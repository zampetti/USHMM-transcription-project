Grosmann of St. Louis Park, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s6">Mr. Grosmann, please tell me your complete name, including your Jewish name, if it is different</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Edward Elias Grosmann.</span> <span id="s8">And my Jewish name is Eliahu Grosmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I was born in Medzilaborce, Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: And what year -- date?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: March 29, 1921.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: And was that town known by any other name?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s15">Under the Austria-Hungarian regime, it was known as Mezulaborce.</span> <span id="s16">And in the Jewish community, they used to call it Mezulaboritz.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: What were your parents’ names, your grandparents’ names or your great-grandparents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Well, I can only go as far as my grandparents.</span> <span id="s19">I do not know about the great-grandparents.</span> <span id="s20">We’ll start with them.</span> <span id="s21">On my father’s side it was Eliazur, and his wife’s I didn’t know because she died very, very young before I was born.</span> <span id="s22">My mother’s side, my grandfather’s name was David and my grandmother’s name was Dina.</span> <span id="s23">My mother’s name was Blima and my father’s name was Chaim.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What were your parents’ occupations?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: My father was a peddler.</span> <span id="s26">As far as I know, most of the time he spent in the United States except for a few years from 1919 through 1925.</span> <span id="s27">So he came back when I was born and two other members -- siblings.</span> <span id="s28">And my mother carried on a very small general store in Czechoslovakia, in our home town.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Where were your parents born?</span> <span id="s30">What town?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: My father was born in a small village, Mikova.</span> <span id="s32">And my mother, I believe, was born in Medzilaborce.</span> <span id="s33">At the time they were born there was no Czechoslovakia in existence.</span> <span id="s34">There was Austria-Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: What languages were spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: It was mostly Yiddish, except when my mother didn’t want me to understand what was going on, she spoke Hungarian to my older sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Would you say that your family was secular or religious in practice or orientation?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: My family was religious in practice and orientation.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Were they Zionist or hasidic?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: They were hasidic.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Did you receive any formal Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s43">Starting from the age of three and continued until I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s44">We studied in a cheder.</span> <span id="s45">From the age of three until about 10, 11.</span> <span id="s46">Then we were in more formalized Talmud Torah until about 14.</span> <span id="s47">And from 14 until 18 I was in a Yeshiva in my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Which is like a college, a university, or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Well, the Yeshiva, actually was over and above the secular education.</span> <span id="s50">It was concerned only with Jewish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: What events, either local, national or international were you aware of from the mid-1930s to 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: I was very much aware of the rise of Nazism in Germany, because the newspapers and the Jewish community was very concerned of what is going on in our neighboring states -- and especially when we saw the fall of Austria.</span> <span id="s53">Then we really started getting very seriously concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Were there any meetings or gatherings?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s56">The Zionist activity, which was not very dominant in our community, took on some very important aspects.</span> <span id="s57">Speakers came from the more enlightened part of our country to tell us what’s going on and how important it is to go to Palestine in order to escape the disasters that our brethren in Germany and Austria were already facing.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: So did many of the people go?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Some.</span> <span id="s60">We had a few people who had left our community against the wishes of the elders of the city, who were very much opposed to the idea of creating a Jewish state in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: The prevailing philosophy in the community was the very traditional approach, that when the Holy One will decide that the Meshiach should come and redeem His people, redeem the people of Israel, at that time they will be ready to go.</span> <span id="s63">Any other approach of resolving the problem of creating a state was totally in opposition to the existing philosophy in our community -- though I must mention, we had a very small group of Zionists, of which I was one, that were actually in conflict with the prevailing philosophy, and we were continuously fighting with the establishment, who could not see the need for the creation of a political state in Palestine for the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Did you try to get to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: No.</span> <span id="s66">I did not get to Palestine.</span> <span id="s67">When I may have had a chance, I did not try very hard.</span> <span id="s68">When it was too late, I have tried and at that time, I did not succeed.</span> <span id="s69">In 1939, many of the young people who have been already deeply involved in the Zionist movement, we have appealed to the Jewish Agency for affidavits.</span> <span id="s70">And we were promised to get them.</span> <span id="s71">But we don’t know if we ever were awarded those affidavits.</span> <span id="s72">Hitler marched into Prague -- and all contacts, all practical contacts with the outside world diminished to the degree that really we didn’t know what is going on outside in our behalf, and we only know we saw already the big problems -- the big clouds encompassing us.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Were you still getting information through the newspaper or radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: We were getting newspapers.</span> <span id="s75">Information was coming in in clandestine ways, and we knew exactly what was going on in Germany and in the places where Hitler was already creating his mischief.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Did you have ay contacts with gentiles during this time?</span> <span id="s77">The time we’re speaking of is just before the outbreak of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes, because I was going to public schools, and I had quite a few non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s79">In fact, in my community, because the majority of the inhabitants of our community was Jewish -- I would say almost 60 to 70% were Jewish -- I have never felt any anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s80">I never felt any persecution until 1938 when Slovakia, which has declared itself independent from Czechoslovakia, has adopted the Nuremberg Law and became an ally of Nazi Germany</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: I what kinds of settings did you have contact with gentiles, other than school?</span> <span id="s82">For instance, in your family business that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Even though I was going to school, I was very active in this very little small business that we had, and I would say most of the customers were non-Jews, who came from the out-lying areas to do their business, whatever business there was.</span> <span id="s84">And we created some pretty good friendships to the degree that we had some of the gentiles with whom we dealt with hide my sister for a while during the time of deportations.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: In your community before the outbreak of the war, did you have any encounters with anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: As I mentioned before, I have never encountered any.</span> <span id="s87">I have never felt persecuted.</span> <span id="s88">I have never felt any anti-Semitism during my first 17 years of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Before the war, did you have any relatives living outside your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s91">My grandfather and his ancestors lived in this town, Mekova, which was about 20 miles away from our town, Medzilaborce, which was the county seat.</span> <span id="s92">It may be interesting to note that they were among the very few farmers who farmed the land before Jews were allowed to hold land.</span> <span id="s93">The legend goes that supposedly they had settled the land many centuries before, and they believe, we have no proof, that they may have been among the wandering immigrants from the Inquisition, who found their way, somehow or another, in that part of -- at that time --Austria-Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: To your knowledge, what happened to them, and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: There isn’t a single survivor from this entire group of at least as I was able to count, more than 150 ancestors, descendents and relatives.</span> <span id="s96">Al, of them perished during the transportations, including my family.</span> <span id="s97">I do not know how anybody who was at that time left in Europe could have survived -- except myself</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: What age were you at the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: I was 18 years old when Hitler marched into Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: How did you receive news of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: We were reading the newspapers.</span> <span id="s102">First of all, our community, unfortunately, was not far away from the Polish borders, and we saw the German marching machine passing through our town, which was the visual part, but the worst part was because we had been following the crisis, although we were young people, but we were politically very much aware.</span> <span id="s103">Even though we couldn’t afford buying a newspaper, we were able to get newspaper by sharing the expense in the community, and three or four families used to buy a newspaper and share it, and we were following the news through the newspapers and then also there were a few radios in town and we had access to listen to the neighbors’ radios which gave us, most of the time, the internal news, but once in a while we were able to catch also clandestine news from London.</span> <span id="s104">There we got the true news.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Do you remember when you heard that the war had started?</span> <span id="s106">Was that a memorable date or moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Very, very much so.</span> <span id="s108">I remember very much the moment when the war had started, because at that time, there was a great celebration by the existing Soviet government who was a member of the Nazi regime at that time.</span> <span id="s109">A big jubilation took place on the radio that the “German brothers_ -- the German allies – will be able to liberate their “oppressed” and persecuted brethren in Poland who were oppressed by those “terrible Poles.”</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: And what did you make of that news at that time and date?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Although we could not believe at that time that the things that we have been hearing clandestinely about various prisons in Germany and in Austria -- of taking Jews and torturing them -- we were afraid.</span> <span id="s112">At least the chills were going through our backs that we may encounter the same situation that’s going on there.</span> <span id="s113">The Jewish community in general was very, very sad and very worried about the fate that’s going to befall us.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Did they get together in any kind of meetings or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s116">The things that we used to do is, we went to shul, and there were prayers, praying and entreating the Almighty to save us and help us.</span> <span id="s117">And all the discussions in the Bet Hamidrash, in the shul, were only what’s going to happen, about the fate of the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: How did life change economically and socially after the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: It changed terribly, because it didn’t take very much longer that the existing regime “Aryanized” our little business, kicked us out and gave the licenses under which we were able to scrape out a meager living to a non-Jew, and took over the little store.</span> <span id="s120">So our life as respectable citizens in the eyes of our non-Jewish citizens dwindled down to zero as a result of this happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: We already mentioned that there were discussions about the possibility of going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s122">And you, possibly some others in the community favored this?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A Yes, there were quite a number of young people, and especially the younger people, who at a much earlier stage of our lives realized that we must find a solution.</span> <span id="s124">Even though we were never persecuted, we knew that in order to go to the university, we would not have a chance because there was a secret “numerus clausus” practiced, where only so many Jews were able to attend the highest institutions of learning.</span> <span id="s125">And this alone, and when we saw in the beginning of the ‘30’s what’s been happening in Germany, we felt that it would not be very long that the same fate will befall out country, which at that time, was the most democratic country in the whole of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: When did the Nazi occupation occur?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: It’s hard for me to say, because I lived in the part of Czechoslovakia which eventually became Slovakia in 1938.</span> <span id="s128">Although, officially, there were no Nazis -- there were no German or SS troops in our community -- nonetheless, we became a Nazi state right after the division of Czechoslovakia when Chamberlain sold out Czechoslovakia through the Munich conference to Hitler.</span> <span id="s129">At that time, Slovakia immediately declared itself as an independent state and they immediately instituted the same laws as they prevailed in Germany -- the Nuremberg Laws --and they started immediately at that moment forcing us to wear the yellow stars.</span> <span id="s130">I was kicked out of school.</span> <span id="s131">No Jew was able to attend public school.</span> <span id="s132">Where he went, he goes to Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s133">That actually was the beginning.</span> <span id="s134">This is how we felt the rise of Nazism in our country.</span> <span id="s135">We were very unique in this respect, because this was the only state which was a free state, in the eyes of the Slovaks, but actually they were just puppets in the hands of the Nazis, and were following through their orders to the “nth” degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: So was there an actual “Nazi” occupation then?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: There was no Nazi occupation.</span> <span id="s138">The same people who have lived with us, who were neighbors, became the Nazis.</span> <span id="s139">They were the ones who were carrying out the orders of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s140">The majority of the population was rather timid and afraid to the degree that those we considered our friends in the non-Jewish community have become very, very cautious and stayed away from us, because they were afraid that some of the deaths were given for “associating” with Jews.</span> <span id="s141">In fact, association with Jews was considered a crime.</span> <span id="s142">It was criminal, and it was punishable by penalties and also imprisonment.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: You talked that there were barriers getting into the university, and you had to wear the yellow star, and that they followed along the lines of the Nuremberg Laws that the Soviets promulgated.</span> <span id="s144">Were there any other actions that were taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Not the Soviets -- you mean the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: I mean the Nazis, excuse me.</span> <span id="s147">Were there any other actions that the government there in your locality took against the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: You mean after the Nazis came to rise?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s151">We were picked up from our homes.</span> <span id="s152">All the young people had to report and do public labor, cleaning the streets, helping build some roads -- for which you were not paid.</span> <span id="s153">We were taken away from our homes with no provisions from the government to provide food, so we had to worry about the food, and we had to leave our families, totally, without being able to assist them in survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Were you contained in a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Well, I was not contained in a ghetto, per se, because it was a very strange situation in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s156">We were an independent country, as I declared, under the regime of Nazism.</span> <span id="s157">The army, itself, was able to maintain a degree of independence under the German rules.</span> <span id="s158">And as a 19 or 20 year old man -- all the 20-year-old people had to be drafted into the army – I had to subject myself to the draft, and I was drafted.</span> <span id="s159">Like all the other non-Jews, I was drafted in the Slovak army, and in 1941 I became a member of the so-called Slovak Armed Forces.</span> <span id="s160">But because we were Jews, we were not taken in to the fighting forces, we became a part of the labor forces.</span> <span id="s161">And we wore a uniform somewhat different in color from the uniforms of the non-Jews.</span> <span id="s162">Also, instead of having a gun, we had a shovel.</span> <span id="s163">This is something very rare.</span> <span id="s164">This is not known at all about our particular group, and I thought this may be very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Had your community always had a history of separating people out according to what religion they were?</span> <span id="s166">Was it registered at the courthouse?</span> <span id="s167">Or, with the local government, what religion people were in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Oh, absolutely, because the government itself collected the religious tax from every citizen in the country.</span> <span id="s169">And every member, every citizen had to declare what religion he is, so that the amount collected from the citizen through the normal taxation was given and divided to the Jewish communities, wherever they were.</span> <span id="s170">You see, in addition to the income tax, there was a small percentage which was a religious tax.</span> <span id="s171">And the Jewish community collected from the government a certain amount of the tax, which was then distributed to the various Jewish communities.</span> <span id="s172">And the Christians had the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Well, during this time that we’re talking about, when you were in this labor force, did you have any knowledge of what was going on outside your community?</span> <span id="s174">About other ghettos, about mass killings, or concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes, we had very much so, because in 1939, after the Polish war, we had many, many people, many “smugglers” -- refugees -- among them Jews, and some of them my relatives, who lived on the Polish side, told us what was going on, that the Nazis who have been there have taken people out in the street and murdering them in cold blood.</span> <span id="s176">And that was in 1939 and early 1940.</span> <span id="s177">And many smugglers who came from Poland, already was telling us about the creation of ghettos in Poland, and also, we knew what was going on, because Czechoslovakia was divided.</span> <span id="s178">The western part of Czechoslovakia became the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia -- the Nazi regime -- and we, Slovakia, where I lived, was under the Slovak government.</span> <span id="s179">And we had heard that a big ghetto is being created in a small town near Prague which was called Terezin, and that many of the Jews were collected there and taken away.</span> <span id="s180">And the transports started to the east for labor purposes -- from Bohemia and Moravia -- while nothing was happening, yet, in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s181">That was during the year 1940 when I was still home.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Were you actually then deported to this labor camp?</span> <span id="s183">Or was that voluntary?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: I marched in.</span> <span id="s185">I was drafted as any other soldier.</span> <span id="s186">In 1941, I started duty as any other soldier, going through basic training in the same shape and form as all the other normal soldiers went through, except, instead of using a gun, we used a shovel.</span> <span id="s187">And this went on from October, 1941, until January, 1942.</span> <span id="s188">And then we were sent away from the basic training into labor battalions, in uniform, under the supervision of gentiles who were normal soldiers of the Slovak Armed Forces.</span> <span id="s189">What our job was, we were building roads and any other war-important projects.</span> <span id="s190">We performed the labor for these projects.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: And what were the living conditions like?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Living conditions were as good as any other soldier.</span> <span id="s193">We got the same pay as any other soldier.</span> <span id="s194">We got the same food.</span> <span id="s195">And there was absolutely no persecution under those conditions other than we were wearing a blue uniform instead of a green uniform.</span> <span id="s196">We were in the same position as the gypsies who were also collected, who also had to march into the Armed Forces, but they wore a brown uniform, we wore a blue uniform, the normal soldiers wore a green uniform.</span> <span id="s197">This went on until 1943.</span> <span id="s198">And we were shifted from one area to another.</span> <span id="s199">But always in uniforms, and always receiving the same pay, the same food.</span> <span id="s200">There is the only time where the supervisors have exerted their power in expressing their feeling, in this country, about anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s201">We had the right to worship -- I happened to be in a group which was a religious group -- and for the holidays we didn’t get time off, but we were able to arrange with the supervisors to make up the time of our quota.</span> <span id="s202">What we had to perform in our work, either during the evening or during Sunday, when we were not working.</span> <span id="s203">We were allowed to worship in our own way in the barracks where we stayed.</span> <span id="s204">And not only that.</span> <span id="s205">It was agreed that we would not have to accept non-kosher food.</span> <span id="s206">There was no meat available, but we were able to get other supplies, like beans and peas and bread, which made up, in terms of dollars and cents -- in terms of the kronas -- the amount of money which was allocated.</span> <span id="s207">We were able to get other foods, so we wouldn’t have to eat the non-kosher food.</span> <span id="s208">This boggles your mind, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: No, I’m stuck on that thought that you mentioned about the supervisors.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Well they were actually soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Do you remember who the commanding officer was?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: There is a book that was written in Israel.</span> <span id="s213">Covers the whole situation.</span> <span id="s214">I believe it’s about to come out, momentarily.</span> <span id="s215">It covered that period of the experiences of our group.</span> <span id="s216">There were over 2,500 of us all over Slovakia.</span> <span id="s217">We created what was called the 6th Division, and there were several battalions.</span> <span id="s218">I happened to be in the 21st Battalion of the 6th Division.</span> <span id="s219">In 1943, apparently the pressures from the Nazis came upon the Army, and they said they will not allow any Jews to be members of the Slovak Armed Forces, who are their allies.</span> <span id="s220">We were all honorably discharged from the Army and what we have learned after the war, that the Minister of Defense of the Slovak army was a humanist.</span> <span id="s221">He knew what was going on in Poland.</span> <span id="s222">And he felt, at least he can save those 2,500 of his Jews.</span> <span id="s223">He kept us, and we performed tremendous labor.</span> <span id="s224">Tremendous.</span> <span id="s225">But it was always under the threat that if we will not make our quota, we will be deported.</span> <span id="s226">And we knew already what was going on, because at that time our family was already gone -- it was terrible -- to Poland.</span> <span id="s227">We were the only Jews left in Slovakia out of the maybe 100,000 Slovakian Jews.</span> <span id="s228">He said he will not allow, under any condition, to take these Jews.</span> <span id="s229">They wanted to transport us to Poland --that he delivers them over to the SS.</span> <span id="s230">The SS was already active at that time, very much.</span> <span id="s231">It was in the middle of the Russian war, and there were big problems for the Germans.</span> <span id="s232">The SS wanted us out.</span> <span id="s233">They wanted us to Poland -- or to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s234">And what happened was, the Minister of Defense said, under one condition.</span> <span id="s235">He’s going to release us if we will be able to continue providing the labor which we have done so faithfully for the Germans -- in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s236">And what happened was, we returned the uniforms and we stayed at the same place where we stayed as soldiers, with the exception that the Army supervisors have left, and the equivalent of the SS in Slovakia, which were called the Chrinkaguard -- I don’t know if you heard that name before -- the Chrinkaguard was the equivalent of the Slovak SS -- that they will become the supervisors.</span> <span id="s237">Which happened.</span> <span id="s238">From 1943 in June until 1944, October 28, we stayed at the same barracks, performing the same labor.</span> <span id="s239">Happened to be in a brick quarry.</span> <span id="s240">But during that period, our co-workers, who were gentiles, in that brick factory cautioned us that they have heard rumors in the community that the SS is coming to pick us up.</span> <span id="s241">And those rumors, they’re going on from the time when we became civilians.</span> <span id="s242">So we used to pick ourselves up and run off to the woods, and hide out for about two, three weeks.</span> <span id="s243">Then our gentile co-workers came back to us and told us it seems like everything is quiet.</span> <span id="s244">We need you in the factory.</span> <span id="s245">Why don’t you come back and help us.</span> <span id="s246">So this was going on for about 16, 17 months.</span> <span id="s247">And one unsuspecting day, it was the 28th of October, 1944, the whole community where we worked was surrounded by several thousand SS -- no Slovaks -- SS, with machine guns and cannons to capture us.</span> <span id="s248">We about 410 of us.</span> <span id="s249">And we heard over the microphones telling the local population, “Anybody who’s going to hide any of those Jews, they and their family will be executed on the spot and their property will be burned down and confiscated for the state.”</span> <span id="s250">So we were all surrounded.</span> <span id="s251">We were picked up, and within 48 hours we were in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: And how did they get you to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: They picked us up, they surrounded, they picked everyone up, and they manacled us like criminals and they brought us into Bratislava.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: By foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: No.</span> <span id="s256">They were about 2,000.</span> <span id="s257">They had about 60 or 80 trucks -- lorries And we were thrown into the lorries.</span> <span id="s258">A few of us at a time, because they were afraid of us.</span> <span id="s259">They took only 5, 6 in one truck, with 10, 15 SS.</span> <span id="s260">We could do ‘em as much harm as we could do to the people who live on Mars!</span> <span id="s261">They brought us into Bratislava overnight, and from there they brought us to the concentration camp in Serat.</span> <span id="s262">And from Serat, they took us directly to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s263">We arrived in Auschwitz on November 1, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: And what happened when you first got there?</span> <span id="s265">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: When we got to Auschwitz, we were in the last transport going from any place in Europe to Auschwitz, the last one.</span> <span id="s267">There were no more transports coming to Auschwitz after we arrived.</span> <span id="s268">When we came down, we saw the chimneys.</span> <span id="s269">We smelled the smell of burning flesh as we arrived there.</span> <span id="s270">And we already knew, because there were some people who have come back to Slovakia from Majdanek and others, and they told us what’s going on.</span> <span id="s271">They told us about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s272">And they told us that none of our parents and none of our relatives are most likely alive.</span> <span id="s273">We knew all the children and all the older people would be killed on the spot.</span> <span id="s274">And we were very surprised when we arrived there, we saw big dogs and the yelling, but they did not divide us.</span> <span id="s275">They took the whole group -- we were about 800 people -- they called only two names out.</span> <span id="s276">Those were two informers who informed the Germans on Jews.</span> <span id="s277">Those are two people they called out, and we never heard of them.</span> <span id="s278">We heard that they were executed by the Germans when they arrived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s279">But whole families were taken in Auschwitz, in Birkenau, to the Tziganer camp.</span> <span id="s280">Have you heard of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: To the Tziganer camp, which is the gypsy camp.</span> <span id="s283">This was a camp where they kept a few months before us a big group of deportees from Terezin.</span> <span id="s284">And there were the whole families together.</span> <span id="s285">We were there for a number of days, and the lagerfuhrer, who was a German political prisoner, who has been in prison for many years, we asked him, “What is going to happen to us?”</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: What’s a lagerfuhrer?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Lagerfuhrer is the camp director who was also a prisoner.</span> <span id="s288">You heard of the kapos?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: They’re like police?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yeah, but the lagerfuhrer was a prisoner who was responsible for the whole camp.</span> <span id="s291">And the kapos were his workers, his supervisors.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Was this a Jewish person?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: No, it was a German political prisoner, a Communist most likely, who was imprisoned by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s294">In fact, in this camp, there were all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s295">There were homosexuals, who had, I believe, blue signs.</span> <span id="s296">And the political prisoners had red signs.</span> <span id="s297">And the Jews had yellow ribbons on their arms, with the stars in the front and the back, and the striped suits.</span> <span id="s298">And we asked him, “What’s going to happen to us?’</span> <span id="s299">He says, “Well, I can only tell you, you may be called into the Himmelkommando.”</span> <span id="s300">You know what Himmelkommando is?</span> <span id="s301">To the commander, to the heavenly commander.</span> <span id="s302">“Like your brethren were called in two months ago.”</span> <span id="s303">They did the same thing to a complete transport from Terezin.”</span> <span id="s304">They brought ‘em in, to the same camp where we were, and then one day they took the whole camp, women, children, young and old, labor-capable and young people -- they were all taken to the gas chambers and liquidated.</span> <span id="s305">And we were very concerned, because we knew already well, that there was a division, they picked out the younger people and the older people, they’re going directly into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s306">We were concerned.</span> <span id="s307">We felt, “Well, this is it!”</span> <span id="s308">I can remember very clearly on November 14, two weeks later, they asked that the women go separately and the men go separately and the children go separately.</span> <span id="s309">Then we felt, “This is it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Where did they want you to go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: They sent to the right all men, on one side all children, and on one side all women, but without distinction of age.</span> <span id="s312">And there was a big line of people.</span> <span id="s313">This was 900 people.</span> <span id="s314">They lined us up, and we started getting these numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: The tattoos.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s317">And they were two Jewish boys, who were tattooing this particular group where I was.</span> <span id="s318">They says, ‘Well, we believe that you’re not going into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s319">Because otherwise they would not be tattooing you.”</span> <span id="s320">And they were doing the same thing with the women.</span> <span id="s321">They took the children away.</span> <span id="s322">There was a children’s camp.</span> <span id="s323">They put the children in it.</span> <span id="s324">And then after the tattooing was done, we went to the so-called “cleansing prospelet,” this so-called shower bath.</span> <span id="s325">We were afraid, because we heard of the baths, but we really went through the baths, and we got the uniforms.</span> <span id="s326">We were brought into the general camp, but I was brought into a group of people where they were mostly Czechs, for some reason or another.</span> <span id="s327">This is how they placed the Slavs, together with some of the previous arrivals who lived in certain camps.</span> <span id="s328">And the children were in a children’s camp and the women went to the women’s camp.</span> <span id="s329">And they started sending us out.</span> <span id="s330">The following day we were sent to dig up -- that was November 14 -- rutabagas on one of the fields that they had.</span> <span id="s331">The mud was to the knees, and we felt, “Well, this is it.”</span> <span id="s332">Under such conditions, we felt we are not going to last very long.</span> <span id="s333">And this was going on for two, three days.</span> <span id="s334">And one day, a kapo came in, who was also a political prisoner with a red triangle, he wants 20 Czechs.</span> <span id="s335">And we had a conference.</span> <span id="s336">You know, Jews always have conferences.</span> <span id="s337">“Shall we dare to volunteer?”</span> <span id="s338">And we decided we can’t lose too much.</span> <span id="s339">Things were so bad, if they get much worse, we won’t be around very long anyhow.</span> <span id="s340">So we volunteered.</span> <span id="s341">He said, ‘Tomorrow at 5:00 -- he took down the numbers, we were no longer people --I was B14083, see?</span> <span id="s342">-- “I will have these 20 numbers, and I want you to be right here in front of the barrack, and I will have two SS men pick you up and bring you in to your new labor place.”</span> <span id="s343">We didn’t know what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s344">What happened was, we were taken from this barrack to the women’s barracks, where they had a so-called weaving factory -- only about 100 steps away from where we were.</span> <span id="s345">The kapo was there and he told us there was an enormous warehouse full of plastic waste, of pieces of plastic.</span> <span id="s346">And the 20 of us were supposed to take this waste and distribute it to a group of women who were mussulmen.</span> <span id="s347">You know what a mussulman is?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: No, tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: A mussulman was a person who has reached a point where they have lost the looks of a human being.</span> <span id="s350">They were totally human skeletons.</span> <span id="s351">And they were supposed to take this material and weave it into ropes, which ropes were supposed to go to the German navy.</span> <span id="s352">And this -- this was in front of the SS who were inside the big warehouse -- this kapo said, “I will expect of you that you will behave yourself in a proper way, that you will do a good job for the German war effort, because we have to win this war.</span> <span id="s353">And if you’re going to do well, you’re going to stay in this barracks.</span> <span id="s354">You won’t be sent outside.</span> <span id="s355">If you won’t, if you think the labor that you did before was hard, you haven’t seen any labor yet.”</span> <span id="s356">The SS left, and this kapo came over and said, “Listen, guys, I am a brother of yours.</span> <span id="s357">I’m a Czech, but I was in Stettin, I was a Communist --and I’m here because of my beliefs.</span> <span id="s358">I’m going to help you, but you people, you cannot do anything that will jeopardize my life.</span> <span id="s359">I will come in from time to time in the presence of the SS.</span> <span id="s360">I’ll beat the living hell out of you.</span> <span id="s361">I’ll yell at you.</span> <span id="s362">I’ll kick you.</span> <span id="s363">I want you to know, I will do it, because this is how it works here.</span> <span id="s364">Otherwise I’ll leave you in peace.</span> <span id="s365">Just mind your own business.”</span> <span id="s366">This is what happened in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s367">For some odd reason, he picked me -- I was the youngest, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Gottfried.</span> <span id="s370">I remember his name.</span> <span id="s371">I can see his face, like today.</span> <span id="s372">And he said to me “I hold you responsible that all goes well.”</span> <span id="s373">That could have meant a death sentence, because if something doesn’t go right, I would have been the one to account for it.</span> <span id="s374">A few days later, the Sharfuhrer in the SS comes in with our kapo.</span> <span id="s375">And the kapo started beating everybody.</span> <span id="s376">And this Sharfuhrer was the SS in charge of a number of barracks.</span> <span id="s377">He said, “Give me a man who will be responsible!”</span> <span id="s378">So he picked me.</span> <span id="s379">So this SS man took out a bag of stuff and gives it to me.</span> <span id="s380">He says to me, “Here I have my personal belongings.</span> <span id="s381">I am not going to tell you what I have here.</span> <span id="s382">There are cigarettes, there are other things.</span> <span id="s383">If I’m going to miss one cigarette from this bundle here, you see those two big dogs?”</span> <span id="s384">They had those very big dogs.</span> <span id="s385">“They’re going to tear you to pieces.”</span> <span id="s386">And he meant it We had a conference, those 20 Czechs, and I told ‘em what happened to me.</span> <span id="s387">I told ‘em.</span> <span id="s388">I have to safekeep it, because apparently he was afraid, himself, to keep it where he was keeping it, because somebody else was above him, and they were looking what he has stolen, what he has.</span> <span id="s389">So I had to be his confidant.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: No, I don’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s392">All 20 of us, every day, we were guarding that little bundle,, because we knew that our lives depended on this little bundle, whatever it was that is there.</span> <span id="s393">.</span> <span id="s394">And this was going on until January 18, 1945.</span> <span id="s395">As a result of being where we were, I personally feel I survived.</span> <span id="s396">I wasn’t a strong fellow, and I was inside a building, in the winter.</span> <span id="s397">It was a very cold winter in Auschwitz in 1944 and 1945, an early winter and very cold.</span> <span id="s398">On January 18, we were ordered to get into ‘appell,” that we will go on trip.</span> <span id="s399">This was the time of the evacuation of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s400">I was standing in line with my friends and suddenly this SS man was searching with a microphone.</span> <span id="s401">“B140983, if I don’t hear from you within the next five minutes, I’ll find you, and you’ll be executed on the spot for disobeying orders.”</span> <span id="s402">I came out.</span> <span id="s403">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s404">I don’t know why they picked people.</span> <span id="s405">I forgot totally about the bundle because we knew we are going on this big death march, already.</span> <span id="s406">This was the 18th of January death march from Poland when the Russians were coming in.</span> <span id="s407">And my friend said, “I think you should be going.</span> <span id="s408">He’ll find you anyhow and then we will all be in trouble.”</span> <span id="s409">So I went out and he kicked me.</span> <span id="s410">“Why didn’t you come out immediately?”</span> <span id="s411">He kicked me and he had his dogs with him.</span> <span id="s412">He says, “I want that bundle.”</span> <span id="s413">So I went back to that barrack and fortunately nobody touched it, brought the bundle and he opened it.</span> <span id="s414">There were cigarettes.</span> <span id="s415">I remember the soles -- there were soles, shoe soles.</span> <span id="s416">And there was some perfume there.</span> <span id="s417">And he started counting the packs of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s418">And I thought he may give me a cigarette.</span> <span id="s419">He gave me a kick -- it hurt me for weeks -- and he says, “Get lost!”</span> <span id="s420">I lost my friends, because in the meantime, the march started.</span> <span id="s421">We were about 20 or 30,000 people marching out of Auschwitz, and I came with new people.</span> <span id="s422">I didn’t know a soul.</span> <span id="s423">We marched for three days from Auschwitz to Gliwice and it was a disaster.</span> <span id="s424">I would say from the groups – there were 200 people in a group, or 500, I cannot remember -- it was snowing bitterly, and I would say half the people sat down.</span> <span id="s425">We saw, from previous groups, the bodies lined up in the ditches.</span> <span id="s426">Anybody who sat down or who remained behind, the SS pushed ‘em into the ditches and killed ‘em.</span> <span id="s427">It was a disaster!</span> <span id="s428">It was an awful disaster!</span> <span id="s429">I would say more than half that never made it to Gliwice -- in our group.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: How far was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: From Auschwitz to Gliwice?</span> <span id="s432">Overnight -- during the night -- we were put in some kind of haystack.</span> <span id="s433">But I would say, probably, maybe about 60 miles?</span> <span id="s434">It was a very long road.</span> <span id="s435">And we came in there half dead -- very decimated.</span> <span id="s436">And we were there for about two days, and there they started again.</span> <span id="s437">We didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s438">They asked all the Jews to come out, because in Auschwitz, we left together in groups, the Jews and the non-Jews were all together.</span> <span id="s439">And we came out.</span> <span id="s440">I didn’t try to hide, because I had the whole city of Jerusalem on my face, but there were some Jews, looked very odd, blondes, and you could never distinguish the difference between them and non-Jews, but they -- the Polacks, the bloody Polacks -- anybody who tried to hide among them, they called ‘em out.</span> <span id="s441">They called ‘em, “Here is a Jew!”</span> <span id="s442">to the SS.</span> <span id="s443">And that guy, they took him away to a separate place.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: These were Polish prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Polish prisoners.</span> <span id="s446">That’s why I have never had any heart for the Poles.</span> <span id="s447">And we were lined up, thousands of us, and finally I wound up in a big train -- open train, open car.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Like a flatbed?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Flatbed, yes.</span> <span id="s450">First of all, a group of us, we were the first ones to get in, and they loaded.</span> <span id="s451">They loaded those flatbeds.</span> <span id="s452">I would say by the time when we took off, there wasn’t room to breathe, physically.</span> <span id="s453">There was no room -- absolutely none.</span> <span id="s454">They gave us a bread -- one bread to each prisoner.</span> <span id="s455">And we saw, not far away from the train station, a big group of people --also prisoners –-- standing there behind gates.</span> <span id="s456">And we took off.</span> <span id="s457">And we traveled from Gliwice all over Poland.</span> <span id="s458">Czechoslovakia, and we came all the way to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s459">The concentration camp, Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: That was in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: No, that was in Austria.</span> <span id="s462">Not far.</span> <span id="s463">And this trip took approximately, I would say, about seven days, in open cars, never gotten out of the cars.</span> <span id="s464">During that trip from the 200 people, more than half died in the cars, and we had to throw them out.</span> <span id="s465">And when we were traveling through Czechoslovakia, the Czech people saw the cars going by and they came alongside the stations and they threw bread into the cars.</span> <span id="s466">.</span> <span id="s467">most of the people were killed not so much because of hunger, but because of the bread that was thrown in.</span> <span id="s468">Instead of the Nazis allowing proper distribution of food, they wanted to see those people, like mad dogs, how they’re scrambling.</span> <span id="s469">You know, when people are hungry, they kill each other for a slice of bread.</span> <span id="s470">So most of the people killed on that particular section -- on that strip -- they were fighting to get that small bread.</span> <span id="s471">We came to Mauthausen, and supposedly we were supposed to get out.</span> <span id="s472">And we heard -- all, everything was a rumor mill -- we will not be allowed to get out because there is no room left, because there were many camps, from other places in Poland that they came here before us, and they filled up the camp.</span> <span id="s473">There was no more room.</span> <span id="s474">So we remained for one day outside of Mauthausen, and we were going back the same route, but to Berlin.</span> <span id="s475">Took another seven days to come to Sachsenhausen, Oranianberg.</span> <span id="s476">I don’t know if you’ve heard of these camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Sachsenhausen, that was near Berlin.</span> <span id="s478">We went through Berlin.</span> <span id="s479">I remember seeing Berlin from the open cars.</span> <span id="s480">There was a heap of ashes like we saw when our people landed on the moon.</span> <span id="s481">This is what Berlin looked like when we passed through.</span> <span id="s482">This was the only consolation that we had.</span> <span id="s483">And we came in there to Sachsenhausen, Oranianberg, which was actually originally a factory where they were making the Heinckel planes, the Messerschmidt.</span> <span id="s484">It was all evacuated.</span> <span id="s485">We arrived there, out of a full car where we had at least 200 to begin with, I don’t think there were 30 of us left.</span> <span id="s486">I was, I remember, very, very hungry, very sick.</span> <span id="s487">The people died from hunger.</span> <span id="s488">They died from hunger because there was no food for the seven days.</span> <span id="s489">We never got out of the trains.</span> <span id="s490">The only thing that we had was the snow -- fortunately.</span> <span id="s491">None of us would have survived if it hadn’t been for the snow that was coming down in our trains while we were traveling during all this time.</span> <span id="s492">We came down to Oranianberg, Sachsenhausen, we got hot water.</span> <span id="s493">And this is the first time that we had anything hot in our mouth in the fourteen days from the time when we left Gliwice.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">We were there for about three, four days, and they told us we are going to go to some working camps.</span> <span id="s495">We were divided into various groups, and I was sent from Berlin, probably two, three days, to Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s496">We were sent to the stone quarries in Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s497">The only memorable thing that I remember in Flossenburg, is because in the next barrack there was Leon Blum.</span> <span id="s498">You know who Leon Blum was?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: No, tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Leon Blum was the Minister of Labor of the French government.</span> <span id="s501">And he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s502">And he was a great personality in pre-war Europe.</span> <span id="s503">Very important there.</span> <span id="s504">The Germans didn’t dare kill him, because they were afraid of the repercussions that they may have had from the local population in France who were their friends, so-called.</span> <span id="s505">If you didn’t know who he was, it wouldn’t mean much to you, so I would not even mention it, but he was a very important person in Europe at that time.</span> <span id="s506">We were going to the stone quarries for a few days.</span> <span id="s507">There was nothing to do in the stone quarries because we were so weak that we could no longer lift even a stone!</span> <span id="s508">We couldn’t lift a shovel.</span> <span id="s509">So they decided they were going to send us to a so-called Ausencommando, a “planetary camp.”</span> <span id="s510">So they sent us to a place supposedly where we were going to build an airfield.</span> <span id="s511">We were as capable as building airfields as I am capable to walk to the moon.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">People were dying very quickly in those days, because we all got dysentery.</span> <span id="s513">It was just a miracle how anybody got up.</span> <span id="s514">Every morning we found somebody else next to us in our bunk.</span> <span id="s515">The situation was very bad.</span> <span id="s516">In Auschwitz, at least, we had normal bunks, there was a normal life, but from the time when we left Auschwitz, either we were marching, we were in cars, or we were in those various barracks where everybody was fighting for a space to breathe.</span> <span id="s517">In a bunk like this, they put in six people.</span> <span id="s518">Every morning there were one or two dead, and when these died, it was somebody else that replaced them.</span> <span id="s519">So this was a total disaster, really.</span> <span id="s520">In the planetary camp, we were maybe about 300.</span> <span id="s521">We were sleeping in tents.</span> <span id="s522">And every day we went to the airport, supposedly pouring cement, but I don’t think we did anything.</span> <span id="s523">Every day a few people died or they were killed because the SS got mad at them -- they weren’t moving fast enough, And suddenly the American Air Force started coming down.</span> <span id="s524">And every day, without exception, we had the American liberators coming down and dropping their bombs.</span> <span id="s525">That was supposedly used to be a training airport, and they were training pilots.</span> <span id="s526">We were very busy every day, because they did so much damage every day that we had to clean up.</span> <span id="s527">This was going on until April 24.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: What country was this in?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: This was in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s530">On April 24 we saw the German armies coming closer where we were.</span> <span id="s531">This gave us a big scare.</span> <span id="s532">And the Americans were very prevalent.</span> <span id="s533">We saw, every day, the American bombs, the American fighters coming through.</span> <span id="s534">And we were gathered for a march.</span> <span id="s535">The rumors were that we were going to go to Mildorf.</span> <span id="s536">We didn’t know why and what.</span> <span id="s537">We were marching.</span> <span id="s538">We were about 900 of us.</span> <span id="s539">We were marching, and the same thing was happening on that march like on the other marches.</span> <span id="s540">Everybody who just slowed down was shot.</span> <span id="s541">And then it was a Friday afternoon, on the 27th -- I remember this very vividly -- on the 27th of April, we were resting on the shorelines of the River Issa, which is in southeastern Bavaria, not far from Dachau.</span> <span id="s542">We were resting there.</span> <span id="s543">And suddenly an SS man and the lagerfuhrer -- was a different one now -- came and said we are going to get a very important message.</span> <span id="s544">And the SS man read the message.</span> <span id="s545">On the order of Reichsmarshal Himmler, all of the heftlinger -- which is all prisoners -- are now freed and they are allowed to leave this unit.</span> <span id="s546">They can find rest in the neighboring area.</span> <span id="s547">They’re requested not to commit any crimes until the American Army arrives here, and at that time they will be able to report to the American Army.</span> <span id="s548">And this was read by an SS man in the presence of the lagersfuhrer.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">There was no jubilation, because the people were so weak that many of them just didn’t have the strength to get up.</span> <span id="s550">It was a sunny day.</span> <span id="s551">The wild flowers were out -- those yellow flowers that you get in the spring -- and it was very bright.</span> <span id="s552">A few of us picked ourselves up.</span> <span id="s553">An instinct told us, “Move away, go away from here.</span> <span id="s554">Try to see what it really feels to be free.’</span> <span id="s555">All the SS who were there, they vanished and we were free.</span> <span id="s556">And I and two other fellows, we went into the neighboring town, which was about three-quarters of a mile or a mile, because this is as much as we were able to walk.</span> <span id="s557">We came there in our prisoners’ uniforms.</span> <span id="s558">We came to a farm and we told the farmer what happened.</span> <span id="s559">He said, “Okay, you can go in that haystack.”</span> <span id="s560">And he brought us some boiled potatoes and we lie down there.</span> <span id="s561">And we just rested.</span> <span id="s562">It was a Friday evening.</span> <span id="s563">It was the first Friday that we were not in the SS hands.</span> <span id="s564">And there were some chickens, so we stole a few eggs and we ate them.</span> <span id="s565">The following morning the farmer comes and tells us the SS has been there and asked if there are any prisoners there.</span> <span id="s566">And he told ‘em there weren’t any.</span> <span id="s567">Because he saw they had been picking up all the prisoners in all the neighborhoods, he said to us, “I want you to hide.</span> <span id="s568">I have never seen you.</span> <span id="s569">In case you are caught -- I have been helping you, and you don’t want me to get shot -- I’m not going to tell them you are here.</span> <span id="s570">Just stay here, because we already heard the American guns not far from that little town.</span> <span id="s571">The war isn’t going to last very long.</span> <span id="s572">I want you to stay here and I will bring you food.</span> <span id="s573">Just don’t leave or come out, because as long as you are here, we want to see that you survive that war.”</span> <span id="s574">We were in that haystack for about four days.</span> <span id="s575">On May 2 we saw some tanks, and we recognized immediately those were not the German tanks, those were the G.I.’s coming through the highway of this little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">We left the farmer.</span> <span id="s577">The G.I’s picked us up.</span> <span id="s578">They threw us chocolate, and they took us to the neighboring town.</span> <span id="s579">We were still very hungry.</span> <span id="s580">I and a few others broke into a bakery.</span> <span id="s581">The bread was still baking.</span> <span id="s582">It was still half raw.</span> <span id="s583">We got hold of that bread, and we started eating.</span> <span id="s584">And I wound up in a hospital, unconscious.</span> <span id="s585">I was kept in the hospital there for about two and a half months, from May until about the middle of July.</span> <span id="s586">I found out I am under the supervision of the American doctors, and they brought me back to life, actually.</span> <span id="s587">One day I woke up, and there was a big celebration.</span> <span id="s588">I remember the lieutenant that was there.</span> <span id="s589">He was a doctor.</span> <span id="s590">His name was Siegel.</span> <span id="s591">I spoke a little English, because I took some English -- I was studying before the war – and I was able to communicate a little bit, and between the Yiddish and the English, we got along very well.</span> <span id="s592">They asked me if I have any relatives in the United States, I told ‘em I had a brother who lived in the United States.</span> <span id="s593">And I remembered the address.</span> <span id="s594">I was so ill, that I didn’t remember that I was in the war.</span> <span id="s595">I didn’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s596">I was totally blank, but I remembered his last address.</span> <span id="s597">He was also in the U.S. Armed Forces.</span> <span id="s598">And he sent the first letter -- that’s when I woke up from that nightmare.</span> <span id="s599">And they put me in a recovery area in that town.</span> <span id="s600">The town where I stayed was Engsfelden.</span> <span id="s601">I remember very clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: In Germany, in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s604">And I stayed there for two weeks.</span> <span id="s605">And then the Czech government sent out their own trucks to pick up the Czech prisoners, and we were brought back to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s606">And when I came back to Czechoslovakia, naturally, first thing, I went to see if anybody survived.</span> <span id="s607">And what I saw, I knew that the chances are very, very low.</span> <span id="s608">I happened to find one person from my community, survived from that transport that my mother and sister was on.</span> <span id="s609">And she told me what happened.</span> <span id="s610">My mother was murdered on Rosh Hashanah Raba, 1942, by a drunken SS.</span> <span id="s611">And my sister vanished among the thousands and thousands in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s612">And my other sister, my older married sister, was in Treblinka, and we found out they also wound up in Majdanek, and the whole family vanished.</span> <span id="s613">It was my two sisters and my nephew and a brother-in-law, and then lots of uncles and cousins and aunts.</span> <span id="s614">A big family.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">But the Czech government, I must say, and I want to give credit to them, they were very good to us.</span> <span id="s616">Unlike the Poles and unlike the Romanians or the Hungarians, when we came back, we didn’t come back as “Damned Jews!”</span> <span id="s617">We came back as national heroes.</span> <span id="s618">We were treated as heroes.</span> <span id="s619">I was no hero.</span> <span id="s620">I was just a Jew, and that was the only reason that I was imprisoned.</span> <span id="s621">And I didn’t perform any acts of heroism during the entire war.</span> <span id="s622">I was just trying to survive.</span> <span id="s623">And the Czech government saw to it that we get back into as normal a life as we could, and provided the conditions and the financial means.</span> <span id="s624">First of all, we had to get housing and food, which they provided.</span> <span id="s625">At that time there wasn’t too much housing, there wasn’t much food.</span> <span id="s626">We got double rations of food.</span> <span id="s627">We got housing.</span> <span id="s628">And they helped us with jobs.</span> <span id="s629">They provided free schooling for those who wanted to attend school.</span> <span id="s630">They gave us cultural means to develop ourselves.</span> <span id="s631">We had free subscriptions to all the theaters in the community, and to the symphony orchestra.</span> <span id="s632">When I returned, I lived in Prague.</span> <span id="s633">I did not return to my shtetl because nobody survived there, and I didn’t want to live in the shtetl.</span> <span id="s634">There were no opportunities, and it was no trace of any anti-Semitism in Prague.</span> <span id="s635">In Slovakia, where I was born, there was some remnants of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s636">But in Prague where I worked, and went to school, and lived from 1945 to December of ’47, it was a very pleasant life that I enjoyed there.</span> <span id="s637">I had acclimated myself, and I was treated very well by the Czech government.</span> <span id="s638">And I have a very warm spot for them since they did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: What kind of school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: It was the business academy, which is equivalent to business colleges here.</span> <span id="s641">In 1938, when I was seventeen, I almost finished high school -- the equivalent of high school -- but I got credits.</span> <span id="s642">I was able to take exams.</span> <span id="s643">It was like a junior college, and there was an English school, like an English college of languages which had both academic as well as language, and when I came to the United States, I spoke as fluently English as I speak today.</span> <span id="s644">Except it was a different accent; it was an Oxford accent instead of a Yankee accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: How was it that you happened to leave Czechoslovakia in 1947?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: First of all, I saw that the Communists were taking over the country.</span> <span id="s647">And I was very active in Masaryk’s and Benes’s part, which was in direct collision with the Socialist and the Communist parties.</span> <span id="s648">And we saw the long reach -- of the Communist Party, the strong influence that the Communist Party was exercising in the Ministry as well as in the rest of the government.</span> <span id="s649">We saw they were getting stronger and stronger, and the rumors were around that if -- there were elections in December -- if they don’t win the elections, normally, that there will be a coup.</span> <span id="s650">I knew that my life wouldn’t be very safe there under those conditions, so I started preparing several ways.</span> <span id="s651">Number one, I had a brother here, and I applied for a visa the moment that I arrived to Prague.</span> <span id="s652">I found my brother -- this is a long story which I won’t go in -- and he helped me get the necessary papers to apply for a visa under the Czech quota to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s653">The way things were going in the beginning, I really had no serious intentions of coming t the United States, because life was very pleasant in Prague.</span> <span id="s654">But as time went on and I saw the political winds -- how they were blowing --- I was very concerned, and I tried to make provisions under which I will have some other options in case I have to leave.</span> <span id="s655">So I arranged, number one, to get a visa -- to apply for permission to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s656">Secondly, I made arrangement with the Czech government to make me their representative to go to the United States and to Canada to represent the Czech nationalized textile industries in the United States to sell their products.</span> <span id="s657">We had very fine textile mills which were making tablecloths -- beautiful tablecloths -- and I was given an official appointment by the government to set up distribution in the Middle West of the United States and Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">And when I got my passport, I got a passport which would allow me to come, go, back and forth.</span> <span id="s659">It was an immigration passport, but a different kind which allowed me to come back to Czechoslovakia, because I was going in the official capacity as a representative of the Czech government.</span> <span id="s660">I didn’t have the political “perks” but I was an “official” representative.</span> <span id="s661">I was going to get a salary from the government, but before I had a chance to get started in the United States and Canada, I received a telegram at the American Consulate in Toronto -- I was at that time there -- to stop all activities until further notice, which was two days or three days after they killed Jan Masaryk.</span> <span id="s662">And I never heard from them again.</span> <span id="s663">This was the last that I heard from the government.</span> <span id="s664">I wound up with some beautiful samples that I took along with me from the government, various tablecloths and stuff.</span> <span id="s665">I came to Minneapolis because my brother lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: You never had any contact with them after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Then what plans did you make?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Well, I came here and I tried to get a job in international trade, what I was doing in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s670">And I went to all the big companies who had an international department.</span> <span id="s671">I went to Minnesota Mining, to Cargill, General Mills.</span> <span id="s672">Pillsbury, Honeywell.</span> <span id="s673">Everybody was very nice.</span> <span id="s674">“Mr. Grosmann, it’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s675">Wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s676">We’ll call you.”</span> <span id="s677">I went to an agency downtown and they told me.</span> <span id="s678">“Ed, there isn’t a single Jew working in these companies -- in these area.</span> <span id="s679">You’ll never get a job there.</span> <span id="s680">You might as well forget it.”</span> <span id="s681">That was the end of my looking for my current career in the United States.</span> <span id="s682">I was looking for work.</span> <span id="s683">I was hungry.</span> <span id="s684">We had nothing to live on.</span> <span id="s685">My brother wasn’t doing too well, and he was just able to make ends meet for himself, and I had to earn some money.</span> <span id="s686">And I looked for a job high and low -- that was in 1948 and there was big unemployment in the United States -- and finally, I believe, the Jewish Family Service got me a job at a restaurant -- are you a local man?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: I’ve been here 15 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: So you wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s689">The name of it was a restaurant by the name Hasty Tasty and I got the grave-shift to make sandwiches.</span> <span id="s690">They asked me if I am a cook.</span> <span id="s691">I says, yes.</span> <span id="s692">In fact, the only thing I knew how to cook is hot water.</span> <span id="s693">But I was making sandwiches and hamburgers and they promoted me the third night to make waffles and that was my downfall.</span> <span id="s694">Was a very busy Friday night, and I forgot to take the waffle out, smoked out the place, lost their customers.</span> <span id="s695">They picked me up and they kicked me out so fast.</span> <span id="s696">They says I should never comeback.</span> <span id="s697">So I lost my career in being a waffle maker.</span> <span id="s698">And from there I had a menial job at a company that was making shirts.</span> <span id="s699">And from there I went to another company where I stayed, being a receiving clerk, doing manual work, while I was going to school.</span> <span id="s700">Immediately, the first thing I had done when I came here, I enrolled to be in the University in evening school.</span> <span id="s701">And I was going to school at night, and whenever I had time, and then by good fortune, I met the president of the company whom I am still with today, 35 years now since I started.</span> <span id="s702">And there he gave me an opportunity to do what I was doing.</span> <span id="s703">And I started an export department for them, and I am, today, the head of the export department, and I am a senior vice president of Napco, and I am a member of the board.</span> <span id="s704">So America has been very good to me</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: I just have a couple more questions here.</span> <span id="s706">Do you maintain contact with the Jewish community here?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A; I would say very much so.</span> <span id="s708">I am on the Board of Trustees for the Federation.</span> <span id="s709">I am on the Board of Trustees of the Jewish Family Service, I served for many years on the Board of Trustees of the Adath Jeshurun Synagogue.</span> <span id="s710">I served in various capacities, in the synagogue; I was the Chairman of the Ritual Committee in the Adath.</span> <span id="s711">I was the Chairman of the I.S. Joseph Scholarship Committee of the Minneapolis Jewish Federation.</span> <span id="s712">I served for many years on the Central Budget Committee of the Federation.</span> <span id="s713">I serve on the Committee for the Resettlement of the New Americans, the Russians.</span> <span id="s714">So I’m a little busy, as you can see.</span> <span id="s715">I was also on the Board of the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s716">I keep my fingers in.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Do you maintain contact with other survivors or any survivors’ organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: I maintain contact.</span> <span id="s719">Quite a few of my very close friends -- very close friends -- are survivors.</span> <span id="s720">Some of them you know.</span> <span id="s721">Freddie -- I met Freddie when I came to this country, he was already here -- Fred Baron.</span> <span id="s722">I don’t know if you know him.</span> <span id="s723">In fact, he is the president of the JCRC right now.</span> <span id="s724">And I am also on the committee for the Ida Grossman Holocaust Committee.</span> <span id="s725">I serve there.</span> <span id="s726">And Dora Zaidenweber, you heard of Dora Zaidenweber?</span> <span id="s727">I would say many of our good friends --very close friends -- are survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: How did you meet your wife?</span> <span id="s729">Is she a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: My wife?</span> <span id="s731">It was beshert, I must say.</span> <span id="s732">I was at the University, and during vacation time, we went on an outing to Duluth, and I met her there, and that’s how we are here today.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Can you tell me what it has meant to you to be a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s735">Number one is I didn’t realize how precious life is until I saw what could happen to people.</span> <span id="s736">But the most important thing to me --as a survivor -- is that I have a very big investment in the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s737">The price that I have paid is so great, that I felt that I want to be able to see, “L’kol mikvat avohda.”</span> <span id="s738">I wanted to see the end of the Nazi Regime.</span> <span id="s739">In fact, that strength, that spirit, of the wish to see the downfall of that regime, I believe, really kept me going in the last moments of the war when I weighed only 80 pounds and was very ill.</span> <span id="s740">And I am very anxious to see that the Jewish people survive, because the price that we have paid deserves and necessitates our wish and effort that this is carried on to posterity.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Well, this is somewhat related to that, but could you describe to me your general feeling about human nature, non-Jews and Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Basically, people are good.</span> <span id="s743">But unfortunately, I saw what happened in Auschwitz, that in many people, customs, habits and behavior is just like a veneer that peels off very quickly when the conditions under which they were brought up are changed.</span> <span id="s744">But I would say, during the war, when I had so many non-Jews risking their lives, helping us out, I feel that there are good people in this world -- basically, people are good and they would stay good unless something comes about that brings out the bad in them.</span> <span id="s745">But they are basically good people.</span> <span id="s746">Because of this, I feel, the world and mankind has survived up to date.</span> <span id="s747">Otherwise, I think there wouldn’t have been mankind today if there wouldn’t have been some good people in this world, regardless, Jews or non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Has your belief or practice in Judaism or a Supreme Being changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: (Laughs) I’ll make it very brief.</span> <span id="s750">I was brought up in a very religious home in a very religious community.</span> <span id="s751">I was a rebel at the age of eight or nine.</span> <span id="s752">I could see many things going wrong which I couldn’t figure out.</span> <span id="s753">And I felt that changes have to take place.</span> <span id="s754">I was among the few rebels who did not conform to the local standards, and belonged to a Zionist movement which was in “cherem.”</span> <span id="s755">You know what “cherem” is?</span> <span id="s756">That’s a place outside the community.</span> <span id="s757">But I felt this was right.</span> <span id="s758">I believed very strongly in God, but I felt that I had to help God in order to accomplish some things -- and this was with regard to the creation of a State, of our own homeland.</span> <span id="s759">But basically, I was a very religious Jew, and I went along with the general feeling of our community.</span> <span id="s760">During World War II, when I was in the Army, when I had a choice to be in a battalion where we wouldn’t have to eat kosher, I chose to be in a battalion which was called the kosher battalion, which had religious inclination, because I believed very strongly in my Jewish upbringing, I laid t’fillin -- and I had t’fillin --every day in labor camp, and studied Talmud and all --and had the prayers of mincha and maariv recited every day until I came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s761">Since then I have never put t’fillin on.</span> <span id="s762">In Auschwitz, I lost total belief in any Supreme Being, for the same reason as many of my colleagues.</span> <span id="s763">I won’t go into the philosophy of that, because that philosophy has been thoroughly expounded, in a much better way than I can expound on it.</span> <span id="s764">And after the War, after I was liberated, I didn’t want to have anything to do with the God of Israel.</span> <span id="s765">All I wanted to see is that the world becomes a better world than it was, that the things that happened under Nazi Germany don’t repeat itself.</span> <span id="s766">And I didn’t care if it happened under what regime, under what philosophy.</span> <span id="s767">And I sure felt it cannot happen under the philosophy of Judaism, because the all-merciful God who was supposed to practice mercy and justice, couldn’t have been so merciful when he took my little nephew, when I was still in the labor camp in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s768">When I saw several thousand Hungarian Jewish children from the ages of five to ten going to Auschwitz, and I found out their fate, what befell them in Auschwitz, I couldn’t believe in such a God.</span> <span id="s769">And during the entire time when I was in Prague, I had nothing to do with my God.</span> <span id="s770">I told my God, he should mind his own business, and I was living my own life.</span> <span id="s771">And I came like this to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">When I met my wife, I told her that I am not a religious Jew and I would like to get married by a Justice of the Peace.</span> <span id="s773">I said I don’t want any part of a synagogue.</span> <span id="s774">I didn’t want any part of anything that has to do with the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s775">With the Jews, yes, but not with their religion.</span> <span id="s776">She says, ‘No synagogue, no wedding.</span> <span id="s777">No rabbi, no wedding.”</span> <span id="s778">So I got married, but I still didn’t go to any synagogue.</span> <span id="s779">Finally, my wife insisted, why don’t we go to the synagogue, so she brought me back to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s780">We had our first baby, we had to name the baby, and before I knew it, I was asked by the president of the Adath Jeshurun if I wouldn’t take on some positions in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s781">Before I knew it, I was so tangled up, I became an officer.</span> <span id="s782">We created the organization in the synagogue for the purpose of bringing young people together, which was called the Married Couples League.</span> <span id="s783">I didn’t have any interest in the religious aspects of the synagogue, but I was very interested in the social aspects, and as a result of the social aspects, I was slowly woven into the fabric of religious life.</span> <span id="s784">I’m pretty deeply involved.</span> <span id="s785">You know, there’s the old saying; The apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree.</span> <span id="s786">And I don’t regret it,</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Would you be willing to share with us any photos, mementos or other things for the purpose of exhibition or research?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s789">I would be prepared.</span> <span id="s790">You want ‘em now?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: I think they’ll contact you.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: I haven’t got too many.</span> <span id="s793">But I have the pictures of my parents, and I have some pictures from the labor camp that some of my friends have given me after the War.</span> <span id="s794">And I have a picture of how I looked in the Slovak Army, in the uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Do you believe that films and books about the Holocaust accurately depict it?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: They do as well as they can.</span> <span id="s797">It could never be depicted, there is nothing in the world that I feel could do the total job -- could do the true job, what really we experienced in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Have you read any of the books or seen movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: I have read many of the books, yes.</span> <span id="s800">I read them all.</span> <span id="s801">I read The Wall.</span> <span id="s802">I read Mila 16.</span> <span id="s803">I read Exodus, and I believe I’ve read most of the books that have been written on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s804">In fact, I was very instrumental to set up a memorial for the Holocaust in the Minneapolis Public Library with a few of my other colleagues.</span> <span id="s805">And I was able to get some very interesting books from the Czech government -- from the Jewish Museum in Prague -- which are now part of the Minneapolis Public Library, in the Holocaust Memorial section.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: This concludes the interview with Edward Grosmann at his home in St. Louis Park on June 23, 1984.</span></p> <p><span
