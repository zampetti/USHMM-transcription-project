and we ran.</span> <span id="s40">We ran for our lives.”</span> <span id="s41">And...and that way, I think about three thousand or four thousand Jews from Russia, in those areas--Poland-Lithuania, in that time--wound up in...in...in Harbin.</span> <span id="s42">We had a nice little Jewish community in Harbin.</span> <span id="s43">China.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Would you describe it?</span> <span id="s45">Tell, talk about yourself and your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Well, I was several...two years old when we came there.</span> <span id="s47">Uh I don't recollect what my father doing for a living; but apparently he was doing alright, because we had a nice home.</span> <span id="s48">Uh we lived...I went to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s49">We had a Talmud Torah.</span> <span id="s50">As small a community, we had in Harbin...in China, we had uh, we we were organized.</span> <span id="s51">We had wonderful leaders.</span> <span id="s52">Rabbis and uh Zionist uh leaders.</span> <span id="s53">Dr. Kaufman, one of them.</span> <span id="s54">Uh they organized - we had a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s55">We had uh a Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s56">We had two or three synagogues.</span> <span id="s57">And we had Talmud Torah.</span> <span id="s58">That's the Jewish school that I went to.</span> <span id="s59">That's where I learned Hebrew and some Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: And then when I was uh ten years old, I went to a Russian school.</span> <span id="s62">And stayed there for six years; and that was in 1929.</span> <span id="s63">Uh my parents, right when I graduated Russian school, uh decided to send me and my brother to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s64">At that time, situation in Harbin started to deteriorate because the Japanese were moving in.</span> <span id="s65">And the Japanese eventually occupied Manchuria, and set up an independent country of Manchukuo in 1934 or '33.</span> <span id="s66">I don't remember exactly when it was.</span> <span id="s67">Anyway, so my parents decided to be safe, send us to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s68">They eventually also came and lived in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s69">We lived together in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s70">That's where I went to a British school.</span> <span id="s71">And I studied the English language that I know now.</span> <span id="s72">And then, sixteen or seventeen that I was, I went to work.</span> <span id="s73">And that's ...and that's... I went to work for an office which was importing uh textiles from England, Japan.</span> <span id="s74">And uh in 1936, I got married.</span> <span id="s75">In 1937, my...I think it was '36.</span> <span id="s76">Uh, the...my firm decided to send me to Japan.</span> <span id="s77">Kobe, Japan.</span> <span id="s78">That is how I found myself--I..</span> <span id="s79">.</span> <span id="s80">my wife and me.</span> <span id="s81">And we still had no children at that time.</span> <span id="s82">I found myself in Kobe, Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s84">Before we get to Kobe, can we back up a little bit?</span> <span id="s85">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Before we get to Kobe, can we back up a little bit?</span> <span id="s87">Tell me what it was like for a young Jewish boy growing up in Harbin, China.</span> <span id="s88">What were you relations with the Chinese like?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Uh, we didn't have any close relations with the Chinese.</span> <span id="s90">Uh we...our parents were doing business with the Chinese.</span> <span id="s91">Uh, we were growing up in a nice Jewish atmosphere.</span> <span id="s92">We had uh...and of course, Zionism was very prevalent at that time.</span> <span id="s93">We had people coming from Palestine in those days; and giving us lectures, and sending...uh, selling--at that time it wasn't one.</span> <span id="s94">What was it at that time?</span> <span id="s95">They were selling land, actually.</span> <span id="s96">A lot of our people bought land in Palestine in those days.</span> <span id="s97">Keren Kayemeth and Keren Hayesod, the Jewish funds.And we had uh we had very - I belonged to a Jewish organization, Ritrum Pilog (ph), and uh we were very active.</span> <span id="s98">I mean, in sense like studying English and studying Jewish history, the history of Zionism; and, of course, being young fellows, we were all in sports.</span> <span id="s99">And uh it was a good, good fine Jewish life.</span> <span id="s100">We had good teachers, good instructors.</span> <span id="s101">And uh it's amazing how how this small community of Jews in Harbin - I always think of it as a lot of of fine 1 Also, Manchoukuo or Manchutikuo.</span> <span id="s102">Set up as an independent republic in February 1932 following the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in 1931.</span> <span id="s103">The nearby province of Jehol was added in 1933.</span> <span id="s104">Became a puppet empire under the nominal leadership of Manchu emperor K'ang Tê in 1934.</span> <span id="s105">Dissolved in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">2 Funds established by the Zionist Organization for the purchase and development of land in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">good warm feelings because they were so dedicated, all these rabbis and the teachers and the Zionist leaders.</span> <span id="s108">So eventually when uh... I am getting a little jump, we'll come back again later, if you don't mind.</span> <span id="s109">Eventually in 1948, after the war, when the State of Israel was established, where ...where else would I go?</span> <span id="s110">Only to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: And we went to Israel.</span> <span id="s113">In 1948.</span> <span id="s114">We stayed there two years.</span> <span id="s115">Then back to Japan.</span> <span id="s116">But that's another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: That's another story.</span> <span id="s118">OK.</span> <span id="s119">Now we'll go back.</span> <span id="s120">You have just arrived then in Kobe.</span> <span id="s121">Will you describe your impressions on first arriving?</span> <span id="s122">You are now a young man...</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Always, uh we had a little house.</span> <span id="s124">I was busy, of course, doing the job that I was assigned to do.</span> <span id="s125">I used to travel a lot all over Japan, buying merchandise and uh shipping it to China, to my firm that I was working for.</span> <span id="s126">Always we were looking for Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s127">We established some contacts.</span> <span id="s128">A little synagogue there, and uh then that's where we established a little Jewish community.</span> <span id="s129">I mean, this Jewish community uh...uh mainly, the main activities-- besides, of course, having a little synagogue where we gathered uh on high holidays and Passover--not very religiously inclined people.</span> <span id="s130">The Sephardic Jews that lived there were much much stronger in that.</span> <span id="s131">They had minyan every Friday night and every Shabbos, you know; but we were not that uh religiously involved.</span> <span id="s132">Mostly our people played cards over there.</span> <span id="s133">And the ladies played Mah Jong, and the men played poker or whatever they played.</span> <span id="s134">And there was a restaurant; just that, meeting.</span> <span id="s135">It was like a club more or less.</span> <span id="s136">Jewish community was like a club where people got together.</span> <span id="s137">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: You said earlier that there was a difference between Sephardic Jews and the Askhenazi Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: We felt that we were being looked uh looked down upon.</span> <span id="s140">You see, we were stateless people.</span> <span id="s141">We had no passports.</span> <span id="s142">Having ...our parents really ran away from Russia to China.</span> <span id="s143">We had no nationality.</span> <span id="s144">Uh, some of our people who wanted to become Soviet did become; but we didn't want to become Soviets.</span> <span id="s145">We stayed as Russian immigrants.</span> <span id="s146">And we were...the Jewish community that was organized there was uh was involved in in keeping in touch with the Chinese authorities who were in charge of the... I mean, if you had to have a passport to travel somewhere, they would issue you a Chinese passport.</span> <span id="s147">But nationality was White Russian Immigrant.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: White Immigrant - stateless.</span> <span id="s150">And then it was not so easy to come to Japan to get a visa, but if you went on--uh, like my firm applied for me, uh they transferring me on uh certain situation, a job, so they gave me a visa.</span> <span id="s151">Of course, uh you have to you know, they... You always knew when you live at that time in Japan that you were being uh...somebody was looking at, all the time watching you.</span> <span id="s152">As a matter of fact...</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: How did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Uh, plainclothes police--Japanese.</span> <span id="s155">Every foreigner was considered to be a spy in those days.</span> <span id="s156">It was uh an unusual situation, but it didn't bother us.</span> <span id="s157">As long as you didn't engage yourself into any politics, or...or...or uh doing things that are against the law, nobody bothered you.</span> <span id="s158">You just went on with your business, and that was it.</span> <span id="s159">That was the life over there.</span> <span id="s160">Very easy.</span> <span id="s161">I mean, we were young-- friends, uh social uh uh parties, playing cards and travelling.</span> <span id="s162">And uh that was the life.</span> <span id="s163">In those days, travelling was not as simple as it is today - jump on a plane and you fly.</span> <span id="s164">Shanghai was about 48 hours by boat.</span> <span id="s165">You know, it was... But...but we did we did our share of travelling.</span> <span id="s166">But you couldn't travel...say if I wanted to go to Hong Kong, I couldn't.</span> <span id="s167">Being a white Russian immigrant, they wouldn't let me in.</span> <span id="s168">It's...it's hard to explain how it was, but uh we managed.</span> <span id="s169">We managed.</span> <span id="s170">We lived.</span> <span id="s171">And I suppose uh...uh, again, coming back to our conversations before, that there was some reason why we were there.</span> <span id="s172">Maybe we were there because we had to...to be in the right place at the right time as you said.</span> <span id="s173">I..</span> <span id="s174">.</span> <span id="s175">I..</span> <span id="s176">.</span> <span id="s177">older I became, more I think that's what it's all about.</span> <span id="s178">We had to be there to help our people.</span> <span id="s179">Three thousand.</span> <span id="s180">And...and...and it's amazing.</span> <span id="s181">The Japanese, who were very strict in allowing non-uh foreigners so to speak to come to Japan, all of a sudden they opened their doors.</span> <span id="s182">This man, this Sugihara--the Japanese Consul that was stamping across the visas...the passport for the Japanese transient visas--it's amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Let's back up so we can get some context.</span> <span id="s184">We're in Kobe, and you've been there for a little while now.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yes, uh I just I have to back up a little bit.</span> <span id="s186">In 1938, I went back to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s187">My son was born at that time; and my wife and myself and my son, we went back to Shanghai because the firm that I was working for transferred me back to Shanghai where I stayed for a year and a half.</span> <span id="s188">And in 1930... 1940...1940--yes, beginning of 1940, I received a proposition from another firm which was doing business with uh... with--again...again, curiosity, with Curaçao.</span> <span id="s189">Of all the...Curaçao and Panama.</span> <span id="s190">The name of the firm was Curaçao-Panama Boeki Kaisya, which means in Japanese "[Curaçao-Panama] Trading Company.”</span> <span id="s191">Uh, a man I met in Japan, a Jewish man from Panama--Max Pecker--he met me in Japan, and he needed somebody to run his business over there.</span> <span id="s192">So he came to Shanghai and he took me to Japan; and he told me, "I know you are involved in Jewish social work.</span> <span id="s193">I don't want you to be busy with any social work.</span> <span id="s194">We have a lot of work to do here, buying all kinds of goods, a lot merchandise.”</span> <span id="s195">I said, "Max, I'll be there.”</span> <span id="s196">And uh I..</span> <span id="s197">.</span> <span id="s198">and that's what it was.</span> <span id="s199">And...and ...and if it would be of interest, can I digress a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Please.</span> <span id="s201">As much as you like.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Max Pecker, who was my boss from Panama, uh brought me to Japan.</span> <span id="s203">Kobe, again Kobe.</span> <span id="s204">And there was a really Jewish community which was about thirty families, and I became active.</span> <span id="s205">Having uh...having been one of the few who spoke good English and and could write English, I became Secretary of the Jewish community at that time.</span> <span id="s206">Not paid, of course; just social, you know.</span> <span id="s207">And also my job was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s208">Yiddish - use to receive a lot of magazines, Zionist magazines.</span> <span id="s209">And the others.</span> <span id="s210">And I used to translate and...and speak about the various happenings, and that were happening in the Jewish world, in Poland, at that time.</span> <span id="s211">And uh when we were there in Japan in 1941 with Max, in 1940...'40, uh his parents were in uh Bessarabia.He left Bessarabia when he was a young man, and went to South America.</span> <span id="s212">And he developed a very good, large business in Panama, in Curaçao, in...in...uh in Peru.</span> <span id="s213">There was a number of group, Jews from Romania.</span> <span id="s214">I don't know if you are aware of it.</span> <span id="s215">A group of them went to...and they went to South American countries--Argentina, Venezuela--and they...'til today, they are there.</span> <span id="s216">So at that time, the refugees started to come in.</span> <span id="s217">This...the whole situation, the whole historical situation...people started to come in.</span> <span id="s218">And I started getting more and more active.</span> <span id="s219">And uh I said, "Max, where are your parents?"</span> <span id="s220">He says, "They are in a small city in Noua Sulita, in...in Bessarabia.”</span> <span id="s221">I said, "Max, look what's going on in Europe.</span> <span id="s222">Hitler is advancing, and Poland is already destroyed.</span> <span id="s223">I mean, occupied half- way.”</span> <span id="s224">It was occupied by the Russians, half-way occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s225">"And Romania could be next.</span> <span id="s226">Get them out of there!"</span> <span id="s227">He says, "Look, I am writing letters to them.”</span> <span id="s228">And...and he used to correspond to them in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s229">And...and he show it [to] me; and he says, "Look, I want you to come here, and then we will...” And about three weeks later, he got the reply from them.</span> <span id="s230">And...and his old man, his father, writes... He says, "Who's ?</span> <span id="s231">Where shall I go?</span> <span id="s232">My shtube [Yidd: "home" or "house"?]</span> <span id="s233">is done, my shul is done, my life is done, my gesheft [Yidd: "essence of being" or "soul"] is...” I don't know what gesheft he was doing in a small place called Noua Sulita.</span> <span id="s234">I said, "Max, get them out of there!"</span> <span id="s235">He says, "Look, he doesn't want to come.”</span> <span id="s236">And then he left.</span> <span id="s237">But before he left, he said, "Look, I'm going to write my father a letter.</span> <span id="s238">If he ever wants to leave Romania, you bring.</span> <span id="s239">Now you are bringing Jews from Poland- Lithuania...” You know, this whole...the Jews started to come in.</span> <span id="s240">And he says, "I wrote to my father if he ever thinks there is need for him to leave uh Romania, to let you know and you'll see what you can do.”</span> <span id="s241">I said, "Max, we're bringing people from Poland from under Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s242">Who knows?</span> <span id="s243">Uh, Romania, Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s244">It's another border.”</span> <span id="s245">He says to me, "I wrote him a letter.”</span> <span id="s246">And I said, "Look, do you have photographs of your father, your mother and your two sisters?"</span> <span id="s247">He says, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s248">I said, "Leave them to me in case the communication, something.”</span> <span id="s249">Something told me I must have those photographs.</span> <span id="s250">He gave them to me.</span> <span id="s251">And uh about uh three or four weeks later, you know, Romania became a uh a uh ally of Germany; but Bessarabia was occupied by the Russians, and it became the Moldavian Republic.So they were under the Russians.</span> <span id="s252">And I get a telegram one day in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s253">I mean, the writing was in English, of 3 Rom: Basarabia.</span> <span id="s254">Asserted independence from Russia in 1917 as Moldavian Republic; joined Romania 09 Apr 1918.</span> <span id="s255">Recognized as part of Romania by Treaty of Versailles (1919), but still claimed by the USSR.</span> <span id="s256">Seized by the USSR 27 Jun 1940 and incorporated with Bukovina in Aug 1940 as Moldavian SSR.</span> <span id="s257">Recaptured by Germans and Romanians June 1941; recovered by USSR in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">4 This would have been about August 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">course, but they were English [NB: Yiddish] words.</span> <span id="s260">"Das bild was Max .”</span> <span id="s261">In other words, "The picture that Max wanted to send me, I have to have it very, very, very urgently.”</span> <span id="s262">So I understood.</span> <span id="s263">They have to run.</span> <span id="s264">So I uh...I went, and I started talking to some of the of the rabbis, Rabbi Shapiro.</span> <span id="s265">He was a good friend of mine, one of the refugees.</span> <span id="s266">I said, "Shloime, this is the story.</span> <span id="s267">What to do?"</span> <span id="s268">He says, "Well, if they were in Lithuania I would tell them what to do, but they are in another place.”</span> <span id="s269">So I said, "Think about it.</span> <span id="s270">We must save them.</span> <span id="s271">We must do something about it.”</span> <span id="s272">So he says to me, uh, "Give me a day or two to think about it.”</span> <span id="s273">And he came running to me one day, and he says uh... Uh, I'll talk about it, [but] I will not name the country; because maybe...one of the South American countries, the consul is selling passports.</span> <span id="s274">Better I don't name the country.</span> <span id="s275">Don't you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: No, no.</span> <span id="s277">Name the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Chile.</span> <span id="s279">The Chilean consul.</span> <span id="s280">I said I have to meet him.</span> <span id="s281">I want to talk to him.</span> <span id="s282">So uh I don't remember how I met him.</span> <span id="s283">Anyway, he gave me...he says, "I want to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s284">I said, "I want to talk to you about something very, very urgent.”</span> <span id="s285">He said, "Yes, come and see me.”</span> <span id="s286">His office was not far from where I lived.</span> <span id="s287">As a matter of fact, he had his office in his private home.</span> <span id="s288">I went to see.</span> <span id="s289">And this was an experience that I'll never forget, because it was such an ...such an anti-Semitic man.</span> <span id="s290">Uh, Rodriguez was his name, I do remember.</span> <span id="s291">I said, "Look, this is the situation.</span> <span id="s292">Jews are trapped in a small city in Romania.</span> <span id="s293">And, uh, I want to bring them out.</span> <span id="s294">The only way I can bring them out if they have some passports, some documents, that...that they can...they can leave the country.</span> <span id="s295">As long as they can come, I want to bring them to Moscow.</span> <span id="s296">From Moscow, we will bring them somehow here, the same as the refugees who are going from...between Yugoslavia and Moscow.</span> <span id="s297">From Moscow, I will bring him here to Japan.</span> <span id="s298">And then we will see what happens.</span> <span id="s299">But let's...let me get them out.”</span> <span id="s300">He says, "Well, what do you want?"</span> <span id="s301">I said, "I need passports.”</span> <span id="s302">"So?"</span> <span id="s303">I said, "Well, I uh...I'd like to...

but in my mind, I was ready.</span> <span id="s325">I said, "Well...” Not to be so uh quick in agreeing to his price.</span> <span id="s326">He says, "You see, you Jews.</span> <span id="s327">You want to help and save people.</span> <span id="s328">When it comes to money, you are stingy.”</span> <span id="s329">I said, "Mr. Rodriguez, please have a heart.”</span> <span id="s330">He says, "Alright.</span> <span id="s331">$4,000.</span> <span id="s332">You bring me cash.”</span> <span id="s333">I have to smuggle out.</span> <span id="s334">Cash was not allowed.</span> <span id="s335">It was black market, you know.</span> <span id="s336">Just...but I managed.</span> <span id="s337">He said, "You must promise me.</span> <span id="s338">I'll give you three passports.</span> <span id="s339">One's for the father.</span> <span id="s340">One for the mother, and one for the two girls.”</span> <span id="s341">They were under eighteen.</span> <span id="s342">"And when they come here...if you bring them here, you must promise me solemnly that you will return the passports to me.”</span> <span id="s343">I said, "Of course.”</span> <span id="s344">I said to myself in my hat, "I'll give them to you!</span> <span id="s345">Let them come.</span> <span id="s346">Then I'll worry about giving you the passports.”</span> <span id="s347">Anyway, I got the passports.</span> <span id="s348">And then I had a big problem.</span> <span id="s349">How do I send those passports out?</span> <span id="s350">There was censorship.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Where do I--a stateless immigrant living in Japan--get hold... can get ahold of foreign passports?</span> <span id="s352">What to do?</span> <span id="s353">So on that picture I showed you, that was Mr. Kondo (ph), a good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s354">He was a policeman in charge of Russian affairs.</span> <span id="s355">Spoke perfect Russian.</span> <span id="s356">Good friend.</span> <span id="s357">I came to see him.</span> <span id="s358">I said, "Kondo-san.”</span> <span id="s359">In Japanese, you don't say "Mister.”</span> <span id="s360">You say, "san," you know.</span> <span id="s361">And I said, "Kondo-san, I have a problem.”</span> <span id="s362">"What's the problem?"</span> <span id="s363">I said, "My boss was here from Panama, and he went to Chile.</span> <span id="s364">And he sent me passports for his family.</span> <span id="s365">And now I have to send them to occupied Bessarabia, which is occupied by the by the Soviets.</span> <span id="s366">Uh, Government Soviet Republic.</span> <span id="s367">How do I go about it?</span> <span id="s368">I..</span> <span id="s369">.</span> <span id="s370">I want to make sure that they're going to get those...those passports, because then I will bring them over here.”</span> <span id="s371">He says, "Let me talk to my boss.”</span> <span id="s372">How cooperat...they were so cooperative.</span> <span id="s373">I..</span> <span id="s374">.</span> <span id="s375">I..</span> <span id="s376">.</span> <span id="s377">You know, I think about it now and I get shivers, because all those things that happened.</span> <span id="s378">Anyway, uh he came back.</span> <span id="s379">And he says, "Look.”</span> <span id="s380">And he spoke to his chief of his Russian section, Saito-san.</span> <span id="s381">And Mr. Saito says send those passports to the Japanese Ambassador in Moscow.</span> <span id="s382">Since Bessarabia is occupied by the Soviets, write a letter and ask the Consul to contact these people in the occupied zone, Soviet zone, and tell them that he has passports for them.</span> <span id="s383">They should try and get out and come to Moscow, where he will give them those passports.</span> <span id="s384">Sounds good.</span> <span id="s385">I did it.</span> <span id="s386">And uh, unfortunately, a month later Hitler invaded Russia.</span> <span id="s387">And that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s388">They were destroyed.And they, uh... After the war, in 1947, Max came to Shanghai, where I lived.</span> <span id="s389">And he came, and he... And I kept copies of all the... First of all, it was his money that I spent to buy these passports, the passports.</span> <span id="s390">So I..</span> <span id="s391">.</span> <span id="s392">I told him.</span> <span id="s393">He was crying like a child.</span> <span id="s394">He said, "It's my fault.”</span> <span id="s395">I said, "Max, no.</span> <span id="s396">I am a witness.”</span> <span id="s397">"Ich bin ein eydes,"I said, in Jewish.</span> <span id="s398">"You wrote to your father and to your mother and to your sisters to leave when they still had a chance.</span> <span id="s399">And...and they never left.</span> <span id="s400">I am a witness.</span> <span id="s401">Don't...don't...don't punish yourself.”</span> <span id="s402">And he was on the religious side.</span> <span id="s403">I said, "Let's go and see our rabbi.”</span> <span id="s404">Rabbi Ashkenazi was the rabbi of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s405">A very beautiful old man.</span> <span id="s406">And we went there, and I told him the story.</span> <span id="s407">"Well," the rabbi told him, "look.</span> <span id="s408">Don't punish yourself.</span> <span id="s409">It's not your fault.</span> <span id="s410">Go to synagogue and say kaddish.”</span> <span id="s411">And uh that was it.</span> <span id="s412">But then--I'm jumping again.</span> <span id="s413">Because about ten years ago, I went to Venezuela on business.</span> <span id="s414">To Caracas.</span> <span id="s415">And Max was already married with children.</span> <span id="s416">He was there.</span> <span id="s417">And I uh wrote him a letter I am coming.</span> <span id="s418">He was so excited.</span> <span id="s419">Many years had gone by, and the last time I saw him was in 1947.</span> <span id="s420">And now I am talking about 1973, or something like that.</span> <span id="s421">Thirty years.</span> <span id="s422">Thirty years went by.</span> <span id="s423">He's married.</span> <span id="s424">He has grown-up children.</span> <span id="s425">Lives...he is a very very wealthy man.</span> <span id="s426">Lives in Caracas, Venezuela.</span> <span id="s427">I called him up.</span> <span id="s428">He came.</span> <span id="s429">He came to the hotel, and you can imagine what went on.</span> <span id="s430">He brought his son.</span> <span id="s431">His son... He says, "My son is going to be Bar Mitzvah next year.”</span> <span id="s432">I said, "Oh, how wonderful!"</span> <span id="s433">They all spoke English and Spanish and Yiddish, of course.</span> <span id="s434">He says, "You know what my son's name?"</span> <span id="s435">I said, "No.”</span> <span id="s436">"His name is Leo.”</span> <span id="s437">You know, I was...I was flabbergasted.</span> <span id="s438">Yes.</span> <span id="s439">Yes.</span> <span id="s440">I said, "Oh, my 5 800 Jews were massacred in Noua Sulita by Romanian soldiers on 02 Jul 1941.</span> <span id="s441">Survivors were deported to the east, and were eventually interned in a camp in Transnistria.</span> <span id="s442">Source: Matatias Carp, Cartea Neagra, Bucharest (1946).</span></p> <p><span id="s443">6 Literally, "I am a witness."</span> <span id="s444">(Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s445">God!"</span> <span id="s446">And uh he says, "By the way my wife's name is Reva.”</span> <span id="s447">And that was my wife's name.</span> <span id="s448">But that was a coincidence.</span> <span id="s449">But he wanted to tell me that he named his son for me, which was very, uh... And then we went to his house.</span> <span id="s450">Beautiful place.</span> <span id="s451">And nice family, nice good Jewish family.</span> <span id="s452">And I went to his bedroom.</span> <span id="s453">And there on the table, the pictures of his father, his mother and his sisters.</span> <span id="s454">The ones that were destroyed in the camp.</span> <span id="s455">I said, "Max, do your children..."--a girl, eighteen, seventeen; and Leo was nearly thirteen.</span> <span id="s456">I said, "Do they know what happened to your children...to your parents and to your sisters?"</span> <span id="s457">He said, "No.</span> <span id="s458">They know they were...they were uh destroyed by the...in the Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s459">I said, "Did you ever tell them that uh you tried your best to bring them here?</span> <span id="s460">To bring them out of there?</span> <span id="s461">And the only chance... Who knows?</span> <span id="s462">And...but they wouldn't go.”</span> <span id="s463">He says, "No.”</span> <span id="s464">I said, "Max, you must...you must tell your children.</span> <span id="s465">Because children today are different children than you were and I was.</span> <span id="s466">They might think, 'Where was my father, a very wealthy man and uh doing so well?</span> <span id="s467">Maybe he didn't want to spend his money...' Or something.</span> <span id="s468">You must tell them.”</span> <span id="s469">He says, "I can't.”</span> <span id="s470">I said, "Can I?"</span> <span id="s471">He says, "Yes.</span> <span id="s472">Go ahead.”</span> <span id="s473">So I took those photographs, brought them to the dining room, put them on the table.</span> <span id="s474">And I said, "Children, do you know who these are?"</span> <span id="s475">They said, "Yes, our grandfather and grandmother.</span> <span id="s476">They were destroyed in the...in the Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s477">I said, "Let me tell you something.”</span> <span id="s478">I said, "I am a witness.</span> <span id="s479">And your father was insisting that your great grandfather and your grandmother and your two aunts should come, should escape from there.</span> <span id="s480">But they wouldn't move.”</span> <span id="s481">And so they were crying and sad, but that's it.</span> <span id="s482">That's part of the Holocaust stories, one of them.</span> <span id="s483">That's what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Let's go back to Kobe, and... We have had a long, very important story, but bring it back to Kobe.</span> <span id="s485">How did you first get involved?</span> <span id="s486">You were involved in the community...</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yeah, we were an organized Jewish community, of which I was the secretary.</span> <span id="s488">And we started getting telegrams.</span> <span id="s489">First a telegram with a few names in it.</span> <span id="s490">They were German Jews-- or maybe Austrian Jews, I'm not sure--that were at that time in Lithuania, and they got the visas to go.</span> <span id="s491">Some of them went to Argentina, or somewhere else.</span> <span id="s492">All they needed was Japanese transit visas.</span> <span id="s493">Can we arrange Japanese transit visas?</span> <span id="s494">Uh, our president of our Jewish community--Anatole Ponve--was a very fine, hard-working dedicated person.</span> <span id="s495">Uh he ran to the police and he talked to them about it.</span> <span id="s496">He says, "Look, there are six people.</span> <span id="s497">Here are there names.”</span> <span id="s498">They gave their names on the...on the telegram.</span> <span id="s499">And, uh, they said, "Well, what do you want?"</span> <span id="s500">He said, "Let them come here.</span> <span id="s501">We guarantee, we the Jewish community, will guarantee their stay here.</span> <span id="s502">If they need money, and the political--uh that they are not spies, or anything of that sort.</span> <span id="s503">Just allow them to enter through Japan to Kobe, and from here they will take a ship.”</span> <span id="s504">At that time there was...it was before Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s505">I'm talking about 1900... end of 1940, beginning of 1941.</span> <span id="s506">And, uh, they said, "OK.”</span> <span id="s507">So we sent them a telegram that the visas can be obtained at the Japanese consulate.</span> <span id="s508">They got it.</span> <span id="s509">But then the new story started, this Japanese consul in Lithuania--in...in...in Kaunas [NB: Kovno], Lithuania--who, as it was so very well written in this book, The Fugu Plan... Uh, one of the rabbinical students was a uh a uh citizen of Netherlands.</span> <span id="s510">He was a Dutch citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">7 Originally: Anatole A. Ponevejsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">He studying in the Mir Yeshiva in...in...in Poland; and uh he went to see a Japanese...uh, the Dutch consul and said, "Look, uh, there is this Dutch colony, Curaçao, in West Indies.</span> <span id="s513">And I want to go there.”</span> <span id="s514">And...and the Russians, the Russians already were in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s515">They occupied Lithuania at that time, became a Lithuanian Republic.</span> <span id="s516">And he said, uh, "They will give me exit visa, and uh if I can get in visa where to go.”</span> <span id="s517">So he says, uh, "There is no need for visas to go to Curaçao.</span> <span id="s518">Anybody can go to Curaçao.”</span> <span id="s519">He says, "What?</span> <span id="s520">No entry visas?"</span> <span id="s521">"Yeah.”</span> <span id="s522">So he went back to the Russian authorities.</span> <span id="s523">I think that's how it worked.</span> <span id="s524">And says, "Look, I don't need any visas.</span> <span id="s525">I can go.”</span> <span id="s526">He says, "Show it.</span> <span id="s527">Prove it to us.”</span> <span id="s528">He went back to the Dutch consul; and the Dutch consul [he] told, "Look, give me a paper saying that according to the regulations there is no need for visas to enter Curaçao or Surinam in Dutch West Indies, and subject to the permission from the Governor, the Dutch Governor of Curaçao.”</span> <span id="s529">And he gave him that, he wrote it down with a stamp.</span> <span id="s530">That was all he needed.</span> <span id="s531">He went there and said, "Here.</span> <span id="s532">I can go.</span> <span id="s533">Here is the stamp.</span> <span id="s534">Here is the proof that there is no need for a visa.”</span> <span id="s535">He says, "Alright.</span> <span id="s536">We will give you the exit visa.</span> <span id="s537">How are you going to go?"</span> <span id="s538">Need a Japanese transit visa to travel across Russia to Japan, and from Japan to take a boat, you see.</span> <span id="s539">So he went to the Japanese, and that's how it all started.</span> <span id="s540">The Japanese consul started to give them visas.</span> <span id="s541">They were standing there... You know, news spread very fast.</span> <span id="s542">They started going, they were standing there day and night for their turn to get those visas.</span> <span id="s543">First the Dutch stamp, then the...the...the uh...the Japanese visa.</span> <span id="s544">And this man Sugihara, the Japanese consul, he got instructions from his people in Tokyo, "Stop issuing visas.”</span> <span id="s545">But he didn't listen to them.</span> <span id="s546">He actually saved the people.</span> <span id="s547">I mean, part of the whole picture, you see.</span> <span id="s548">He was very important.</span> <span id="s549">Why did he do it?</span> <span id="s550">I met him after the war in Japan, by the way.</span> <span id="s551">He uh...he said, "I don't think they can leave this country anyway.</span> <span id="s552">So let them have some peace of mind.</span> <span id="s553">I'll give them the visas.”</span> <span id="s554">Now with the Dutch consul, according to this book that I just brought to show it to you--the one written by the Rabbi--the Dutch consul had a..</span> <span id="s555">.</span> <span id="s556">a secretary.</span> <span id="s557">A German man, who eventually joined the German uh SA.</span> <span id="s558">The...the... You know.</span> <span id="s559">He...his job was to give to the consul the background of each uh...each person who applied for a Dutch, for that Dutch stamp, you see.</span> <span id="s560">And uh uh he was a German; but he was very sympathetic to the Jews.</span> <span id="s561">And the reason is, according to this book, is he had a Jewish girlfriend when he was in Germany.</span> <span id="s562">(Laughter) Another one, another angle.</span> <span id="s563">It's amazing.</span> <span id="s564">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Bring us back to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Bring it back to me.</span> <span id="s567">So we were, we were the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s568">We were a small Jewish community, and we started working.</span> <span id="s569">We organized our ladies.</span> <span id="s570">My late wife was among them.</span> <span id="s571">Uh, hundreds of people started to come in.</span> <span id="s572">Where do you put them?</span> <span id="s573">You need housing.</span> <span id="s574">You need food.</span> <span id="s575">A representative of the Joint Distribution [Committee] sent their people to Japan, to Kobe.</span> <span id="s576">A representative of the Jewish organization HIAS sent their people.</span> <span id="s577">From Lithuania, they came to Japan; and they were helping with money.</span> <span id="s578">At first, we put up our own money when a few people came.</span> <span id="s579">So there was very little to spend.</span> <span id="s580">You 8 Tokayer, Marvin (Rabbi), The Fugu Plan.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">know, transportation and food.</span> <span id="s582">But then, when hundreds started to come in, we just couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s583">So I sent a cable to the Joint Distribution Committee in New York saying uh what we are doing.</span> <span id="s584">So in the reply came--I'll never forget it as along as I live--"Money no object.</span> <span id="s585">Save Jews.”</span> <span id="s586">They immediately sent $25,000.</span> <span id="s587">That was a lot of money in those days.</span> <span id="s588">And...and since then, the representative of Joint came; and they were put uh...you know, more and more people were coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: How did you arrange all... You've talked about one route to bring Jews in.</span> <span id="s590">How did you arrange for other Jews to go in?</span> <span id="s591">What were the arrangements for getting Jews in?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: They were getting Japanese visas, transit visas.</span> <span id="s593">They had Russian exit visas, which the Russians gave to them; and they sold them, they allowed them to buy tickets only if they were paying.</span> <span id="s594">At first, they allowed them to use Russian money.</span> <span id="s595">Then they said you have to pay in dollars; so all the Jews had relatives somewhere in America, and also especially the religious.</span> <span id="s596">They...they organized themselves in New York with an organization called Va'ad Ha-Hatsala,"Organization of Saving," to...to... Hatsala is to save.</span> <span id="s597">And they were sending money.</span> <span id="s598">They were organizing everything.</span> <span id="s599">And uh, of course, they had the documents already in order.</span> <span id="s600">They had the Japanese transit visa.</span> <span id="s601">They had the Dutch stamp.</span> <span id="s602">And the Russians gave them an exit; and that's all they needed.</span> <span id="s603">And the Japanese allowed them to come and stay in Japan two weeks; but some of them stayed as long as six months, you see.</span> <span id="s604">But that's enough of story.</span> <span id="s605">Why?</span> <span id="s606">Why?</span> <span id="s607">I..</span> <span id="s608">.</span> <span id="s609">I..</span> <span id="s610">.</span> <span id="s611">It has to do with what uh Rabbi Tokayer has made research in this book: they...they...they thought by helping the Jews, they would influence the uh top of people in America--President Roosevelt, etc.</span> <span id="s612">They needed help.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Get back to you.</span> <span id="s614">How did you get involved, and what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: I was secretary of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s616">And I used to go after work--five, six o'clock-- when I finished my work in regular office, business.</span> <span id="s617">Uh, was quite an active organization.</span> <span id="s618">I used to buy a lot of merchandise to ship into South America--uh, to Panama; to Central America, Panama, Curaçao, Peru, Chile.</span> <span id="s619">And I would go every day to the Jewish community, and there were problems.</span> <span id="s620">There were so many... there were so many people.</span> <span id="s621">We had to have meetings every day, uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Talk about the problems...</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: What kind of problems.</span> <span id="s624">Uh, food.</span> <span id="s625">Three thousand people to feed.</span> <span id="s626">Uh, distribution of money.</span> <span id="s627">We organized a committee.</span> <span id="s628">We had some people from the refugees who started to work in the...in the various departments getting visas.</span> <span id="s629">Uh, they all applied to American consulate, to British consulate.</span> <span id="s630">Uh, as a matter of fact, the fifty young fellows volunteered to uh serve in the British Army; and we had to uh...uh, with the ...with the...working together with the British consul, we had to--uh, I don't know if this is the correct word--"smuggle" them out of 9 Known in English as: Rescue Committee of United States Orthodox Rabbis.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Japan, because Japan was an ally of Germany.</span> <span id="s632">And uh you couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s633">We used to do it in a very unusual way.</span> <span id="s634">Uh, we had the names of the people who wanted to enter the British Army.</span> <span id="s635">I would call up the British consul, meet him in a bar and order a couple of beers.</span> <span id="s636">I would give him the names, and he would arrange to have them assigned as, as a..</span> <span id="s637">.</span> <span id="s638">as crew members on British uh cargo boats that were run...that were sailing from Japan to India, to Singapore.</span> <span id="s639">And that's how they they left and ventured.</span> <span id="s640">Eventually, some of my good friends, they were killed.</span> <span id="s641">Two of them were killed in Italy.</span> <span id="s642">They were in the British Army.</span> <span id="s643">Some of them joined the Polish Army that was in exile.</span> <span id="s644">And uh...and every day, the Japanese police would come and ask.</span> <span id="s645">You'd have to talk to them and explain.</span> <span id="s646">What are you doing, and how are you doing.</span> <span id="s647">Uh, being a secretary and speaking some Japanese also, uh my ...one of my jobs was to keep all the documents of all the refugees - I will call them refugees - in a safe.</span> <span id="s648">They were not allowed even to go Osaka, which was one hour by train.</span> <span id="s649">Not allowed to travel in Japan.</span> <span id="s650">And they couldn't buy a ticket on a train without presenting their documents.</span> <span id="s651">And these documents were under the community's...uh, locked in a safe.</span> <span id="s652">And uh I'll never forget-- one day, two guys came in.</span> <span id="s653">One was a very mean man, as I told you.</span> <span id="s654">He studied Mein Kampf, and he always used to argue with me about why do the Germans hate the Jews so much and all that.</span> <span id="s655">That's another story.</span> <span id="s656">And uh uh he came to me; and he said, "Look, we have uh...uh suspicions that among the refugees there are some spies.</span> <span id="s657">Soviet spies.”</span> <span id="s658">I said, "As far as I'm concerned, all the Jews are Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s659">I mean, we're helping everyone.</span> <span id="s660">We don't ask who they are.</span> <span id="s661">What they are.”</span> <span id="s662">He says, "Look, you get all the documents, all their passports, all their traveling documents.”</span> <span id="s663">I said, "Yes, sir.”</span> <span id="s664">"Well, if you see that the...the picture of the man and the picture on the passport are different, you report to us immediately.”</span> <span id="s665">I said, "I can't do that.</span> <span id="s666">There are hundreds and hundreds of passports, and I can't look at each other.</span> <span id="s667">Besides," I said, "the problem with...could come without a beard, and he grew a beard.</span> <span id="s668">I didn't know if...” "You don't want to cooperate with us," they said to me.</span> <span id="s669">I said, "I'll cooperate with you, but I can't do that.</span> <span id="s670">I can't.</span> <span id="s671">I have no time to look...to look at each each passport and see who's there.</span> <span id="s672">So many of them.”</span> <span id="s673">Anyway, they were angry at me.</span> <span id="s674">They left.</span> <span id="s675">What else could we do?</span> <span id="s676">What did we do?</span> <span id="s677">I mean, let's say my wife, as young as she was - she was only 21, 22 - she was in charge of the children.</span> <span id="s678">There were about hundreds of children.</span> <span id="s679">And children would get sick.</span> <span id="s680">Children needed food.</span> <span id="s681">And, uh, children...it was winter sometimes.</span> <span id="s682">I mean, some of the months they were there, it was cold, the heating (ph) clothes.</span> <span id="s683">So they would run to her; and she would take the child and go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s684">And the Japanese doctors were marvelous.</span> <span id="s685">We had a doctor, his name was--I forgot.</span> <span id="s686">I used to call him the...the uh...uh, "the rabbit doctor.”</span> <span id="s687">He had a couple of rabbits in his yard.</span> <span id="s688">So my son, who was three years old, called him "the rabbit doctor.”</span> <span id="s689">Anyway-- Yoshimura, Dr. Yoshimura.</span> <span id="s690">Marvelous man.</span> <span id="s691">He wouldn't take any money.</span> <span id="s692">My wife would come with the mother of the child, and whatever it was--dysentery.</span> <span id="s693">And lucky, lucky, lucky [that] there was no uh...no any kind of sicknesses or serious sicknesses among the people.</span> <span id="s694">After all, you know, the change of food, the change of water, the change of climate.</span> <span id="s695">And uh (laughter) ...it's remarkable.</span> <span id="s696">Getting homes.</span> <span id="s697">There were not many foreign homes.</span> <span id="s698">And there were hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s699">So they would get Japanese homes.</span> <span id="s700">They would rent them out.</span> <span id="s701">And then we would...it was very painful sometimes to say, "Well, here you are.</span> <span id="s702">Here's a home.”</span> <span id="s703">And they... You know, the Japanese tatami--those uh straw mats.</span> <span id="s704">And we would figure out one straw mat for two people on the floor who had no pillows, no blankets, no nothing.</span> <span id="s705">Everything happened so fast; but people were crying.</span> <span id="s706">People were upset.</span> <span id="s707">"But I'm this, and I'm that, and everybody put me on the floor" - was painful.</span> <span id="s708">It was painful.</span> <span id="s709">I'll never forget; one day, uh a lady came.</span> <span id="s710">She...they all decided, most of them decided they were going to go to Yokohama, to the American consul; because the American consul in Kobe was not a very sympathetic man.</span> <span id="s711">They they had their own...</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Who was the American Consul?</span> <span id="s713">A: He was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: And he just died recently--Dr.... Uh, I forgot his name.</span> <span id="s716">Q: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: I'll think of it.</span> <span id="s718">Anyway, so they used to go to Yokohama.</span> <span id="s719">Yokohama was about overnight trip by train.</span> <span id="s720">They needed money to go on the train.</span> <span id="s721">Where did they get the money to go?</span> <span id="s722">So I remember... I forget, I was...I was in the office; and a lady comes in with a child in her hands.</span> <span id="s723">She said, "I need money to go to Yokohama.”</span> <span id="s724">I said, "We...the community does not have money for that purpose.</span> <span id="s725">The money we get from the Joint Distribution is for food, for clothing, for rent.</span> <span id="s726">For necessities, but not for travelling purposes.”</span> <span id="s727">"OK," she says.</span> <span id="s728">She had a bracelet.</span> <span id="s729">She says, "Here.</span> <span id="s730">Take this.”</span> <span id="s731">I said...uh, I forgot her name...I said, "This is not a pawn shop, madame.</span> <span id="s732">This is a Jewish community.</span> <span id="s733">I am sorry.”</span> <span id="s734">"Take my child.”</span> <span id="s735">You know, it was painful.</span> <span id="s736">And I..</span> <span id="s737">.</span> <span id="s738">I..</span> <span id="s739">.</span> <span id="s740">I..</span> <span id="s741">.</span> <span id="s742">As young as I was, I only could cry at what's going on.</span> <span id="s743">So what does one do?</span> <span id="s744">I said, "How much is the ticket?"</span> <span id="s745">That was, that remained in my mind for all these years.</span> <span id="s746">I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s747">Few from Czechoslovakia, I think.</span> <span id="s748">Uh...well, anyway, one night - another story - there's so much to do.</span> <span id="s749">It's hard to tell your problems, religious problems.</span> <span id="s750">And they would come to me, because I spoke Yiddish and because they thought I was more sympathetic, to uh uh... I have to tell you this story.</span> <span id="s751">It's a very interesting one.</span> <span id="s752">Uh, three months before Passover, uh a delegation of rabbis--six... You know, they were very well organized, by the way, I must tell you.</span> <span id="s753">Everyone.</span> <span id="s754">Not only the religious uh groups.</span> <span id="s755">The religious groups organized the Yeshivas and the ceremonies.</span> <span id="s756">But there were engineers.</span> <span id="s757">There were doctors.</span> <span id="s758">There were uh a couple of fellows working in...in...in Poland in mines, mine workers, whatever.</span> <span id="s759">They were organized in groups.</span> <span id="s760">Journalists.</span> <span id="s761">And...and it was good, because if they would come to talk about some problems they wouldn't come all at once.</span> <span id="s762">They would send their representatives, and we would handle it in...in that way.</span> <span id="s763">So here comes six rabbis.</span> <span id="s764">And I said, "Yes?"</span> <span id="s765">"Passover is coming, Herr Hanin.”</span> <span id="s766">"Yes, Passover.”</span> <span id="s767">"Was er zein...What will be with Matzahs, etc.?"</span> <span id="s768">"Well, we'll do the same thing like with us.</span> <span id="s769">We're a small Jewish community.</span> <span id="s770">We get our matzahs from the Jewish communities in Harbin, in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s771">They're baking matzahs.”</span> <span id="s772">"Those matzahs are not kosher for us.</span> <span id="s773">We must get matzahs from America.”</span> <span id="s774">"America?</span> <span id="s775">So what do you want with me?"</span> <span id="s776">"You must send a telegram.</span> <span id="s777">Here is the address.</span> <span id="s778">The organization of the rabbis in New York.</span> <span id="s779">Tell them there are eight hundred Jews here that need matzahs.”</span> <span id="s780">"Unh uh.</span> <span id="s781">There are three thousand Jews that need matzahs.”</span> <span id="s782">"Oh, yes, yes, yes.”</span> <span id="s783">Right away, I said, "There are three thousand and thirty.</span> <span id="s784">We are also Jews, if you're going to get matzahs.”</span> <span id="s785">So I sent a telegram.</span> <span id="s786">And uh about eight or ten weeks later, documents arrived at the community, addressed to me.</span> <span id="s787">Shipping documents.</span> <span id="s788">On a ship, matzahs.</span> <span id="s789">Wine, caskets of wine.</span> <span id="s790">Chocolate.</span> <span id="s791">Manischewitz.</span> <span id="s792">You know, stuff, everything is coming.</span> <span id="s793">Beautiful.</span> <span id="s794">But that was three days before Passover the ship is arriving.</span> <span id="s795">We're in a hurry to get them cleared through the customs and get a permit, because imports to Japan was not allowed.</span> <span id="s796">You had to get a license.</span> <span id="s797">And we...I never thought we would get these things.</span> <span id="s798">So now...I never even thought of applying for a license, and here are the documents.</span> <span id="s799">So I run to the customs person, or the Bank of Japan - I don't remember where.</span> <span id="s800">Anyways, "Here.</span> <span id="s801">The shipment is coming in on such and such and such a boat in three days.</span> <span id="s802">A Jewish holiday, Passover, is coming; and we got matzahs.”</span> <span id="s803">"What's matzahs?"</span> <span id="s804">I said, "Look, Jews are not allowed to eat any ordinary food.</span> <span id="s805">They can only eat this special food which American communities, Jewish communities are sending for our people here.”</span> <span id="s806">"This is not for resale?"</span> <span id="s807">I said, "No, of course not.</span> <span id="s808">It is for us.”</span> <span id="s809">"OK.</span> <span id="s810">Write a letter saying that you guarantee from the Jewish community that these food products are for distribution among the refugees and not for resale.”</span> <span id="s811">So I wrote the letter.</span> <span id="s812">We got a permit right away.</span> <span id="s813">Now, another problem.</span> <span id="s814">Two rabbis come in, and they said, "We have a big problem.”</span> <span id="s815">"What's the big problem?"</span> <span id="s816">"According to the orthodox, strict orthodox law, if a non-Jew touches the wine, it's not kosher.</span> <span id="s817">We can't...

I don't know if it will be with the next generation, but with us it will.</span> <span id="s882">Actually, it was not witnessing it; because, luckily, we were not there.</span> <span id="s883">We were in another part of the world.</span> <span id="s884">But it touched us.</span> <span id="s885">And uh a friend of mine, Brandt was his name, he was among the refugees.</span> <span id="s886">He came.</span> <span id="s887">He lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s888">He came here for a visit.</span> <span id="s889">It was about ten years ago.</span> <span id="s890">And uh he called me up.</span> <span id="s891">And uh I kept in contact with some of them.</span> <span id="s892">We became really friends, and some of them worked for the community.</span> <span id="s893">We...we had, those...those that spoke English.</span> <span id="s894">Some of them spoke good English.</span> <span id="s895">One of them became uh uh speaker of the Knesset, yes.</span> <span id="s896">Uh, Menachem Savidor.</span> <span id="s897">His name was Hodorowski.</span> <span id="s898">He just died last year in Israel.</span> <span id="s899">Anyway, uh so Brandt came in.</span> <span id="s900">And we...we went to a Chinese restaurant and we were sitting and talking.</span> <span id="s901">And he says--oh, he was always...

One story I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s1012">We were...uh, we put him up.</span> <span id="s1013">He had a big large family.</span> <span id="s1014">And, you know, the...the rabbis of small cities, they had their own entourage.</span> <span id="s1015">The shammos, people who assist them, to help them; and he had a whole group of about twenty of them.</span> <span id="s1016">So we...we...we were lucky to hire, to rent a home in the mountains somewhere, which is about half an hour by train from Kobe.</span> <span id="s1017">We set him up there.</span> <span id="s1018">We had a lot of respect for him.</span> <span id="s1019">He was going to be there.</span> <span id="s1020">We'll supply with the food, and everything will be alright.</span> <span id="s1021">And we had meetings every night of the community, of the committee.</span> <span id="s1022">Too many problems were coming up, decisions, money problems, etc. etc.</span> <span id="s1023">And one night we were sitting in the meeting, and suddenly they come in and they call me.</span> <span id="s1024">And they said, "The rabbi is here, and wants to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s1025">Ten o'clock at night, which was very unusual.</span> <span id="s1026">I got worried maybe he's sick, or something.</span> <span id="s1027">I run out, and he sits there.</span> <span id="s1028">He used to call me Leibl, in Polish pronunciation "Leib.”</span> <span id="s1029">"Leo...Leibl.”</span> <span id="s1030">"What happened?"</span> <span id="s1031">He says, "I came here to ask you a question.”</span> <span id="s1032">I said, "What is the question?</span> <span id="s1033">Ask.”</span> <span id="s1034">"We are Polish citizens.”</span> <span id="s1035">"Yes, yes.”</span> <span id="s1036">"We are allied with the British.”</span> <span id="s1037">"Yes.”</span> <span id="s1038">"We are at war.</span> <span id="s1039">They are at war.</span> <span id="s1040">What would have happened if instead of three thousand Polish Jews they would have been English people?</span> <span id="s1041">What would have happened?"</span> <span id="s1042">So one of my...one of my uh co-workers, Dr. Moiseef - he also came out with me - he was uh... He says, "Well, if you were British, the British would have sent a ship after you and would have taken you out from here to one of the British colonies.”</span> <span id="s1043">At that time it was India.</span> <span id="s1044">It was Australia.</span> <span id="s1045">It was Canada.</span> <span id="s1046">They were all British colonies, at that time.</span> <span id="s1047">He says, "That's the whole point.</span> <span id="s1048">We must insist that they should send a ship after us.</span> <span id="s1049">Ships.</span> <span id="s1050">And take us out of here.</span> <span id="s1051">We are their allies.”</span> <span id="s1052">"So...so what do you want from me?"</span> <span id="s1053">"You, Leibl, you will go with me to the Consul tomorrow and translate and request for ships.”</span> <span id="s1054">I said, "Rabbi, you read the papers, don't you?"</span> <span id="s1055">He said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1056">That was during the time when the British had to retreat from the uh from... What's that French port?</span> <span id="s1057">Do you remember they were bombed out, like very, very severely?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1059">I don't quite remember but I know what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Uh, I said, "I don't think... Even if they wanted to do it, they have no ships.</span> <span id="s1061">Now is war.”</span> <span id="s1062">He says, "Never mind.</span> <span id="s1063">You go with me and you will translate.”</span> <span id="s1064">So, next day I called up the British Consul.</span> <span id="s1065">I..</span> <span id="s1066">.</span> <span id="s1067">I..</span> <span id="s1068">.</span> <span id="s1069">I met him a couple of times, because of this situation with the young fellows who volunteered for the British army.</span> <span id="s1070">And, uh, I said, "Look, I am going to bring a rabbi who is - I don't know if you ever saw uh these people who are still are in the 17th, 18th century, with the way they are dressed, the way they are wearing with the beards and with the fur hats.”</span> <span id="s1071">It's August.</span> <span id="s1072">It was hot.</span> <span id="s1073">I said, uh, "I..</span> <span id="s1074">.</span> <span id="s1075">I'd like you to meet him.”</span> <span id="s1076">He says, "Fine.</span> <span id="s1077">What time will he come?</span> <span id="s1078">Just call me, and I will...I will escort him myself.”</span> <span id="s1079">So I called him before, he came to my office.</span> <span id="s1080">We took a taxi.</span> <span id="s1081">We went there.</span> <span id="s1082">I called him.</span> <span id="s1083">I called the Consul.</span> <span id="s1084">He came down.</span> <span id="s1085">The Consulate was on the sixth floor.</span> <span id="s1086">He came down.</span> <span id="s1087">He met him.</span> <span id="s1088">Was very very... You know, we always thought the British were so uh high-falutin'--a consul and all that.</span> <span id="s1089">We went upstairs.</span> <span id="s1090">"Yes.</span> <span id="s1091">What can I do for you, Rabbi?"</span> <span id="s1092">So I told him, the rabbi, "He wants to know what's the purpose of your visit.”</span> <span id="s1093">Well, he repeated the whole story about being allies with with the British and a Polish citizen, etc.</span> <span id="s1094">So the guy was smoking his pipe.</span> <span id="s1095">He said, "Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1096">That's a very reasonable request.</span> <span id="s1097">I will have to transmit it to the to His Majesty's Ambassador.”</span> <span id="s1098">At that time, it was King George the VI in England; in Tokyo, his [Ambassador's] name was Robert [Granger (ph)], I believe.</span> <span id="s1099">"And uh you will hear from him, hopefully.”</span> <span id="s1100">You heard; and the rabbi was satisfied, and everybody.</span> <span id="s1101">That was the story of the rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">11 NB: Dunquerque?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: That's a lovely story.</span> <span id="s1104">This is also again in 1940, before '41, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Oh, of course.</span> <span id="s1106">It was 1941, I believe.</span> <span id="s1107">Yes.</span> <span id="s1108">By the way, I have to tell you a point, very interesting.</span> <span id="s1109">Uh so when we were talking to the rabbi the night before, I said, "Rabbi, supposing it's all right.</span> <span id="s1110">Supposing it works.</span> <span id="s1111">Who knows?</span> <span id="s1112">Where would you want to go?</span> <span id="s1113">There's so many British colonies.”</span> <span id="s1114">He says to me, "Jamaica.”</span> <span id="s1115">I said, "Rabbi...” Frankly, I didn't even know where Jamaica was, at that time.</span> <span id="s1116">I heard the name Jamaica, but I couldn't imagine in my mind on the map where it was.</span> <span id="s1117">He says, "For us, Jamaica.”</span> <span id="s1118">"Why not Australia?</span> <span id="s1119">Why not Canada?"</span> <span id="s1120">He says, "The climate is a good the climate, a very good climate.”</span> <span id="s1121">I went home.</span> <span id="s1122">I took...I had an atlas.</span> <span id="s1123">I said [to myself], "Jamaica is very close to New York.</span> <span id="s1124">And he thought if they'll get to Jamaica, it maybe would be easier for them to get to New York.”</span> <span id="s1125">He didn't want to say that, but I think that's what he had it in mind.</span> <span id="s1126">(Laughter) Anyhow...</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Show us your photographs, would you please?</span> <span id="s1128">You brought photographs with you and there's one that has particular, two that have particular...</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: I..</span> <span id="s1130">.</span> <span id="s1131">I..</span> <span id="s1132">.</span> <span id="s1133">In my mind, this particular photograph is very very ...uh I'd like to call it historical because the whole episode is historical.</span> <span id="s1134">Historical . . .

This gentlemen here was representative of Japanese government.</span> <span id="s1148">Anyway to make a long story short, he told Mr. Ponve, "You are going to America.</span> <span id="s1149">We want you to tell the American Jews over there, who are your brothers, how good the Japanese government is to your people here.</span> <span id="s1150">How we actually helped to save their lives.</span> <span id="s1151">How we allowed them to stay in Japan.</span> <span id="s1152">We gave them visas to come here.</span> <span id="s1153">And we want Jews in America to know about this, and you tell them about us.”</span> <span id="s1154">That, in my mind, was the the the basic thought of the Japanese--that the the people in America, the Jewish, our people in America are very very influential.</span> <span id="s1155">And they can influence the higher people in the government, and even the President Roosevelt himself, to help them with uh with uh arranging matters.</span> <span id="s1156">So that uh uh they will help them to settle the war in China.</span> <span id="s1157">The Japanese were getting deeper and deeper towards China, and they had no way of getting out of there.</span> <span id="s1158">And uh America has uh has uh prohibited the sale of metals and oil to them, started to put economic sanctions on them.</span> <span id="s1159">And they were having a much much harder time at that time.</span> <span id="s1160">So I feel that's the...that's the historical angle.</span> <span id="s1161">What they were aiming at.</span> <span id="s1162">It didn't work, because uh the Japanese were allies with Germany and they were occupying China;

and by the hundreds they left.</span> <span id="s1208">A few were still left, about six, you know, were left a little later.</span> <span id="s1209">But all eventually had to go.</span> <span id="s1210">And by the time Pearl Harbor...of Pearl Harbor, there were no more refugees left in Shanghai--in, uh, Kobe.</span> <span id="s1211">They were all in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1212">We stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: How did you stay, and what... Why did you stay, and what was it like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Well, I was...I had a job.</span> <span id="s1215">I was working there, and uh business was going on.</span> <span id="s1216">I mean, I was buying merchandise and shipping.</span> <span id="s1217">And uh when the war came uh, what do to?</span> <span id="s1218">I mean, I..</span> <span id="s1219">.</span> <span id="s1220">my home.</span> <span id="s1221">I had my wife, my child.</span> <span id="s1222">And uh stayed there, and uh you couldn't do any more business.</span> <span id="s1223">Everything was closed.</span> <span id="s1224">The war started.</span> <span id="s1225">My firm--which was a Panamanian firm-- a Panamanian consulate was closed, because Panama declared war on Japan.</span> <span id="s1226">So I was left without a job, without any money, without anything.</span> <span id="s1227">Without doing any business, I had to think of some way of continuing my livelihood.</span> <span id="s1228">So my family, my parents, were in Shanghai; and uh I knew there were a lot of Jewish communities in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1229">A lot of people.</span> <span id="s1230">Where they lived, they are making a living.</span> <span id="s1231">I will do it.</span> <span id="s1232">So... As a matter of fact, as far as I'm concerned, they came once.</span> <span id="s1233">And uh one of these fellows was a very mean mean.</span> <span id="s1234">He was a real...he was...he was, he grew up on Mein Kampf.</span> <span id="s1235">He used to always to talk to me about Mein Kampf, and he was very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s1236">As a matter of fact, one day he came and he spoke to me.</span> <span id="s1237">And he says, "Why...why is it the German people hate the Jews so much?"</span> <span id="s1238">And his name was Osakabe.</span> <span id="s1239">I said, "Mr. Osakabe, are you asking me this question as a policeman, or as a friend?"</span> <span id="s1240">"As a friend.”</span> <span id="s1241">I said, "Well, why are you talking to people who like Japanese?</span> <span id="s1242">You know, [there are] some people who don't like the Japanese too much.”</span> <span id="s1243">He jumped.</span> <span id="s1244">He said, "What do you mean?"</span> <span id="s1245">I said, "Now, don't get excited.</span> <span id="s1246">Don't get sore.</span> <span id="s1247">You're talking like a friend.</span> <span id="s1248">You're not talking to me like a policeman now.”</span> <span id="s1249">I said, "Is it true?"</span> <span id="s1250">He said, "Yeah, it's true.”</span> <span id="s1251">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1252">"Well, uh we are smart people.”</span> <span id="s1253">I said, "We are also smart people.”</span> <span id="s1254">Yeah, as young as I was.</span> <span id="s1255">Maybe it was stupid to say that, but I was very angry.</span> <span id="s1256">And then about a couple of weeks later, they came and they said, uh, "We want to ask you a question.”</span> <span id="s1257">"Yes.”</span> <span id="s1258">There was another, he was a major in the Japanese Army.</span> <span id="s1259">"And don't tell me you have no answer.</span> <span id="s1260">You...we know you are intelligent young man.</span> <span id="s1261">You read books, etc. etc.” I said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s1262">What's your question?"</span> <span id="s1263">"Uh, who is going to win the war?"</span> <span id="s1264">I said, "I can't answer this question to you.”</span> <span id="s1265">"Well, you are not an American.</span> <span id="s1266">You're a stateless person.</span> <span id="s1267">Tell us the truth, what you think.”</span> <span id="s1268">I said, "I'll tell you in my own way.”</span> <span id="s1269">I said, "I don't want Germany to win the war.”</span> <span id="s1270">He said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1271">"Because I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s1272">And I know how Germany is treating the Jews.”</span> <span id="s1273">"Yeah, clever answer.</span> <span id="s1274">Uh, well, we recommend that you leave Japan.”</span> <span id="s1275">So the recommendation was taken, and I left.</span> <span id="s1276">Took my wife, my child, on the boat.</span> <span id="s1277">Was a dangerous journey, because by boat 48 hours, because American submarines we knew were around there.</span> <span id="s1278">But uh I'm here.</span> <span id="s1279">I made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: What happened when you got to Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: You know, when I got to Shanghai, uh Shanghai was an open market.</span> <span id="s1282">Uh a lot of Chinese people and there was a lot of merchandise that was there in the warehouse uh from before the war.</span> <span id="s1283">People would import.</span> <span id="s1284">And uh I was...I started to be like a salesman, selling textiles and here and there; and life was very very inexpensive.</span> <span id="s1285">For about thirty, forty dollars a month in US dollars, you could live well with food and with everything.</span> <span id="s1286">Was very very cheap.</span> <span id="s1287">So we managed, we lived...</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Did you get involved in the Jewish community in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: No, I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1290">I just couldn't.</span> <span id="s1291">It was...there was a lot of work to be done.</span> <span id="s1292">There were twenty thousand Jewish refugees, and besides the Polish Jews that came from Japan.</span> <span id="s1293">Uh it was handled very well.</span> <span id="s1294">They had committees organized by the Sephardic Jews, and by their own people; and they were handling it.</span> <span id="s1295">It was rough.</span> <span id="s1296">The representatives of Joint were there, and uh uh they did a little work.</span> <span id="s1297">We didn't have to get homes for them.</span> <span id="s1298">Uh, it was a lot of difficulties because in in 1943 I believe it was, the Japanese--under the pressure of the Germans--have uh...have put the Jews that came to Shanghai after 1937, put them in the ghettos, in specified areas which was terrible difficult conditions.</span> <span id="s1299">We were not subject to that law, because we came to Shanghai before 1937.</span> <span id="s1300">It was only those that came after 1937.</span> <span id="s1301">They were smart.</span> <span id="s1302">They didn't say German Jews or Polish Jews or Austrian Jews that were kicked out by the Germans or that fled from Germany and Poland as Jews.</span> <span id="s1303">They said those that came after '37, which was understood.</span> <span id="s1304">That was those applied to the German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Uh, I'm confused.</span> <span id="s1306">You said that you, that when you came from Kobe it was after '41 and the war had started . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Yes, I came in February of 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: But you then just said that you were not put into the ghetto uh because you came before '37.</span> <span id="s1309">And, of course, that's not true, but... You mean because you were in, under Japanese control before '37?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: No.</span> <span id="s1311">The...the, after 1941, the Japanese took over Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1312">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: You know, Shanghai had different concessions.</span> <span id="s1314">It had the British Concession, the French Concession.</span> <span id="s1315">And the...and the people that had taken those concessions not, except those that were stateless people, but under the protection of the consulates.</span> <span id="s1316">We, the stateless people, were again under the the Chinese people that were, they they were in charge of our situation.</span> <span id="s1317">See, and we had a Jewish community which was working together with the Chinese.</span> <span id="s1318">And uh, when the proclamations came out, it applied to the Jews that came to China after 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: To all of China, and that included Kobe as part of that...China under Japanese control...</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: They came to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1321">They were in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1322">Those who came to Shanghai after '37.</span> <span id="s1323">Q: So what did you do?</span> <span id="s1324">You were outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1325">How did you live during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: As I told you, we were doing, buying and selling and .</span> <span id="s1327">My father, as a matter of fact, had a uh a wholesale business in textiles.</span> <span id="s1328">And I was helping him and uh making a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Can you describe - the two communities were very different.</span> <span id="s1330">A: Which two communities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: In the ghetto and outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1332">Can you describe, can you explain some of the differences to us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Well, the...the...the Jewish people that were put in the ghettos were confined.</span> <span id="s1334">They had no no rights.</span> <span id="s1335">They had to get a permit to get out of there to come and conduct their business and go to their jobs.</span> <span id="s1336">See, we were free to move where ever we wanted to.</span> <span id="s1337">We didn't...in Shanghai that is.</span> <span id="s1338">We didn't have to have any uh special permits to do that; and uh they lived in in the heims, which was the...they lived in the very best situation.</span> <span id="s1339">They were taken care of by, money was being uh, funds were coming from America through Switzerland, through Sweden.</span> <span id="s1340">Things were being - I don't know exactly how it was done but they were, they were in a very bad situation.</span> <span id="s1341">Very very difficult situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: What happened to you and for you when the war ended?</span> <span id="s1343">A: When the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Uh, when the war ended a big market opened up.</span> <span id="s1346">China was a big market.</span> <span id="s1347">And uh and I got my, I established my contacts with my friends that I used to work for in Japan.</span> <span id="s1348">The same people that I told you about--Max Pecker.</span> <span id="s1349">And he was in New York at that time.</span> <span id="s1350">Luckily, I sent him a telegram and he started sending merchandise to me.</span> <span id="s1351">And I was doing very well from 1947, 1948.</span> <span id="s1352">I was doing good business.</span> <span id="s1353">But then the Communists started advancing, and uh we knew we had to leave.</span> <span id="s1354">So uh the Israeli government--at that time the State of Israel was established in 1948--they sent a representative, and they they registered us.</span> <span id="s1355">And 800 of us registered together, and they sent a ship for us and took us out.</span> <span id="s1356">And they took us to uh, afterwards more people left.</span> <span id="s1357">Some went to Harbin, went to Hong Kong.</span> <span id="s1358">They sent ships after them to Hong Kong.</span> <span id="s1359">Then they organized even planes.</span> <span id="s1360">They had B-29's that were flying uh refugees to Israel.</span> <span id="s1361">So uh, when we went from uh Shanghai to Israel in 1948, in December of 1948, there were 800 of us on a ship that could take only 600 or so.</span> <span id="s1362">It was a crowded ship.</span> <span id="s1363">It wasn't as bad as the Exodus, that we saw in the movies, but it was tough.</span> <span id="s1364">And we had to go 54 days to travel, because the Suez Canal was closed.</span> <span id="s1365">Uh, there was war with Egypt.</span> <span id="s1366">We had to go to Singapore, from Singapore to South Africa, around the Cape to Italy.</span> <span id="s1367">And in Italy we got off that ship and the Israeli government sent a ship after us and we went to Haifa.</span> <span id="s1368">Fifty-four days it took.</span> <span id="s1369">It was a rough journey.</span> <span id="s1370">It was something.</span> <span id="s1371">One day, if I ever write a book about it, it's...it's a very unusual trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Do you want to tell us a story from that trip?</span> <span id="s1373">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Tell us a story from that trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: We were coming from Singapore.</span> <span id="s1376">It was what nine days.</span> <span id="s1377">The weather was rough.</span> <span id="s1378">Some of our people organized themselves in a group that was sending things on the ship because we had about uh out of eight hundred and sixty people we had about eighty or a hundred very orthodox Jews, who wouldn't eat anything.</span> <span id="s1379">And they were just just drinking tea and...and bread; because it was not kosher you know.</span> <span id="s1380">I mean to say, who could think about kosher on a refugee ship?</span> <span id="s1381">So uh the committee got together and decided - there's a Jewish community in Singapore - they knew them.</span> <span id="s1382">Sephardic Jews.</span> <span id="s1383">Send them a telegram and uh telling we are on our way to Israel, Jewish refugees on the way to Israel, to the new State of Israel.</span> <span id="s1384">And we have people who need kosher food.</span> <span id="s1385">Will they be able to help us?</span> <span id="s1386">They sent it to them.</span> <span id="s1387">As we arrived in Singapore, I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s1388">I was on the deck; and uh we were not allowed, the ships were not allowed to berth because the British--it was British at that time still, you know, before Singapore became independent--and uh we had to drop anchor somewhere far away because, I don't know, to to to get some more uh whatever they needed to run the ship, oil or whatever.</span> <span id="s1389">And uh uh I was walking on the deck; and suddenly I see a Chinese junk, a large Chinese junk, sailing toward the ship.</span> <span id="s1390">I had the binoculars.</span> <span id="s1391">I looked.</span> <span id="s1392">And there was a uh darkish man with a beard and a beret, look like a Sephardic Jew.</span> <span id="s1393">And uh old junk, Chinese junk, coming towards the ship.</span> <span id="s1394">I said, uh, "Who are you?"</span> <span id="s1395">He says, "I am from the Jewish community.”</span> <span id="s1396">He says, "You need kosher food?"</span> <span id="s1397">I said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s1398">I said, uh, "Good.</span> <span id="s1399">What do you think (ph).”</span> <span id="s1400">He says uh, there were about two hundred baskets with live chickens, live chickens.</span> <span id="s1401">When we talk about kosher food, we thought--I don't know--sausage and cheese.</span> <span id="s1402">I said, "Don't you have anything else?"</span> <span id="s1403">He says, "Look, we are a small Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1404">Climate is very hot here.</span> <span id="s1405">We don't have sausages or cheese.</span> <span id="s1406">There are chickens.</span> <span id="s1407">You can have somebody to make them kosher, and then they will make soup and whatever they need.”</span> <span id="s1408">"OK.”</span> <span id="s1409">So we got those baskets and brought on the ship; and then our people called the representatives of the religious group - there were some rabbis among them - some people who knew how to...to...to cut the chickens.</span> <span id="s1410">Said, "Look, we got about a few hundred chickens.</span> <span id="s1411">Organize yourselves and get them all...cut them in the proper way.</span> <span id="s1412">Then cook them, and that will be your food for the next couple of weeks.”</span> <span id="s1413">"OK.”</span> <span id="s1414">We can, what do you want now.</span> <span id="s1415">I don't know how they organized.</span> <span id="s1416">It was like a conveyor rail line.</span> <span id="s1417">There was men on this side.</span> <span id="s1418">Three of them were cutting.</span> <span id="s1419">Then they were sending them down.</span> <span id="s1420">And, you know, according to the Jewish law you're not allowed to scald the chickens.</span> <span id="s1421">You had to flick them.</span> <span id="s1422">You see, at the end, there were six women or so; and they were flicking them.</span> <span id="s1423">And...and then the ship...at six o'clock in the evening, the ship was on its way with our next stop South Africa.</span> <span id="s1424">And all of a sudden, all these feathers started going up in the air, into the funnel of the ship.</span> <span id="s1425">(Laughter) Where the classy (ph) captain - was a Greek captain - he took a uh one of those megaphones, and he said, "I give you ten minutes to get that stuff cleaned up, or I'll send my people with the hose--water hoses--and everything will go overboard.”</span> <span id="s1426">So somebody ran to him, and explained to him what it was.</span> <span id="s1427">He said OK, I'll give you a half an hour.</span> <span id="s1428">Within a half an hour everything was OK, and they had food.</span> <span id="s1429">(Laughter) But then comes South Africa.</span> <span id="s1430">South Africa was marvelous.</span> <span id="s1431">The Jews in South Africa--the most remarkable, hospitable, fine, heart-warming, wonderful people.</span> <span id="s1432">We sent them a telegram, also.</span> <span id="s1433">On the way to Israel.</span> <span id="s1434">"We have children.</span> <span id="s1435">We have old people, this and that.”</span> <span id="s1436">And about five o'clock in the morning, Capetown is a beautiful city.</span> <span id="s1437">It's just like Honolulu with the mountains.</span> <span id="s1438">Gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1439">So uh, I had three children, we had three children then.</span> <span id="s1440">Two of my youngest children - one of them was one year old, then he was one year old - and I was allowed by the captain to go to my wife's - the children were in the women's section - men were in another place.</span> <span id="s1441">I was allowed to go and take.</span> <span id="s1442">Because my wife was very sick on this ship - she couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s1443">For 21 days, she couldn't lift her head.</span> <span id="s1444">Was rough.</span> <span id="s1445">Anyway, so I was allowed to take - for a man to go into the women's section and take the children out.</span> <span id="s1446">And I would take the...you know, little boy out; and he had a little carriage tied up on the deck.</span> <span id="s1447">So put him in the carriage, you know.</span> <span id="s1448">And as I was strolling him on the deck, we arrived in Capetown.</span> <span id="s1449">It was still dark in the morning.</span> <span id="s1450">I said, "Well, they must be working people.</span> <span id="s1451">You know, come to work at the docks.”</span> <span id="s1452">They came closer.</span> <span id="s1453">Jewish flags - hundreds of Jews - it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1454">I said it's you know it's so loud.</span> <span id="s1455">And then started - we weren't allowed to go on shore.</span> <span id="s1456">"What do you need?"</span> <span id="s1457">And...and from eight in the morning until six in the afternoon, until we left, there were trucks and trucks and trucks bringing stuff - toys, food, magazines, medicines, potatoes, uh canned stuff, chocolates, anything.</span> <span id="s1458">And uh it was all taken out.</span> <span id="s1459">It was, it was remarkable.</span> <span id="s1460">I'll never forget it as long as I live.</span> <span id="s1461">As a matter of fact, about eight years ago I had to on business in South Africa.</span> <span id="s1462">And I went to the newspaper uh that covered this arrival, this ship; and there were pictures and so forth, and I told them that I was on that ship.</span> <span id="s1463">They dug out from their files what happened uh thirty years ago, and they found it.</span> <span id="s1464">And I said, "Look, I am not uh... Nobody has given me the authority, but please accept our thanks, from all of us I'm sure, for what you've done for us.”</span> <span id="s1465">Lovely people.</span> <span id="s1466">So that's...that's...that's the Coast of Victory, was the name of the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Alright, Mr. Hanin.</span> <span id="s1468">Is there anything that you want to add?</span> <span id="s1469">Anything that you want to...any story that you want to tell that you haven't told, anything that you want to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Well, what shall I add?</span> <span id="s1471">There are many other things that happened.</span> <span id="s1472">Some of them were not so very pleasant that I would rather not talk about it.</span> <span id="s1473">Because uh there were accusations that the Jewish community of Kobe stole money.</span> <span id="s1474">Uh, it was painful because we gave our hearts, we gave our our efforts, we gave everything we had to help.</span> <span id="s1475">But some people... You know, you always have that kind of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Can you tell us a little about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: It was just rumors.</span> <span id="s1478">They would never come and and openly tell us.</span> <span id="s1479">I was always going and talking to them.</span> <span id="s1480">But then when the time came for them to go to Shanghai, when we got orders that everybody has to go to Shanghai, there was always very painful, who goes first.</span> <span id="s1481">Nobody wants to go.</span> <span id="s1482">Everybody, someone is waiting with visas to go to South America; or, you know, they were applying for visas to go.</span> <span id="s1483">of the world.</span> <span id="s1484">Brazil, Argentina.</span> <span id="s1485">And uh also the...the unpleasant thing that I found, one of the things, was that the missionaries took advantage of some of the people.</span> <span id="s1486">They came and they spread the words; and some of the people, they promised them visas if they would convert to Christianity.</span> <span id="s1487">Uh, and some did.</span> <span id="s1488">Uh I saw...I saw them going to the church, and it's none of my business.</span> <span id="s1489">People do what they want to do.</span> <span id="s1490">Until one day, I came to the community.</span> <span id="s1491">And there was a man with a bible in his hand, an American missionary, preaching from the bible.</span> <span id="s1492">I said--uh, in what language he spoke, German, I think--I said, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s1493">He says, "Well, I can do what I want.”</span> <span id="s1494">I said, "Look, you have taken advantage of people who are uh uh desperate, who need visas, who are... who are run away from a terrible war.</span> <span id="s1495">I don't think it's the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s1496">You want them to," I said, "come to church or whatever.</span> <span id="s1497">They want to go, I cannot stop them.</span> <span id="s1498">But you cannot come to our Jewish community here and...and preach the bible.</span> <span id="s1499">I don't think it's the right way to do it.”</span> <span id="s1500">He agreed with me.</span> <span id="s1501">He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s1502">Came to my house and we had a long talk.</span> <span id="s1503">But then, you know, when all of them went to Shanghai, uh remarkable, remarkable people how they could adapt themselves with the Polish group.</span> <span id="s1504">The German did also.</span> <span id="s1505">They adapted themselves.</span> <span id="s1506">They had newspapers.</span> <span id="s1507">They had sports activities.</span> <span id="s1508">They had Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s1509">They had uh rabbinical seminaries.</span> <span id="s1510">They had - I used to go to their lectures.</span> <span id="s1511">They had musicians.</span> <span id="s1512">They had theaters.</span> <span id="s1513">They had cafes.</span> <span id="s1514">Uh, some people suffered, but others adapted themselves.</span> <span id="s1515">And this is one thing I will always say about...I can't speak for other people but I am talking about our people.</span> <span id="s1516">We could adapt ourselves.</span> <span id="s1517">They find a way, and uh life went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1519">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: I'm glad I was able to share some of my experiences.</span> <span id="s1521">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1522">You've been very helpful.</span></p></body></html>
