year?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">AG: June 28, 1907.</span> <span id="s7">I had at that time a father and mother, two sisters and a brother.</span> <span id="s8">We were born, educated schools, and

killed him.</span> <span id="s14">He didnÕt survive.</span> <span id="s15">A few months being in the service.</span> <span id="s16">And I was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">ES: What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">AG: I told you before in the report I was in the spinning industry, partial into spinning and partial administration and I was the treasurer.</span> <span id="s19">Our way of doing business at that time in Europe was different than nowadays in the United States.</span> <span id="s20">So these two functions I had, and later on you will find out why I mentioned it because I was partially for a time in the spinning industry after the war and then I got involved in administration and [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s21">ES: After you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">AG: Right.</span> <span id="s23">Of course I had to redo my way of thinking and way of doing of business.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">ES: What was your life like before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">AG: We were not rich people but well to do.</span> <span id="s26">We had a nice apartment, standard in Poland, very nice apartment.</span> <span id="s27">I had a villa in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">ES: Your own or with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">AG: It was with my father, combination, it was the family; it wasnÕt my use, it was the family.</span> <span id="s30">I had quite a nice salary so I put in with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">ES: Did your family experience any anti-Semitism before the Hitler period?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">AG: In comparison to anti-Semitism which we experienced during the war, it was nothing.</span> <span id="s33">I was born and raised among Polish, German and Jews.</span> <span id="s34">As a matter of fact, I have good friends, German boys, good friends in Poland.</span> <span id="s35">We didnÕt have it to this extent, but later on I will tell you an instance what I experienced with the workers in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">ES: Did you or your family belong to any Jewish organizations or to a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">AG:

id="s49">AG: I was working in this bit outfit and I had a nice...</span></p> <p><span id="s50">ES: Life was good for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">AG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">ES: You had been married already and you had a child.</span> <span id="s53">You said you lived in Lodz and there were a great many Jews in Lodz at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">AG: Right, close to about 400,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">ES: Was there a Kehillah?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">ES: How did your family view this Kehillah?</span> <span id="s57">Did you feel it represented your best

id="s60">AG: I wasnÕt home.</span> <span id="s61">In 1939 there was such a mishmash in the Polish, you know, administration.</span> <span id="s62">They lost their heads.</span> <span id="s63">I was in the Reserves.</span> <span id="s64">After my duty, 18 months, every year I went for maneuvers.</span> <span id="s65">When the war broke out, they didnÕt mobilize me because everybody got their individual call to get in, but on the radio, September 1, 1939, they told all of the reserves to go to their regiments.</span> <span id="s66">I left my wife, mother, two sisters, and I left a little baby, and joined.</span> <span id="s67">I left Lodz to look for the regiment which I never found.</span> <span id="s68">I came to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">ES: What did you do after you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">AG: We were fighting the Germans.</span> <span id="s71">It was three weeks artillery bombardment, air raids and so forth.</span> <span id="s72">How I survived, like many others I donÕt know, itÕs a miracle.</span> <span id="s73">And then when we surrendered the Germans took us in prison.</span> <span id="s74">They marched us about 25 miles south of Warsaw and there was a war prisoner camp.</span> <span id="s75">In reference to anti-Semitism with the Polish people, they caught on fast enough to get after the Jews.</span> <span id="s76">In my case a Polack went to the Germans, pointed out to me and said, ÒThis is a Jew.Ó ThatÕs how they acted, the Polish.</span> <span id="s77">And then they kept us there for a few weeks and told us to go back.</span> <span id="s78">They opened the gates and said, ÒGo.Ó And we went home; I went back to Lodz.</span> <span id="s79">My wife had a nervous breakdown, my mother had a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s80">Because they didnÕt hear from us or anything and the news where they had bombarded Warsaw and so many killed people.</span> <span id="s81">Anyway I survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">AG: Yeah.</span> <span id="s83">And then the life, there was no work.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">ES: Did you receive any help from any non-Jews during this period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">AG: We lived with the non-Jews.</span> <span id="s86">We didnÕt actually need any help, because we had some money and what we could buy, we bought, until they put us in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s87">The one time I remember, my wife told you before, the Germans came and took furniture, paintings, the dog.</span> <span id="s88">They came to me too.</span> <span id="s89">They came up and took the pictures, the paintings, and took an expensive radio; at the time there were no televisions, and I spoke a fairly good German and I was sort of arguing with him.</span> <span id="s90">I told him itÕs better to die than have such a life.</span> <span id="s91">So he pulled out his gun and was giving it to me saying, ÒKill your people.Ó I had a big temptation to grab the gun and kill him but I looked at my family, I knew I am not going to kill him.</span> <span id="s92">Killing him, IÕll kill them.</span> <span id="s93">We couldnÕt at that time anticipate the atrocities and the killings and the ovens.</span> <span id="s94">So I didnÕt kill him; I was one of the sharp-shooters in the army and I could have killed him, but I didnÕt.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">ES: Nobody could perceive what was going to happen then?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">AG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">ES: When the ghetto was closed, your family went together; when was that, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">ES: Had your family lived outside the ghetto and had to move inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">AG: Yes, the ghetto was in the slums and we lived in a nice, prosperous neighbor hood.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">ES: What was life like in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">AG: You could hardly call it life, because we were squeezed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">ES: Tell me how many people were in the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">AG: Six, seven people in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">AG: And then my sister and her husband and their child and my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">ES: Were you able to do any kind of work, or nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">AG: In the beginning no, but later on because we were foolish enough to think that this wouldnÕt last too longÑfor some reason or anotherÑso I wasnÕt too much concerned to get a job; later on I got a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">ES: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">AG: I was the head cashier in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s109">They set up stores for food and rations and so forth.</span> <span id="s110">There were about 25 stores I think and they all brought the money into my office.</span> <span id="s111">I was the head cashier.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">ES: Who ran the stores; did the Jews run the stores?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">ES: And you handled the money so you were involved in the financial end.</span> <span id="s114">How long were you able to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">AG: Till the last day of August, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">AG: My wife was a nurse working with my present wife, Alexandra; they were friends before the war.</span> <span id="s117">They graduated nursing school.</span> <span id="s118">So we were both in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s119">I took sick from the dirty money and Alexandra, my present wife, came to this hospital and sort of worked on my being alive now.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">ES: Looked after you.</span> <span id="s121">Explain why your wife then could not help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">AG: Quarantine.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">ES: Why was she quarantined?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">AG: Typhoid fever.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">ES: Did she have typhoid fever or

quarantine.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">AG: I was in hospital and she was in quarantine.</span> <span id="s130">The whole house.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">ES: O.K., so she could not come.</span> <span id="s132">But your present wife was a nurse and she came and looked after you.</span> <span id="s133">During the time that you were in the ghetto, did you have any contact at all with anyone outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">AG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">ES: Did you hear any news in any way about anything that was going on outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">AG: Yes, we had a radio.</span> <span id="s137">ItÕs a part of my wifeÕs brother, which he was caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">AG: We had the news and we made out, sort of meetings, and told other people what is going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">ES: So you secretly listened to the radio.</span> <span id="s140">What were you hearing, BBC?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">AG: BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">ES: And then you passed on information to other people in the ghetto and nat urally you knew, if you were caught with the radio, like your wifeÕs brother was...</span></p> <p><span id="s143">AG: I didnÕt know it at the time what happened to my wifeÕs brother.</span> <span id="s144">He was killed because you know he took so many people out of the ghetto, among others my wifeÕs brother, that I didnÕt know think this was the reason but they had theirs and we had ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">ES: Were you able to keep your radio until the ghetto was liquidated?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">AG: No, just for a short while and they were after the people who had the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">ES: They confiscated it.</span> <span id="s148">How would you describe the Judenrat in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">AG: Actually they called it the Jewish King.</span> <span id="s150">Now this guy had I donÕt know how to describe him.</span> <span id="s151">He sort of thought that he is real, you know, owner of our lives the way he didÑlike a king, like a dictator.</span> <span id="s152">No one dared to criticize him.</span> <span id="s153">And he did what the Germans told him plus his own crazy ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">ES: Was there a lot of favoritism played?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">AG:

id="s157">AG: Yes, now as I told you they created the ghettos from the slums of the big city.</span> <span id="s158">[Lodz] was a big city of a million, three hundred thousand, so we were I donÕt know how to tell you this here.</span> <span id="s159">It was sort of a divided Jewish population between the slum people and the people who were a little better off.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">ES: Socially.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">AG: Socially.</span> <span id="s162">It wasnÕt our fault and it wasnÕt their fault that they were poor.</span> <span id="s163">It wasnÕt our fault that we were a little bit better off then them, but it was two different kinds of Jews.</span> <span id="s164">When we came into the ghetto they were happy, sort of, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s165">See you came to us, you ignored us.</span> <span id="s166">They had a chip on their shoulders like the colored people over here.</span> <span id="s167">They thought that we were against them, which we were not, and they took sort of a revenge that we came to their level.</span> <span id="s168">And then it smoothed out as time went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">ES: Were you aware of any kind of

<span id="s175">We didnÕt have any connection, even the name of the Lodz was changed to Litzmannstadt, a German name.</span> <span id="s176">So we were sur round ed by Germans, Polacks and we couldnÕt think of any resistance.</span> <span id="s177">Not in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">ES: To what extent did the Poles help the Nazis persecute the Jews while you were in the ghettos?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">AG: It would be our guess only because we didnÕt have any contact with them.</span> <span id="s180">They were probably glad that this is what happened to the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">ES: But you didnÕt have any contact with the Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">AG: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">ES: Were you aware of any Poles who

id="s223">AG: What happened was, I donÕt know how to describe it.</span> <span id="s224">The films they show you here with different sceneries and stuff like this, we couldnÕt comprehend, we couldnÕt understand what is going on.</span> <span id="s225">We were driven into the barracks.</span> <span id="s226">They gave us some pots and this will be for your soup.</span> <span id="s227">No spoon, nothing.</span> <span id="s228">They gave us a half a loaf of bread for two days and you know, in the mornings the Appell, at 4:00, what you call it in English, counting.</span> <span id="s229">They kept us here.</span> <span id="s230">I remember when I got to the showers, it was different; the showers into the female portion were with gas.</span> <span id="s231">Our showers were water, thank God.</span> <span id="s232">I was so thirsty that I run to a spigot.</span> <span id="s233">I wanted to have a few sips of water.</span> <span id="s234">I was almost killed because they didnÕt allow

machinery.</span> <span id="s284">Now I had a special cause, because of this here.</span> <span id="s285">And because of the knowledge of the German language.</span> <span id="s286">I had two weeksÑfor 14 nights, I had this special engineer teaching me how to operate the machinery, and then I got three trained mechanics as my helpers.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">ES: What was your job then?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">AG: Rockets.</span> <span id="s289">We did not assemble them but we shape them, we build them from the machines and there were so many different operations and hundreds of screws and they told us that every screws is 1/4 mm [?]</span> <span id="s290">thick.</span> <span id="s291">You have to make the hole, drill the hole half the size of this screw, in order, you know, to keep it.</span> <span id="s292">Tools, complicated tools, and it took me two weeks to pick it up, and then they put us into operation of the missiles, the V-2 bombs which we didnÕt know officially what they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">ES: You were building something but you didnÕt know at that time what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">AG: We found out later, we guessed, we heard about the V-2 bombs, still being in the ghetto, when they got them over to England, so we knew of their existence but we didnÕt know at that time that we are building them, but rumors came from the Germans and we found out that these are the V-2 bombs.</span> <span id="s295">Now I started to work and then came the idea to me itÕs time to do something.</span> <span id="s296">We didnÕt have any arms, we didnÕt have resistance, we didnÕt have any possibility to be against the Germans, let me do it my way.</span> <span id="s297">They had their figures and I had my figures.</span> <span id="s298">I told you about the size of the screws and the holes.</span> <span id="s299">I didnÕt tell you about the length of the screws, and many other things, which I made larger holes for the screw, figuring that they wonÕt last, they wouldnÕt hold the power.</span> <span id="s300">I shortened the screws to a half.</span> <span id="s301">If they would be any kind of magicians, they could not find out, which they didnÕt; later on IÕll tell you how, what kind of a job, once you put the screw into the hole, they couldnÕt figure out if it was a bigger hole or a smaller hole.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">ES: So there really wasnÕt any way to check up on what you were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">AG: No.</span> <span id="s304">And now if you know what a chutzpahÑa Yiddishe chutzpah is, I wasnÕt satisfied with doing it myselfÑand I was in good terms with the Germans.</span> <span id="s305">We had a number, half and half of German mechanics.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">ES: Prisoners, you are talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">AG: No, German mechanics.</span> <span id="s308">We were working alongside each other in the factory there.</span> <span id="s309">I was doing the same thing they did, and they did the same thing that I did.</span> <span id="s310">So having this chutzpah, I wanted more, and I wanted Germans to do the same sabotage, and I was in good terms with them, knowing the German language well enough.</span> <span id="s311">And I asked him, ÒHow are you doing this here, donÕt you have any cramps in your palms and your hands?Ó He said, ÒYes.Ó ÒDonÕt tell the next guy, donÕt tell the next guy, donÕt tell anybody.</span> <span id="s312">IÕm going to give you an easier way of doing it.Ó And I told him to do the way I did, bigger holes was easier to screw in with this screwdriver.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">ES: So you got them to sabotage without knowing.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">AG: I went through psychology.</span> <span id="s315">They donÕt think.</span> <span id="s316">They didnÕt think and I had nerve enough to tell them, ÒDonÕt tell the next guy because you know itÕs only for you, because I like you.Ó And I went to the next guy and I told him myself and I had the whole crew doing the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">ES: That was your way to fight back.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">AG: Fight back, yes.</span> <span id="s319">And I was waiting.</span> <span id="s320">I did not tell even my brother-in-law be cause I didnÕt want, I know IÕll get shot, IÕll get killed if they ever find out and he was working on the same line.</span> <span id="s321">And I [was] waiting for the results.</span> <span id="s322">I know it so happens, they will find out, because once the bombs wonÕt come to England, I forget how they have to blow up on the launching pad in German, in Europe, not in Great Britain.</span> <span id="s323">About two months I continued and my good friends, the Germans, continued to sabotage, and all of a sudden we had a commissionÑabout 12 German mechanicsÑcame and started to investigate and I knew, when they came in, that I did it.</span> <span id="s324">I did it.</span> <span id="s325">And they were looking and they found a few faults.</span> <span id="s326">In the meantime, the Russians came closer to the part of Germany; this labor camp where this factory was, and they took all of the German mechanics out of this factory and sent them deeper into Germany, farther away from the frontÑand they kept us in there; whatever we produced, we produced.</span> <span id="s327">When this committee was checking, they found little things, not major things, but little things.</span> <span id="s328">As I told you before, they couldnÕt possibly check out whether the holes were the proper sizes or improper size, and they started to give me back to repair and each time they gave me something back I repaired, they got louder and fresher and I figured now I have to try something.</span> <span id="s329">I started to holler back at them.</span> <span id="s330">I said, ÒHow can you prove this, that I did it?</span> <span id="s331">How about all the me chanics you sent away from here?Ó And I hollered at them back and they took it.</span> <span id="s332">And they laid off of me, didnÕt bring me anything.</span> <span id="s333">I said, ÒI can repair anything you want me to, but donÕt blame me that I did it.Ó But the resultÑand the talkÑgave me so much pleasure, that I didnÕt care if they shot me or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">ES: In the meantime you were responsible for a lot of the rockets not exploding the way they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">AG: They exploded on the German soil.</span> <span id="s336">We have here an acquaintance, a Polish Jew, who was in the Belgium University when the war started; when they occupied Belgium he ran away to France, and you know who DeGaulle is, and he enlisted into DeGaulleÕs army, and when they cleared the French territory from the French troops, they were sent to Great Britain, England.</span> <span id="s337">In some conversation, we were talking about the V-2 bombs and I told him this story.</span> <span id="s338">He said, ÒWait a minute.</span> <span id="s339">There was a lull, the V-2 bombs stopped coming into Great Britain,Ó and [we] figured out the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">ES: And it was the time you were sabotaging.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">AG: SabotagingÑthey had other sources too, but not as many as we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">ES: It just shows that one person can make the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">AG: And this was my pleasure, and then I could get killed twice: one, if they moved, if the Russians moved closer they had to dissolve the factory there, they would find out and kill me for the sake of killing.</span> <span id="s344">And among other things, one time I had a visitor working in another part of the factory, and I had a cut on my finger.</span> <span id="s345">He asked me what this isÑa German, the owner of the factory.</span> <span id="s346">I said, ÒI cut it.Ó ÒHow did you cut it?Ó I told him how.</span> <span id="s347">I said, ÒThis is not important, this will heal.Ó He said, ÒWhat do you mean?Ó I said, ÒThis will heal, but whatÕs inside here, wonÕt heal!Ó He reached for his revolver and moved his hand down and didnÕt get his revolver and asked me, ÒAre you a German Jew?Ó I said, ÒNo.Ó ÒYou speak a good German language.Ó I told him more.</span> <span id="s348">I said, ÒI had enough timeÑbeing five years in your jail and your campsÑto learn the language.Ó But I gave it to him and I didnÕt believe, and you wouldnÕt believe it too probably, that the same German who used to come there for inspections, used to come to me, and talk to me, and told me among other things, ÒIt wonÕt last long, not much longer; the war is coming to an end.Ó</span></p> <p><span id="s349">ES: How long did you work like this in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">AG: From September, 1944 until we were liberated in May 9, 1945, a month until April.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">ES: You worked in the same factory, working on those rockets all that time up until the very end, in other words?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">AG: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">ES: Tell me about how you were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">AG: The Russians came closer and closer and then the Germans disappearedÑand the Russians came in this little town and told us to get out of the camp.</span> <span id="s355">They didnÕt care if we had anywhere to go, or what we have to eat, nothing.</span> <span id="s356">We had to clean the camp and they put in the German prisoners.</span> <span id="s357">They were Russians fighting alongside with the Germans and they caught them and they put them in the same camp.</span> <span id="s358">And we had to go around in the little town.</span> <span id="s359">Of course, the Germans were not bad, they were angels.</span> <span id="s360">They didnÕt know what was going on there.</span> <span id="s361">So we walked in a house.</span> <span id="s362">There was a family so we walked in and stayed there.</span> <span id="s363">Not only did they cook and wash our clothes,

they tell you, ÒNo,Ó like a number of people tell you the Holocaust was a hoax, they knew.</span> <span id="s368">We were marching from the beginning of the day until the end of the day, day in and

When we found each other we wanted to go back to Lodz.</span> <span id="s376">So we saw a German riding a horse with a wagon and we told him to get the hell off the horse and wagon, and we took the wagon and we drove the poor horse to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s377">And in Czechoslovakia, they didnÕt let us in with the horse; we went on the train.</span> <span id="s378">It took us a few

later they called me into Personnel and almost accused me of sabotaging.</span> <span id="s414">Why?</span> <span id="s415">Because I proved that I knew more than I told them when they examined me for
