get out, and th-the -- fr-from this [indecipherable] I fo -- I don’t remember as a chi -- children.</span> <span id="s388">The only thing I remember very well -- and there was a boy, maybe he was nine or 10 years old, and he was starving very much, he was -- you know, she wanted to eat, and there was no -- no food.</span> <span id="s389">And he escaped.</span> <span id="s390">He was with his

for barbed wire, on the wooden posts.</span> <span id="s392">And she was staying and looking through the -- through this gate, and I remember her back.</span> <span id="s393">Very possible she was a big woman, or very -- very possible -- she seems to me a big woman.</span> <span id="s394">But her wide ba -- back, I never forget.</span> <span id="s395">This back was, you know, you can see in her back [indecipherable] by her back how she had the pain, and the -- and she was staying when they were coming.</span> <span id="s396">This is al -- always, always you can see her.</span> <span id="s397">She was staying with her face to this gate.</span> <span id="s398">It was such a -- you know, to -- I remember even how I fe -- I felt about her, this pain.</span> <span id="s399">I didn’t remember this boy, but I remember that my mom say, “Because you don’t want to eat, do you see what happen?”</span> <span id="s400">This is -- this wo -- this I remember.</span> <span id="s401">And I remember when I was working, Dr. Girsh sometimes and he took me to his -- to hi -- to the place he -- he used to live, but this was in the same ghetto, bi -- if he in the same [indecipherable] from the barbed wire [indecipherable] you know, the -- the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: In the same area, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yeah, in the same area.</span> <span id="s404">Not -- it was like, you know, next house -- ne -- next door.</span> <span id="s405">It’s very, very close.</span> <span id="s406">She took me once, and I saw a woman over there, and being

the white blouse, another time she took me, she had the red blouse.</span> <span id="s409">And I remember the blouses, because being a girl [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s410">I paid attention, because everybody was gray, everybody was in gray, and here were colors.</span> <span id="s411">And what I remember, you ma -- from time to time the Germans were coming to the -- to ghetto, and everybody was so afraid because you know, German al -- always brought the death with them.</span> <span id="s412">And everybody was trying to hide somewhere.</span> <span id="s413">Once I remember we’re trying to hide in the deep cellar, and there was a ladder without -- with sa -- with missing some, you know, some this -- what is the -- with -- ladder with some missing --</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: You -- planks?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Planks.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: The planks?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Yeah planks.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: In the cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s420">And fer -- and I remember that there was a man’s voice, I don’t remember who it was because was absolutely dark.</span> <span id="s421">He didn’t want to ask to go there because of me, because I was very little that he was afraid that I will cry, and Germans will hear -- wo-would hear us.</span> <span id="s422">And I remember, my memory, why he think that I will cry?</span> <span id="s423">I am afraid the same s -- the same way, I would not cry, but I will not express it because my mom say to me do not open my mouth, and I didn’t open my mouth.</span> <span id="s424">And they let us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: I’m going to have to stop the tape, and continue on the next tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Claudia, we were talking about you going into this --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: A cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: -- cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Mm-hm, yeah.</span> <span id="s432">This -- that time, we really stayed in the cellar.</span> <span id="s433">Of course I didn’t pronounce a word, and we stay alive.</span> <span id="s434">And we went from the cellar -- this I remember very well, it was dusk already, you know, not a dusk, it was dawn.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: It was dawn?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Dawn it was, dawn, sorry.</span> <span id="s437">And it was light already, almost when we went out, it means all night long we were just staying in the cellar.</span> <span id="s438">And few more time it was very, you know, [indecipherable] it was the brightest part of my memory when Germans used to come because it is -- it’s really, you know, it’s really was the most dangerous t-time.</span> <span id="s439">And once --</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: You -- you understood that it was very dangerous by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Oh sure, sure.</span> <span id="s442">I understood.</span> <span id="s443">I understood that they -- if I will cry, or if I will loudly pronounce something, some gost German will hurt us, and they will kill us.</span> <span id="s444">This I -- I understood.</span> <span id="s445">Maybe I did not understand about the death, about killing, but I understood that it’s very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: And there were a few times when they put -- put me -- put somebody on the bed -- it was one bed in this room, everybody else was sleeping on the floor.</span> <span id="s450">I don’t remember who was sleeping on the bed, maybe me and my mother, my mother and me, maybe.</span> <span id="s451">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s452">Maybe my grandmother because I remember all f -- always her warmth here, when she was so warm and soft.</span> <span id="s453">Maybe I was sleeping with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s454">Th -- th -- I remember her softness.</span> <span id="s455">And a few times they were put somebody on this bed, and when German -- I remember Germans were coming [indecipherable] you know, the -- the head with the hide, this front and the gray her -- coats, military coats, and black epaulets.</span> <span id="s456">This I remember, it is black on the collar, I remember very well.</span> <span id="s457">They’re high, though we -- I was little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: They’re tall cause you’re little.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: -- y-yeah, we’re little girls, and I remember how th-they were high, and -- and fo -- somebody was on the bed, and somebody pronounced typhuses, you know, the sickness from their laces, you know, si-sickness, typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Oh, typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Typhus, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Typhus, typhus, yeah typhus.</span> <span id="s464">They left im-immediate -- immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: They -- because they were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yeah, they -- this was -- this I remember there was a magic wart.</span> <span id="s467">Typhus was a magic wart.</span> <span id="s468">I -- I saw this magic wart, because actually there was no typhus in there -- in this -- after the war, my grandf -- grandmother was sick by typhus, but this was some kind of inside typhus, the inside infection.</span> <span id="s469">And once I remember they were not able to get into the cellar, because Germans came very ra-rapidly, and was very suddenly, and they put me in the barrel, and covered me with the wooden cover.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: In the barrel?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Barrel, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s472">I was little, I can fit it.</span> <span id="s473">This is how they hide me.</span> <span id="s474">And two times I remember t -- there was two times.</span> <span id="s475">Once, there was a strange young woman, her name was Sima.</span> <span id="s476">She all a of a sudden came to the -- to ours -- and she didn’t speak -- to our camp, and she didn’t speak Russian, she spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s477">But some strange Yiddish which I barely can understand.</span> <span id="s478">But the grown-up people understood her.</span> <span id="s479">Very possible she was -- she was escaping of some other place, from Romania, and she happened to be here.</span> <span id="s480">And she stayed in this room, and every time, when Germans were coming, she was the one who was put into the bed, and covered with all the sheets and everything, which was -- and they put me on the bed, because I was the smallest, one, it was not heavy for her, on the bed, and this way sh -- they were hiding her.</span> <span id="s481">And beso -- because of -- I don’t remember her in the gray dress, it means she was not part of this camp.</span> <span id="s482">Maybe sh -- they would not -- not make her working, I remember, but she lived in Zhmerinka after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: So she was saved?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: She was saved, she was saved.</span> <span id="s485">And beside her, in awhile, there was a man who came to this -- to this camp.</span> <span id="s486">He was Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s487">Maybe he was in capture, he was ca -- he was captured, and he escaped and this way he -- he came to this camp, I don’t remember, but he -- he’s arrived, too, and they got married on th -- a-after the war, and we visited them, we stay in their house.</span> <span id="s488">His name was Kiva.</span> <span id="s489">I remember very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Kiva?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Kiva.</span> <span id="s492">And wo -- he had in her -- in his hat, a star, a yellow star.</span> <span id="s493">And he gave it to me to play with.</span> <span id="s494">Believe me, I put it on my dress, and went very proudly, I went outside to walk as I am grown up.</span> <span id="s495">This I remember very well.</span> <span id="s496">I -- and all of a sudden there was passing -- a guy was passing me, I believe he was a German soldier.</span> <span id="s497">Yeah, he was a German soldier, he was passing me, he came back, he looked at this and he started to beat me with his feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Kick you.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Kick me with his feet, I was on the floor -- on the ground, and he was kicking me.</span> <span id="s500">He -- he threw out this -- this star, for -- together with the -- the -- that’s my clothes what’s -- with what I was in, and Dr. Girsh, and Girsh came, and he liberated me, he took me and he was talking to him some way, he must have been like he was talking to him, and he took me.</span> <span id="s501">And after, w-when my mother came from work, she was beating me.</span> <span id="s502">She was punishing me for -- for why -- why did -- did it.</span> <span id="s503">But I didn’t know that this -- this

id="s511">A: Hitting me, punishing me for -- for -- for ca -- for -- for being show off.</span> <span id="s512">And nobody can see me, nobody was around.</span> <span id="s513">But I went out with a s

id="s643">And there was a soldier who came for my mother.</span> <span id="s644">And my grandmother was talking to him.</span> <span id="s645">And I didn’t understand when my gran -- grandmother learned it to -- to speak Romanian, or German.</span> <span id="s646">It happened to be Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s647">She was a traitor, she was a polizei.</span> <span id="s648">But my mother was

actually to -- to Germans, and he didn’t belong to Russian.</span> <span id="s663">He -- he was not -- you know, he didn’t belong to anybody.</span> <span id="s664">And he wanted to -- to take us, and my mother didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s665">I didn’t know for which reason absolutely, you know, it was not nice talk about it, because I remember that -- maybe -- maybe my father was jealous

neighbors.</span> <span id="s676">They were in good con -- relationship.</span> <span id="s677">And happened to be that rest of the Jew, who actually lived there, didn’t have place to go, and they went to the same house.</span> <span id="s678">And the house was packed, nobody can sit.</span> <span id="s679">The house was very little.</span> <span id="s680">Now, when -- when I remember, that was really very, very small village house.</span> <span id="s681">She was baker, so she lived over there by herself.</span> <span id="s682">But again, because she was my grandmother’s friend, I was

and kill us.</span> <span id="s686">And she put me on this -- and to -- to make me breathe she was -- sh-she was pu -- she put a paper and sugar on fire, and this way she told she will clean up some air for me.</span> <span id="s687">I didn’t know this was -- this was the way -- this I remember, the sugar and the -- and -- and the paper, and I was licking the sugar.</span> <span id="s688">I was

this bombing, he came right away, on horses, and with carriage.</span> <span id="s903">And he took us and this carriage to Brailov, and we started to live in Brailov.</span> <span id="s904">And if somebody told that this actually was a club, it was a not place to live.</span> <span id="s905">But we lived in this -- we stayed in this club, because there was nothing, no other.</span> <span id="s906">And this is where my -- it was in Brailov.</span> <span id="s907">And this is where my -- when my mother was walking with me, and showing me the doors of the -- of houses which used to belong to Jewish people who were killed in Zhmerinka, because they didn’t belong to Zhmerinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: They were killed in Zhmerinka

<span id="s969">And everything burned out, but there were leftovers of flour.</span> <span id="s970">And flour was mixed with the -- with the ashes.</span> <span id="s971">And --</span></p> <p><span

Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: They killed -- the people who were killed, only Jews, and Ukrainians who stayed, they were shu -- they were okay, they were alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Yeah, I knew about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: So you knew, but did they teach that in school, or did y

ghetto never mentioned, even when I got the job, already not first of my job.</span> <span id="s1311">I had to put e-every -- every time when you go to -- to new job, you have to make autobi -- biography, put on the paper.</span> <span id="s1312">And you have to cover the full time for during the war.</span> <span id="s1313">And I wrote on occupieded territory.</span> <span id="s1314">I di

I didn’t know because I never wrote, I never read word ghetto, never.</span> <span id="s1315">Never mentioned it.</span> <span id="s1316">A-And I wrote that I was in occupied territory.</span> <span id="s1317">And my supervisor, who so -- who wanted to give me a job, he was a Jewish -- old Jewish man, he said, “It’s so bad that you were on occupieded territory.”</span> <span id="s1318">I thought, if you would count, I was two -- from two to four years old, what -- what’s such a does -- what did, you know, what actually can -- what harm to the Soviet Union I can make in this -- in this age?</span> <span id="s1319">And the -- when I told the story to my friend, just treat it like a joke, he -- they -- one of my friend made a -- a [indecipherable] poetry, I lived in Russia, about me being a spy in -- a spy in two years --</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: It was in occupied territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: -- yeah, in two -- when I was two years old, being a

something about ghetto.</span> <span id="s1324">When I lived in lu -- in Russia -- in Soviet Union, was no mention.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Nothing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s1327">And actually when we left, e-everybody said, “You should have some documents that you were in ghetto.”</span> <span id="s1328">There was no place to have -- to obtain these documents from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: -- for -- that we were in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1331">No place.</span> <span id="s1332">And we got a few -- two women who all knew, or were in ghetto, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1333">And they signed a paper which -- which we notarized.</span> <span id="s1334">And we brought this paper, and my mother, because we -- we -- we want something to -- to -- for my mother, for -- my mother was the one who was suffering the most here.</span> <span id="s1335">I was a child, you know.</span> <span id="s1336">My memories and s -- she actually does -- it is her and my grandmother’s y-you know, also --</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: -- also honors that I survived, actually.</span> <span id="s1339">This is -- this is for them.</span> <span id="s1340">And when we brought this paper to some organization here -- she brought, with my husband, because I was at work already, and my husband was the one who was taking care with her -- he was working, too, but they were very close, my parents and my husband were very close, we’ve never had any problems with this -- in this -- the was th -- he was considered the son i-in the family.</span> <span id="s1341">And when she came to some organization, there were Russian who working in this organization, not Jewish, Russian.</span> <span id="s1342">I don’t know how -- va -- which way they ki -- they used to ki -- to come here, and they said, “Where did today

English language, to -- to speak English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: She was after se -- she was 75, but she wanted to speak e -- English was -- she was so accurate with her homework, and teacher loved her so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: Yeah, because I was talking the teacher, and she -- she was not able talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Teacher was Jewish, she spoke Yiddish, some little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: And this how they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: So y-you met your husband in 1963, am I correct, something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1359">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: But when you are starting to date --</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: -- and you’re going to university, are there many people who were from Jewish families who admit they’re Jewish, or are most people hiding the fact that they’re Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: I will tell you something.</span> <span id="s1364">When I have to go to school -- we lived in village.</span> <span id="s1365">When we came with my mother, we came to Kiev because I wanted to -- I wanted to study in the same school which my father did for [indecipherable] like this family.</span> <span id="s1366">And I came to Kiev, and in fren -- y -- this was not the si -- subways train outsti -- outside train.</span> <span id="s1367">I saw Jewish faces, I decided that I want to live here, because I was so afraid about -- o-of big cities after Leningrad, being outcasted so much, that when I saw here Jewish faces, and Kiev was a f -- the fa -- city of the -- a lot of Jewish people lived because still before the revolution, and everybody who survived bu -- came back to Kiev and in Kiev somehow you can -- it was difficult anyway, being Jewish [indecipherable] was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1368">But anyways, better than Leningrad, for example.</span> <span id="s1369">And for -- I stay in Kiev, and I don’t know for which reason, but my memory, I was befriending only Jewish boys and girls.</span> <span id="s1370">I -- for some reason -- by the way my sister didn’t -- did not, she married a Gentile, she married that Russian, I was -- very -- very possible because I suffered from an -- anti-Semitism all my life, being o-only one in school, and being one in school in Leningrad, and being so outcasted, that I want to be among my -- among my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: But you were clear that people looked Jewish, to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Looked Jewish, when they looked Jewish to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Were you correct most of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Most of the time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Yes, I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Most of the time I was Jewish -- I was correct.</span> <span id="s1379">And I stayed -- I rented the c -- it -- it cal -- it call a corner, it means a bed.</span> <span id="s1380">And my lane -- landlady was Jewish, and I was very anxious to bring everybody whom I meet, and whom I befriend to -- for -- for her to see them, because she has to know whom I am with, because you know, that she -- very possible she’s -- you know, t-the -- I want to -- her to know that I -- that everything is okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: And this way I use [indecipherable] Jews, and I thought that if they are Jewish, they are okay.</span> <span id="s1383">I don’t know, I was like a [indecipherable] running to the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: -- boys and girls --</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: -- but anyway, I thought if they are Jewish, and they have family Jewish, it means that they okay, they brou -- they brought up properly, that mean they’d -- are not --- and they -- and besides, everybody went -- try to go to ha -- to college, or is in the college, which means, you know, it means that, you n -- they’re certain level --</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: -- of, you know, the education, makes people -- first of all, they very occupied that -- with -- with lessons, and with -- and they didn’t have time for -- for bets -- the -- for -- for betting.</span> <span id="s1390">And very soon time of Khrushchev came, Stalin died.</span> <span id="s1391">There was this open letter, so called.</span> <span id="s1392">Y-You know, when they open letter was read, i -- I was still in high school.</span> <span id="s1393">I believed every word right away.</span> <span id="s1394">I didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s1395">But in my home sometimes, my father mentioned something.</span> <span id="s1396">But believe me, I was very much against this because I want to be like everybody else, I want to mingle with -- with -- and my father was so against government, against the -- you know, he didn’t show it -- beside that cu -- beside -- behind the door of our apartment.</span> <span id="s1397">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: You mean ou -- you mean -- oh, you mean outside the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Outside the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: But inside, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: But inside, sometimes he mentioned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: So, did you consider yourself a Communist in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: You know, pioneer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Pioneer, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: But no Communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: When it came time to be even in Komsomol, even in young Communist party, I was tre -- cynical all right --</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: -- de -- about all this hi -- all this.</span> <span id="s1410">And when Khrushchev came, and all my friends and me, we started to read the literature, which was -- which was prohibited in Stalin’s time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: And of course from that time I was -- you know, I didn’t believe exists a -- a civil government forever -- fo -- fo -- from -- from this particular time.</span> <span id="s1413">This -- I’ve -- when -- when I was growing up, I was already re -- ready to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: You were ready to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: So, can you explain to people what it meant to be a refusnik?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: Again, I was [indecipherable] a refusnik.</span> <span id="s1418">Because first of all we get the job, because of us trying very hard.</span> <span id="s1419">My husband had very bad job.</span> <span id="s1420">He had to change the job to be a refusnik, and he was -- like my father refused to ta -- tell me look at this, what she made of that -- of this guy, he was a man, a mensch [indecipherable] and now he be -- he became a frightened man because he -- he used to bring his is d -- you know, these gloves, this -- you know, the fa -- because he, who very -- very often he -- he had to, you know, to load the truck and unload the truck.</span> <span id="s1421">And it was really very difficult.</span> <span id="s1422">Besides, we were -- because of my husband had to change a job, his salary was half of the salary here he used to have.</span> <span id="s1423">And because of everybody’s salary was from -- just fr-from salary to salary, we suffered a lot.</span> <span id="s1424">And only because of again, my mother was a very -- you know, fu -- very frugal cook, this is how you can survive.</span> <span id="s1425">We did -- didn’t -- we never had any savings on us, ne-never had.</span> <span id="s1426">And at work I never talk to anybody about America, about my intention to leave.</span> <span id="s1427">Everybody knew because they had to take paper, and they supposed to, you know, condemn me in voice.</span> <span id="s1428">The -- the lot of people who just supported me, but they suppose -- what they supposed to.</span> <span id="s1429">And I remember even this old man who is -- who fa -- who didn’t want me to write that I was on occupieded territory, he was the one who supposed to condemn me.</span> <span id="s1430">And he didn’t know how to do it.</span> <span id="s1431">He said, “Look at this, I work fo -- with you for such a long time.</span> <span id="s1432">I never knew that you wanted,” he didn’t know what to -- v -- what -- what else bad to s -- to tell.</span> <span id="s1433">He didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1434">I was like everybody else, I was coming to work, I was a consciousness at work, I was doing -- I love my work always.</span> <span id="s1435">And you know, I was brought up as -- you know, I have -- if I come -- if they gave me work, I have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: -- I -- I have to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: And -- and actually it was -- actually it was difficult to complain about me.</span> <span id="s1440">And I wanted to tell one story, because this story was significant enough.</span> <span id="s1441">When there was, you know, the -- su-supposed to be meetings to condemn me, to tell bad thing about me, that -- to -- that I am a traitor, I want to leave my country, my cuze -- you know, my Fatherland -- Fatherland for some kind of America, a-and supposed to be like this.</span> <span id="s1442">And somebody supposed to represent me.</span> <span id="s1443">There was this foo -- of general -- retired general who was a head of personnel department, who was very nice, because he was -- he -- he -- he grew up among Jewish boys and girls who help hi -- him before the war, be -- became a man sh -- and they decided -- in my division, they decided that head of division would not go because they will re -- ij -- j -- remind him of all the mistakes we made.</span> <span id="s1444">You know, he -- head of department, e-everybody.</span> <span id="s1445">So he decide -- decided that his assistant will go, that’s me.</span> <span id="s1446">And his assis -- assistant was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1447">He was very nice, very handsome man.</span> <span id="s1448">Handsome and to -- could -- you know, everybody in the -- in this -- in my cu -- company was talking about h-how nice, and how handsome he is.</span> <span id="s1449">He is now here.</span> <span id="s1450">His name is Weiss.</span> <span id="s1451">I --I would like to have his -- his name, because I never forget what he had done for me.</span> <span id="s1452">And he was s -- s -- charming, and he was the one, if there was some problem, he was sent to -- to -- to sol -- to solve this problem because he was very charming, everybody was -- you know, was -- was charmed by him, was the -- because he was the -- he -- he was the one.</span> <span id="s1453">And he f -- everybody, they decided that he will represent me.</span> <span id="s1454">Like when we came, there was a committee.</span> <span id="s1455">There was a -- a chief engineer, who was -- he wa -- who was a Schwarz, he was a anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s1456">I didn’t know before, because I -- you know, on my position, then his position, we were very far from each other.</span> <span id="s1457">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1458">There was this Barbara, which I told you, who -- who was assistant of this h-head of personnel department, who was a cou -- who was undercover KGB, everybody knew that s-she is undercover to KGB, but what can we do?</span> <span id="s1459">And a lot of other people, among them are Jewish people, too.</span> <span id="s1460">Was a secretary [indecipherable] of party secretary, who was anti-Semite number one.</span> <span id="s1461">But he was drunk, I remember where f -- my friends who was working, they said, “Oh, you know, we had to make a picture of him, how sometimes he will -- he is coming from work, he could not walk, he went to -- to -- to the train [indecipherable] and this pi -- picture will -- will make him tell about you the bad thing.”</span> <span id="s1462">But then nobody made this picture, and -- and there was few other people.</span> <span id="s1463">And to keep me at work, which I ask them to keep me at work, do not fire me because I knew that we will be refusniks, and we have to survive somehow.</span> <span id="s1464">This, you know, assistant is Yuri Wizer, this what I thought, he who represents me, said about me good things.</span> <span id="s1465">And he signed up the punishment for him.</span> <span id="s1466">And now everybody said, “How can you tell about a traitor, about the person who want to leave he -- her Fatherland, good things?</span> <span id="s1467">She’s the worst person we can di -- how can you?”</span> <span id="s1468">And everybody forgot about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: And started --</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: -- for the moment, and started with him.</span> <span id="s1471">And it was like for two hours.</span> <span id="s1472">I will tell you, I was so tense.</span> <span id="s1473">I didn’t know how will I come tomorrow to work and look in his eyes, if he will still here after everything they told about him, and this Barbara, who happened to be -- you know, she -- of course she liked him, but he was -- he was very respectable man, that was far for her.</span> <span id="s1474">She was -- she was the one who was -- her -- her language was the most -- the most -- the most powerful against him.</span> <span id="s1475">And after two hours, we walked out in silent.</span> <span id="s1476">We didn’t talk to each other.</span> <span id="s1477">Everybody came.</span> <span id="s1478">He went to his office, he had the private office, and I came to my -- and -- to my room where I work, and nobody from co-workers ask me how it -- everybody saw.</span> <span id="s1479">And was so silent, nobody was talking, everybody understood that there’s something to -- something terrible happened.</span> <span id="s1480">And I didn’t know if they will keep him at work.</span> <span id="s1481">I -- I didn’t think about myself already because I felt so bad about him being so brave to -- to -- to represent me.</span> <span id="s1482">Well they made an -- in the end of their working day, he came to my he -- to the room, looks at every -- every group, every [indecipherable] had the room, separate room.</span> <span id="s1483">He came to my [indecipherable] room, and he ask everybody to leave, just me to -- to stay.</span> <span id="s1484">And he approach me, he said, “Claudia, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1485">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1486">If you would need more m-my help, I will go.”</span> <span id="s1487">I never forget.</span> <span id="s1488">It is so -- sorry -- and believe me, because of this anti-Semitism, I was -- I didn’t tell anybody this.</span> <span id="s1489">I wanted everybody know how brave he is, but I could not tell, because he made such a -- you know, tha -- such a -- and I didn’t tell about this to anybody before I found out that he is here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: When I found out about this, he got -- he is older than me, and he came later, and it was very difficult for him -- him to got a job.</span> <span id="s1492">And this is -- okay, and he -- and I got an offer from a guy who knew me before, a young guy, he became vice-president of the company.</span> <span id="s1493">And he insisted on me to get a job for -- in his company.</span> <span id="s1494">But I had my job, and I didn’t feel like leave my boss.</span> <span id="s1495">Y-You -- we have very good relationship, it’s very small company actually, and I didn’t feel like, and I decided I will try to offer to Yuri this job.</span> <span id="s1496">I will tell Yuri that there is a job.</span> <span id="s1497">And I call him, and I told him that -- I -- I found his telephone number.</span> <span id="s1498">I told -- I called him and I told him, do you remember this story?</span> <span id="s1499">I never forget it, and only now I want everybody to know.</span> <span id="s1500">And everybody who used to work with us, and who is here, and I t -- I telling the story everybody.</span> <span id="s1501">Because I never for-forget.</span> <span id="s1502">You -- you should know who he was.</span> <span id="s1503">He was, you know, like a symbol of -- of -- of engineering mind, and being so handsome, and you know, it becau -- even that he was a Jewish didn’t -- you know, it didn’t bother -- bother everybody be -- because he was so respectable.</span> <span id="s1504">And he had the -- you know, he had -- had guts, like American say, to -- to stand next to me, and to protect me.</span> <span id="s1505">This is -- this was -- but he did not get the job, it was difficult for him with language ver-very much.</span> <span id="s1506">And he was, you know, he was retired already, he -- he was 65, he said, you know, “I got my social security, and I -- I am happy with that.</span> <span id="s1507">My son is okay, I -- he -- thank you so much.”</span></p>

will waiting for -- from -- and to -- to leave.</span> <span id="s1580">And this is -- this is -- was our life.</span> <span id="s1581">Of course we cou -- could not change a job, we could not move, we’re -- oh, about moving from town to town, when Chernobyl happened, our son lived -- was in Moscow as a student.</span> <span id="s1582">And actually before Chernobyl he could get an assignment too after the college, because in Russia was -- in [indecipherable] was the rule, you finish the college, and you work according to your assignment.</span> <span id="s1583">You don’t look for who -- for -- for your job, you have to work two, three years where they send you.</span> <span id="s1584">And after you can -- you can be free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: And it was possible that he can come back to Kiev, it -- it was possible because he was a [indecipherable] student, he had -- he had the privilege of his hi-high -- high marks in -- in college.</span> <span id="s1587">He had some kind of privilege to choose the place.</span> <span id="s1588">But when Chernobyl happened, we didn’t want to -- him to come back to Kiev, because Kiev became dangerous city to live, especially nobody wants to -- for their children, to live th -- this -- and we started to think maybe we will move some -- somewhere close to him, you know, change -- we had the -- not the bad co-op apartment which my parents helped us to buy, and they lived with us, and this was our actually ti -- we left this apartment.</span> <span id="s1589">We left because of there was, you know, we were allowed to bring in United State, 150 dollars, which is -- which was equivalent to 3,000 dollars -- or 300 dollars in Russian -- in Russian money.</span> <span id="s1590">And our apartment that time was six and a half thousand dollars, which is, you know, anyway this money -- we g -- we got some money we left to -- from my mother-in-law a little bit, little bit to my sister’s mother-in-law, little bit, but you know, this is actually nothing.</span> <span id="s1591">I actually can buy this ga -- dress for this.</span> <span id="s1592">This is -- this is the only thing we ca -- could d -- could do.</span> <span id="s1593">And in this -- this is 150 dollars, which we were allowed to take -- take with us.</span> <span id="s1594">And what -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Did you move from Kiev?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: No, and we were trying to move, and we actually found an apartment not far from Moscow, it was not in Moscow, it is one of -- one of the small towns around Moscow.</span> <span id="s1597">But was such thing we could not move, because of prescription to this particular place.</span> <span id="s1598">But this is not only refusniks, this was in -- in Russia there was a rule, you prescribed to this apartment.</span> <span id="s1599">And you could not move.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: [indecipherable] you can’t move, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: And you could not move.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Not only to another city, to another -- to -- to another apartment.</span> <span id="s1604">To -- to -- you have to have permission, government permission to move from this apartment to -- government permission to -- for to move from one apartment on.</span> <span id="s1605">And this is of course we could not -- we -- we could not move, it just -- we just found it, but it didn’t go -- go fast, no paper were -- were from -- allowed.</span> <span id="s1606">And actually this is -- this is what [indecipherable] and wh-what -- w-we were under -- under control --</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: -- were under [indecipherable] you know, we were under the hoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: Were most of the people who were refusniks Jews?</span></p>

id="s1615">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s1616">First of all, why?</span> <span id="s1617">Because -- because of the situation, the [indecipherable] sit -- situation, there aren’t -- anti-Semitism was government politics.</span> <span id="s1618">It was permissible to not take people to the college.</span> <span id="s1619">By the way, I h -- I was a [indecipherable] enough student, and for to get to the college, you have to -- to get exams, you know, exams, tests, tests.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Yes, tests, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: Tests was very hard, harder than the -- than tests in school, like five, six times, believe me.</span> <span id="s1622">Very -- very often there was a -- they questioned you, something which is absolutely out of the school program, just to make you -- and my husband, he will tell you, he -- he -- he went through, just to make you do not answer it.</span> <span id="s1623">And there was a score, 25 it was the biggest one, 24, was permissible, I had 23, and I could not get to the co -- to the college, but with same mark my landlady, who I hired the corner from, she helped me to go to another school not so prestigious, li -- like I want to, and was really not very famous, but that’s it, I went to this school and I graduated that -- that school, which didn’t give me the profession I wanted, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: What did you want to study?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: I wanted to be a technology engineer for sugar plant.</span> <span id="s1626">I wanted to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: Oh, to work with your father’s company --</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Yeah, and I knew this technology because I went to -- when I was in school I was working part time, and my hus -- and my father had difficulties, I told you, in -- at work, and sometimes I just went to work just to earn some money for -- for -- and I was -- during the time I was in school at night, I was working at the -- at the plant, because plant when it works, it works actu -- actually only few months a year, it produces sugar from -- it works 24 hours.</span> <span id="s1629">That’s why I was able to work at night, and I love this -- I like this [indecipherable] production.</span> <span id="s1630">I knew everything about that, and I loved it, and I wanted to -- but it was impossible actually, the -- I actually don’t know anybody of my age, Jewish, to be in this school, during this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Uh-huh, during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Yeah, and that why he -- why by the way n -- a lot of Jews [indecipherable] from Kiev went to different obscure towns in Russia, where they didn’t even saw Jewish -- Jews before.</span> <span id="s1633">And they didn’t pay attention to it.</span> <span id="s1634">And they got -- they studied there, not only because they were [indecipherable] refusing thing, they were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1636">And what -- what did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: I was -- I was at the chanot -- sillicut ceramic, different kind of ceramic, which for [indecipherable] fro -- for dishes, glasses --</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: So is that struc -- is that what they call structural engineering?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: -- it was not the structural, it was a technology engineer.</span> <span id="s1642">But when I decided to le -- and assess -- assess this technology in the -- technology engineer for -- for this ceramic, I was working on this military plan, which my profession was okay for this, it was s -- compliant with this.</span> <span id="s1643">But I decided to leave, I wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s1644">And I left this military p-plant, where to go?</span> <span id="s1645">There was only design companies, very bad pla -- factories, very, very old fa -- old military productions, this is -- was, and my neighbor ca - say to me, you know, in structural depart -- department, we’ll always need people.</span> <span id="s1646">And I was an engineer here on -- on the plant, and I went as a technician, actually as a drafter -- draft -- draftsman for -- for -- to -- in structural department.</span> <span id="s1647">And very soon, because you know, I had the background, I had the -- from I had the college background, I -- to -- very soon I understood what -- what we’re doing.</span> <span id="s1648">And the group of people moved it -- it’s before we were refusniks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: It is -- was before -- before we applied, because my husband still could not find a job, he was still working on -- and you could not apply, because nobody will take documents from us, because he is working on such a secret plant.</span> <span id="s1651">Besides, he didn’t -- being a Jewish, he didn’t have the -- the -- a level of secrecy he -- he would -- the -- really he -- he’s supposed to have on his position, a foo -- over there, he -- he’s supposed to have, but they didn’t give it to him because he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1652">And from a group of young people my age went to little company who -- which were de -- designing brick -- like production, there was brick ovens, you know, this big -- how will you call it, where they [indecipherable] the brick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Ovens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: Ovens --</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: O-Ovens, but this is when -- when you do something from ceramic and you put it on fire, how are you calling that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: Oh, right, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: Oh, it’s a -- a special name, I he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: No, I know what you mean, you --</span></p> <p><span

be special foundation for this kiln, and the -- e-everything.</span> <span id="s1666">And they took me, and th-th-th-this company had the oof -- and from this compa -- working here part time, I went to structural colle -- to -- to college, and became a structural engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: This is when I was working as a -- as a

by -- by this member of party, that member of party, and -- and these Jewish boys who were structural engineers before, who took me with them, they left br -- just do -- just -- they were afraid that that were -- will be kicked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Beside, they were not head of departments, they started from the head of departments and they m -- they were different thi -- a project -- project managers -- you know, project managers were one thing, and there foo -- foo -- and the people who were negotiating it, and who were making the

were kicked out, and -- and this -- my co-workers, my friends actually, they were afraid that they will be kicked out, but I was on such a low position that to foo -- nobody -- nobody was paying attention to me, and I was able to finish the s -- the school over there.</span> <span id="s1676">Soon as I finished one of that’s my friend, they could not let me to stay there, he was afraid of me.</span> <span id="s1677">He found me the job on this company which was designing paper [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1678">And working on this paper [indecipherable] and this company, I shill applied -- not -- not soon enough like in five, six years.</span> <span id="s1679">Ev-eventually I stayed with this company for 15 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: 15 years?</span></p>
