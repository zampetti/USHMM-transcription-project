where and when you were born, and a little bit about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">HB: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s6">I was born in Berlin, Germany in 1930 and my family lived in Berlin most of their lives.</span> <span id="s7">My dad was born in Frankfurt and my mother was born in Dresden, Germany but we lived in Berlin.</span> <span id="s8">And… [sounds as though tape stopped].</span></p> <p><span id="s9">JF: Can you tell me your mother's maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">HB: My mother's maiden name was Pinkus, P-I-N-K-U-S…</span></p> <p><span id="s11">JF: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">HB: …And they were--my grandparents--well, my grandmother, was sent to Auschwitz but my grandfather died of natural causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">JF: This is your mother's…</span></p> <p><span id="s14">HB: My mother's mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">JF: On your mother's side?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">HB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s17">But my parent's parents, my father's parents did pass away previous–in the 20's, late 20's.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">JF: What kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">HB: My father was working for a recycle, so to speak, not a recycling place but rebuilt machinery; in other words, they'd take old machinery and they rebuilt it and then they'd sell it.</span> <span id="s20">So he was more or less a salesman for this company as my memory recollects--the name was Kohls, K-O-H-L-S, and also a Jewish firm, and, like I said, my dad was a salesman for those people.</span> <span id="s21">Reconditioned machinery, that's what it was.</span> <span id="s22">Reconditioned machinery, and later, and when people had to give up their businesses before the Crystal Night, Mr. Kohls was also being relieved by so called Aryan individuals, so he can run the business.</span> <span id="s23">But my father was still employed with this firm until he migrated to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">JF: So he was able to earn a living during that time…</span></p> <p><span id="s25">HB: He was earn–yeah, he was able to earn a living and during the time of the Crystal Night or the Germans call it Kristall Night, Nacht--Kristallnacht, he at that time, they were gathering male, all males--not all males but certain males at random and they were sent through the first phase of concentration camps, forced labor.</span> <span id="s26">But my father somehow escaped that and he went to relatives in Dresden, where my mother was born, and he hid there until this was over and they never picked him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">JF: How did he know to escape or had he been warned?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">HB: I cannot recall that, but I remember, I was a child of eight, yeah, 1938 that was the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s29">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s30">He had a probably a hunch that--he heard maybe, I think he heard of others.</span> <span id="s31">He had a lot of gentile friends and they were telling them that, "You better watch out, Max".</span> <span id="s32">His first name was Max.</span> <span id="s33">"You better do something.</span> <span id="s34">Hide somewhere."</span> <span id="s35">That's the way I recollect and…</span></p> <p><span id="s36">JF: That something…</span></p> <p><span id="s37">HB: Because they were pick--they knew, his gentile friends knew that they were picking up men for forced labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">JF: And they knew this after Kristallnacht had already happened or as…</span></p> <p><span id="s39">HB: No, no, this was before Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">JF: Before Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">HB: Before, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">JF: Ok…</span></p> <p><span id="s43">HB: Because I remember, I was a child, I didn't know where my father was going.</span> <span id="s44">He was going on a trip.</span> <span id="s45">I thought he was going on a business trip...</span></p> <p><span id="s46">JF: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">HB: You see.</span> <span id="s48">But actually in reality he was escape this phase of the, well it was a phase of first type of concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">JF: Do you remember Kristallnacht for…</span></p> <p><span id="s50">HB: Yeah…</span></p> <p><span id="s51">JF: …yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">HB: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">JF: Can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">HB: I was seven years old when they, I was going to a public school in Germany, Berlin, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">JF: Umm hmmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">HB: And I was the only Jew in the classroom.</span> <span id="s57">And I'll tell you, I was seven years old and they kicked me out because I was Jewish and I was transferred to a parochial school.</span> <span id="s58">The parochial school was in the back of a synagogue.</span> <span id="s59">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s60">JF: Do you remember which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">HB: Yeah, it's the Rieckestrasse, the Rieckestrasse Synagogue, and I was, it was a combination of religious school and parochial school.</span> <span id="s62">Well, it was a parochial school, and at the time of Crystal Night, we weren't--I wasn't going to school, that was the night before.</span> <span id="s63">The day before, we had school and then I came back.</span> <span id="s64">They went home.</span> <span id="s65">That same night, I remember when they were smashing, the Nazi's were smashing all the Jewish shops and for these derogatory remarks for the Jews, Jews, Jews and…</span></p> <p><span id="s66">JF: Where were you when you witnessed this?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">HB: I didn't actually see the smashing of the glass but I've seen the demolished after, when I, the next day when I went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">JF: Did you hear anything from your home?</span> <span id="s69">Could you…</span></p> <p><span id="s70">HB: I, No, no…</span></p> <p><span id="s71">JF: …hear sounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">HB: We were living in the suburbs, so we weren't.</span> <span id="s73">We were away from business establishments.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">JF: So you did not know that there was…</span></p> <p><span id="s75">HB: No, I did not know really, but the day that I went to school, the next day…</span></p> <p><span id="s76">JF: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">HB: That's the, that's the thing.</span> <span id="s78">The day that I went to school, I passed shops that were demolished and …</span></p> <p><span id="s79">JF: Do you remember how you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">HB: I don't know how I felt.</span> <span id="s81">I felt numb.</span> <span id="s82">I, because there were some previous incidents, I used to play, where there was a park close by where we lived.</span> <span id="s83">It's called, it was called the Friedeichshain Park and I used to go and, by myself.</span> <span id="s84">I had a buddy that was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s85">He lived in the same apartment building.</span> <span id="s86">See we didn't have these, in those days hardly anybody had houses.</span> <span id="s87">We only, we lived in apartment buildings, and all of a sudden people, hordes of kids, threw stones at me and called me "Jew, Jew!"</span> <span id="s88">And, of course, that discouraged me from going to the--that was very hurtful--because you know, I didn't know really the concept of why, why, you know--Jew, you know.</span> <span id="s89">I didn't know the concept of why they were throwing stones at me, and I don't think those kids knew why they were throwing stones at me, because their parents probably threw stones at me.</span> <span id="s90">I mean, they told them to, about Jew, they're devils, and, as a matter of fact…</span></p> <p><span id="s91">JF: You don't think the kids knew what they were doing really?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">HB: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s93">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s94">They were my age, eight years old, maybe seven, eight years old.</span> <span id="s95">I remember we took a field trip when I went, before they kicked me out of the public school.</span> <span id="s96">We were on a field trip and--it's funny how you remember, and I still have a school picture, which I don't have with me, of the school where I went to, of the public school, and we went--we passed a Jewish cemetery, and I remember vividly when our teacher said, we made a detour around the cemetery.</span> <span id="s97">We didn't go past the cemetery because he mentioned that this is the devil's--the devil roams in these grounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">JF: Your teacher said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">HB: My teacher.</span> <span id="s100">The devil roams in these grounds.</span> <span id="s101">I didn't know what he meant.</span> <span id="s102">I had no conception--know what he meant and, of course, then a couple months later, I was kicked out anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">JF: Had this teacher ever treated you differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">HB: No, no, he didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">JF: He knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">HB: Umm hmmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">JF: And had you, before this time--before this attack in the park…</span></p> <p><span id="s108">HB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">JF: … had you experienced any kind of…</span></p> <p><span id="s110">HB: Not really.</span> <span id="s111">No.</span> <span id="s112">I really didn't.</span> <span id="s113">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">JF: …discrimination?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">HB: But I was so innocent, so naςve about these things.</span> <span id="s116">As a matter of fact, they gave out these little pamphlets of Hitler, and I was, in my mind, oh my, I wish I could join the Hitler Youth.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">JF: Ah.</span> <span id="s118">Did you get one, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">HB: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s120">They were distributed on the street, I mean they were, you know, and really I--you know, funny when asked you interview me, I, this, it comes back to me and, of course, before I was being--before I realized that they were throwing stones at me in the park.</span> <span id="s121">That was before that.</span> <span id="s122">I really thought it would be nice to join Hitler.</span> <span id="s123">I used to play with German soldiers, you know these little figurines.</span> <span id="s124">They looked just like…</span></p> <p><span id="s125">JF: The little toy soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">HB: Toy soldiers, toy soldiers.</span> <span id="s127">Of course, I had a Mercedes Benz, I guess.</span> <span id="s128">That's what Hitler drove around in.</span> <span id="s129">That open Mercedes Benz.</span> <span id="s130">I had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">JF: You mean a toy.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">HB: A toy, a Mercedes Benz.</span> <span id="s133">Where you know, a figure, an image of Hitler was--and SS troops you know.</span> <span id="s134">I played with those.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">JF: You had these toys…</span></p> <p><span id="s136">HB: I had these toys.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">JF: With an image of Hitler in…</span></p> <p><span id="s138">HB: An image of Hitler and an image of these SS troops and SA troops and what have you.</span> <span id="s139">And I was six years--I was seven years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">JF: These were the miniature--Were they iron or…</span></p> <p><span id="s141">HB: They were…</span></p> <p><span id="s142">JF: Or rubber?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">HB: What was it?</span> <span id="s144">What are they made of, like clay or not clay, it would break easy but…</span></p> <p><span id="s145">JF: They would break.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">HB: Yeah, probably iron.</span> <span id="s147">Probably iron, yeah.</span> <span id="s148">I don't know what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">JF: Did your family know that you were playing with these?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">HB: Sure they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">JF: Did they say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">HB: No, nothing until--No, I didn't, no, no not at my recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">JF: Did they…</span></p> <p><span id="s154">HB: But then, like I said when I was seven, that was 1937.</span> <span id="s155">You figure 1937, we never thought it was--it would came to the Crystal like in Crystal Night and…</span></p> <p><span id="s156">JF: Did you have a sense of before then, that your parents were concerned about Hitler coming to power?</span> <span id="s157">That they were being affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">HB: Not really.</span> <span id="s159">Only I was concerned about that night, the Crystal Night and I didn't finish, actually as I was after…</span></p> <p><span id="s160">JF: No, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">HB: The way it happened, I went to school.</span> <span id="s162">Now that's when I really realized what was happening.</span> <span id="s163">I was going to school and, like I said, the synagogue was in, behind the school and the courtyard.</span> <span id="s164">So I visualize the courtyard and I seen the books and Torahs being in the middle of the courtyard, and the caretaker, he was not Jewish, he had a bloody face and, of course, there was no school, like I said.</span> <span id="s165">And that visualize and I never will forget that.</span> <span id="s166">The Torahs were on the courtyard.</span> <span id="s167">They weren't burned yet, but they were intending to burn.</span> <span id="s168">So I just went home right away and so then I realized that, and then, of course, at that time, my dad was in Dresden because he knew or he had the, what's it called hindsight?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">JF: He had foresight.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">HB: Foresight, I got mixed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">JF: [laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s172">HB: He had his foresight that something is going to happen and…</span></p> <p><span id="s173">JF: How did it feel when you saw the Torahs in the courtyard?</span> <span id="s174">What was that feeling before you left, turned around and left?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">HB: The feeling, I really didn't have a feeling at that time because I didn't know the concept of the Torah, per se.</span> <span id="s176">We didn't really study the Torah or the--now, I afterwards, in China that where we really went into it--the Torah.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">JF: Was your family observant in anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">HB: No, not too, no, not too observant.</span> <span id="s179">My dad did do the Friday night Kiddush.</span> <span id="s180">That's about it, but I never, no, no we weren't observant…</span></p> <p><span id="s181">JF: But you had a sense that these were holy books?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">HB: I had a sense that they were holy books, and I could not understand why they were thrown in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s183">I didn't have no conception why, why, you know?</span> <span id="s184">And until I was, like I said, I was eight years old then and finally--and why was this caretaker being injured, you know?</span> <span id="s185">I didn't have no, I, no conception at all, no conception at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">JF: When you went home, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">HB: I went home and my--you know something, it's kind of a blank because I was with disbelief that something like this can happen, I mean disbelief.</span> <span id="s188">And then I stayed home, I guess until--I never went back to that school again.</span> <span id="s189">Never went back to that school until we migrated to China.</span> <span id="s190">There was--it was shortly.</span> <span id="s191">My dad had, and anyway, my dad came back after it cooled down and I..</span> <span id="s192">.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">JF: Were you worried about where he was at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">HB: No, I thought he was on a business trip, but then it was, I was told to me later.</span> <span id="s195">They didn't tell me to keep, they didn't want to worry me too much, so they--you know it kind of reminded me, funny--it kind of reminded me of this movie Life is Beautiful, did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">HB: And like I say, I, they made it so that everything is going to be ok.</span> <span id="s198">You know everything is no problems, you know.</span> <span id="s199">We'll go to it, try different places, to beautiful places.</span> <span id="s200">We go to Shangri-La, whatever and a…</span></p> <p><span id="s201">JF: So that's how your parents…</span></p> <p><span id="s202">HB: They believed that--as a matter of fact, my dad had an opportunity to go to South America.</span> <span id="s203">He had two opportunities, so that visa somehow did not come through yet, so they didn't want to wait.</span> <span id="s204">They didn't want to take any chances and Shanghai--well my uncle had, he was in the textile business in Germany.</span> <span id="s205">And he had a little money, and he helped my dad with a fare to come to China at that time, so, but South America never materialized.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">JF: And the South American plan was the only other plan that you know that your father might have pursued?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">HB: Yeah, yeah, it was Brazil, Brazil, as a matter of fact, he--Brazil or Bolivia.</span> <span id="s208">Now I'm not quite sure.</span> <span id="s209">One of these.</span> <span id="s210">Because I remember an uncle of mine went to Bolivia, [unclear].</span> <span id="s211">That's, I think it was Bolivia, because in Brazil they speak Portuguese.</span> <span id="s212">And I still have a Spanish-German dictionary at home.</span> <span id="s213">So it must have been Bolivia.</span> <span id="s214">It must have been Bolivia.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">JF: And when you got home, your mother was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">HB: Yeah, as I can recollect.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">JF: Did she explain anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">HB: Not really.</span> <span id="s219">No, that's what…</span></p> <p><span id="s220">JF: At that point?</span> <span id="s221">They really were protecting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">HB: Protecting me, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">JF: And it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">HB: And it worked.</span> <span id="s225">With this kind of a mentality, we left China, with this kind of an attitude, so to speak.</span> <span id="s226">I had a ball.</span> <span id="s227">I mean my mother, I mean the anxiety of my parents, you see we had to cross, we left Germany, we...</span></p> <p><span id="s228">JF: When did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">HB: We left Germany April of 1939.</span> <span id="s230">As a matter of fact it was the day of Hitler's birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">JF: April 20th?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">HB: No, April, I don't know what date it was, April, I think I have my dad's passport.</span> <span id="s233">I think it might be--and we had to cross Switzerland, we had to cross the Swiss-German border.</span> <span id="s234">Brenner, have you ever heard of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">JF: The Brenner Pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">HB: The Brenner Pass.</span> <span id="s237">And my mother--they were, they took a certain amount of jewelry with them and she was scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">JF: How were you traveling?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">HB: By rail.</span> <span id="s240">By rail and, like I say, I as a kid had a ball.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">JF: Do you remember any difficulty in…</span></p> <p><span id="s242">HB: No I didn't…</span></p> <p><span id="s243">JF: …in leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">HB: No, no difficulty.</span> <span id="s245">When I went with my mother to get all these permits and visas and, from the German consulate.</span> <span id="s246">I went with my mother, and my mother never looked Jewish per se.</span> <span id="s247">So when I went with my mother, they took her first because they thought she was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s248">She was Jewish…</span></p> <p><span id="s249">JF: They thought she was German and not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">HB: Exactly, and I, funny I remember that, and then I, later on I when she told me that they took her because she did not look I know--what is Jewish looking, I mean what is Jewish looking I mean, now a days it's kind of ridiculous, you know.</span> <span id="s251">But somehow you have this instinct of a refugee has a certain mannerism that you can just guess.</span> <span id="s252">Later on I can tell you a story where my guess was right, and they were refugees in California that I met.</span> <span id="s253">Their daughter I met here.</span> <span id="s254">It was a bizarre story.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">JF: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">HB: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">JF: So here you are on the train, with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">HB: With my parents going through the Brenner Pass…</span></p> <p><span id="s259">JF: Any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">HB: No, no I was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">JF: And your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">HB: My grandparents, unfortunately, stayed behind, and they tried very hard to also get them out of there.</span> <span id="s263">See, you had them, the way I remember, they had an amount of business people and they arranged these trips.</span> <span id="s264">If you didn't have any money, you lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">JF: So you didn't, there wasn't family money to get your…</span></p> <p><span id="s266">HB: There was, if you had money, sure there was family, but there were certain people.</span> <span id="s267">You know, anybody that had a chance to get out of Germany, could get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">JF: To?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">HB: To wherever they wanted to go.</span> <span id="s270">At that time, of course, Shanghai was the only open port.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">HB: Yeah, so but you still have to have a certain amount of money to get out of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">JF: So the fact that your grandparents didn't get out was a financial one?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">HB: No, it's just…</span></p> <p><span id="s275">JF: Is that what you're saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">HB: …well, I don't know.</span> <span id="s277">I really couldn't say but they were so close and yet so far away, when we were in Shanghai to get them out.</span> <span id="s278">My dad, my, like I said, my grandfather died of natural causes; then my grandmother somehow did…</span></p> <p><span id="s279">JF: She was

id="s992">See I had two types of friends.</span> <span id="s993">Friends from this school here were, did not go to cheder, did not go to the yeshiva, so consequently they were a different breed of people, so to speak.</span> <span id="s994">I don't know if that's the right terminology or not, but they were, some of them were non-observant, I mean, just like--and then I, of course, the transition all takes place when I had [unclear] friends in cheder, so from one extreme to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">JF: Did you have both groups of friends at the same time or…</span></p> <p><span id="s996">HB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">JF: …or did you move?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">HB: No, when I was Bar Mitzvahed, this was 1943.</span> <span

id="s1001">Very good friend.</span> <span id="s1002">Name is Willy, and he was half-Jewish, and his mother was not Jewish, or somebody wasn't Jewish, and best friend, one of my best friends, you know.</span> <span id="s1003">It did not make any difference to me at that time whether somebody was religious or non-religious, you know.</span> <span id="s1004">To me, personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">JF: What impact had this all had on your parents in terms of how…</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">HB: Oh, they were…</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">JF: …your home was, you say your cousin had also become…</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">HB: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">JF: …observant and wanted to keep kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">HB: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">JF: So that meant the whole household changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">HB: The whole household, yeah.</span> <span id="s1013">Not the people that he rented, the other people that my uncle rented, no they were--to my recollection they were not that observant, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">JF: But the kitchen had been koshered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">HB: Oh, well the kitchen, everybody was on their own.</span> <span id="s1016">We usually sometimes cooked separate.</span> <span id="s1017">And we cooked, you know, we had our own pots and pans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">JF: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">HB: You know?</span> <span id="s1020">So there was no, the only time we, sometimes we ate together just a family but not the other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">JF: Did your parents then also become more observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">HB: My parents?</span> <span id="s1023">No, not so much.</span> <span id="s1024">My uncle did though, became more observant, but not--no, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1025">I didn't go to, he never went to the Shabbat services with me.</span> <span id="s1026">I went.</span> <span

id="s1029">Sometimes my dad wouldn't wear a hat, so he would go on one street and I would go on the other street.</span> <span id="s1030">G-d forbid one of my rabbi's should see me you know with my dad, you know, I was embarrassed.</span> <span id="s1031">I was embarrassed actually, and this is wrong sometimes when you, when they teach kids, well if it has something to do with, no you can break this commandment "Thou shalt honor your parents", you know.</span> <span id="s1032">You can break this commandment only in certain circumstances, when it was, when it pertains towards Judaism.</span> <span id="s1033">And it was wrong, you know.</span> <span id="s1034">I realized it later in years.</span> <span id="s1035">I mean it was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1036">Why should I be ashamed to go with my father on the street?</span> <span id="s1037">So, so anyway it's--then I later on I changed myself.</span> <span id="s1038">I changed.</span> <span id="s1039">So in order to comply to, I can be--like I said, I can be acclimated to any surroundings, to any community.</span> <span id="s1040">I can mix in easy with secular people, you know.</span> <span id="s1041">I can act the same ways, you know, to respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">JF: Do you attribute this flexibility in any way to your experience in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">HB: No, it's my own feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">JF: It's just your own personal…</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">HB: My own personality, my own personal feeling.</span> <span id="s1046">I learned and I'm very tolerant and, a lot of adversity happened in my life after I left Shanghai, and I do not have any, just like Rabbi Kushner I am, what happens to…</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">JF: Good things happen…</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">HB: Good things happen, well, what happens to bad…</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">JF: Bad things happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">HB: Bad things happen to good people, yeah.</span> <span id="s1051">I feel the same, I mean I have this tremendous faith, you know and , things you know.</span> <span id="s1052">Like I said, to me personally Shanghai was the best years of my life.</span> <span id="s1053">And the adversity came after I came to this country in certain things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">JF: Oh boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">HB: I mean it's silly, but the things were happening in this country that you know.</span> <span id="s1056">I was married, sick wife, and I lost a son at 40, and all these kind of things and it seems like my cousin despite, I mean he has 23 grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1057">Sometimes I get a little bit jealous because this, their life--well they live in a different world in, you know, they don't face reality sometimes [unclear].</span> <span id="s1058">But they live in their own little, like Fiddler on the Roof, they're contented and--so, sometimes I wonder, well, is this a good life or not, you know, but--so I go back and forth sometimes, you know.</span> <span id="s1059">But in general speaking, no, no, I'm a pretty happy-go-lucky fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">JF: So you had this ability as a kid to be friends with these…</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">HB: Oh definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">JF: Guys and girls as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">HB: Not so much with girls, no.</span> <span id="s1064">I, see that, again, I sure looked at girls, you know.</span> <span id="s1065">I mean you had this feeling for girls.</span> <span id="s1066">When I was a little older,14, you know you had this--but that was again, taboo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">JF: Because you had become more identified with the traditional…</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">HB: Identified with the traditional way, yeah.</span> <span id="s1069">I'll tell you a little humorous story about taboo now.</span> <span id="s1070">On Yom Kippur, there is this Torah portion of the--all these commandments, thou shalt not do this, and thou shalt not do that, and thou shalt not, it's all in the, you know we studied this in Torah and thou shalt not lay with any, doesn't say cohabit, but lay with any beast or with any animal.</span> <span id="s1071">It just said lay.</span> <span id="s1072">So I asked the Rabbi at that time, what does it mean?</span> <span id="s1073">"Geh weiter," go on he said, "go to next page."</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">JF: [laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">HB: You know, wouldn't explain anything.</span> <span id="s1076">I mean so you were so naςve.</span> <span id="s1077">So we had a cat in China, and that cat, [laughter] yes, you guessed it, was laid on my bed all the time.</span> <span id="s1078">Ever since that portion I've learned I shushed him away, cause I was not supposed to lay with him, you know?</span> <span id="s1079">[laughter] So that's how, in a way, it's kind of a comic, but that's how they teach you, you know.</span> <span id="s1080">Until later on in years, when you went to yeshiva, you went to the big yeshiva, you knew more about the facts of life, but I was so naςve about the facts of life even when I, when I left Shanghai I didn’t'even know the facts of life too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">JF: Now when you dropped out of the Kadoorie School around the time of your Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span

took a rickshaw ride and guess what?</span> <span id="s1171">Instead of--we didn't have any money-- so we gave the coolie our bread for our rickshaw ride.</span> <span id="s1172">Of course, I never heard the end of it.</span> <span id="s1173">[laughter] So that day we were out of bread, but we had a rickshaw ride.</span> <span id="s1174">I don't know, I forget how old I was, 12 or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">JF: [laughter] That's wonderful.</span> <span id="s1176">Now you said, when you had your Bar Mitzvah, this was within the yeshiva at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">HB: Yes, within the yeshiva compound, yes.</span> <span id="s1178">Well, it was the cheder compound and in that same shul that we were brought up--we learned in the morning, we learned in the, well, actually in the morning I went to school everyday but…</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">JF: And what was the name of the shul?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">HB: Ohel Moshe, Ohel Moshe School.</span> <span id="s1181">It was within the perimeter of the quote, unquote - ghetto.</span> <span id="s1182">That's, the shul was built by Russians also.</span> <span id="s1183">As a matter of fact, the shames [sexton] was [laughter], the shames went, was a Russian and a, you know what a shames is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">JF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1185">Of course.</span> <span id="s1186">What was it like, was it, the day of your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">HB: The day of the Bar Mitzvah--first of all, they complimented my dad.</span> <span id="s1188">They wished my dad, oh what a good job he did, oh what a good job, what a good job, but little did they know that my mother pushed me to go to cheder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">JF: Ah [chuckle]</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">HB: See, they always gave credit to the men, and it was a little bit, it was not too fair.</span> <span id="s1191">You know, there are prayer books nowadays where it says, "Blessed be Thou oh Lord our G-d, who has not created me as a woman."</span> <span id="s1192">And then the woman says, "Blessed be Thou Lord G-d of the Universe, who created me according to thy will."</span> <span id="s1193">So these Orthodox prayer books don't have that, you know.</span> <span id="s1194">So it's kind of a little bit prejudicial statement but then…</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">JF: Did you feel that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">HB: No, no, no, I, no.</span> <span id="s1197">Not really, but later on in years I, you know, I elaborate these things, you know, no, I didn't…</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">JF: But it was your mother who had pushed you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">HB: Yeah, my mother always pushed me and encouraged me to go, yeah.</span> <span id="s1200">My dad worked anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">JF: What kind of…</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">HB: All during the--my dad was working for a Japanese or a Chinese factory.</span> <span id="s1203">He was a watchman, and it was managed by Japanese.</span> <span id="s1204">They made bolts, nuts and bolts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">JF: You are showing me a picture that you drew on the back of one of your report cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">HB: [laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">JF: Do you want to describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">HB: 1941.</span> <span id="s1209">I don't even know what that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">JF: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">HB: It's just a scribble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">JF: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">HB: Like how old was I, 11 years old, 11 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">JF: Your father was able to work the entire time that you were in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">HB: Well, yes, he did, and he worked for this Chinese factory and it was managed by Japanese.</span> <span id="s1216">I'm sure that these nuts and bolts were not going for any civilian use.</span> <span id="s1217">I'm sure it was going…</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">JF: It was going for the war effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">HB: It was going for the war effort.</span> <span id="s1220">I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">JF: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">HB: But he had a job there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">JF: Do you know whether or not, he was able to work out a way of getting any money to Shanghai before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">HB: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1225">I think the, I remember he hid some American money…</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">JF: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">HB: …after the war in suitcases because it was against the law to even have American money during the tremendous inflation that they had.</span> <span id="s1228">It was against the Chinese government to even own any--people were doing black markets.</span> <span id="s1229">But that's the only kind of money that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">JF: Where do you think they got the American money?</span> <span id="s1231">In, do you think they brought it with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">HB: No, they probably--well, he was, no, he worked for the American Army, too, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">JF: Oh, in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">HB: In Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">JF: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">HB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">JF: What were, not to lose…</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">HB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">JF: Some of the story…</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">HB: My Bar Mitzvah, we were talking about…</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">JF: Let's, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">HB: Yeah, and like I said, they complimented my dad, and it was a regular feast and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">JF: That your mother prepared?</span> <span id="s1244">That the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">HB: No, the people [unclear] from my mother and my aunt and the whole community almost, the whole did prepare for--we were all within the spectrum of this cheder.</span> <span id="s1246">Not the people that were associated with this school, but people that were associated with the cheder and the yeshiva.</span> <span id="s1247">They all made these preparations and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">JF: Special foods?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">HB: Oh, I do not remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">JF: But it felt like a feast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">HB: It felt, yeah, it felt like a feast, yeah and--I attended a wedding there.</span> <span id="s1252">My cousin was married, I mean my cousin's, female, my female cousin…</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">JF: Yes, your, the older…</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">HB: Not girl cousin, the older one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">JF: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">HB: Was married there, and I attended all the sheva berachot, you know, the seven blessings.</span> <span id="s1257">Every day they had a feast.</span> <span id="s1258">That was during the war and they had schnapps and the vodka and all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s1259">I mean…</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">JF: Were you?</span> <span id="s1261">…</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">HB: It was, it was available there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">JF: It was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">HB: It was there, if you had the money to purchase.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">JF: Were you aware of the difficulty that the other refugees were having?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">HB: Yes, we were aware of--we ate, a lot of times we ate in this community kitchen.</span> <span id="s1267">It was, I mean you talking about scar--I mean not all the time, it was plentiful.</span> <span id="s1268">I mean, at that time we had to go to this community kitchen and then we got our meals and then we had some sad, poor, I mean sad-looking people sold their practically the shirt off their back in order to survive there.</span> <span id="s1269">Yes, I seen those.</span> <span id="s1270">I was one of the lucky ones that did not go through that, and I'm sure Mr. Hepner was one of the unlucky ones, what I gather from his video.</span> <span id="s1271">I have to talk to him here, I'll probably meet him here, that you know, that we're in the same category [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">JF: Did you have any idea who was running these community kitchens, where the help was coming from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">HB: The help was coming partially from the religious Jews, because it was managed by mashgiach3 to make sure it's kosher, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">JF: So this particular kitchen was a kosher kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">HB: It was a--yeah.</span> <span id="s1276">It definitely was a kosher kitchen.</span> <span id="s1277">Now I don't know if there were other kitchens or not.</span> <span id="s1278">I have no way of recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">JF: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">HB: The people that lived in these Heime, I don't know if they had their own kitchen or not.</span> <span id="s1281">But that particular kitchen my mother went to and I went to, was a kosher kitchen, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">JF: You mentioned before that you had every illness possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">HB: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">JF: Can you tell me about…</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">HB: But I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1286">I was inoculated.</span> <span id="s1287">We all were inoculated for all these--and I was sent to a--first, I had malaria and recurrent every year, recurrent, and this Dr. Wolff happened to be in our cabin.</span> <span id="s1288">I remember when we came to, when we sailed to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1289">He had a, that he brought from France evidently, he was in France, too, a what is it called, an inoculation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">JF: The vaccine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">HB: The vaccine.</span> <span id="s1292">He had a vaccine that's supposed to have cured malaria and he gave me this vaccine.</span> <span id="s1293">I think he donated it to me somehow, cause I remember, cause, and ever since then I never had a recurrence.</span> <span id="s1294">That's what's weird.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">JF: Were you in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">HB: Not for malaria.</span> <span id="s1297">Yeah, maybe I was, too, but was not an isolation hospital.</span> <span id="s1298">It was the local hospital that was established by the refugees, yes, and then I…</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">JF: Do you remember the name of the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">HB: No, I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">JF: It was the special hospital that was…</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">HB: It was not special hospital.</span> <span id="s1303">See there was a, when I had, when I acquired this typhus and thyphoid, they, I was sent to an isolation hospital that was outside the ghetto, so to speak, and as we were--I was taken by ambulance and I could look outside the ambulance and I remember very vividly that there was a ship at the Bund, you know the Bund thing, you've heard of the Bund.</span> <span id="s1304">The…</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">JF: The avenues.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">HB: Yeah, but the Bund was right by the White River.</span> <span id="s1307">There were all these bank buildings that were built by a certain, by Sassoon families.</span> <span id="s1308">There was the ship laying on its side.</span> <span id="s1309">I don't know what it was so I--it was the Conte Verde, I think.</span> <span id="s1310">It was an Italian luxury liner and the Italians sank it--intended to sink it.</span> <span id="s1311">So the Japanese intended to salvage it for the war effort, and I remember the big chains around the big bank buildings in order to keep it afloat on its side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">JF: The Conte Verde.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">HB: I think it was the Conte Verde.</span> <span id="s1314">Now I could be wrong, but I think it was the Conte Verde, an Italian luxury liner, and that's on the way to the hospital, and all these pictures, I mean I have it in mind, yeah.</span> <span id="s1315">And then I came, I was in the hospital maybe for a week or so, and, gosh, I've seen so many people die of cholera.</span> <span id="s1316">I mean, there was a big auditor, a big ward.</span> <span id="s1317">The ward was, you know…</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">JF: Now this hospital where you were you isolated, was this…</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">HB: It was a Chinese hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">JF: It was a Chinese hospital, ok?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">HB: …aAnd it was, they call it the isolation hospital.</span> <span id="s1322">People with these communicable diseases had to be there.</span> <span id="s1323">People like I say, people were, I might see one person two beds away from me, and next time, he passed away.</span> <span id="s1324">So that was a bad experience for me, seeing these…</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">JF: You were a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">HB: Sure, I was 12, 13, I was 12 and that was a bad experience for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">JF: Were you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">HB: No, 12, 13, maybe I was 14 years, 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">JF: Were you scared about what would happen to you with the diseases?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">HB: Not really, because I know I was being inoculated.</span> <span id="s1331">See the reason why so many Chinese died, they disregarded the inoculation.</span> <span id="s1332">It was initiated by the Japanese, to be inoculated.</span> <span id="s1333">Although the Chinese didn't care, you know, just didn't go for it.</span> <span id="s1334">So what is the consequence of, if they acquired disease, then there wasn't a chance to survive it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">JF: Did the Japanese make the inoculations available to the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">HB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">JF: At no cost?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">HB: At no cost, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">JF: But it was just a matter of whether they decided to follow through on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">HB: Decided, yes, exactly, yeah.</span> <span id="s1341">No, it was mandatory to be inoculated, but then who can control mandatory Chinese.</span> <span id="s1342">[unclear] So…</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">JF: What was the experience like in the other hospital?</span> <span id="s1344">You said you had gone to the refugee hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">HB: Yeah, well I wasn't stay there too long, with just malaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">JF: And that's when you got the vaccine from Dr. Wolff?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">HB: Whether there or not, I do not remember.</span> <span id="s1348">Maybe I got it there, maybe I got it at home.</span> <span id="s1349">I do not remember, yeah.</span> <span id="s1350">But evidently I know that certain, that vaccine I got.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">JF: Did you know of any family members, did you have the experience with family or with friends who died from the illnesses or any other causes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">HB: No, not family members but I've, there was a refugee, I don't know his name--two beds away from me, and he passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">JF: This was in the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">HB: And he talked to the Chinese nurses in German, so they would understand him, so he was already--so, unfortunate individual, I mean very…</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">JF: Now this was in the isolation hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">HB: Yeah, it was in isolation hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">JF: And he died…</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">HB: I never experienced any bad effect in the other hospital, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">JF: When the war started, how did you know?</span> <span id="s1360">How did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">HB: Pearl Harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">JF: Umm.</span> <span id="s1363">Hmmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">HB: Well, it was in the paper.</span> <span id="s1365">We had our Shanghai Jewish Chronicle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">JF: And that's how you found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">HB: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">JF: And what was…</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">HB: During the war, to tell you the truth, instead of seeking shelter, when the B-29's flew over Shanghai to bomb Japan, my cousin and I--all these houses had roofs, like flat roofs.</span> <span id="s1370">We went up the roofs and watched it.</span> <span id="s1371">Never went to a shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">JF: Watched them fly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">HB: Fly--and most humorous account which I was, we had a marine school that was behind our house.</span> <span id="s1374">There was a Japanese marine school, and they tried to get these planes with rifles.</span> <span id="s1375">People were killed more by shrapnel than by, by anti-aircraft, you know by shrapnel than bombs.</span> <span id="s1376">Well, as you recall, you probably heard from somebody else, there was one day, I think it was July 17, 1945, before the war, we were bombed and then [tape two, side one ended] Tape 2, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">JF: This is Tape two, Side two, with an interview with Mr. Herbert Broh.</span> <span id="s1378">We were talking about the bombing of Hongkew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">HB: Yeah, Hongkew, yeah.</span> <span id="s1380">Yeah that's, I remember that episode.</span> <span id="s1381">I was roaming around, there was a place called SACRA.4 That was heavily damaged, this building.</span> <span id="s1382">People lived there.</span> <span id="s1383">It was not a camp like the Ward Road Camp or the--we used to play around.</span> <span id="s1384">We used to play there quite often.</span> <span id="s1385">We were kids.</span> <span id="s1386">And we stuck plenty--we became alienated from the time of the bombing, you know.</span> <span id="s1387">We were evacuated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">JF: You became alienated?</span> <span id="s1389">…</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">HB: Alienated in respect to, we had the same friends that always met there, you know that just, and then somehow we became dispersed, we were dispersed after, because we were going in different directions.</span> <span id="s1391">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s1392">I have no explanation why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">JF: Your experience meant that you had to separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">HB: We had to separate, yeah, because we were evacuated, we put--that particular place was heavily bombed, was heavily damaged.</span> <span id="s1395">The, our house where we lived was not shockproof anymore, so we were evacuated temporarily to the Kadoorie School.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">JF: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">HB: Which was in bungalows.</span> <span id="s1398">They had built bungalows.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">JF: Where, the Kadoorie School where you had gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">HB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1401">Now the first…</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">JF: The one you had attended as a younger child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">HB: Yeah, as a younger child.</span> <span id="s1404">I was 15 then.</span> <span id="s1405">Excuse me--and the--so we were evacuated to the Kadoorie School because there were these bungalows.</span> <span id="s1406">So we lived there just like the Heimes and bunk beds.</span> <span id="s1407">So I had experienced too, how it feels to live not in a house but in a community-type, it was exactly like the way we lived in these Heimes, these camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">JF: So what was that experience like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">HB: For me, it was exciting [laughter].</span> <span id="s1410">I don't know, it was different.</span> <span id="s1411">We had a big courtyard, a big yard, and you know, we had bungalows, a big yard.</span> <span id="s1412">The most, so, but the adverse experience, of course I had was the bodies that we found.</span> <span id="s1413">They pile them up just like wood, the Chinese.</span> <span id="s1414">And I think we lost 30 some or 40 refugees, and they are 300 over [unclear], you know.</span> <span id="s1415">And they had all the marine school that was behind us was damaged, too.</span> <span id="s1416">That's why our house was kind of not shockproof anymore.</span> <span id="s1417">So then, all of a sudden capitulation came, and the day of the, when Japan capitulated, we had an aircraft flying low over the Kadoorie School and dropping leaflets with the signature of General Wiedmeyer.</span> <span id="s1418">I think he thought it was a POW camp.</span> <span id="s1419">I think the plane, he did not probably realize it was just us, humble refugees.</span> <span id="s1420">And it says, "Don't despair," I remember that, "Don't despair, the American forces will be coming your way," blah, blah, blah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">JF: How did that hit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">HB: That, I was kind of aware of what was happening.</span> <span id="s1423">OK, now take this scenario here.</span> <span id="s1424">OK, around the Kadoorie school, there were ammunition dumps, and I've seen it, I still see it.</span> <span id="s1425">I know people who remember it.</span> <span id="s1426">I see the Japanese soldiers guarding these ammunition dumps with fixed bayonets yet.</span> <span id="s1427">Now the war was over the day of the capitulation, and they were guarding these ammunition dumps, it would be.</span> <span id="s1428">If they would not have guarded ammunition with Chinese going in there, it would have been devastation.</span> <span id="s1429">Chinese were throwing crackers, you know their firecrackers.</span> <span id="s1430">That was their New Year's, Chinese New Year's.</span> <span id="s1431">They like the firecrackers--but here that was a risk that they did, because here was still armed Japanese.</span> <span id="s1432">But they didn't harm them, so that same day, the day after the capitulation, some, I think they were the first servicemen that came to the shores of Shanghai, all of a sudden I seen big fellows, I think they must have been Swedes, and they were the flyers of the--and they were coming to apologize to some of the people, who were wounded, and I never forget this in my life.</span> <span id="s1433">If I would have had at that time a camcorder, that would have been something, or a camera.</span> <span id="s1434">A fellow, one of our refugees, had an American flag hidden all through the war years.</span> <span id="s1435">Raised up the American flag and us kids, we were 15, you know, and we sang God Bless America.</span> <span id="s1436">I can

American counterspy.</span> <span id="s1504">So, now then I hear that Ghoya was an American counterspy and he didn't have any choice but to show authority, or humiliation against the refugees.</span>

parents had a leather goods store next to the jewelry store.</span> <span id="s1520">I met them in Santa Monica.</span> <span id="s1521">I'd never met this lady.</span> <span id="s1522">She's about ten years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s1523">A shudder came to me and I stayed over at their house in Santa Monica by coincidence because I met them in a bus.</span> <span id="s1524">I was

Nationalists, the Chinese troops came in, occupied Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">JF: And what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">HB: They were poor looking soldiers with straw boots and straw, I don't know how in the world they survived on the battlefield, very poor equipped soldiers, World War II, World War I cannons.</span> <span id="s1534">All the Japanese had World War I cannons too.</span> <span id="s1535">Then later on, little by little, the Navy came in and the Armed Forces came in.</span> <span id="s1536">Then of course my dad did work for the Armed Forces as a carpenter, I think it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">JF: And that might be where he got the American money, you said…</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">HB: Yeah, it could be, could be, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">JF: The experience after the war in terms of deciding or trying to make plans to leave, do you recall that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">HB: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s1541">Well, we went through HIAS, and HIAS, my dad was lucky because he had the German quota.</span> <span id="s1542">At that time they go, went by quota systems.</span> <span id="s1543">I guess they still do today, I imagine.</span> <span id="s1544">And people from Austria, they were not so lucky.</span> <span id="s1545">They had to seek refuge, I mean they had to seek other places to go, because the United States would not take any people from Austria.</span> <span id="s1546">See, my cousin that was married in Shanghai, her husband was Austrian, so he couldn't come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1547">So he went to Australia, Australia.</span> <span id="s1548">Now my cousin, her brother, came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">JF: Your friend, the cousin who you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">HB: My cousin, the her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">JF: The male cousin…</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">HB: Male cousin.</span></p> <p><span

id="s1557">Now he joined the yeshiva.</span> <span id="s1558">I mean he was in the yeshiva and the whole, the complete yeshiva went to Canada first, and then they came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">JF: This is the Mir Yeshiva?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">HB: The Mir Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s1561">I'll tell you another, that was a remarkable story.</span> <span id="s1562">Just take this scenario, the Mir Yeshiva, they were ready to leave Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1563">They were on the boat and the rest of the secular people, I mean the, oh there were a lot of these from the cheder, the teachers from the cheder and the Lubavitchers, a lot of the Lubavitcher people were, there were a mixture of the Lubavitcher and the Lubliner people.</span> <span id="s1564">See they never starved, these Lubliners, the Lubavitcher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">JF: How did you understand that they didn't starve?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">HB: Because I was there.</span> <span id="s1567">I mean I did…</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">JF: You just, you observed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">HB: They had, they were observed, yeah, because I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">JF: You watched them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">HB: I ate with them.</span> <span id="s1572">I dined with them.</span> <span id="s1573">I…</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">JF: How do you understand that that…</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">HB: Well, the thing, the only thing that the Rus--Orthodox Russian Jews support them, and that's the only solution I have.</span> <span id="s1576">If you become religious, you were pretty well off.</span> <span id="s1577">If you remained unobservant, you were losers, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1578">I, it sounds not too fair that way but…</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">JF: So when you talk about the Lubliners, you're talking about the yeshiva…</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">HB: There were just a handful of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">JF: …from the big yeshiva in Lublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">HB: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1583">Right.</span> <span id="s1584">Well, they came from there years ago…</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">JF: Originally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">HB: Also the Lubavitch, some of the Lubavitch, they came from, they were from Lithuania also.</span> <span id="s1587">I think that's where the Lubavitch came from originally.</span> <span id="s1588">Mir, Mir were more modern Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1589">They were not chasidims, they were called misnageds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">JF: The misnagdim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">HB: The misnagdim [also called Mitnagdim; opponents of the chasidim].</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">JF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">HB: So, but they were, of course, religious.</span> <span id="s1594">See they were more maybe learned, or they took their studies very seriously, whereas the chasidims and the Lubavitcher were more of the spiritual--dance a lot, sang a lot.</span> <span id="s1595">I don't say that about, they're very, I'm sure they're very--studious.</span> <span id="s1596">I mean they know about--but, anyway, I was trying to get away from it.</span> <span id="s1597">See, I joined Toastmasters, and that's when I--my father's good for one story, go to the middle, and then go back to the first one.</span> <span id="s1598">So take, so here were the people from the Mir Yeshiva up there, my cousin was there.</span> <span id="s1599">And here, we were the rest of us.</span> <span id="s1600">Now can you picture this turmoil on this wharf, you know, people you know, rickshaws, and what have you.</span> <span id="s1601">We started out to sing Ani Ma'amin.5 Yim Kol ze Ani Ma'amin.</span> <span id="s1602">is the song.</span> <span id="s1603">Ever heard of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">JF: Ani Ma'amin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">HB: Ani Ma'min, you could have hear a pin drop.</span> <span id="s1606">Like a miracle!</span> <span id="s1607">You could've hear a pin drop.</span> <span id="s1608">They started it, we started it.</span> <span id="s1609">That was something else.</span> <span id="s1610">So that was one of these highlights of Shanghai that I never will forget.</span> <span id="s1611">You know the one where they raised the American flag, and singing Ani Ma'amin to the parting yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">JF: Now this--The Mir Yeshiva left before you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">HB: Yeah, before, yeah.</span> <span id="s1614">They left maybe a year before we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">JF: When did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">HB: 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">JF: And you came…</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">HB: Then we went to Minnesota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">JF: You came directly…</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">HB: Oh no, not directly but we [unclear] to San Francisco, see that's…</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">JF: You were able to go to the United States in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">HB: Right, yeah.</span> <span id="s1623">So my, yeah that's another thing.</span> <span id="s1624">My first experience in, my first luxury, there was no luxury in Shanghai, by no means.</span> <span id="s1625">But my first luxury, cause we had to--for one thing, you could not drink water from the faucet.</span> <span id="s1626">You had to drink water, you had to boil it first.</span> <span id="s1627">It was cheaper to buy boiled water from the vendor, than boiling water yourself.</span> <span id="s1628">Gas was too expensive then.</span> <span id="s1629">I never recalled doing, although we had gas, we never used the gas.</span> <span id="s1630">We used the charcoals.</span> <span id="s1631">That's the only way of, cheapest way of doing.</span> <span id="s1632">So anyway, the first, so the first luxury I had, when we went on this ship called, former troop transporter, Marine Adder, I hit the water fountain and drank from the water fountain.</span> <span id="s1633">To me that was the biggest luxury in life.</span> <span id="s1634">Just to, we went back and forth.</span> <span id="s1635">Milk, same thing with milk, you know.</span> <span id="s1636">I came to San Francisco, I remember we bought milk from the store, you know, get milk from the store, in the refrigerator.</span> <span id="s1637">Now I don't drink enough milk.</span> <span id="s1638">I don't drink enough water.</span> <span id="s1639">But the things we take for granted, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">JF: During that time, did you have any information about what was going on in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">HB: Yeah, after the war, of course.</span> <span id="s1642">We had a special…</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">JF: No, during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">HB: No, not during the war.</span> <span id="s1645">I had no conception…</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">JF: You had no idea what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">HB: No conception.</span> <span id="s1648">No conception, no.</span></p> <p><span

knowledge.</span> <span id="s1653">Maybe my parents knew, but not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">JF: It wasn't discussed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">HB: It wasn't discussed, no.</span> <span id="s1656">I don't think the news were, it was only in the Japanese Theater.</span> <span id="s1657">There was not too much of a, well, sure there was news of Europe, but never, I don't think there was, maybe somebody remembered here, but I sure didn't.</span> <span id="s1658">See I did my thing.</span> <span id="s1659">I went to cheder.</span> <span id="s1660">I went to this and I worked in this jewelry store...</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">JF: And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">HB: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">JF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">HB: And you know, we did davening [saying prayers] three times a day.</span> <span id="s1665">That was another little--this fellow was shomer Shabbat [Sabbath observant], you know, Mr. Brenner, he was owner of the jewelry store, and so he was a little bit of a hypocrite, and here comes one of these rabbis from, I don't know whether he was a Lubavitcher, or he was and he bought something from me.</span> <span id="s1666">And it was late in the afternoon and he asked me--he used to call me Herschel, you know, can you speak Yiddish?</span> <span id="s1667">And he said in Yiddish, "Herschel du hast shon gedavent Mincha?</span> <span id="s1668">[Have you said the afternoon prayer?]</span> <span id="s1669">I said, no, I didn't.</span> <span id="s1670">He said, "Oh take your eyes off and daven Mincha."</span> <span id="s1671">I know just to make me…</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">JF: To go, to daven and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">HB: Mincha in the afternoon, to show this fellow that he was strict with this; he never cared about every day.</span> <span id="s1674">He cared less whether I did Mincha every day, you know, who cares, but just because he was standing there buying some, intending to buy some merchandise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">HB: He was standing to the other room…</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">JF: So you did speak Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">HB: Yeah, that's how we learned in cheder, in yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">JF: You didn't, not from

when they have to give a lecture or you know, an essay of some sort, a lecture of some kind, of what we learned, we spoke in a very High German.</span> <span id="s1686">Some people could not adapt to the Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1687">It was, we were laughing at them, because we were, we were speaking with High German.</span> <span id="s1688">But like I said, I did have a grand time there, all through the years.</span> <span id="s1689">I never had any regrets, never.</span> <span id="s1690">I wish I could go back sometimes, you know.</span> <span id="s1691">A lot of people went back there,

of my life?</span> <span id="s1694">Being, well there was always a rub-off of Judaism.</span> <span id="s1695">I was thankful.</span> <span id="s1696">And indirectly, which I didn't mention before, indirectly I have to thank Mr. Sugihara for my higher learning in Judaism, because due to him the Mir Yeshiva came to the, came to, well, they went to Kobe, then they went to, I have his book by the way.</span> <span id="s1697">I bought his book.</span> <span id="s1698">His son is lecturing all over the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">HB:

this, in the ghetto, the ghetto area.</span> <span id="s1708">But, you know--but it was through them, it's obvious, Mir Yeshiva was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">JF: This was the most significant piece…</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">HB: The most significant, yeah.</span> <span id="s1711">I would say the most significant aspect of, that's why I am a cantor now.</span> <span id="s1712">I'm a cantor in Sun City, California.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">JF: So you studied here, or you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">HB: No, I said, I remember, I remember…</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">JF: …was from your learning there…</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">HB: Yeah, I to conduct services there, I primarily learned from Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1717">Now there are certain prayers that as a matter of fact, when I was hired, so to speak, I was working, and then I did this part-time.</span> <span id="s1718">I went down to Fairfax Avenue, you know where that is in Los Angeles?</span> <span id="s1719">I bought a training, cantorial training records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">JF: Ok [chuckle].</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">HB: That was 22 years ago, and I'm there 22 years in that Congregation.</span> <span id="s1722">And I don't have any [unclear] so I made a tape, on 78 records I made it, you know, cassette tapes, and then it came back more or less.</span> <span id="s1723">I had the biggest, the scariest part was the Kol Nidre.</span> <span id="s1724">I want to have it, make it perfect, you know.</span> <span id="s1725">So I even took Perry Como's rendition of Kol Nidre, that's a pretty good rendition and, actually I took it between him and between another cantor on that record, so, I did ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">JF: Is there anything else you would like to add, before we stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">HB: Well, I never had any remorse being there.</span> <span id="s1728">To me, it was an exciting time and it was, we had, it was, I only can't speak for my parents, they're the ones that lived in anxiety, didn't know about the results of this, hadn't even heard of this doctor so called, Meisinger that came, and from the Butcher of Warsaw, wasn't it, and tried to annihilate us.</span> <span id="s1729">But the bottom line, the biggest irony is--you couldn't say that the Japanese rule was an antisemitic rule, because the simple reason, the Russian Jews lived outside the ghetto, like free people.</span> <span id="s1730">The Iraqian Jews were in turn like with the rest of the internees and were treated the same way, not as Jews.</span> <span id="s1731">So we were the so-called stateless refugees, which were primarily Jews.</span> <span id="s1732">In order, in my evaluation, in order to pacify the Germans, the Japanese had to do something.</span> <span id="s1733">Remember the Fiddler on the Roof, in order to pacify the Czar they made this disturbance during the wedding.</span> <span id="s1734">The same thing.</span> <span id="s1735">And so I never, I myself never had any animosity against the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1736">Now my cousin that lived here in Philadelphia, they wouldn't even, I don't think now, I don't know how the attitude changed, but they wouldn't buy a Japanese car.</span> <span id="s1737">People had bad experiences with some Japanese people and so is war, I mean, you know.</span> <span id="s1738">The Marines did bad things to the Japanese, too, I mean, but again, I mean, there is no comparison.</span> <span id="s1739">The Bataan march, I mean the atrocities that they did.</span> <span id="s1740">I seen atrocities against the Chinese, when I was there before the war, before the, no, before the American war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">JF: You saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">HB: Yeah, you know they hit the Chinese, [unclear] you know, then we had these, I don't know whether I mentioned this already or not, we had a French gendarme, and a Japanese gendarme, and an American soldier, and a British soldier guarding the guard bridge, and, of course, the Chinese, when they crossed over, they had to bow to the Japanese, and in case they didn't bow then they would butt the rifles.</span> <span id="s1743">I've seen that, so they treated the Chinese very badly, you know.</span> <span id="s1744">That's the only time I, but I didn’t see severe atrocities, and beggars, that was a common sight.</span> <span id="s1745">And a common sight during the wintertime, not our people, but the refugees and the Chinese used to pick them up like a garbage collector on a pitch fork, I've seen that.</span> <span id="s1746">That's the only thing that kind of…</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">JF: That stays in your mind…</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">HB: Stays in your, in my mind, the… [tape two, side two ended] Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">JF: This is Tape three, Side one, of an interview with Mr. Herbert Broh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">HB: I said that--I started to say what I've learned and what my reaction was living in China, if there was any aftereffects, did it affect me in later years?</span> <span id="s1751">No, it didn't, but I've learned lessons, many lessons.</span> <span id="s1752">One lesson I mentioned is that human life was, there was no value in human life, primarily among the Chinese people in those days and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">JF: You mean the, when you said there was no value, you mean this is how the Japanese perceived it or the Chinese?</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">HB: Well, among themselves even, among the Chinese themselves there was no, the Japanese had at least made it mandatory that the Chinese were inoculated in order to, not to spread disease, but the Chinese would never had done that, and so--survival was, of Chinese beggars, the ones that couldn't make it, survival was on the minimum, and of things that is in my mind again, is that the starving Chinese people were, especially among the beggars, they died on the street and they--even the people that were not beggars, had the infants, they wrapped them around and let them freeze to death, or maybe they were dead already in their straw mats, and I've seen that, and I could not, well I could not figure out why, and at the end of a week or so, then a truck came and they had pitchforks.</span> <span id="s1755">They picked up those corpses like garbage cans, I mean like garbage collectors.</span> <span id="s1756">Now that sticks in my mind, yes, but it did not affect me per se.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">JF: But it's something that you remembered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">HB: Something I, something that I remember.</span> <span id="s1759">Of course, the primitive living that we lived during the time, I remember, when we did not have all the luxury we had in our first house, of course.</span> <span id="s1760">But again, we survived that.</span> <span id="s1761">It was no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">JF: You mentioned before about Mr. Meisinger…</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">HB: Yeah, I had no inkling about that until after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">JF: What was your understanding of what that was all about?</span> <span id="s1765">How do you understand?</span> <span id="s1766">How did you understand it at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">HB: Well, that was already after the war and you know, because I guess he was, according to the paper then, they described all the Treblinka camps, and they had a whole series in our local paper and all, and I could not believe that the Japanese would do that, would annihilate the Jewish population, including the Russian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">JF: When you were aware when he came to Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">HB: I was not aware, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">JF: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">HB: I was not aware.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">JF: So were you aware that there was some talk about whether or not there was a plan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">HB: Nah ah, no I have, until after the war I've learned it.</span> <span id="s1774">I learned it after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">JF: And…</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">HB: As a matter of fact, I did not learn it after I came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">JF: And when you learned it, how was it described to you?</span> <span id="s1778">Was it described as an actual plan to annihilate the Jews in Shanghai...</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">HB: That's right.</span> <span id="s1780">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">JF: Or that it was a hoax?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">HB: No, no.</span> <span id="s1783">I thought it was a hoax, but they were, the rumors were, I don't know, I cannot confirm that, that they were starting to build already preparation for a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">JF: This is what you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">HB: That's what I heard, yeah.</span> <span id="s1786">I cannot confirm or deny either that they was starting to, and then miraculously the, I guess the atom bomb was bombed and the war was over.</span> <span id="s1787">Now…</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">JF: And then in the concentration camp was to be a death camp or…</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">HB: A death camp, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">JF: It was to be a death camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">HB: It was supposed to be a death camp, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">JF: So your understanding of it, was that there was an actual plan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">HB: A plan, exactly.</span> <span id="s1794">But, not I learned, not until even I came to the States and it wasn't, wasn't even discussed at Shanghai, some reason or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">JF: You don't think your parents were aware of it or it was…</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">HB: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1797">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s1798">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1799">I never was discussed.</span> <span id="s1800">It never, I just heard it from other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">JF: And then what stopped it was the fact that the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">HB: That the war ended, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">JF: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">HB: Now, I talked to a Russian woman here that came to this reunion, and she says that the plan was to annihilate all Jews, and, you know, and due to the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, she was saved.</span> <span id="s1805">I mean her life was saved.</span> <span id="s1806">I still kind of, I'm still in disbelief that this would have had happened, because my conception of the Japanese was that they respected religion because they, did you ever hear of the Amshenower6 Rebbe?</span> <span id="s1807">He was, well, I guess, the Amshenower, he was from the town of Amshinov7 somewhere in Poland or Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1808">He had a beard.</span> <span id="s1809">He looked like Peter, I mean, he like Moses himself.</span> <span id="s1810">He could live outside the perimeter of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1811">He had his own, his own horse and wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">JF: Now was he, was he a refugee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">HB: He was a refugee like everyone else, but they respected him so much and he was respected by others, too.</span> <span id="s1814">He was almost like a saint, like a miracle worker, almost like the Rabbi Schneersohn here.</span> <span id="s1815">That's why, how he was.</span> <span id="s1816">And I know some people think that Rabbi Schneersohn is probably the Messiah, but that--anyway, I don't want to say…</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">JF: But this particular rebbe from the town of--can you spell the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">HB: I only know that his, I cannot even spell it.</span> <span id="s1819">It's Abarron, Abba [phonetic], I just said it, Abrumshike [phonetic].</span> <span id="s1820">Oh G-d, I can't even spell it.</span> <span id="s1821">Abrumpshike [phonetic] whatever, Abrumpshire, Abrumpshire… [phonetic]</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">JF: Ok, but he…</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">HB: …something like that…</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">JF: He was that special?</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">HB: You go back to the tape, I probably said it very clearly.</span> <span id="s1826">But he was, yeah he was, right.</span> <span id="s1827">And as a matter of fact he was blessed.</span> <span id="s1828">He, my cousin that became a rabbi, was blessed by him.</span> <span id="s1829">I remember being, visiting us in that Ohel Moshe Synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">JF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">HB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">JF: Now when you came to the United States…</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">HB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">JF: …You did not stay with the watch repair work…</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">HB: I did, I went, I worked for Jewel--Goodman Jewelers and tried to re-establish my, but I hated every minute of it.</span> <span id="s1836">Then I went to University of Minnesota for a year, and then I dropped that.</span> <span id="s1837">Then finally I came, I was married there in Minnesota and went to, came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1838">I came to…</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">JF: LA?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">HB: …Riverside, California, and then I worked for a company for 40 years in Quality Control.</span> <span id="s1841">I liked this job, and then I acquired this job as a cantor 22 years ago.</span> <span id="s1842">That's so, I'm still doing it and, by the way, you know, when we were sponsored, the way we came to the United States, we were sponsored by a pretend cousin of ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">JF: Ah!</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">HB: I don't know if you know that.</span> <span id="s1845">If you are aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">JF: A pretend cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">HB: A pretend cousin.</span> <span id="s1848">In other words, a cousin, I forgot his name, but his family lived in Cleveland and supposed to be improvised cousin of ours sponsored…</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">JF: Did you know…</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">HB: Yeah, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">JF: You knew of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">HB: They were strangers, but you, in other words, the stipulation, the conditions was that we were not supposed to be in touch with.</span> <span id="s1853">In other words, they were sponsoring us, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1854">It was a pretend cousin in order, to quicker, to sponsor to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">JF: Who organized that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">HB: The HIAS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">JF: This was through HIAS.</span> <span id="s1858">Ok.</span> <span id="s1859">And they were getting backers, anonymous backers…</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">HB: Backers, yeah, anonymous backers, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">JF: Basically, so you never…</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">HB: But I thought they told us not to come in contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">JF: And did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">HB: No, we didn't.</span> <span id="s1865">We never had any reason to, any reason to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">JF: Ok.</span> <span id="s1867">Is there anything else that you want to add at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">HB: Well, I can't think of anything except the emotional aspect that I experienced in Shanghai, like I told you about, and I'd like to visit Shanghai sometime again.</span> <span id="s1869">I, well I have a little, I have friends, Chinese people now, that they are almost mish-poche [family] with me.</span> <span id="s1870">I'll tell you why.</span> <span id="s1871">Met them in this, met them here, and I have a friend, my friend--I have a friend that I live with.</span> <span id="s1872">She always wanted these--let's put it this way, she was a friend of the family, and I am staying with her now.</span> <span id="s1873">Since I had heart surgery, I'm staying with her, and she had a graduate student, that she rents out a room for a graduate student.</span> <span id="s1874">She lives right close by the University of California, of Southern, University of Riverside, Cali--Southern California, Riverside, U-C-R, and this Chinese, it happened to be a Chinese girl, and she was born in Shanghai, and she, her parents are still in Shanghai, and she graduated, and she, so there was a common bond between her and I.</span> <span id="s1875">We talked about streets and so on, and, unfortunately why I never learned to speak Chinese.</span> <span id="s1876">When I was in the Korean war, I would have had it made if I would have known Chinese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">JF: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">HB: Because I would have been an interpreter then.</span> <span id="s1879">But unfortunately I never adopted that language, because we didn't need to.</span> <span id="s1880">We had our own language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">JF: You learned Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1882">[laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">HB: Between Yiddish, between Yiddish, German and English, you know.</span> <span id="s1884">So [laughter], anyway, so she fell in love with a fellow from Taiwan, very unique, and they were married.</span> <span id="s1885">They have two kids now, and we were so-called, this lady and I, we were her adopted parents, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1886">On her wedding, we were invited to her wedding in Fremont, California.</span> <span id="s1887">So I, she asked me if I wanted to be the entertainer, because I play the musical saw.</span> <span id="s1888">This is carpenter saw, and I play on my harmonica.</span> <span id="s1889">[laughter] So I did, and I--they want to hire somebody else, a fiddler or somebody, and then they, she heard me and she went, "Hey Herb, why don't you do this?"</span> <span id="s1890">So I did and I [unclear].</span> <span id="s1891">So I do double-talk, and I said would they be offended if I would double talk Chinese, you know in a satire way.</span> <span id="s1892">So she said no, no, no, and the master of ceremony, who was her friend, I asked the same question and she said, no, go ahead.</span> <span id="s1893">So I did and what I've learned about China and Shanghai and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s1894">And I played some, I played a tune, a Chinese tune which I had no idea what I was playing because I just adopted the hearing, you know the sound, and would you believe that people, old-timers, were humming that tune.</span> <span id="s1895">I had no idea what I was playing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">JF: But it stayed with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">HB: It stayed with me, yeah.</span> <span id="s1898">So, anyway, I saw that there were not [unclear] this on their wedding.</span> <span id="s1899">He was, her husband worked for pharmaceutical.</span> <span id="s1900">He also went to UCR, and he works in statistics, a very good job for the pharmaceutical company.</span> <span id="s1901">So anyway, so they have, so they had a child.</span> <span id="s1902">They have two children now, and they called me Poppy, that child, and they called my friend Bubby, so, and anyhow, they, one of these days, I might marry this woman and who knows, you know, and now they have another child, and we are so close, so close.</span> <span id="s1903">So when, if I go to Shanghai, before, oh, she wanted to bring her parents to this country and she is, you know, she still wants to.</span> <span id="s1904">But I like to go there when they are still living in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1905">I mean I have a good place to go, and they want, they had some pictures I want to show you.</span> <span id="s1906">They have some pictures that they took presently of Hongkew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">JF: That would be a wonderful way for you to go back?</span> <span id="s1908">Wouldn't it?</span> <span id="s1909">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">HB: Yeah, it would be.</span> <span id="s1911">Before they would come to this country, you know.</span> <span id="s1912">So that's--and I have, remarkably, we have so many Chinese--their friends, and it's coincidental that she prefers, that she had an American student now, but she prefers Asians.</span> <span id="s1913">Why?</span> <span id="s1914">Because they are just like family, because they don't have anybody here, and they are just like family, and all the Asians that she had in her rental, they all contact, they e-mail to her and everything.</span> <span id="s1915">They still contact with her.</span> <span id="s1916">That's beautiful, so anyway it, China gave me a good optimistic, a good, not optimistic, but a good attitude and a good, not an adversity, by no means.</span> <span id="s1917">We've seen a lot of anguish, a lot of things that stay with you, of course, but personally I never regretted it and I would do it over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">JF: Mr. Broh, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">HB: Oh, you're welcome.</span> <span id="s1920">I…</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">JF: So much…</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">HB: I sometimes, I can't think.</span> <span id="s1923">You know, you want to say things that I can't express…</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">JF: You have said a great deal, and I thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">HB: Oh, you're welcome.</span> <span id="s1926">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">JF: This is an additional memory that Mr.Broh would like to add to his testimony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">HB: While I wanted to show Josey Fisher some Shanghai pictures, I came across a picture of my mother here, that, when she was working, and I forgot to mention this in the tapes.</span> <span id="s1929">She was working all through the war years for the kindergarten, used to be the Komor8 kindergarten.</span> <span id="s1930">I think Komor, I don't know, is he related to the Kadoories or the Sassoon family somewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">JF: No, he worked with them, but he was separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">HB: Oh, oh, he was separate.</span> <span id="s1933">Was he Iraqi also?</span> <span id="s1934">Was he an Iraqi Jew?</span> <span id="s1935">Was he…</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">JF: No, I don't believe he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">HB: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1938">I don't remember but anyhow it was Komor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">JF: K-O-M-O-R, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">HB: K-O-M-O-R, yeah, and it's kindergarten, and as I can see, there are some ruins in the background, which was the ruins from the 1937 war with Japan, and this particular kindergarten was rebuilt.</span> <span id="s1941">It was in the backyard of the, I use to hang around there quite a few times, and this picture is with the staff.</span> <span id="s1942">And this is my mother.</span> <span id="s1943">This here is my mother.</span> <span id="s1944">She was a cook in this kinder, in that particular kindergarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">JF: Now she was able to do this throughout the time…</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">HB: Throughout the war years, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">JF: Because this…</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">HB: Just like the Kadoorie School existed during the war years, which, of course, all the English teachers, all the were British subjects, whoever can recall to…</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">JF: Because it was outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">HB: No, no, well, yeah, but no.</span> <span id="s1951">But this, no, that was within the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">JF: It was within the ghetto but it still functioned during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">HB: It still functioned, yeah.</span> <span id="s1954">But no, the Kadoorie School, now there was some contradicting statements that was made yesterday.</span> <span id="s1955">Now, I'm not sure if the bungalows I
