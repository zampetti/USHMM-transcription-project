I’d like to start by asking you about your liberation experience.</span> <span id="s14">What was the moment of liberation like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Answer: Well, we got liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s16">We didn’t know anything til the lagerfuehrer came in and told us we are freed.</span> <span id="s17">We didn’t hear no noises, nothing.</span> <span id="s18">The – the older SSs left, and we were surrounded only by the lagerfuehrer, who was from Czechoslovakia, a girl, a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s19">So we really don’t know anything much about it.</span> <span id="s20">But the ru-ru-Russian government declared it liberated, and that’s all wa – we knew [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: When you heard that you were free, that you were liberated, what did that mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: We were in a small town.</span> <span id="s23">Because we were on the front line, we were given the ammunition for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s24">So we were in a farm, in a – in a stable full of hay, that we slept in.</span> <span id="s25">And when they came in and said we got liberated, everybody start running.</span> <span id="s26">This is the way it started.</span> <span id="s27">That was January 21st, winter, cold, and we were shivering in a barn.</span> <span id="s28">The first thing people went, and they were looking for food.</span> <span id="s29">Everybody grabbed what they find in the farm.</span> <span id="s30">They tried to get the milk from the cow, because the farmers just had left when we got there.</span> <span id="s31">The first thing that we did was we – by the time we realized that there is no more food left, I grabbed a little pig running in the stable.</span> <span id="s32">I took a fork, one that i – cleaning the stables, and we punched into the pig, and with everything in it, we made a fi – bonfire and we sat down, about 10 - 12 girls with potatoes and that’s what was our first meal.</span> <span id="s33">Everybody was first laughing.</span> <span id="s34">I took my belt and I tie it around the pig after I caught him, and I start to make a bonfire.</span> <span id="s35">So, got the heat, to warm up a little, and maybe about an hour later, we all start eating on the pig.</span> <span id="s36">That was our first meal.</span> <span id="s37">And then we started up walking.</span> <span id="s38">We had no facilities, no cars, no bicycles, nothing.</span> <span id="s39">Whatever we had – we took our clothes that we had on us, nothing else, and we start going towards the city.</span> <span id="s40">And when we got to the city, we asked the people how we go down south.</span> <span id="s41">Got liberated in Estonia.</span> <span id="s42">And from there we walked, we start walking.</span> <span id="s43">We walked from January to March.</span> <span id="s44">This is the way we got home, were no transportation.</span> <span id="s45">Because we were offered a couple of rides from the Russians.</span> <span id="s46">We were 10 girls, we are still in touch.</span> <span id="s47">One of them – two of them passed away since then.</span> <span id="s48">Eight is still – we still talking occasionally together.</span> <span id="s49">One is in Canada, couple of them are in Brooklyn, couple of them in Israel I just visited.</span> <span id="s50">And we are in touch.</span> <span id="s51">The 10 of us made a group, and like a chain, we jumped from one [indecipherable] to another one, because there were no bridges.</span> <span id="s52">And this was the way we crossed the rivers.</span> <span id="s53">We went into houses, and whatever we found, we ate.</span> <span id="s54">In certain houses, there was hot food on the stove, and I told them, don’t eat, cause if it’s hot, there must be poison in it.</span> <span id="s55">So we ate raw potatoes.</span> <span id="s56">We were sleeping during the day, and we were running at night, because we were afraid of the Russians.</span> <span id="s57">They picked us up once with a car, one girl went up the car and he start the motor running.</span> <span id="s58">So as soon as we see that they start rolling, we pulled her down from the truck.</span> <span id="s59">And I said, no more lifts, we have to walk.</span> <span id="s60">And there was no trains, everything was banned.</span> <span id="s61">Nothing was going.</span> <span id="s62">So the only way we were able to go was by foot.</span> <span id="s63">And wherever got dark, we start running.</span> <span id="s64">During the day, we were sleeping wherever we found a place, in a barn, in a house.</span> <span id="s65">Everything was opened.</span> <span id="s66">You could go in any house, there was no people around there, until we got to Poland.</span> <span id="s67">And then already there we ask in Polish, that’s all that we knew was, [speaks Polish here]</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Translate for me, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: I don’t speak Polish either.</span> <span id="s70">That’s all Polish we know that we ask her, how many kilomete – kilometers is to the station.</span> <span id="s71">That’s what we know Polish from the Polish girls that we were in lager together.</span> <span id="s72">And they said there is no station.</span> <span id="s73">So we kept on walking, and we walked til March.</span> <span id="s74">Purim, just before Purim, we arrived to Budapest.</span> <span id="s75">And there already, we were home, because we spoke the language.</span> <span id="s76">We were able to speak Hungarian, and we asked the first thing if there’s a Jewish agency.</span> <span id="s77">And we were dir – were directed because Russian ha – occupied the territory, and they told us that there is a communist government there, and we should go to the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Did you get any assistance from the Russians along the way, after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: No.</span> <span id="s80">We were afraid to take anything.</span> <span id="s81">When we saw them on one side of the street, we run on the other side of the street, because we were afraid from them.</span> <span id="s82">They didn’t have a very good name to people.</span> <span id="s83">Even after the liberation they raped a lot of people; we heard about it.</span> <span id="s84">And when we tried to take a ride and a girl went in the truck, after then, whenever we see them – see – seen them on one side of the street, we run on the other side of the street.</span> <span id="s85">So there was no help, or we didn’t have any help until we got to Hungary, which was two months that we left from one house to another one running.</span> <span id="s86">Then, in Hungary there already, when we got to Hungary they already called our [indecipherable] and explained them, because there was a couple of people who were in the army, and a lot of people who were in jail because they were communists.</span> <span id="s87">So – Jewish people.</span> <span id="s88">There were a lot of them that they jailed them because they were communists.</span> <span id="s89">So when the communist government came over in Europe, they had big positions.</span> <span id="s90">So one called the other one to let him know that the Jewish people are coming back.</span> <span id="s91">We were, by the way, the first group to arrive in Hungary from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s92">And the greeting was, the dead people are coming back from the other world.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: What was the state of your health at liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, most of us were frozen.</span> <span id="s95">To that extent that the – from Budapest, they took us by train home, and the first thing that they – I got home at Decs(ph) they put us in the hospital, and the first thing they’d give us was a bathtub full of ice, cause we were frostbitten.</span> <span id="s96">And that’s the – we were skinny, very – skeletons.</span> <span id="s97">Really, whe – if you look on us, they would say really that the dead people are coming from the other world.</span> <span id="s98">And we were in the hospital maybe about two weeks.</span> <span id="s99">There they checked us and they gave us medication, and they gave us little by little food, til towards the end, after two weeks, they discharge us from the hospital.</span> <span id="s100">That was in Decs(ph), which was a couple of miles from the town where we lived before the deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Among the 10 people, the tan – the 10 women that you were with, were any of them from your hometown, or related to you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: We were four sisters, survived together.</span> <span id="s103">And there was one cousin, and one girl that my brother used to go out before th-the concentration camp, and before the ghetto.</span> <span id="s104">But when they met, my brother was married already, because he didn’t come straight home.</span> <span id="s105">She was a third cousin, and also a friend that we were together in the same camp.</span> <span id="s106">And two of them were from our town, and the rest of them are from the vicinity – we all 10 were from the same ghetto.</span> <span id="s107">And we were all the way to – almost all the way together.</span> <span id="s108">Nine were together all the way from – starting from the ghetto, and once my sister we met in Stutthof, where she was in a different – from a different area one.</span> <span id="s109">And a girl that was with us found her sister in the other camp.</span> <span id="s110">So they changed their dresses at night, and they came to the fences.</span> <span id="s111">She came to us, and the other sister went to her, being that we were three, so my sister should be together, we changed places with the other girl.</span> <span id="s112">And this is the way we were together from September til January, til they liberated us.</span> <span id="s113">Because we were first – from Auschwitz they took us to ri – Kaiserwald, and then there were Riga, and from Riga to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s114">Then at Stutthof we met our other sister.</span> <span id="s115">Cause always whenever you ge – went to a new camp, we ask, is there anybody from the area.</span> <span id="s116">And when they told us who it was, we got to speak through the fence.</span> <span id="s117">And through the wire fence, we picked – raised the fence so they changed clothes, and the numbers, and this way we got together.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: When you came back to Budapest, and were then taken by tr – by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: And then put in the hospital, who took care of you in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: In – in the hospital they – they – already they were a communist organization and they was running mostly by the Jews who were jailed because they were communists.</span> <span id="s122">They were leaders in the government that time, and they arranged it.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Who were the doctors that cared for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: The doctors that cared for us were Romanian Hungarian, the ones that they – we didn’t know them because before we left in the lager, most of the doctors were Jewish, but by that time there was the government doctors because th – they put in doctors from all over.</span> <span id="s125">It was a big hospital, still in existence now, it’s a big hospital.</span> <span id="s126">And that’s where they put us, right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: You mentioned that your group of 10 were the first to come back from the camps.</span> <span id="s128">Were there any other former prisoners in the hospital with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: No.</span> <span id="s130">There was nobody.</span> <span id="s131">We were the first group that ever came back.</span> <span id="s132">So there was no other group.</span> <span id="s133">The only one – there were a couple of Jewish people like I said, they were in jail.</span> <span id="s134">And they were government agencies now, because after the liberation that Russia took over from that part, they became officials.</span> <span id="s135">So they put us into the hospital and they took care of us.</span> <span id="s136">And after them, they opened the kitchen for people that they start coming from other countries.</span> <span id="s137">They came, not from the lagers, they came from the other part of Romania, people who wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s138">So they had to go through that area, so they came to find that from the family.</span> <span id="s139">But originally, when they started, there was nobody else.</span> <span id="s140">We were the first ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: During your time when you were freed by the Russians, and your travel, your walk home, did you witness any acts of retaliation against collaborators or former guards from the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: No, we didn’t – we – we were – were running at night where we didn’t see nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Right after the war, when you were freed and making your way back, was your view of Judaism the same as it had been when you were a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: At that point it was still pretty strong, because we – we didn’t know that – we figure we go home and everybody will come home too.</span> <span id="s145">We didn’t realize that they – they wouldn’t come back any more.</span> <span id="s146">That time we didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s147">We were together, so we figure maybe they are together someplace, and they will come home.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: What efforts did you make to try and find members of your family, and friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Well, the first effort we made is we went home to our town and waited to see.</span> <span id="s150">So we got home in March, and April was – went back to our town, and we start looking around.</span> <span id="s151">The house was broke – was vacant, nothing in it, no windows, no doors, everything was empty, nothing in the – in the stables, everything was gone.</span> <span id="s152">And we start looking around to see if anybody else came home.</span> <span id="s153">Then we settled in the city, where the hospital was not far, and we’re waiting to see who else is coming.</span> <span id="s154">So the – all the effort that we had at that point was waiting to see, after the liberation from other camps to see who’s coming.</span> <span id="s155">And we waited about two or three months, then they start to come, one by one.</span> <span id="s156">A lot of people came from – to our town, from our town and from the city.</span> <span id="s157">From the ghetto there must have been about 8,000 - 8,500 maybe, maybe 400 people came back all total.</span> <span id="s158">But we waited and we asked questions; where would – where they were, whom they seen, and if anybody else is coming, and if they met anybody.</span> <span id="s159">So we were home that [indecipherable] my sister came home with us, and she found her husband, who was an invalid who was in the army.</span> <span id="s160">But he got liberated before, and he was home.</span> <span id="s161">So they met after the war, right away, as soon as she came to the hospital, he came right away, and they were together.</span> <span id="s162">But we were waiting to see who else will come.</span> <span id="s163">And from March, almost another year we stayed home, and we were waiting to see.</span> <span id="s164">Then got a letter towards the end, from my brother, who w-was in Austria, who said he’s waiting to see who else is coming because there was a big DP camp right there, and they had a list of most of the people who got liberated.</span> <span id="s165">But if nobody else is coming home, he suggests we should travel to him, or he’s not coming back.</span> <span id="s166">He will go either to Israel or to South America, because – or to America, because we had family all over.</span> <span id="s167">Before the war, my father was here.</span> <span id="s168">But for my mother’s family, we had a large group here.</span> <span id="s169">My grandfather’s sisters and brothers were here, and their family.</span> <span id="s170">So we knew the names, but we did not have no idea the addresses, we didn’t remember any more.</span> <span id="s171">So we had written, and the papers, they had papers that they were sending overseas to see who was left from the family.</span> <span id="s172">So we waited til around March.</span> <span id="s173">There was a group of Polish people who were entertainers, and they came to our town for Purim in 1946.</span> <span id="s174">And after their – the show, that they were putting up a show in the theater, they were saying, the reason we are entertaining, and we’re going around the country is to let you know that the Russian people are taking prisoners for work.</span> <span id="s175">And when they’re taking them, fortunately, the Jewish people, they’ll be the first one to go again.</span> <span id="s176">So I advise anybody who could just leave, the sooner the better.</span> <span id="s177">So that was Purim.</span> <span id="s178">So the next day we packed, and we start running.</span> <span id="s179">So we went towards my brother.</span> <span id="s180">We figure my brother was in Austria, and it’s crossing the border, so see what’s gonna happen, we’ll meet him, we’ll see what decision gonna make after.</span> <span id="s181">So we packed, and we took a couple of bottles of whiskey, knowing that the Russians, if they are on guard, if we give them a bottle of whiskey, we’ll be able to cross borders.</span> <span id="s182">Money, we didn’t have.</span> <span id="s183">Whatever we were able to put on our back, we put, and we left.</span> <span id="s184">We left, a group about 40.</span> <span id="s185">We met from Decs(ph), we went to the border, which was a couple hours by train.</span> <span id="s186">And then there was a Jewish organization that was working to the borders.</span> <span id="s187">From there they picked up the people to cross them to the border, because there were a lot of people who were trying to bring them to Israel.</span> <span id="s188">And we were ready to go anyplace, to Israel, to the State, just out of the communist group.</span> <span id="s189">So the first thing they took us, we crossed the border, and we walked about 40 - 50 miles, at night too.</span> <span id="s190">We paid off the Russians with whiskey and went through 40 in a group, with three or four people who knew the way, they were the leaders.</span> <span id="s191">And from there the first thing we went to, went to – arrived to the English zone.</span> <span id="s192">I think it was Innsbruck, or whatever name it was, I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s193">And the first thing when we went into the DP camp, they give us injections and they give us a meal and they put us up, and we were waiting to see who else is coming.</span> <span id="s194">And there was a lot of groups already.</span> <span id="s195">Every days new and new people used to arrive.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: I want to pause for just a minute and ask you, when you went back to your hometown, did you feel welcome by your former neighbors – non-Jewish neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: I felt welcome, but there was nothing to stay with.</span> <span id="s198">The house was empty, and they themselves didn’t have too much.</span> <span id="s199">It wasn’t a big city, they were mostly very older people, and poor people in the – in the town.</span> <span id="s200">Because wherever it was before the war, everything was taken away.</span> <span id="s201">So they offered us a meal, and we were there a day or so, then we went into the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Can you give me a time frame, when you left your hometown and – and made your way into Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: We left after Purim, two days after that group – I don’t know, was it March 22nd or 23rd, I don’t remember exactly the date.</span> <span id="s204">That’s when we left our town.</span> <span id="s205">And I just get wi – me and my sister and her husband.</span> <span id="s206">My sister got married one a – on the [indecipherable] date, the time that we was there, and my other sister had already a new baby, so she di –couldn’t leave.</span> <span id="s207">So she was staying home with the baby, and I took the key, we locked up the house, and I said, look, we are leaving.</span> <span id="s208">If they catch us, we’ll come back, we have the apartment.</span> <span id="s209">And if not, whatever you want to do, give it to somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: What year are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: 1946.</span> <span id="s212">March 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: You mentioned that you were in a DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: In –</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I think it was Innsbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: In Innsbruck.</span> <span id="s218">Can you tell me – can you describe what the DP camp was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: There was a small DP camp, maybe 200 people.</span> <span id="s220">They had a kitchen, and they had bunk beds.</span> <span id="s221">And everybody got a blanket and a pillow and a bunk bed.</span> <span id="s222">And we were sleeping with the – in the – in there it must have been about 20 - 30 people in a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Do you know which agencies provided assistance for that DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: It was an underground agency that ca – that came and took us to the camp.</span> <span id="s225">At that time it was the – the English zone, so I don’t know which – i-it was UNRRA, I don’t know what – what agency was involved, UNRRA was involved with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Who else was in the DP camp with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: When I left from – my sister, only my sister with her husband was there, and there was a lot of people from our town that we still in touch.</span> <span id="s228">They live in the New York area.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Were there people from other nationalities?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Oh, there were Polish people, German people, French people, Belgian people, from all the camps.</span> <span id="s231">And they were trying to get to an area to be able to go further, because other people did not want to go back home to their own town.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: How did the different people get along?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Pretty good.</span> <span id="s234">Everybody went to town to find out more information, and there they had bulletin boards.</span> <span id="s235">And th – by the kitchen there was a big board that everybody was – was able to write down for who they are looking and for what par – from where they coming, and anybody what group they are looking.</span> <span id="s236">At that point I put a sign that I am looking for the Weinstein(ph) family from America, if anybody knows where they are located.</span> <span id="s237">And I was there only maybe two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s238">My brother was in the American zone.</span> <span id="s239">He was in Bad Gastein, which was a one night ride by train from where I was.</span> <span id="s240">So he send over – a couple came from Bad Gastein, my brother paid them, and another person.</span> <span id="s241">It was a husband and wife group, and they came with Austrian clothes.</span> <span id="s242">And my brother wrote me a letter that somebody will visit me, cause he couldn’t talk on the telephone.</span> <span id="s243">And she came over with a letter from my brother to the camp, and she says, my brother sent for me.</span> <span id="s244">And I got dressed in Austrian clothing, and I was the wife for her husband, and a friend of mine that I knew, he was supposed to be the husband for her.</span> <span id="s245">We changed.</span> <span id="s246">From one couple, they made two couples.</span> <span id="s247">Like he’s Austrian and I’m his wife, and she was Austrian and my friend was the husband.</span> <span id="s248">And he says, just sit in the train and you don’t say nothing.</span> <span id="s249">And if anybody comes asking questions, make believe you’re sleeping and I will be dudi – doing the talking.</span> <span id="s250">So we took a train in the afternoon, and we went a couple hours.</span> <span id="s251">Then we had to stop because there was no train further that day.</span> <span id="s252">And we shared a hotel room that we all slept, the four of us on – on the floor in a hotel room, because there was no room.</span> <span id="s253">And then the next day we got dressed and we went with another train, and we arrived to Bad Gastein.</span> <span id="s254">That place already my brother was there, he was married with his wife.</span> <span id="s255">And that was in a hotel.</span> <span id="s256">The – is – was a – that was already American zone, and it was [indecipherable] from the American organization.</span> <span id="s257">They had a store that people used to go and pick out the clothes.</span> <span id="s258">There was old clothes, but cleaned, and you registered there and you get food.</span> <span id="s259">But being I was a outsider, I came in illegal, I couldn’t register.</span> <span id="s260">So I had a job in the kitchen that I peeled potatoes and carrots, just to have my food.</span> <span id="s261">And at night I didn’t have where to sleep, so my brother had the room with his wife, and with two other fellows.</span> <span id="s262">So we slept five in one room.</span> <span id="s263">My brother had one bed with his wife, and the two boys have – had one bed.</span> <span id="s264">And then whoever came from our group, we were in the alley, sleeping in the room.</span> <span id="s265">And we were working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s266">This is the way we lived there until a month and a half, then they got a job for us, legally, they legalized that [indecipherable] are there.</span> <span id="s267">And then they start registration for people underage to go to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: When you met with other survivors, whether they were with – meeting your brother, or meeting people from your hometown, or meeting people from different places, in the DP camps and along the way, did – what kinds of things did you all talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Everybody ask, where were you?</span> <span id="s270">Who do you see?</span> <span id="s271">Who died, and who do you know where they was left?</span> <span id="s272">That was the only questions that were able to ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Did you have to register or sign up or do anything in order to come to the United States?</span> <span id="s274">If that was your plan, what did you have to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Well, first we didn’t have no plans at all.</span> <span id="s276">By then they had a notice that anybody under 18 to register, because there are gonna be a children group, the first group to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s277">But you have to register in order to be able to be in it.</span> <span id="s278">So I went and I registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Seventeen.</span> <span id="s281">And we went downstairs to register and after we register we have to go for medical checkups to – to get the visa.</span> <span id="s282">So when I walked into the doctor’s office, I saw somebody that I recognized from – it was our – we lived in a town, but he lived in the city.</span> <span id="s283">And he played as – he was the doctor that it was supposed to examine.</span> <span id="s284">I know his brother was a dentist, but he was never a doctor, he was in a mental institu – they were saying that he was a little crazy from overworking in a yeshiva.</span> <span id="s285">When I saw him I said to him, Crazy Blatt(ph), what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s286">He says, please don’t tell anybody anything.</span> <span id="s287">I will sign you all the papers, you will be ready to go in the first group, but don’t mention to anybody that you know me.</span> <span id="s288">I said, okay, you got a deal, provided I don’t take no medication and no injections.</span> <span id="s289">If you want to take an x-ray, fine.</span> <span id="s290">You can check me up if you have to, but you don’t need to.</span> <span id="s291">So he sign me all the papers, he took a chest x-ray, and I was the first one [indecipherable], I left for Feldafing.</span> <span id="s292">That was in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: So Blaut(ph) was his last name –</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Blatt(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Blatt(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: – was his last name.</span> <span id="s298">In the DP camp, in this one and in any other camps also, but after the war, did you notice a different moral standard among the survivors after –</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s300">There was a lot of people who they were sick, there was a lot of people who were disbelievers.</span> <span id="s301">There were all different kind of a groups.</span> <span id="s302">They didn’t believe that this thing could happen, and no matter what who you were talking, they said, pinch me to see if I’m alive.</span> <span id="s303">I just don’t believe that this could happen in this generation, in this type of a world.</span> <span id="s304">So many people were bewildered over it.</span> <span id="s305">A lot of people got married there, but non-Jews.</span> <span id="s306">There was a lot of intermarriages in the – in the towns there.</span> <span id="s307">A lot of people didn’t believe in anything.</span> <span id="s308">It was like a wild dreams for a lot of people, they couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s309">And then when the groups start working, and organizations came in, they came in from this – in the Bad Gastein, they had a big group of Jews.</span> <span id="s310">They had a couple hotels, big hotels.</span> <span id="s311">They were staying in there, Hitler’s supposed to be staying in that [indecipherable] up in the hills.</span> <span id="s312">Was loaded with DP campers.</span> <span id="s313">The place was just beautiful.</span> <span id="s314">Downstairs in the basement there were bathtubs, with hot water coming from the springs.</span> <span id="s315">It was beautiful hotels.</span> <span id="s316">We were in the Hotel Austria.</span> <span id="s317">I – I would like to go back one day to see it again, because it is – Austria, it’s a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s318">Got beautiful waterfalls, and the movies, everything they give special tickets, they used to have shows, and anybody from the DP camp used to go in with half price.</span> <span id="s319">The people were – the Austrian people that – in that area, in that particular town, were very nice to the DP campers.</span> <span id="s320">But I was there only a short time, and after I got the papers to go to Feldafing, which the doctor signed them to me over right away, we went to Feldafing, there was a strike, a boat strike.</span> <span id="s321">That time the boats weren’t coming through to the United States.</span> <span id="s322">And we were supposed to leave in November, but instead of that, in the beginning of November, we left in the end of November, because there was a strike.</span> <span id="s323">And in Bremerhaven, the children used to come in that we ended up sleeping three in a bunk bed, because it got overcrowded.</span> <span id="s324">And even then we went already to the boat, we were supposed to take the boat in the 19th of nove – of November, the boat left the 22nd or the 23rd of November.</span> <span id="s325">And we went a couple of hours or a day and a half, I don’t remember exactly, and boat got a hole in the water and we had to stay in the English channels for the winter.</span> <span id="s326">We had to jump the boat in the little crafts, were waiting for another boat.</span> <span id="s327">So we started that with Marine Fletcher, the boat, and then we went to the Marine Marlin.</span> <span id="s328">And took us almost a month to get here by boat, because we waited [indecipherable] for another boat, and only got into New York December the 20th, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: While you were still in Europe, before you came to the United States, at that time was there any movement among the DP campers to support the establishment of a – of a Jewish state?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: There was a big support about it, and there was a lot of people who registered to go.</span> <span id="s331">They were taking them by boat, a lot of people went from there to e – to that time to Palestine, and a lot of people got caught – I have a lot of family caught on Cyprus.</span> <span id="s332">After I came to the State I find – I – I used to send them packages.</span> <span id="s333">They were a lo – a long time on Cyprus.</span> <span id="s334">But in the DP camps, every place they had big signs.</span> <span id="s335">When I was putting up a sign too, and I got a reply that from the Weinstein(ph) family, from my grandfather’s sister.</span> <span id="s336">The brother died, but the sister is alive, and my – and his brother’s children are here and they waiting for us – for me.</span> <span id="s337">I got a reply – got a letter from them before I got here.</span> <span id="s338">And they were even sending out an affidavit for me, but I already had the ticket to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: You mentioned before that your father had been here, meaning in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: My father was here in the early 1900, before he was married.</span> <span id="s341">And after he became a citizen, he went back home to get married, and the war broke out, and being that he was born there, they didn’t recognize his citizenship, and he went into the army.</span> <span id="s342">And after he get back, his visa had expired, and they didn’t let him out any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: The war you’re referring to?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: The first war.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: When you were growing up, did your father tell you stories about America?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yeah, my father used to – there was another person in our town.</span> <span id="s349">We weren’t in the city, we were in a small town three miles from the city.</span> <span id="s350">And there was another person who was non-Jewish, who was in America with the same time with my father.</span> <span id="s351">And they used to talk.</span> <span id="s352">They used to come over – my father learned a trade in American, he become a blacksmith, and he used to made the carriages, like here in the Fifth Avenue, the carriages.</span> <span id="s353">He had a lot of people working with him, and he used to talk with the other person who was from our town – in English occasionally, but we didn’t understand them.</span> <span id="s354">And they used to take meat and make steaks.</span> <span id="s355">So they were saying them crazy American people are eating raw meat.</span> <span id="s356">Because they couldn’t believe that you just put the steak on top of the coal and you keep it a couple of minutes on one side, and a couple minutes on the other side, that they are eating.</span> <span id="s357">But he used to eat it with the other fellow, and we all looked around, but we never ate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: A few moments ago you told me that you were coming to the United States.</span> <span id="s359">What were your expectations of America, and what were those expectations based on?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Well, the only expectation I had is I knew my – my mother’s family was here.</span> <span id="s361">My mother used to correspond with cousins who were here in New York.</span> <span id="s362">And my mother wanted to come back and my father, they all had couple of times papers to come.</span> <span id="s363">But the government kept on changing, and that time there wasn’t flying, the mail came by boat and it took months.</span> <span id="s364">And by the time one letter came and one visa came, the government kept on changing and they never were able to come out.</span> <span id="s365">And my father used to speak about America, how nice it is and how well organized it is and how comfortable people live around here, more comfortable than on the towns in Europe.</span> <span id="s366">So the expectation was that I will find somebody from the family, because in Europe we lost a lot, maybe we’ll find somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: When you came to this country, what were your first impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: For the first night we stopped in front of the Statue of Liberty, and all night we didn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s369">We were just looking at the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s370">We saw the city lit up, and they were waiting to embark.</span> <span id="s371">We were there a couple hours.</span> <span id="s372">And then in the morning, we went off the boat, and they took us to a children place, a home.</span> <span id="s373">You wouldn’t believe it, there were cribs waiting for us, because they said a children group was coming.</span> <span id="s374">It was in the Bronx, I think it was Ca-Caldell(ph) Avenue, but I don’t remember the number.</span> <span id="s375">And it was a big house, and in there we went – most of the group went there.</span> <span id="s376">And every day families from the group came over to see.</span> <span id="s377">And there were a lot of people who came to adopt children.</span> <span id="s378">I got there, it was December the 20th I arrived, and the 21st already, my mother’s cousin came to see us.</span> <span id="s379">And the first day they asked permission to take me out for a day.</span> <span id="s380">So I felt a little comfortable, because they were speaking Jewish and Hungarian, because I didn’t speak no English.</span> <span id="s381">And I was there for the first couple of days, about two days til Christmastime.</span> <span id="s382">And then I went back, and then they were asking me if I want to go live with them.</span> <span id="s383">So I said okay for the beginning, until my rest of the family will come.</span> <span id="s384">And I was living with them til I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Can you tell me who was with you on that children’s group transport that came?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: There were all ba – all children from all over, from all the DP camps.</span> <span id="s387">There was a group organizer, the children group organization.</span> <span id="s388">All I know is there was three Cs they had in the hat.</span> <span id="s389">What that meaned, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s390">Three Cs he had on the hat, and we all had rooms in the – in the ship, it was like a military boat, but it was considered first class.</span> <span id="s391">And we ate, but ich – food was plenty, but nobody was able to eat.</span> <span id="s392">It was shaking so much the boat that food didn’t stay in anybody’s stomach.</span> <span id="s393">Who – everybody was dizzy from the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: How old were the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: They were from 17 and 18; 16, 17, 18.</span> <span id="s396">One boy was 13, who met a soldier in Austria and adopted him, a 13 year old boy in the group.</span> <span id="s397">He was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: When you came here, what did you plan to do?</span> <span id="s399">What wa – were gonna be your first steps in building a life here?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: When I arrived, I had no plans.</span> <span id="s401">First I was waiting to see how my sisters and the rest of the family will come out.</span> <span id="s402">But they didn’t get no visas, all of them, to come here.</span> <span id="s403">So one sister came to Canada with her husband.</span> <span id="s404">And my brother and my other sister with their husbands wen – and my brother with his wife, they went to South America, because we had family there, and the quota th-there was more liberal.</span> <span id="s405">So they went to South America, to Uruguay.</span> <span id="s406">They settled in Uruguay.</span> <span id="s407">And I was here alone for the first couple of years, but I was living with a cousin of my mother’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: When you came, did you feel that the Americans welcomed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: – tinuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Bella Pasternak.</span> <span id="s411">This is tape one, side B, and I was in the process of asking you if Americans were curious about your Holocaust experience, and you told me that they asked you – what kinds of things did you tell them, and how did they react?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Well, they couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s413">It’s like when somebody will walk into your house and say, you have five minutes; pack, and you have to come with us.</span> <span id="s414">And they said, really?</span> <span id="s415">That’s the way it happened?</span> <span id="s416">They just said, how in the world could that happen?</span> <span id="s417">I said well, this is the way exactly it happened.</span> <span id="s418">Even if you knew, they wouldn’t have believe you.</span> <span id="s419">It just happened that I knew it before, that was gonna happen.</span> <span id="s420">But then I went home, and I was telling my mother and father what I was told.</span> <span id="s421">They all said, it’s very, very hard to believe.</span> <span id="s422">Everything they else – they understand that I’m telling them the truth, but to come to the house and tell us that you have to leave and they taking you away, the reaction was, it’s kind of impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Now, are you referring to your – your experiences before the war, e-early in the war.</span> <span id="s424">Let me just see if I can get you to clarify that.</span> <span id="s425">How did you know, before your parents did, what was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: The reason I knew was because everything in Europe was rationed, and everything was blackmail.</span> <span id="s427">If you [indecipherable] anything, they used to put you in jail.</span> <span id="s428">You couldn’t do business.</span> <span id="s429">But being that I was young, and my mother and my father, they were very much afraid to do any kind of a business.</span> <span id="s430">I was very not afraid.</span> <span id="s431">I didn’t think anything could happen, so I used to sell merchandise.</span> <span id="s432">My father was a blacksmith, and if you wanted anything, clothing or shoes, you had to give them food, otherwise you wouldn’t get them, because all you had rationed, a pair of shoes a year, or a pair of soles in the shoes.</span> <span id="s433">So the – the – in order to buy shoes, or to buy any kind of a food that you wanted, you had to exchange for something else.</span> <span id="s434">So, I used to go into the city, which was three miles.</span> <span id="s435">We had everything in the house.</span> <span id="s436">We had cows, we had chickens, and from the town you were able to buy everything.</span> <span id="s437">Now, in order to go to the city and sell it on the black market, in case they catch me or something, I had to have connection.</span> <span id="s438">So I know the head of the police, the captain, and I used to give him things for nothing, because I couldn’t charge him the black market price.</span> <span id="s439">And the price that it would have been to charge, I may as well give him a present, because it was pennies.</span> <span id="s440">So I became very friendly with him.</span> <span id="s441">And he was the one that told me, a couple of days before it happened.</span> <span id="s442">And when I went home, and I mentioned it, nobody wanted to believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: What other things did you tell people here about the war, besides the – the rounding up of the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: You see, my father was a blacksmith, and the ji – the Germans were in our town.</span> <span id="s445">The soldiers.</span> <span id="s446">And we had the pa – a big house, compared to the rest of the people in town.</span> <span id="s447">So, being that our house was the biggest, they came and they took my mother and father out of their bedroom, and there were officers of the German Reich, who were sleeping by us in the house.</span> <span id="s448">And their horses were – my father was taking care of the horses in the – as blacksmith to put them – shoe the horses.</span> <span id="s449">And they liked the food and the milk, so they ate by us.</span> <span id="s450">They used to pay us, and they used to tell my mother, if she’ll be kind enough to make them food for breakfast, some for lunch and supper.</span> <span id="s451">My mother had no choice, she cooked them, and she served them.</span> <span id="s452">And even when they came for us, my father was still with their horses.</span> <span id="s453">And they had to wait til he finishes the horses in order to leave.</span> <span id="s454">At that point already they believe me, what I told them the days before, but it was kind of late.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Did you tell Americans about your experiences in camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s457">We talked about it.</span> <span id="s458">We talked and we a – when I arrived in Auschwitz the first day, on the ghetto, we were outdoor on the ghettos.</span> <span id="s459">And there was raining, it was right after Passover, between Passover and [indecipherable] we were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s460">Just before [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s461">And it was rainy weather.</span> <span id="s462">And there was no bunks, was nothing, it was out in the woods.</span> <span id="s463">And we took the blankets that we took with ourself, and everybody made their own little sukkah.</span> <span id="s464">And that’s where we slept, the kids all crying.</span> <span id="s465">There was no bathroom facilities, there was no wat – running water.</span> <span id="s466">There was a little lake nearby, people went for water to wash, or food, whatever they – they were giving out ration food.</span> <span id="s467">And we were in the ghetto about three weeks.</span> <span id="s468">And at that time that we were in the ghetto, this particular person that I knew used to take me out as – take – he used to come for the Jewish girls for maids, to take them out in the city.</span> <span id="s469">So every day a truck used to come for the Jewish girls to go to be a maid for the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s470">So this particular guy requested me to go as his maid.</span> <span id="s471">But I used to go in there and I used to do nothing, just talk to [indecipherable] and at night he used to come and he used to drop a bread to – in our place and used to say, just close the lights already, it’s getting late.</span> <span id="s472">And he had suggested even then, that if we want to leave, he would give us a truck for 40 people to leave.</span> <span id="s473">Then my mother said, 40 people, who I’m gonna take for that’s gonna be with the rest, will be with us too.</span> <span id="s474">So we didn’t go nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: I’d like to maybe clarify my question.</span> <span id="s476">I wanted to know what – what you told people about Auschwitz, for example.</span> <span id="s477">And how did they deal with what you were telling them?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Well, a lot of people had some ideas, because there were the American soldiers already, that they used to write home and explain them what’s was going on.</span> <span id="s479">That time with – it was a little knowledge about it, not too much.</span> <span id="s480">A lot of people didn’t even want to – they – they says it’s hard to believe, but they know it had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: When you first came to this country, did you already at that time have a real good idea of just how many Jews had died?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: No.</span> <span id="s483">We had an idea that a lot of them did not come home.</span> <span id="s484">But how many exactly died, nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: When did you begin to realize the magnitude of the genocide?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: The – a man that haman – the – the – the six million or whatever they – they had perished, we knew it only by year after, year and a half it took to calculate.</span> <span id="s487">Because at that point when I – it was st-still a lot of people still were coming.</span> <span id="s488">But nobody knew exactly how many.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Now that you’re in this country, were you able to go back to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yeah, when I went – when I came to my mother’s cousin, she had two girls.</span> <span id="s491">One was two years younger than me, and the other one was only about four years old.</span> <span id="s492">And I went at night school that time, and I went to – first a couple of months they didn’t let me do nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s495">They just said I need a rest.</span> <span id="s496">And they asked me how I survived, and I said that when I arrived in Auschwitz, there was a Polish fellow who asked me how old I was.</span> <span id="s497">I already had [indecipherable] me and my mother, to go with her.</span> <span id="s498">And he asked me how old are you?</span> <span id="s499">I said 16.</span> <span id="s500">He says, well, say you are 17 – say you are 18.</span> <span id="s501">He pushed me in a side, he said, you are not 16, you are 18.</span> <span

wrist was broken, but it didn’t heal properly, and they had to re-break it again, and put it in a cast.</span> <span id="s517">So for awhile I was just home with a cast, and after a – they told me after what I went through, they want me to take it easy, and then I will go to school, or to work, whatever I want.</span> <span id="s518">So they didn’t want me to travel to the city, so they find me

years later, I was working there and they liked me.</span> <span id="s526">So I worked there for a long time.</span> <span id="s527">Until I got married I was in the same company.</span></p> <p><span

they were saying, because I didn’t – I didn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s537">Later on I followed it, when they reviewed it on the television, later on.</span> <span id="s538">I was by the

would be a Jewish state.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: It was very thrilling, I co – I just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s545">I was crying for happiness when that happened.</span></p>

send it away.</span> <span id="s549">I used to get correspondence from all over, from – they were in Italy, they were in Germany, they were in France and Cyprus, and they kept in touch with me.</span> <span id="s550">I al – always knew where they are, and I keep in touch even now when I go to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Did you have an opportunity to make any friends on your own, aside from people that you met through your relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s553">There were a couple of people from – also survivors that settled not too far from where I lived, and they had girls mine age, and we used to go out together, and we had the – also a group of Americans that they were speaking Yiddish, and we used to get together.</span> <span id="s554">And after I went to school, I used to speak a little bit.</span> <span id="s555">And I got along with them fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Did you start dating?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: About two years after.</span> <span id="s558">I used to out in a group a lot, but not really dating.</span> <span id="s559">Two years later I used to go out with – in a group, but not really dating.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: When you started to mingle, were there any special gentlemen that were interesting to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Mostly – at that time mostly we used to go to the HIAS, or to organizations that I used to be the newcomers, and I always wanted to find out who else is coming up, because the – there used to come boats – mostly then they used to come by the HIAS, we used to go to find out who came from our area, and what news they are bringing.</span> <span id="s562">So you find a lot of people that we knew from the DP camps and from the unt – our own town.</span> <span id="s563">And then we starting – they used to have the special affairs for the refugees camps.</span> <span id="s564">They used to have groups in the HIAS, they used to have it in the Joint, they used to have it in the – with our diplomat, and they used to get together from all over.</span> <span id="s565">And we met all the people who used to say in the boat, we will meet you whenever they gonna have a Hanukkah party, or a Purim party, we used to go together, just to see our friends from the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: What I’m trying to get at is, I want to know how you met your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Well, we went to a Purim party, I assume.</span> <span id="s568">It was a Purim or Hanukkah party, and I went with my cousin’s daughter, and with other people from our town, a group, because we lived out of the city.</span> <span id="s569">And we went there and somebody looked at me, I didn’t recognize him.</span> <span id="s570">And one day I got a telephone call from him, and he said his name was Andrew, because he – Andrew.</span> <span id="s571">He said it’s a Romanian name, so he start talking Romanian.</span> <span id="s572">He said he saw me, and he would like to meet me.</span> <span id="s573">And this is the way we had a blind date.</span> <span id="s574">So he came out with his brother and his sister-in-law, together with the car, and we had a blind date, the four of us together.</span> <span id="s575">And we met in early ’51 or ’52, I don’t rem – I think it was in ’52 that we met the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: And so you met, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: We went out for a while, and then I went out with other people for a while.</span> <span id="s578">I couldn’t make up my mind.</span> <span id="s579">And then, eventually, I think the Korean War broke out, and my friend called me, and he told me that he was drafted.</span> <span id="s580">So I – it was just before New Year’s, I send him a New Year card, and I wished him good luck in his career.</span> <span id="s581">So then he called me, and we got together again, and after then we started to go out more steady, and we got engaged, and married in ’53.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: So your husband is also a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Yes, my husband is a survivor, also from Romania, but from a different area.</span> <span id="s584">That’s like a different state.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: When you and your new husband were first married, what plans did you have for your future together?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: We didn’t make big plans.</span> <span id="s587">He was working and I was working and that time it was – it wasn’t as easy as today, there were no apartments, it was difficult to find apartments.</span> <span id="s588">In order to get an apartment, you actually had to buy the apartment, throw out the old furniture, and get apartments.</span> <span id="s589">So we moved to the city, where he was closer to work.</span> <span id="s590">And I gave up my job, and I went, in order to make it convenience for him.</span> <span id="s591">But then, as I walked around on the area, there was a job opening there, and I walked in and I got a job.</span> <span id="s592">And I was working first as a operator, as a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s593">And then he – they approached me, the new owner, and he said look, our forelady is getting married and I would like you to take her job.</span> <span id="s594">And I said – I looked on him, I said, you must be kidding.</span> <span id="s595">You know I’m expecting a baby, I’m only working temporarily.</span> <span id="s596">I said, you better look for another forelady.</span> <span id="s597">He says, well, you know something?</span> <span id="s598">Take the job until we find somebody else.</span> <span id="s599">I said, but look, sometimes I don’t feel good and I don’t come in and I can’t really work so much.</span> <span id="s600">I’d rather work piecework.</span> <span id="s601">This way I don’t cheat you, and I know that I’m only getting what’s coming to me.</span> <span id="s602">He says, don’t worry about that.</span> <span id="s603">So he took me, and I became the forelady in that place, and he was so nice to me.</span> <span id="s604">When I had to go to the doctor, he used to come to the doctor with me, I shouldn’t waste time with the bus, going back and forth.</span> <span id="s605">He used to wait for me.</span> <span id="s606">The doctor even thought that he was my husband.</span> <span id="s607">He used to take me to the doctor for monthly check-ups, practically, til – I was working for him as a forelady til two hours – I came home at night and I took home a sample to make for the next day to take to work, to be able to show the girls how to do it.</span> <span id="s608">And I call them up the next day, I said – from the hospital, I said, pick up the sample, I’m in the hospital, I have a boy.</span> <span id="s609">He was first one to send me the flowers, before my husband send them to me.</span> <span id="s610">He was very nice to me, and he wanted me to go back to work.</span> <span id="s611">By then my first son, was Jerry, was a colic baby, and I couldn’t put him down.</span> <span id="s612">He offered me a nurse plus my salary to go back to work, but I just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s613">I used to go with the kid a little to look around and help him a little, til he found somebody.</span> <span id="s614">He was very nice.</span> <span id="s615">They were Italian people, very nice people.</span> <span id="s616">But he got the store, the factory, he got, and he went in with a partner.</span> <span id="s617">And he put in the money, and the partner didn’t like it, and he walked out of him.</span> <span id="s618">And he really had no experience in dressmaking, so he was stuck.</span> <span id="s619">So I tried to help them out.</span> <span id="s620">So we helped each other.</span> <span id="s621">And that’s when I stopped working in the dress line, when Jerry was born, two hours af – before he was born, practically.</span> <span id="s622">I wa – he took me to the doctor and doctor says, see you in a week.</span> <span id="s623">Then I went home and I had to go into the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Three.</span> <span id="s626">Three boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: How did you pick their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Well, my first one, I was living ba – by my uncle, and his daughter was married before me, she got married – she was married three years and she had no children, so my uncle – my – actually my cousin’s husband said gee, I’ll never have my father’s name.</span> <span id="s629">So being he – they were so nice for – to me, and my father and my mother already had a name by my other sisters and brothers, so I figured it was just right to give his name.</span> <span id="s630">After that his daughter had three children, but it took her – my first name, [indecipherable] that she should have the children.</span> <span id="s631">So that’s the way I picked the first time.</span> <span id="s632">And then my second name – my second child was named after my husband’s grandfather, and my other one that was born, the third son has the name of my father and my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: What have you told your sons about your childhood, your life before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: We spoke to them when they were already about seven years old, they kept on asking.</span> <span id="s635">When they went to school, they said, everybody has birthday parties, and everybody has grandparents, how come they don’t have any?</span> <span id="s636">That’s when we started to tell them what happened to their grandparents.</span> <span id="s637">And they kept on asking.</span> <span id="s638">I never refused an answer.</span> <span id="s639">I didn’t want to bring it up when they were too young, but after then they start asking, and whenever they asked, I told them.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: What did you tell them about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I was telling them that we were very, very religious.</span> <span id="s642">I had a brother who was a rabbi, who was so religious, he came home from the yeshiva at 19 and a half, not even 20, and he told my father, th-they should both rest in peace, he says, I’m getting married.</span> <span id="s643">So my father jumped in this chair, he said, you’re getting married?</span> <span id="s644">You’re in yeshiva, there is no girls there, how are you getting married?</span> <span id="s645">He says, my Rebbe find me a wife.</span> <span id="s646">I said, and who’s the wife?</span> <span id="s647">He says, my Rebbe’s sister’s daughter.</span> <span id="s648">I said – my father said, did you see her?</span> <span id="s649">Nope, but if my Rabbi said that she’s the right girl for me, I am sure she’s the right girl.</span> <span id="s650">So my father said, what if she’s blind?</span> <span id="s651">Or she has hand on her feet, you didn’t see her, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s652">He says, it’ll be a bigger mitzvah.</span> <span id="s653">They went to an engagement party, I remember I was young that time, but I remember hearing them talk.</span> <span id="s654">My mother and father went and they got engaged, and they came back and they were telling us, and they were sitting by the table, because the reason that the rabbi wanted them to get married is because her husband died.</span> <span id="s655">Th-The girl’s mother’s husband died, the girl’s father had died, and she – there’s a family of four children and the oldest is 18, and there is no shochet, and there was no rabbi in town.</span> <span id="s656">And he figured that he would be good for that.</span> <span id="s657">At that age he became the youngest rabbi in the area there.</span> <span id="s658">And they got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: As your sons got older, did you tell them about your wartime experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yeah, we always talk about the wartimes experiences, what we went through.</span> <span id="s661">And I always wanted to be a lawyer when I was small.</span> <span id="s662">I told them that I – I want – my father, being that he was in America, he did not speak Romanian, and he was born when it was Hungary.</span> <span id="s663">And when he came back, he didn’t go to school back to learn Romanian, and whenever he had to go someplace, I used to go with him to read what [indecipherable] and tell him if he could sign that or no.</span> <span id="s664">Cause he could speak, but he didn’t read and he didn’t write in Romanian.</span> <span id="s665">He only was able to do it in English, which I didn’t know that he knew it, and Jewish, Yiddish, or in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s666">But Romanian he didn’t know.</span> <span id="s667">So when I was seven – after I was seven years old, and I was his translator, he used to say, I’m only gonna sign what my lawyer will say I can sign.</span> <span id="s668">And therefore, I always said I – when I grow up, I’ll be a lawyer.</span> <span id="s669">But I never finished it.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Did you ever tell your sons about what you had to go through in the ghetto and the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Yes, we spoke about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: What kinds of things do they ask you about those experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: They ask that – how many we were in the family, and how many came back, and how was it in the lagers, and how did I got here, how did I met his father.</span> <span id="s674">We went over that many, many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Did you ever get a sense that perhaps your children had questions that they either wouldn’t or couldn’t bring themselves to ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Well, if they have a lot of – cause maybe they had asked – because most of our family are Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s677">And whenever they didn’t speak to us, they must have spoken to them, because they didn’t want to bring it up to us, we shouldn’t cry.</span> <span id="s678">Or they shouldn’t hurt us, or they didn’t know how to put it.</span> <span id="s679">But whenever they got together with their cousins, they always used to talk or ask somebody else.</span> <span id="s680">It’s easier sometimes to ask a stranger, than your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Was there ever something that you wanted them to ask that they didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Was there ever something that you wanted for them to know, but you weren’t able to tell them, and they never asked?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: They all, when they went away to school, or when they went to high school, there was a lot of groups that they were involved with the Holocaust, and they were involved with the groups, so whatever answers they needed, most of the time, they got it from them.</span> <span id="s685">And whatever I felt that they didn’t ask me, they didn’t want to know, or they already knew it.</span> <span id="s686">Because all of them are involved on the new generation Holocaust group.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: What kind of education did you provide for your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Well, when we got married, we weren’t religious at all.</span> <span id="s689">My husband was way the other side, he didn’t even keep kosher.</span> <span id="s690">I went out – if I ate fish or anything but treyf to go out to eat [indecipherable] the first meal mine was pig.</span> <span id="s691">I didn’t eat it when I was in this country.</span> <span id="s692">But he didn’t keep kosher at all.</span> <span id="s693">Shabbas we didn’t observe, none of us.</span> <span id="s694">We lived by my cousin, who was a kosher butcher.</span> <span id="s695">But Shabbas they didn’t work, but they went shopping, we went to the movies.</span> <span id="s696">No work around the house or anything.</span> <span id="s697">They used to play cards in Shabbas, but it wasn’t Orthodox.</span> <span id="s698">They were more Conservative than Orthodox.</span> <span id="s699">And it was sort of a – for me too, I mean, Saturday used to go to the city, meet my friends.</span> <span id="s700">Sunday – during the week we worked and went to school.</span> <span id="s701">Saturday and Sunday we used to go to the city shopping or meet our friends.</span> <span id="s702">And when I met my husband, we weren’t thinking about [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s703">But then in 1948, when the Arnold Constable estate got sold in Westchester for a yeshiva, that time there was a big article in that “New York Times.”</span> <span id="s704">Arnold Constable estate sold for yeshiva.</span> <span id="s705">It was an estate of 27 or 28 acres, beautiful, by the water.</span> <span id="s706">It’s a castle, a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s707">Everybody from the city came to see it.</span> <span id="s708">So I – we took a ride with friends and neighbors, we took a ride to see the s – the new school.</span> <span id="s709">At that point I wasn’t even married, didn’t even think about it, so I said to myself, it is just gorgeous.</span> <span id="s710">If I’ll ever have children, I would like to send them there.</span> <span id="s711">And this is the way it started out that I send them to the yeshiva.</span> <span id="s712">I didn’t have no other dreams of making them religious, or anything else.</span> <span id="s713">Despite that, I came from a very, very Orthodox family.</span> <span id="s714">And then when they were born, I send them to school.</span> <span id="s715">And Jerry went to school when the – got ready to go to school – when Jerry went to school, the first week he came home, he says, Mommy, you know what I learned?</span> <span id="s716">I said, if you’ll tell me, I’ll know.</span> <span id="s717">He said, you’re not supposed to work on Shabbat, not you and not Daddy.</span> <span id="s718">Saturday is a day of rest.</span> <span id="s719">I said to him, Jerry, they are right and you are right.</span> <span id="s720">But you have a choice; if you go to a public school, I could stay home and you don’t have – I don’t have to work.</span> <span id="s721">But if you want to go to that school, I have to work in order to pay for you they should take you into school.</span> <span id="s722">So I said to him, got time to decide, it’s Friday.</span> <span id="s723">Monday you let me know, do you want to go to school, or do you want to go to public school?</span> <span id="s724">So Sunday night I bathe him and I prepared the clothes and I said, so what is the situation for tomorrow?</span> <span id="s725">He said, well, I decided that while I go to school, you work.</span> <span id="s726">But once I stop, then you should become shomer Shabbos.</span> <span id="s727">So I said, you got a deal.</span> <span id="s728">So I kept my promise.</span> <span id="s729">But we were working, Saturday was the busiest day for both of us.</span> <span id="s730">My husband came from work and I took the car and I went to work.</span> <span id="s731">And even when they went to s – to Yeshiva University High School, where I took Steven and I put him on [indecipherable], I went to the rabbi there for an interview, and the rabbi said, and I’m sure you are shomer Shabbos.</span> <span id="s732">My husband wouldn’t say a word.</span> <span id="s733">I said, sorry.</span> <span id="s734">I said, the prices you charge, I have to work in order to pay it.</span> <span id="s735">I don’t have nobody to pay it for me.</span> <span id="s736">They didn’t reduce the price, so I had to work in order to pay it.</span> <span id="s737">And they continued yeshiva, but they – Jerry was even – when he finished high school and Yeshiva University, he applied to NYU and they called him for an interview.</span> <span id="s738">And being that they called him for an interview in Shabbat, he refused to go to that school because they called him for a interview in Shabbat.</span> <span id="s739">I said, Jerry, they don’t have to know that you are Orthodox.</span> <span id="s740">He said, but can they see I’m in Yeshiva University?</span> <span id="s741">Would I be in Yeshiva University if I wouldn’t be Orthodox?</span> <span id="s742">So I told him, Jerry, there are many people in Yeshiva University and they’re not Orthodox, they travel in Shabbat.</span> <span id="s743">All you have to do is write them a note or call them up and say you want another interview.</span> <span id="s744">But he didn’t want to go any more.</span> <span id="s745">And for that reason he went to Yeshiva College.</span> <span id="s746">And the other ones never asked me, and they continued it.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: What do you mean they continued it?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Yeshiva College.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Did they get education beyond college?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Yes, they all went to law schools.</span> <span id="s751">And that time it was very difficult to get into law school because they ask where did your parents graduated from.</span> <span id="s752">And despite that they were very good students, not because they were my children, they couldn’t get into Columbia or to a school in the vicinity.</span> <span id="s753">So Jerry went to California, Alvin went to Saint Louis, and Steven went to Boston.</span> <span id="s754">Because we didn’t go to school here, so Yeshiva University, when they graduate over a hundred students in a class, and they only took two or three students from ea – to each school in law school, so I was in the bottom of the list, because we didn’t go to no schools in here, in the state or colleges.</span> <span id="s755">So that’s where they ended up, in very good schools.</span> <span id="s756">They got a fairly good education, I hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: You mentioned that you had to make compromises, working on Shabbat and you know, th-the deal that you made with Jerry.</span> <span id="s758">Were there other compromises that you had to make raising a family and working in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Well, we didn’t ba – travel.</span> <span id="s760">We didn’t have a big house or anything, we had a small apartment.</span> <span id="s761">It was expensive and the colleges were very high and the schooling was very expensive, although they didn’t – didn’t – when I start working already, later on, I was able to – to get an – a – a house before they went to high school, but when they were small, we were sacrificing to that extent that I put them all three in one bedroom.</span> <span id="s762">We had a one bedroom apartment and that’s where I raised them.</span> <span id="s763">We slept in a open couch in the living room.</span> <span id="s764">But we sacrificed in order to give them a good education.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: I wanted to ask you if you had followed the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yes, I followed the Eichmann trial a lot.</span> <span id="s767">[indecipherable] watched already on television, that was televised.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: What were your thoughts and your reactions to that trial and the judgment?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: My thought was why it took them so long to find them?</span> <span id="s770">With all the knowledge and with all the new things that they have and they [indecipherable] spaces and everything, they had to take them so many years til they find somebody?</span> <span id="s771">They knew all along where it was.</span> <span id="s772">America had the records from all the Nazis that they were here in America, and the Nazis are there on – in – in Canada and all over the world.</span> <span id="s773">It really didn’t had to take them that long to find them.</span> <span id="s774">That was my reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Did you have a reaction to the fact that Eichmann was being tried in Jerusalem, in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: No, I didn’t think that he should be tried any other place, because the majority of the people in Israel are survivors, and they were the one that knew him the best, so they know mostly what he did.</span> <span id="s777">He would – even there, it took a long time to have a trial for them.</span> <span id="s778">And here would have probably [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: I’m going to pause now and change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Bella Pasternak.</span> <span id="s782">This is tape two, side A.</span> <span id="s783">In the 1950s and 60s and 70s, this country went through some major, major changes.</span> <span id="s784">You were busy working and raising your children, but I wanted to know what your thoughts were about, you know, things like the war in Vietnam, an-and the Cold War.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Well, the war in Vietnam and the Cold War th – every war that you look, even now you can look on the Yugoslavia war and all those things, it’s heartbreaking to see all the refugees.</span> <span id="s786">You know, when you see the refugees, you remember of yourself, how you were.</span> <span id="s787">It’s a very difficult situation, it’s heartbreaking.</span> <span id="s788">The war is never right to have.</span> <span id="s789">No matter na – no matter who the enemy is.</span> <span id="s790">It’s – innocent people will still suffer.</span> <span id="s791">It’s not the army that suffers, it’s not the soldiers.</span> <span id="s792">It’s the innocent people, you see children starving and all this thing in the streets.</span> <span id="s793">It’s a terrible situation no matter where you go and you look on it, regardless what race they are, or what kind of a people are.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: There was a lot of activity also in the country in the area of civil rights.</span> <span id="s795">Did you follow some of those changes that were going on in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Always following the changes, I – I think they did the right thing, because the rights, no matter what – who you are and what you are then – and Martin Luther King was killed, and all those things, I followed them.</span> <span id="s797">I liked to look on all this, in the history, from all this, people that they suffered and they tried to better themselves.</span> <span id="s798">It’s a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s799">I think that it should be equal right for everybody, doesn’t make a difference.</span> <span id="s800">They’re not any better than we are, the color or – or the white.</span> <span id="s801">It should be equal opportunity to all.</span> <span id="s802">It doesn’t make a difference, but it was here terrible when they hold them back, too.</span> <span id="s803">It wasn’t right to hold the colored people back and everything.</span> <span id="s804">I don’t think it was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: What about the assassination of Kennedy?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: I cried.</span> <span id="s807">I couldn’t believe it when it happened.</span> <span id="s808">I – I remember like today that I – that – when it happened in 1963, when they said that he got shot.</span> <span id="s809">First I thought it was a joke.</span> <span id="s810">And then, when I saw it on television, it was heartbreaking.</span> <span id="s811">His father was a anti-Semite, but the – the children – he suffered a lot.</span> <span id="s812">All his children, I think, he got punished right and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: What about the sexual revolution in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Well, I think that is a little too much for me.</span> <span id="s815">I don’t – that I don’t believe in.</span> <span id="s816">You see, I was 17, and there was a lot of revolution, even between the people in the concentration camps after – out of the concentration, in the DP camps, a lot of people were free, and that – I don’t believe in that.</span> <span id="s817">That is one thing I – I – I would stay away from it.</span> <span id="s818">I don’t – I hope my grandchildren will stay away from it, I don’t believe in it.</span> <span id="s819">I believe the old-fashioned way.</span> <span id="s820">You love a person, you get married, you settle them and you live.</span> <span id="s821">But that – this kind of a life, with all this disease especially going around, I think is wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: What about the – the women’s movement for – for women’s rights?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: That is the right way.</span> <span id="s824">I mean, a woman shouldn’t be lower than a man.</span> <span id="s825">They have the same brain, they have the same ability to work.</span> <span id="s826">Matter of fact, in a lot of places you find women better than men.</span> <span id="s827">It should be equal opportunity if you qualify for a job, it shouldn’t be a difference you’re a woman or a man.</span> <span id="s828">Golda Meir was a great woman, a great president.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Was there anything else that’s ha – that happened in your ti – in your years of being in this country?</span> <span id="s830">Any other issues or problems that were of particular interest to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: I don’t think I had a lot of problems.</span> <span id="s832">I had problems my family was all over, until I was able to bring my sister over from South America in the family, which they came in 1962 to this country.</span> <span id="s833">I still have – my brother is in Uruguay.</span> <span id="s834">I have a sister that – from Canada that sh – I brought her over.</span> <span id="s835">Instead of coming to New York, she went to California, and my other sister in – that was in Romania, now she’s in Israel.</span> <span id="s836">But to get the family together at – all at once, it’s very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Did you ever experience anti-Semitism in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: No, I don’t think I would say that I experienced anti-Semitism in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: How do you respond to Holocaust deniers?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: I don’t think anybody with good knowledge would admit that.</span> <span id="s841">It only the people that they are denying that, either they were Nazis, or they are anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s842">Otherwise they would not say it because it’s open to the public and the museums and – and the newspapers and every place else.</span> <span id="s843">I don’t think a normal person would really say that there was no Holocaust</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: In your opinion, do you think that American Jews may ever be in danger in this country, either from skinheads or neo-Nazis or from any other element?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: I tell you, nobody would believe that it could happen again, and nobody would want to believe that it could happen again, but unfortunately, nobody believed it in Europe either that it could happen.</span> <span id="s846">And the situation in here too, they have swastikas in synagogues, they have a lot of swastikas in Jewish homes that they put on.</span> <span id="s847">And there is anti-Semite in here.</span> <span id="s848">I personally didn’t – didn’t see it in my immediate area or my house, but there are people who could start something like that, if it’s not controlled in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: What are your thoughts about the resurgence, this new interest in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: It’s good in one say and not too good in the other thing, because I think they are putting too much effort into it now, and a lot of people resent it.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Can you explain what you mean by too much effort, and a lot of people resent it?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: There’s a lot of people who feel that they shouldn’t go too much in the past, they sh – instead of that, they should look for the future of the Jewish people, not so much on the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: I assume that you have been to Israel many times.</span> <span id="s854">What is it like for you to be in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: I go to Israel often, I have family there, I have friends, very, very good friends that we suffered together, and we correspond together and we meet as many times as we go there, if we can.</span> <span id="s856">Fortunately we go for three or – three weeks or four weeks and it’s not enough time to see everybody, but – [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Have you ever regretted not moving to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Well, I really wanted to go to Israel, I wanted to move many times.</span> <span id="s859">When the children were small, I was hesitant, for the simple reason because they’re constantly on war there, and I didn’t want the boys to throw it up to me and say gee, why did you come?</span> <span id="s860">I was hoping they would go on their own and I would follow.</span> <span id="s861">So I send Jerry over for the – a year to Israel to study, he loved it.</span> <span id="s862">And the only mistake that they made is, when he applied to law school, he applied to Israel and they told him, finish first, and then come.</span> <span id="s863">When he finished and he got married, they said, now you have to go back to school.</span> <span id="s864">I was hoping that he wou – they would go on their own and then I would follow.</span> <span id="s865">But now it’s difficult that they all settled here, for me to pick up and go.</span> <span id="s866">I love Israel, my husband loves Israel.</span> <span id="s867">It’s not that I don’t love America, I love it here too, but there it’s a different type of living.</span> <span id="s868">And I really would enjoy it there maybe better than here.</span> <span id="s869">But the thing that the children are here, and most of all my grandchildren, I couldn’t stay away from.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: What changes have you noticed in relations between American Jews and Israel, over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Well, in the beginning the Jews that went to Israel, they were more Zionist type.</span> <span id="s872">They were hardworking people, they really were depending on American fund that they were getting, and they were living different life, very hard life.</span> <span id="s873">Like the people who come from Europe, when they started here life wa-was difficult, for them it was 10 times harder.</span> <span id="s874">They had to live like in DP camps after they were in Israel, and after Israel was declared a state, because they had no facilities there.</span> <span id="s875">And they worked really very hard.</span> <span id="s876">Today it’s a very beautiful country.</span> <span id="s877">They work less than here.</span> <span id="s878">They have a more normal life as far as social life, and they traveling a lot.</span> <span id="s879">They are not settled as much as the American people are settled.</span> <span id="s880">They take life in day by day because all the time something happens in there.</span> <span id="s881">And they want to grab them whatever they can while they’re alive.</span> <span id="s882">So that’s why they are more loose in traveling and more loose in life in Israel than here.</span> <span id="s883">Life in Israel is beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: How has your experiences in the Holocaust influenced choices that you’ve made over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Well, I’m ver – I’m very close with the family.</span> <span id="s886">I’ve always protected the children, I was always afraid something that’s gonna happen.</span> <span id="s887">When they were small I used to get up from bed at night while they were sleeping to listen if they’re breathing.</span> <span id="s888">I was so surrounded with dead people, that if they didn’t cry, or they to – they were sleeping, I went to see if they’re alive.</span> <span id="s889">So it was fearful no matter how long and no matter how much time after it happens.</span> <span id="s890">Would the children or even the grandchildren, I watched them today.</span> <span id="s891">If I go over there, whatever they do, I said, you do this, now your Mommy and Daddy’s home, not when I’m around you.</span> <span id="s892">They – they – cause they are daring, the children are daring.</span> <span id="s893">Mine, I kept them [indecipherable] cause I was – I was always afraid something shouldn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: In retrospect, do you think you would have done something, or anything differently if you were raising them today?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s896">I still think that they should know more res-respect for others.</span> <span id="s897">I – I believe that today the children are raised a little too loose – in most of the places, not all.</span> <span id="s898">Some of the children, the parents, you know, have a lot of things, they run around, they don – they have strangers watching the children.</span> <span id="s899">I don’t approve of that.</span> <span id="s900">I believe if you have children you gotta be with them and raise them.</span> <span id="s901">Hired help is not the same as you do yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Do you speak with your sons about your Holocaust experiences in – in the past now – now that they’re all adult and parents of their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: They don’t ask too many questions lately.</span> <span id="s904">I think they are all up to date with it.</span> <span id="s905">They all belong to the gathering, they all get the newspapers.</span> <span id="s906">But the – my little grandchildren start to ask now.</span> <span id="s907">I have [indecipherable] and I have three little ones.</span> <span id="s908">One is named after my husband’s mother and sister.</span> <span id="s909">The other one is named after my aunt and my grandmother, and the little one is named after my husband’s father.</span> <span id="s910">And they all – we got all three names, and they’re after the Holocaust survivors [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s911">And even her parents, they never requested a name, they – I’m sure they have deaths on their family too, but they sti – they kept on telling my son, if that means so much, the names, to your parents, give it to them.</span> <span id="s912">So we have all three names in there.</span> <span id="s913">And the children now, the older one is seven.</span> <span id="s914">She starts asking questions.</span> <span id="s915">She didn’t ask til now, but now she already knows why she’s named after her mother and why she perished, and she starts asking questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Do you talk with your older grandchildren about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: [indecipherable] claims he knows.</span> <span id="s918">He follows it in school, and he’s reading about it, and he gets some information in the computers.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Is that satisfactory for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: If they – whatever they ask me, if they ask me, I’d be happy to talk to them.</span> <span id="s921">But just to sit down and starting stories about that, I don’t bring it up.</span> <span id="s922">If they don’t bring it up, I don’t bring it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Does it bother you that they don’t ask you more?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: No.</span> <span id="s925">I figure they know about it.</span> <span id="s926">If they wouldn’t know, and what they don’t want to know, then it would bother me, but they all know about it.</span> <span id="s927">I never kept it a secret and they never kept it a secret.</span> <span id="s928">They all know that they are sur – that they children of survivors and they know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Do you speak publicly about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: In a group for me, in the Hadassah occasionally, or in the – or in the sisterhood, if they have questions, or things like that.</span> <span id="s931">My husband spoke occasionally in city hall about it.</span> <span id="s932">But not going out strongly, like many people do.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Are you involved with any survivor groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: I belong to the groups, I get newspapers.</span> <span id="s935">I have an – wh-when they had the gatherings in ’81 in Israel, we went and made a tape there, in Yad Vashem, I get mail from them, I belong to that group.</span> <span id="s936">I belong to the museum in here.</span> <span id="s937">I get the newspapers in it and all the things that’s happening.</span> <span id="s938">We have – occasionally we have, in our area they have, in a church they have a gathering ever year about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s939">And they have the interracial groups talking about it and singing Hebrew songs, and I attend them.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Have you had any recurring dreams since the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Can you tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: I just feel sometimes like I’m slipping in bed.</span> <span id="s944">I’m sleeping, and [indecipherable] I slip, that somebody’s behind me.</span> <span id="s945">And then when I wake up, I get ch-chills all over my body.</span> <span id="s946">Many times I dream I’m in Auschwitz, many times I dream I’m – I am carrying the ammunition, it explodes in front of me.</span> <span id="s947">I see the war constantly, that’s something that doesn’t go out of your mind.</span> <span id="s948">[indecipherable] even if you think or you don’t think about it.</span> <span id="s949">Especially for like I speak about it now, it’s gonna be a couple of weeks til I still gonna see it in front of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Regarding your life in this country, what has been the best surprise about life in America, and/or, what has been the biggest disappointment about life in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: My best surprise are my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s952">I adored my children, but nothing like my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s953">This is the – this is the real dividends.</span> <span id="s954">And that’s the reason that I ben – that I don’t go too far away, and I always want to be in touch with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Is there, perhaps, a single disappointment about your life in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s957">I think I got more than I expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: What would you yet like to accomplish?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: I would like to see them grow up, my grandchildren and be happy and attend good schools and be in the right side of the street.</span> <span id="s960">Know where they’re going and where they’re coming.</span> <span id="s961">I always want them to know where th-the roots are coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: What are your plans for your golden years?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: I really haven’t made too many plans.</span> <span id="s964">I just hope I’ll be well to travel a little more.</span> <span id="s965">My husband loves to travel, I don’t.</span> <span id="s966">I – I love mami – my – my bed.</span> <span id="s967">I love to be home, and I love to get company home.</span> <span id="s968">Travel it – I find it – I [indecipherable] I – we’re wandering so much around before that now to me sometimes is a punishment to travel, I hate it.</span> <span id="s969">But I’m going because he loves it.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: What would you like your sons and your grandchildren to know about you that maybe they don’t already know?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: I really have no idea what I would like them to know.</span> <span id="s972">I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Is there anything that we didn’t discuss that you would like to talk about, before we finish the interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: I don’t know if I mention it to you, my sister we brought over from South America with her family, and she lives in our area now.</span> <span id="s975">I had – and she also has chil – two daughters who got married and they are involved with the Holocaust a lot.</span> <span id="s976">The children and the grandchildren, they all know.</span> <span id="s977">Matter of fact, the dau – the granddaughter wrote an article that was put in the newspaper, about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s978">And that’s about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Anything else you’d like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: It was nice knowing you, I made a lot of friends through this.</span> <span id="s981">And it’s a really pleasure to get to know you, and your family, it’s part of our family, a little bit.</span> <span id="s982">And we hope to meet you soon on good occasions.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: I want to thank you for doing the interview today, and this concludes the interview.</span> <span id="s984">Thank
