else?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Well, I sounds like in what--you're saying is that he was born in a place where at least his family had been for an generation?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Or two, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Do you know how your family--</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: I have no idea how they got there.</span> <span id="s64">But there were like 13 children.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: In those--I think my mother's family also had about 11 or 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Now, her name is unusual in my--when I hear it--</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Limburger?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: No, Katherine, because Katherine is a Catholic name.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: You know, I never--she never was called that.</span> <span id="s71">She was called Katty or Kater, and I assume--that's how I knew it, and I knew her as Mutter.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: So it was Kater or Katty.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: And she came from a place called Rexingen.</span> <span id="s76">My husband and I have been back to both places.</span> <span id="s77">Rexingen had the largest percentage of Jews of any place, and 40 percent of the population of Rexingen was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: And a lot of them were called Limburger, and I always thought they were all related.</span> <span id="s80">They were not all related.</span> <span id="s81">They came from a place in Poland called Limburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: And Limburg I believe is the German name for (?</span> <span id="s83">Livoff?)</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s86">I'm not sure, but I believe that they called (?</span> <span id="s87">Livoff?)</span> <span id="s88">Limburg, or could be many places or some other small--</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: But they were not all related.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: How interesting.</span> <span id="s91">How interesting.</span> <span id="s92">So your mother's family actually eventuallyway back, could have come from Poland?</span> <span id="s93">To Rexingen?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: You know, I was--I was 12 when I left; and you know, bringing up children in Germany was quite different from these days.</span> <span id="s95">You didn't tell them your history.</span> <span id="s96">You were just there, and you just did things.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Were you the oldest?</span> <span id="s98">The youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s100">I was the oldest of five.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: You were the oldest of five.</span> <span id="s102">Who was born after you?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: My sister, Edith.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Remember there's a mike.</span> <span id="s105">Okay.</span> <span id="s106">There's a mike on you.</span> <span id="s107">There's a mike on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: She was--that's my sister, Edith.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s110">And in a second she's going to put--put the machine on you again.</span> <span id="s111">(Unrelated conversation) So this is a picture of Edith taken in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: I don't know when that was taken.</span> <span id="s113">Edith died in '98, and after her, Ruth was born.</span> <span id="s114">And then Herman was born in--she was born in '30; Herman was born in '33, but I don't have a picture of him right away.</span> <span id="s115">And then Esther.</span> <span id="s116">Where's Easter?</span> <span id="s117">She should be on here.</span> <span id="s118">See this man?</span> <span id="s119">Somehow or other I think it devastated the German economy when all these Jews left.</span> <span id="s120">And they're now doing a history.</span> <span id="s121">I'm sure you're aware of that.</span> <span id="s122">There used to be a man--I had to write to Germany for birth certificate or something to this little place called Korb.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: So the place your were born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Where I was born.</span> <span id="s125">And there was a man there who knew my father by the name of (?</span> <span id="s126">Weterhour?)</span> <span id="s127">who's doing a history of the Jews that lived in that area.</span> <span id="s128">The problem was (?</span> <span id="s129">Weterhour?)</span> <span id="s130">--my German is gone.</span> <span id="s131">It's gone.</span> <span id="s132">And he couldn't talk English; so all the letters were in German which I had to have translated, and I think in '90, my son--where's my son--here.</span> <span id="s133">Had to go the France, and he says, "You know, Mom, I'd like to go to Adelsheim because that's where we lived," and I wrote to (?</span> <span id="s134">Weterhour?)</span> <span id="s135">And low and behold, I got a letter back in English.</span> <span id="s136">(?</span> <span id="s137">Weterhour?)</span> <span id="s138">was getting too old to take care of ___.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: So that's the last name of the man?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: That's the last name of the man.</span> <span id="s141">This man was taken and his English is wonderful.</span> <span id="s142">So Allen went to Germany and met him, and he persuaded us go to.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: To visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: There's another little village called Sennfeld, which is near Adelsheim where the synagogue was still standing.</span> <span id="s145">And he--they opened it as a museum.</span> <span id="s146">I think upstairs are oldfashioned farm utensils, and down stairs is all Jewish.</span> <span id="s147">So we've been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">(Background noise)</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: But mostly we don't--</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, out of five, this waswe really very close.</span> <span id="s151">These are my nieces.</span> <span id="s152">I got eight nieces, one nephew, and one son.</span> <span id="s153">So there are ten cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: So you were four girls and one boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: And you were the oldest?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I was the oldest.</span> <span id="s158">I'm still is oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: What was you language growing up in--in home.</span> <span id="s160">Was it Yiddish, or was it German?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: It was German.</span> <span id="s162">I didn't--I don't--I can't speak Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Were there any other languages they were spoken at home?</span> <span id="s164">Did you feel yourself German, more German than Jewish, or equally German as Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: I never gave it a thought.</span> <span id="s166">I knew I was German, and I knew I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: And it was normal?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Can you let me a little bit about what life was like.</span> <span id="s170">It wasn't Adelsheim that you have the most memories.</span> <span id="s171">What are your earliest memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Because I was a year old when they moved from Korb to Adelsheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Do you have some earliest memories you could share?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: My father was very strict.</span> <span id="s175">I think he was boss, and there were--because of his one leg--we lived on a hill.</span> <span id="s176">We were never allowed to go bicycle riding.</span> <span id="s177">We were never allowed to go to snow--sledding because he as afraid that if we needed help, he couldn't--</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: He couldn't be there to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: He couldn't be there to do it.</span> <span id="s180">But we did.</span> <span id="s181">We did.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: How can you keep kids from doing stuff like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I know.</span> <span id="s184">And when we were out playing, and he wanted us to come home, he would stand in the front of the steps of our house and whistle.</span> <span id="s185">Everybody in that little Adelsheim knew that whistle so.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: That was Mr. Rosenfeld's whistle?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: I don't know what else.</span> <span id="s188">I think we had very normal childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What was your mother like?</span> <span id="s190">Was she somebody who stayed at home and took care of the house, or did she work?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Well, not really because when the weather was bad, she had to go with him to do whatever earned him a living because of his--he couldn't walk on ice.</span> <span id="s192">He couldn't walk on snow.</span> <span id="s193">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: So she was part of his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I guess so, yeah.</span> <span id="s196">I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: And how did he lose his leg?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: In the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: But as a soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: He was in the front?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s203">And, you know, when you're growing up, you accept things and you don't look at ages and somebody who's maybe fourfoot tall if you're that big, their tall.</span> <span id="s204">But he was only a teenager.</span> <span id="s205">When I think back of when he lost his leg, he was only a teenager when he lost his leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: And so he was also very young when he became a father because that was</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: In the 20s.</span> <span id="s209">Did he talk about World War I with the kids?</span> <span id="s210">Did he tell stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: No.</span> <span id="s212">I just remember him saying, when he came home from the war, he went on a motorcycle, and he had a bad experience.</span> <span id="s213">I don't know what happened, but I remember he said, "Don't ever go on a motorcycle."</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: So he was fearful for his kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s216">Friday nights he would inspect our hair for lice, our nails, our toenails.</span> <span id="s217">I think German men--I don't know about only

id="s226">Q: Well, that's also unusual for a man in--in a place where there was very distinct roles that were assigned to who does what.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: I guess, yeah.</span> <span id="s228">I suppose.</span> <span id="s229">You know, when you</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: You don't think of things like that when you're a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Not

Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: So we went back to my aunt's.</span> <span id="s330">I don't know anything about their lives really, but I do remember that sometimes in the evening there were people there, and they were not there in the morning.</span> <span id="s331">So I think my aunts must have smuggled them across the border because it was right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: And we didn't know anything about this, but their Kindertransport had been formed, and my aunts--I don't know who made arrangements for us to come to England on the Kindertransport.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: We'll come to that, but first I still have a few questions.</span> <span id="s337">They may sound almost like side questions, but they're curious for me.</span> <span id="s338">When you would go from Adelsheim to first Heilbronn.</span> <span id="s339">I think it was the first one?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Heilbronn.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: And then after that to Aachen, do you remember how you got there?</span> <span id="s342">Were you--</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: A train.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: You went by train.</span> <span id="s345">And was there any kind of experience did you have on the trains, or it doesn't stay in your memory at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: And when you were still in the school where you were together with other non Jewish children, did you feel anything different in the air?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: I might have, but I don't remember.</span> <span id="s351">I do remember when Iwhen we were in Adelsheim, we had to say, "Hail Hitler" to the to the teachers, and I don't know why that stands in my mind, but I met a teacher, and I was carrying books, and I dropped the books and said, "Hail Hitter."</span> <span id="s352">And he came over and he said, "You don't have to do that."</span> <span id="s353">I don't know why that stands, but I also don't know whether that's real or not real.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s355">Why would you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Because it happenedI don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: You know.</span> <span id="s359">I was--I was a youngster.</span> <span id="s360">I just remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Did--was there talk at home about Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: I only remember at the elections my mother saying, "He won."</span> <span id="s363">I remember that.</span> <span id="s364">She said, "He won."</span> <span id="s365">And I guess that was Hitler who won.</span> <span id="s366">You know, the irony is we had a lot of relatives in America, and the whole family had affidavits to come to this country, but there was this stupid quota, and that's whyI remember my father was the second youngest.</span> <span id="s367">There was an uncle--younger.</span> <span id="s368">They were in business together in Adelsheim, and it was a question of whether my father should come, whether we should come, or his younger brother, and I remember he said his younger brother because if he can't work anymore he always has his pension.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Your father does?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s371">So my uncle came over, and we never made itI mean my parents never made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: So I assume from what you mentioned already you ended up on Kindertransport?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: You know what?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: I don't remember a thing about it.</span> <span id="s378">I do not remember.</span> <span id="s379">I mean that's how we came--the three of us came.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: You were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Me, Edith, and Ruth.</span> <span id="s382">My mother--my mother had a sister who went to England--to London in '33.</span> <span id="s383">And at that time she went to work for a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s384">They could only do domestic work, but anyhow, by the time the Kindertransport, she'd been there six years and her--many friends; so she found us homes.</span> <span id="s385">We wereRuth was in a hostile, but Edith and I were always with private people.</span> <span id="s386">She had found homes for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: So you don't remember saying goodbye to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: I never saw them.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: So you were inafter Kristallnacht, you were still in Aachen and did you ever go back--</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Kristallnacht was in November, and we came in--in March.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: So for four months later, you stayed in Aachen?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Right.</span> <span id="s393">With my aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: With your aunts.</span> <span id="s395">You never went back to Adelsheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Huhuh.</span> <span id="s397">Now, my brother--Esther came out too.</span> <span id="s398">She was still in Adelsheim, and how she got on Kindertransport--she did, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s399">I can't imagine that in that small Adelsheim thereI think my aunts in Aachen made all those arrangements I think, but I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: So from the time--do youfrom the time of Kristallnacht--</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: November.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: November to Kindertransport, do you have any memories?</span> <span id="s403">Did you continue going to a school next to a burnt down synagogue, or was that done as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: You know, I really don't remember.</span> <span id="s405">I do remember Nazis coming to investigate, to look for arms in the house, and they turned the furniture upside down.</span> <span id="s406">Some things I remember, but that I really don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Do you remember any other kinds of exposure or confrontation toone of the questions I was getting to ask, but didn't get to before, is did you have any non Jewish German friends?</span> <span id="s408">Did you have any contact</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: I guess in Adelsheim, I don't know, but in Aachen--</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s411">But if it was in Adelsheim, do you have any memories of it?</span> <span id="s412">Other children that you went to school with?</span> <span id="s413">Kids you played with?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: No, but when we went back and I met somebody I went to school with.</span> <span id="s415">But--she remembered me; I didn't remember her.</span> <span id="s416">But, you know, talking about what you remember, my brotherwhy my parents didn't have him go on the Kindertransport I have no idea, but he stayed with my parents.</span> <span id="s417">And in 1940 when Hitler rounded up all theand sent them to Gurs, and Rivesaltes.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Is that where your parents ended up?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: That where my parents with my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: So he was in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: This was in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: And he came over here.</span> <span id="s424">I don't know when he came over here.</span> <span id="s425">With a thousand children--you've heard of a thousand children?</span> <span id="s426">Came to my uncle and he spoke only French.</span> <span id="s427">He couldn't remember anything about the camp at all.</span> <span id="s428">If you wanted to, you know, would remember a thing about it.</span> <span id="s429">And I guess people just drop unpleasant memories.</span> <span id="s430">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: But you were then how old?</span> <span id="s432">You were 14 or 15 when--</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: When we came to England it was in March '39.</span> <span id="s434">In October, that year, I would have been 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: So you were a 13 and a halfyearold girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: And what were you first memories of England?</span> <span id="s440">Of London?</span> <span id="s441">Do you have anything in there that you can--</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: My aunt found me a home with a family named Pool.</span> <span id="s443">They were not Jewish, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s444">They had a grown son.</span> <span id="s445">I mean they could've been my grandparents.</span> <span id="s446">They were an older couple.</span> <span id="s447">Mr. Pool was the chauffeur for the people that my aunt worked for.</span> <span id="s448">They were Jewish, and I went there, and they were very typically English.</span> <span id="s449">I remember some things.</span> <span id="s450">In fact, I remember the address where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Where were this?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Number 10 Elm street in England--in London--an outskirt of London, and they had a maid, and I spent a lot of time in the kitchen with the maid, and I think when she asked me something and didn't understand, she would show me.</span> <span id="s453">I think I had to credit her with learning English.</span> <span id="s454">Of course, I was going to school, and I didn't do too well in school, I think.</span> <span id="s455">They were never too happy with my grades.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: So your aunt worked for a welltodo Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: And in that family there was also a chauffeur, and their names were Pool?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Noyeah.</span> <span id="s460">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: The chauffeurs names were Pool?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: And they, themselves, had a maid at home and--who taught you English; is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Well, because--when I didn't understand, she went and showed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: If she said, "Get the sugar," didn't know what she was talking about.</span> <span id="s467">She would go and get it and--</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: And show you, and so you connected the word?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: And they always ate in the dining room.</span> <span id="s470">This is the British.</span> <span id="s471">So one day he's sitting, and he's going like this (tapping sounds on the table) and I said, "Shut up."</span> <span id="s472">Well, you would imagine that was the call for the maid.</span> <span id="s473">And since then, I have never used shut up on anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Did he understand that you didn't know?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s476">He understood.</span> <span id="s477">He understood.</span> <span id="s478">Mrs. Pool was originally from Scotland; so when there was talk of war, there was talk of her evacuating to Scotland, and we were in the train on September 3rd on our way--hadn't left London left to Scotland when war was declared.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: That meant when Hitler invaded Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Right.</span> <span id="s481">And I did know she suddenly got homesick; so I don't know how long we were there, but it from a small--up north in Scotland.</span> <span id="s482">Up north of Aberdeen Scotland, a small village.</span> <span id="s483">And that, you know, they--first of all, I don't think they even seen a Jewa foreigner.</span> <span id="s484">So--but I went to school there, and it was a pretty good school.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: By that point, that's half a year.</span> <span id="s486">You know, when you went to Scotland, you've been in Britain for half a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Do youin that time, had you picked up English enough that you could converse, or--</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: I remember we had English lessons in Germany, and they probably helped me, but not enough to do a conversation.</span> <span id="s491">Notbut it probably helped me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: But you came from a large family, and there you were suddenly just you.</span> <span id="s493">No sisters.</span> <span id="s494">No brother.</span> <span id="s495">No parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Well, just me living with the Pools.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Now, Edith lived with a Jewish family in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: The Pools weren't Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s501">But she lived in London, and Edith was the only onewell, Ruth did too with a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s502">There were a motherin that household, there was a mother and a daughter and her husband, and the daughter and her--his really sponsored or whatever, but they both worked .</span> <span id="s503">So the old lady was the only one at home taking care of Edith, and she was a bitch.</span> <span id="s504">She thought she had a cheap maid.</span> <span id="s505">The Pools were very good to me.</span> <span id="s506">We went toI remember we went to the seaside once on vacationthey always went to the seaside, and we took Edith.</span> <span id="s507">We took Edith.</span> <span id="s508">RuthRuth lived with a--went to a doctor, Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s509">They used to be doing the workdo you have a Bloomsbury House in England--in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: I did, but not in connection to the war.</span> <span id="s511">Bloomsbury House--</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Bloomsbury House arranged to take care of children.</span> <span id="s513">They were very involved with the Kindertransport.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: And were they a government agency?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: No, it was a volunteer--no it was a Jewish--I don't know who it was because I don't think it exists anymore.</span> <span id="s516">However, somewhere in the last few years, you could send to Bloomsbury House for your record.</span> <span id="s517">They checked on kinders and things like that.</span> <span id="s518">(?</span> <span id="s519">Anhel?)</span> <span id="s520">and my aunt in England knew them.</span> <span id="s521">I don't know how she knew Doctor (?</span> <span id="s522">Lobby Nickels?)</span> <span id="s523">but they had a maid who was German, and my aunt wasto tell you the truth, I really don't know, but anyhow Ruth went to live with Doctor Lobby Nickles.</span> <span id="s524">But then Bloomsbury House evacuated when the bombs started falling in London, evacuated some of these kinder to hotels, and Ruth was evacuated to a hostel.</span> <span id="s525">Sobut Lobby Nickels and Nick was Jewish.</span> <span id="s526">They were Jewish.</span> <span id="s527">And how Esther got to England with the Kindertransport, we don't really know.</span> <span id="s528">It was in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Of '39.</span> <span id="s530">Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yeah, before the war.</span> <span id="s532">I think they must have advertised it for people who wanted to take--because they got 10,000 kids out.</span> <span id="s533">And a couple in Whales had wanted a child, but then I think the husband got sick or something was sick.</span> <span id="s534">Now this couple, Harrison, lived in Norwich, England, and Norwich, England, there were a lot of shoe factories and Harry Harrison worked in a factory that was owned by a Jew, and on the bulletin board that they needed homes for--</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Children.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Children.</span> <span id="s537">So they had one son.</span> <span id="s538">And I guess he went home and discussed it with his wife, and they decided to take a girl, and that's how Esther got to the Harrison's in Norwich, England.</span> <span id="s539">How she got on the Kindertransport, we don't really--</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: And she had been born when?</span> <span id="s541">'36 did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Esther was born inyeah '30let's see '37.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: She was a baby.</span> <span id="s544">She was a toddler.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Two.</span> <span id="s546">She was two.</span> <span id="s547">Well, Kindertransport went to London, and from London she was going to Norwich, but my mother had written to my aunt that-what was happening.</span> <span id="s548">So she wentmy aunt went to the station to see Esther, and Esther naturally walked towards her.</span> <span id="s549">I guess because she looked like my mother.</span> <span id="s550">I don't really know.</span> <span id="s551">But she went to the Harrison's, and the Harrison's were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s552">And they had one son, and you would think--Allen was seven, I think, at the time.</span> <span id="s553">You would think he would be jealous of her.</span> <span id="s554">He adores--to this day, he adores the ground she walks on.</span> <span id="s555">He's been over herecomes over here quite often.</span> <span id="s556">And he's likethe parents have since died, but that's how Esther got to the Harrison's.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: So all five children--</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s559">That's right.</span> <span id="s560">All five children.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: In Britain.</span> <span id="s562">And these are all--</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: That photo shows all of them.</span> <span id="s564">We were really very close.</span> <span id="s565">This is mythis iswe're all related except him.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: What's his name?</span> <span id="s567">This man--is he from Adelsheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: That'shis name is (?</span> <span id="s569">Lockman?)</span> <span id="s570">(?</span> <span id="s571">Rinehart Lockman?)</span> <span id="s572">This is he, and this is his wife, and they are the two nicest people I havebut these were all relatives.</span> <span id="s573">These were husbands and children and whatever.</span> <span id="s574">And we all were very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: How--a couple of questions.</span> <span id="s576">Do you remember during the time when you were with the Pools, did you think of what was going on with your parents?</span> <span id="s577">Do you remember being worried about what might be going on with them, or was that out of mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: You know, I never--no because we were always told that my parents would pick us up in England and we were coming to America.</span> <span id="s579">One day I got a telegram that said that is our new address.</span> <span id="s580">I didn't really--you know, you really don't think of what could happen.</span> <span id="s581">When it happens, you're surprised, but then they were sent to Gurs, and I remember--oh at 16, I had toI had to go to work, and I did.</span> <span id="s582">And then I remember we got letters.</span> <span id="s583">In fact, I gave the letters after all these years--after all these years, I gave the letters to--my mother's letters to the</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: To the Holocaustto our museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s588">Took me a long time, and I don't think they have all of them because they were always written to my aunt and me, and she must have kept some.</span> <span id="s589">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Was it over a period of years that she wrote those letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Your motherwas it over a period of years that she wrote these letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Well, it must have been just a year or two.</span> <span id="s594">I don't know how long they were in Gurs, but I used to save my money and send them money, and the last lot of--and that was through the Quakers--through the Quakers.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: And so you--</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: The last lot of money they were not there, and the Quakers sent me the money back because I mean--it was my--I remembermy mother'smy father's leg needed mending or something needed money.</span> <span id="s597">I don't know.</span> <span id="s598">I don't know.</span> <span id="s599">I don't really want to talk about that.</span> <span id="s600">I don't really want to talk about that.</span> <span id="s601">So ask me a question.</span> <span id="s602">I don't what to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Well, my next question was going to be when did you find out that they were no longer there?</span> <span id="s604">Was that when you got the money back?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: There's a book out that lists each transport from--I don't know if you're familiar with--can you take this off so I can get that.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: So you're showing me a book that lists those--Rosenfeld--Katty and Adolf 19991899 1898?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Oh that's his birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s611">Adelsheim is where they're from?</span></p> <p><span

us, but they couldn't--they could only go shoppinggrocery shopping certain times, and then there was nothing left in the stores.</span> <span id="s687">And we met someone when we went over there who used to leave food at my parents doorstep at night.</span> <span id="s688">Because, you know, I think the people who lived in Adelsheim, there were no Nazis.</span> <span id="s689">There were no Nazis.</span> <span id="s690">We also met someone with a son who said--who was there when they rounded up all the Jews.</span> <span id="s691">We met someone who watched--this man with his father

id="s725">Q: And yet there are very few actual memories.</span> <span id="s726">Maybe because, as you say, it's blotted out because it was so painful.</span> <span id="s727">And for being so close, yet as you were growing up in formative years, for you, you were the oldest.</span> <span id="s728">And you were going into adolescence, but they spent their childhoods--and you were all scattered all over the place.</span> <span id="s729">So there are ironies as to how it is that you became close, you know, and many other--</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Because in England we saw each other.</span> <span id="s731">We were in touch.</span> <span id="s732">I couldI used toI knew someonea boy, who lived in England with his aunt who came fromI forget where he came fromhad a brother here in--in New York.</span> <span id="s733">He wanted to stay, and I couldn't understand why the brother didn't come to England or why he wouldn't want to be with his brotherbut he never did come over here.</span> <span id="s734">And I know people here who have sisters in Canada.</span> <span id="s735">I just never could up understand that.</span> <span id="s736">Now, four of usno three of us, myself, Edith, and Ruth, we came over to this country in '47.</span> <span id="s737">Edith didn't come until '48 because she was in the British Army.</span> <span id="s738">She had joined the British Army and was not what they called "demobbed" until '48.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: That's still ashe was a</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Discharged.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: She was a

old?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Well, she jointed the British Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: So she didn't comeand she came over here election night, when Truman was elected.</span> <span id="s748">And she couldn'twe were so excited about Truman that we really neglected her, and she got very upset.</span> <span id="s749">But we came over here to live with an uncle and aunt and--and--and life was horrible.</span> <span id="s750">My aunt was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s751">She was very neurotic.</span> <span id="s752">So when Edith came over here, I--Iwewe had to leave.</span> <span id="s753">No other choice.</span> <span id="s754">But when Edith came, she lived there too, and then we decided we just couldn't do it anymore.</span> <span id="s755">I had a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: What town what this?</span> <span id="s757">What city was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Where did you come over to?</span> <span id="s760">Where did your aunt live?</span> <span id="s761">The American.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: In Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: In Washington.</span> <span id="s764">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: In Washington.</span> <span id="s766">We decided we were going--we took an apartment to live by ourselves.</span> <span id="s767">And so Edith and I took an apartment, which at that time were hard to come by.</span> <span id="s768">I had a job, and she got a job.</span> <span id="s769">I remember--and she wasI had been a year, and she was getting five dollars more a week than I was; so I got furious with her.</span> <span id="s770">I got furious with her, but anyhow, we looked for an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: So the two of you then lived together, and did the others move in with you as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Was this the first time then you could say first in the</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: I think that's how we got close.</span> <span id="s775">I don't know.</span> <span id="s776">I really don't know, but there was a teenager there we were in our early 20's, picking up a teaI don't think we could do it today.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: This is why I say it's so--in some ways, it could have gone so much the other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: It could have.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: It could have gone such that the children are all scattered in England.</span> <span id="s780">They grow up their formative years, have different impressions, they don't have memories of really where they came from, and they're strangers to one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Did your aunts play a role, the ones in Britain?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s784">She came over here twice to this country to visit, but I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Yeah, but I don't remember in Britain</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: She was also neurotic.</span> <span id="s787">I lived with herafter I had to leave school at 16, she found me a room in London and a job, but anyhow I lived with her.</span> <span id="s788">She was also neurotic.</span> <span id="s789">She was a chef in--in a restaurant, and she was neurotic.</span> <span id="s790">When she was angry, she would bake.</span> <span id="s791">To this day, I do very little baking because of--but I think she did.</span> <span id="s792">I think she did.</span> <span id="s793">She kept in touch withwith all of us.</span> <span id="s794">In fact, I have a cousin in London that I didn't know was there 'till my aunt found her many, many years ago, but--</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: What were your mother's letters about when she would write to you while she was in--</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: We should be good.</span> <span id="s797">We must to do this and do that.</span> <span id="s798">She'd give us orders and, you know, be good children.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: But not much about what was going on with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Not too much.</span> <span id="s801">Not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Did your father write?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A:

job.</span> <span id="s827">I had trouble getting a job because who would send to EnglandI never thought of getting references, and who would send to England for referenceswhat?</span> <span id="s828">Then I also found a little antiSemitism.</span> <span id="s829">Some of the places I applied to for a jobsomebody later said they don't employ Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: In Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: But, and, you know what?</span> <span id="s832">They really don't tell, you know, we're not going to hire.</span> <span id="s833">They kind of will let you know, and you never hear from them again.</span> <span id="s834">Then I applied for a job, and I went there.</span> <span id="s835">Went to this address, and when I got to the address, an old man came out, and he said to me, "Are you looking for the job?"</span> <span id="s836">I said, "Yes, I am."</span> <span id="s837">He said, "Go in there and ask for Ms. Stopkin."</span> <span

<span id="s846">They were thinking of hiring someone to cut down on the working hours, and that person learned the whole thing.</span> <span id="s847">I learned the whole thing.</span> <span id="s848">She called me.</span> <span id="s849">I don't know if either one of you is Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: No.</span> <span id="s851">I'm not.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: There

<span id="s892">The problem was what to do with Esther over the summer, and Hyman Goldman was on the board of Camp Louise, which is a Jewish camp.</span> <span id="s893">So for five dollars a week, we would send her to camp.</span> <span id="s894">He was on the board, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: And so he made it happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span

she would tell meand she and somebody else went to Adelsheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: At that time right after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: When she was in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s928">British Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: And someone on the street stopped her and said, "Are you Adolf Rosenfeld's daughter?"</span> <span id="s930">So that's what happened.</span> <span id="s931">Let's see--but their attitude--I remember Esther said to me--who can't remember Germany.</span> <span id="s932">She was tooshe was thinking of going back, and she said to me, "Did you ever consider going back?"</span> <span id="s933">As if they couldget lost in the sea--I said, "No.</span> <span id="s934">I wouldn't."</span> <span id="s935">Well, she persuaded me to change my mind, but that was in, I think '89 or something.</span> <span id="s936">I don't remember the date, but Morris got sick.</span> <span id="s937">So they wentwe made agreements to go, but Morris got sick, and she and her husband went.</span> <span id="s938">So I guess that was my attitude at that time.</span> <span id="s939">I don't ever care to go back, but when Allen went and met Rinehart, I changed my mind.</span> <span id="s940">I went to the house where I was born, you know.</span> <span id="s941">Have you ever lived in a small place?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: No--</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Whenin a little town, you see a bunch of people, and you wonder why they're there.</span> <span id="s944">We were standing in Korb.</span> <span id="s945">Rinehart had taken us there.</span> <span id="s946">In front of this, he says, "This is the house," and I have pictures of the house.</span> <span id="s947">That's where your father lived.</span> <span id="s948">So we were standing there, and somebody from the house looked out, and they wondered while all these people were standing there, and they said something.</span> <span id="s949">And it was the daughter who hadher parents had bought the house from my father, and she didn't live in it, but she came there once a year to go to the cemetery of her parents, and that's when she stayed in the house.</span> <span id="s950">So they just happened to be in the house and they asked us into the house.</span> <span id="s951">We went into the house.</span> <span id="s952">Then we went back to Adelsheim.</span> <span id="s953">The German government had sold my parent's house to somebody who we wentwere invited into that house, which had changed greatly from when we lived in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: So you had memories of how it had looked before?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Do you have anydid you have any photographs that--let's say relatives had gotten in the United States that would have had your family before you went on the Kindertransport that would have had pictures of the place of where your lived, of how your parents looked, and things like that?</span> <span id="s957">We'll put it on tapethis photo that you're showing me of your family before the Kindertransport, it must have been very recent before the Kindertransport.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: It was.</span> <span id="s959">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Because Esther's already--</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: She looked a little--yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s963">And so when was the first time you wentdid you only go back the Germany once?</span> <span id="s964">Twice?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Twice?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: In '90, and in '95.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: In '90 and in '95.</span> <span id="s969">But you mentioned earlier that there had been 1982?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s971">That must have been wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s973">So it would have been one of those</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: I have to ask Esther.</span> <span id="s975">I don't remember, but they had a memorial.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Forfor I think it was in 202.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: In 202.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: 60 years 60 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: 60 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: In 202.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s983">So that would have meant three times that you've been back.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s985">That was over the weekend.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s987">So</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: But it was a funny thing, you know, Rinehart had wrote us what they were doing, and he wrote to me, andI said to Esther, "You know, Esther, I think we ought to go."</span> <span id="s989">And she just went like that.</span> <span id="s990">About 2025 years ago, I got a letter from someone in Ireland.</span> <span id="s991">And said, "Dear Mrs. Esenstad, I think we are related."</span> <span id="s992">Well, he's thethe man who wrote it is a geologist, and he had been in a department in Ireland, and he went to Germany for a dig, and, you know, they keep all kinds of records.</span> <span id="s993">His mother was Jewish.</span> <span id="s994">His father wasn't, but when the war started--or beforehis Jewish grandmother and his Jewish aunt came to live with them in England, and they got to England because they were antiNazi and they escaped.</span> <span id="s995">I think they met at the university somewhere in Germany and went to work for the pope.</span> <span id="s996">And they both converted to Catholicism, but he said he was greatly influenced by his Jewish grandmother and aunt.</span> <span id="s997">So when he went back to Germany on a dig, he thought he would find out about his mother.</span> <span id="s998">I had written to Germany because I needed copies of birth certificates, and that led him to Korb, and when he got to Korblater I said to him, you know, soandso is in Englandis in America.</span> <span id="s999">And he wrote.</span> <span id="s1000">They gave him my address, and he wrote to me, and he told me how we were related.</span> <span id="s1001">He sent us family trees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: How were you related?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: His great grandhe'sPeter is now 60 something, I would think.</span> <span id="s1004">He's much younger than we are.</span> <span id="s1005">His greatsomehow or another, his great, great grandfather and my great, great, greatwhatever, very far.</span> <span id="s1006">But, you know, we are--and we've met and he's been here a couple of times.</span> <span id="s1007">They came for Amelia's Bot Mitzvah, he and his wife.</span> <span id="s1008">We've stayed at his house in Ireland and spent some time with him.</span> <span id="s1009">But there we are.</span> <span id="s1010">You never know who you</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: You never know.</span> <span id="s1012">You never know.</span> <span id="s1013">And you'reI think we're coming close to the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Oh I--</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: I think we are, but I want to make sure there aren't any questions that I should have asked that I haven't asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Well, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1017">I wouldn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: I'm ___ myself at the moment.</span> <span id="s1019">Is there something that you would want your childrenhave you talked about these things with your children?</span> <span id="s1020">Did they ask?</span> <span id="s1021">Were they curious about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: You know, this person that I worked with in England, he came on my Kindertransport too.</span> <span id="s1023">We never talked about it.</span> <span id="s1024">The Kindertransportchildren didn't ask too many questions, but they do know.</span> <span id="s1025">They do know.</span> <span id="s1026">We all have the most wonderful children so, right?</span> <span id="s1027">But it'sKindertransport has only been talked about since '89, and that is because the 50th anniversary of the Kindertransport and the Leventhal--whatever her name is--half this reunion.</span> <span id="s1028">Do you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: No, I don't.</span> <span id="s1030">I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: She and her sister organized this reunion--50year reunion in London.</span> <span id="s1032">We didn't go.</span> <span id="s1033">They came from all over.</span> <span id="s1034">They cameI didn't thinkI don't think we thought they would have such a turn out.</span> <span id="s1035">But it's only been

<p><span id="s1047">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1048">They all were very close with their siblings, I think.</span> <span id="s1049">And I remember all the letters from my mother--we should do this, and we should do that, and we shouldyou know.</span> <span id="s1050">She gave us orders because I don't think--I mean it's unimaginable, Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1051">They would not have--</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: She didn't think that what's what would be--</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: No.</span> <span id="s1054">I'm sure they didn't.</span> <span id="s1055">You
