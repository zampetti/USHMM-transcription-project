Two audio cassettes
Abstract Lillian Lazar, née Guzenfiter, was born in Warsaw on June 16, 1924 into a middle class Jewish family. She was an only child who recalls being pampered. Her father, Jacob, and grandfather were in the jewelry business. Her father had been an officer in the Polish army in World War I. Her mother, Natalia, a housewife, was an intellectual like the rest of her family. Lillian had dreamed of becoming Poland’s second female district attorney.
Beginning in late 1940, Jews had to wear the yellow star. She rebelled and did not wear the star occasionally, but was beaten by Polish children. She and her parents were sent to the small ghetto in Prosta. Her father got papers as an Aryan, and left the ghetto to make papers for his wife and Lillian to live as Aryans. Lillian got work at the ghetto’s Tobbens factory that made German military uniforms. She worked 12 hours daily for one bowl of soup, which she shared with her mother, whom Lillian hid. Her mother became increasingly weak from starvation and a heart condition.
Her mother, extremely weak, left to search for her husband. Germans shot her in January 1943. Most of their family had been taken to the large ghetto, and most died from starvation. When Germans surrounded the ghetto, her grandfather took only his prayer shawl and prayer book, and told people not to cry. Lillian’s grandparents, all her cousins, aunt, and mother were killed.
Just before the ghetto uprising, Lillian saw a German shoot a mother with baby in arms, refuse to “waste a bullet” on a baby, and throw the child who “fell in pieces.” On May 8, Germans surrounded the factory. Lillian took scissors to defend herself. When a German saw the scissors, he hit her with a rifle in the thigh, face, and arms, leaving her unconscious. She and the remaining few hundred factory workers were sent in cattle cars to Majdanek.
She was beaten there twice, once for trying to eat a carrot, and once for trying to eat bread. She escaped by hiding in a large pipe that was being laid for water or sewage. She got on a train going to Skarzysko (Skarzysko Kamienna), where she worked making bullets for rifles. “I guess luck was always behind me watching over me.” A German soldier sneaked bits of garbage to her, and was sent to the front lines. She performed sabotage by approving several bushels of bullets that were not good.
She gained freedom on January 18, 1945, exactly two years after her mother was shot. She says that Russians enslaved women they liberated. They raped one woman and she hanged herself.
She married a man she’d known in the ghetto, got pregnant, and went to Italy. With their baby, they immigrated to Uniontown, PA, which was a “paradise”. They had a second child but divorced. Lillian says that she and her second husband are very happy together.
She is the only survivor among 109 family members. “You're always thinking of those that perished.”
Interview 001 Anthony: Today is December 9, 1991. I am Anthony Di Iorio and I am at the home of Anthony and Lillian Lazar. I'm here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and I am about to interview Lillian about her experiences during the time of the holocaust. Lillian, good morning.
Lillian: Good morning.
Anthony: Where were you born?
002 Lillian: I was born in Warsaw, Poland, June 16, 1924 into a middle class Jewish family. My mother's name was Natalia. They were called Kanaja and my father Jacob. As far as I remember, we were comfortable, maybe because I was the only child. That's why I don't remember any discomforts. My father was in the jewelry business. My grandfather, my father's father, was also in the jewelry business. We had a store in Warsaw. I remember as a little girl of three or four years old going with my mother to the store, bringing my father lunch. In Poland, there wasn't the same way of living as we have in the United States that you run out to a grocery or to a candy store for a cup of coffee. So my mother was bringing my father lunch into the store every day and I remember going with her. The store was quite big. I still have it in my memory a big iron safe, I don't know why I remember it, where we always put the jewelry for the night and in the morning we're taking it out from the safe and displaying it. My father was more of a businessman, quite successful. I don't think I'm prejudiced, but I think quite smart in the business. Well, my mother's side, my mother's father, my mother were more intellectuals. Whenever I was going to my grandparents, and it was quite often because I was the only girl in the family, they were always trying to tell me stories, trying to teach me something. It was never just a day spent there but my grandfather, the minute I came in he knew already, to read me something or tell me a story. In the meantime, they were feeding me, I was a bad eater. So always in my memory the stories my grandfather used to tell me. It was like two sides of the families -- my father's side the business people, my mother's side the intellectuals, with the books and stories.
Anthony: Did your grandparents live in the same home or did they live in a different house?
026 Lillian: In the same city, in Warsaw?
Anthony: I mean did they live in the same house as you or did they live separately?
Lillian: Separately, but they were the best sitters. So whenever my parents wanted to go out in the evening, I didn't mind. I was going to my grandparents, spending a night, a day, or sometimes two days with my grandparents. I was the youngest grandchild and the only girl so I was quite pampered.
Anthony: Was your mother a housewife or did she work outside?
Lillian: A housewife, just helping out in the store sometimes.
Anthony: But an intellectual.
Lillian: Yes.
Anthony: She read books and… Lillian: Always books as far as I remember. There were not too many people at that time speaking many languages, but I remember my grandfather. He spoke good Russian; he spoke German. My father and my mother spoke French because my father's sisters were in Paris, and they were planning when I grow up to send me to Paris to study and probably they were trying to pull me in to listen to the language, or to speak it. But just because they were trying so hard, I didn't really want to learn French. I don't know for what reason.
Anthony: Which languages were spoken in your home?
037 Lillian: Polish.
Anthony: Polish. No Yiddish?
Lillian: My grandparents spoke Yiddish. With me, they spoke Polish. There was always a reason for it. In school, if you didn't speak a perfect Polish, the children were making fun of you and beating you up because you are a Jew and you don't speak fluent Polish, or with an accent, and because they were intellectuals the way they were so they were trying to speak Polish with me so that my Polish would be perfect and clear and I wouldn't have problems in school later.
Anthony: Did you attend public school?
Lillian: I was going to a private kindergarten, and as a matter of fact I met my teacher from the kindergarten. She's alive and she's in Florida. Of course, an old woman. After that private kindergarten, I was going to a public school, what you call here the first school, elementary school. After six years of schooling in Poland if you want to go to high school, you were automatically transferred to like a junior high that they started at that time. That was four years of junior high. If you didn't want to go to high school, then you had to go to school for seven years. Of course, my mother wouldn't hear of something else but sending her only child to a high school so I went only for six years. I pretty good and I skipped one year. That was, I think, thanks to my grandfather with his always helping.
Anthony: So your schooling came to an end when you were a teenager?
054 Lillian: My official schooling came to an end in 1939 when the war started, when they bombarded Warsaw and when the Germans marched into Warsaw. That was the end of especially Jewish schools.
Anthony: So you did attend high school then?
Lillian: At that time, yes.
Anthony: Was that a Jewish high school or a public school?
Lillian: It was more on the private side. But only Jewish children attended.
Anthony: Was there Jewish religious instruction and so forth?
Lillian: If we want to attend, we had Jewish instructions. Who didn't want to attend could walk out from the class and didn't have to attend.
Anthony: Was your home a religious home? Did you observe the kosher laws?
Lillian: My grandparents, yes. My parents, no. But out of respect for their parents, they wouldn’t hurt them, so they conducted more or less a traditional home, not to hurt the parents, but they were not deeply religious people.
Anthony: Did you live in a mixed neighborhood, predominantly Jewish neighborhood?
064 Lillian: Mixed.
Anthony: In downtown Warsaw?
Lillian: It was *Placka Saski[ph] 115.
Anthony: That's the neighborhood.
Lillian: It still exists because I went to visit Warsaw a few years ago. It's there but not the same.
Anthony: No, of course not. Did you have any experiences with anti-Semitism when you grew up in Poland?
Lillian: Yes. That was one of the reasons that I had to speak Polish at home. In the elementary school, it was all Jewish people so we didn't feel too bad. But many times, the Aryans were waiting when we were coming out of school and chasing us, beating us up, pushing, kicking.
Anthony: These are children, Polish children?
Lillian: Polish children what they did to the Jewish children.
Anthony: So they harassed you, they chased you?
075 Lillian: Yes and called like filthy Jew, other not very pleasant names that I really wouldn't repeat.
Anthony: This is when you were in grade school?
Lillian: Yes.
Anthony: Did your parents talk about the anti-Semitism in Poland?
Lillian: Not my parents, my grandfather. He was in a way always telling me stories and trying to prepare me that something might happen, something could happen. Little stories that I should know what to do, how to react. But how can you prepare somebody to know how to react if something happens, that I shouldn't be afraid. He wanted me to be careful, but not grow up to be afraid. As a matter of fact, when I finished elementary school, I wrote once a letter to (at that time he was like saying here in the United States) the President of Poland. I wrote letters. I liked to write. And I wrote to his wife and two daughters. His name was Marshal Pilsudski. He was in command of the army. He was very good to Jewish people. As long as he was alive, it wasn't so bad. After his death, it was getting worse by the minute the anti-Semitism. And I wrote to him that I would like to attend high school that was mixed; that were gentiles and a few Jews, just to mix with other people. Or maybe it was a bigger challenge for me to do it. I don't really know why. I wrote that if he could help me I would love to go to a school and the name of that high school was Urszulanli [Ursuline]. Who was from Poland, from Warsaw knows that name. A lot of government officials send their children to that school and to me it was a challenge that I will go to that school with them together. I was there for a few months.
Anthony: So you were admitted to the school?
094 Lillian: I was admitted.
Anthony: And how old were you then?
Lillian: At that time, 12, 13. I just started.
Anthony: And he answered your letter?
095 Lillian: He answered my letter, and he told me that he called up the school and I should go with the letter and I'll be admitted. I wrote another letter that I have a very religious grandfather and I wouldn't be able to attend school on Saturday, that's our Sabbath. And he said not to worry about it. Again he answered to go to the school with the letter and they'll admit me and excuse me from attending school on Sabbath. I went to school for a few weeks. I felt miserable because the whole school probably had five or six Jewish pupils in it. But right in the middle of a session, they were yelling that we should go on the other side. The Jews should sit on the left side to make sure that everybody knows who is the Jew and who is the gentile. It was really the nicest way of getting your education beside being pushed around always, up and down the stairs. After a few weeks, I decided I wouldn't be able to go on with my schooling to a school like that. It's silly. You cannot attend it. My ambitions or my challenge came true. I had enough of it, and I went to a Jewish high school. It was the end of that school that were mixed, the Poles and the Jews together. By the way, my father was an officer in the Polish army. That was one of the reasons it was easier for me to attend that school because he was an officer, and I never thought being a daughter of an officer from the Polish army that I'll be treated in school the way I was treated.
Anthony: Did your father know Marshal Pilsudski personally?
Lillian: Yes, because he was the chief of the military in Poland at that time, and that was from the First World War.
Anthony: Right. And then President?
Lillian: Yes.
Anthony: What did you want to be when you grew up? Here you are going to school. You obviously had ambitions to go this top high school.
124 Lillian: You wouldn't believe it what I want to be, at that time what I was dreaming of. I read once a book. The name of the book of course in Polish was prokurator Alicja Horn. That means District Attorney, Alicja Horn was her name. I don't know for what reason. According to the book, that was the only woman district attorney in Poland, and I said I'll be the second.
Anthony: You wanted to be the second district attorney in Poland?
Lillian: I don't know why.
Anthony: And what did you parents think of this?
Lillian: They wouldn't care less; they would be very pleased with it if those dreams would come true. And I was telling my children when they were born and old enough to understand that that was my ambition and I would love to see them go to law school. Of course they didn't. They have other professions. But my youngest daughter married a district attorney. She said you see your wishes will come true eventually. You didn't go to law school, you didn't become a district attorney but Wayne, that's my son-in-law's name, he went to law school in Houston, Texas. His first job was an assistant district attorney, a district attorney, now he's a very famous lawyer in Houston, a criminal lawyer. So my daughter told me that my wishes in a way came true. It was fulfilled.
Anthony: But not in Poland.
Lillian: Not in Poland, and not for myself.
Anthony: So you planned eventually to go to a university.
144 Lillian: In Paris because my aunts, my father's sisters, were in Paris.
Anthony: The Sorbonne?
Lillian: Yes. So that was the plan. My father was going twice I think he was in Paris, that I remember. Once was, I think, in '35 that they had a gathering of all the countries like we had here in the United States the...how do you call it, I forgot already.
Anthony: Something political, economic?
Lillian: No, the exhibitions.
Anthony: Oh, the exhibition, an exposition, okay. I think it was in 1937. It would be like a World’s Fair?
Lillian: Something like that. '35 or '37. I hardly remember as a little girl. He was in Paris trying to prepare the ground that eventually [unintelligible] but of course it didn't work out.
Anthony: Did you pay attention to politics when you were growing up, when you were a teenager?
Lillian: Not really.
Anthony: How about someone like Hitler one of your neighbors after 1933?
159 Lillian: That had already more contact with our personal lives because people from Germany were sent into Poland. Those were people who were born in Poland and the Germans would not accept them as their citizens. Even if they were living all their lives in Germany, they were sent back to Poland, without money, without anything, whatever they could carry, a little suitcase with them. After a short while, there was no housing for them. In Warsaw, I remember they had kitchens where they were coming, and the Polish Jew was feeding them and giving them clothing, whatever help they could give them. That's how I started paying attention what's going on.
Anthony: So before that you really didn't pay any attention to Germany?
Lillian: Not to politics, no. Not at all.
Anthony: Going to school and growing up.
Lillian: Growing up, playing, having, if you can say so, a nice life. Probably because I was the only child, I don't know.
Anthony: You were spoiled?
Lillian: Probably. I don't remember, but probably yes.
Anthony: Did you have any non-Jewish girlfriends in Warsaw?
175 Lillian: Yes, one boy that lived in the same house and was exactly the same age. We were going to school as youngsters, but as we were growing up, the age of ten, he knew already that I'm Jewish and that's something to look down to, and I knew that he's gentile and I'm not going to be treated right by him because he is not Jewish. It was even hard to explain why. What was the difference between us? Here we grew up together, we're the same age, but all of a sudden our ways were in different directions for no reason, no purpose to it.
Anthony: He was your only non-Jewish friend?
Lillian: Yes.
Anthony: He doesn't sound like he was a friend.
186 Lillian: We grew up together because we lived in the same house. You couldn't hold onto non-Jewish friends. They didn't want to accept the Jewish people as friends. We had neighbors. We were talking with them saying hello, how are you, what was going on. I remember when I used to come to my grandfather, he had quite a few neighbors, non-Jews, they were frankly coming and talking about politics, what is going to happen. But you didn't feel a closeness between a Jew and a non-Jew. There was always a looking-down at a dirty Jew. That's how they called us always, dirty Jews.
Anthony: Did your parents ever think about leaving Poland during the 1930's?
Lillian: Not really leaving, maybe going to Paris because my aunts, my father's sisters were living there. But to leave Poland and to leave their parents and their families, no. Maybe for a short time, like for a few years and then come back, but not to leave permanently.
Anthony: Did you notice any changes after Marshal Pilsudski died? I remember you saying that he was considered a friend of the Jews and yet he died right around this time, I believe 1936 [1935]. Did your parents discuss changes after 1936 when different leaders start… 207 Lillian: Yes. You couldn't discuss business freely. Like for instance years back when I was a little girl you could close the stores on Saturday because it's your Sabbath, and keep them open Sunday as a Jew. Later on, they wouldn't allow us to do this. If you want to keep your business open Saturday you can, and even they force you to keep it open so people can shop and Sunday everything had to be closed if you like it or not. That's what I remember the difference already. After Marshal Pilsudski died, in the schools we felt it.
221 The Jewish children were treated different. Like before, we were not harassed coming out of schools where later on, after his death it was like a free hand. Do whatever you wanted with the Jews. So as little as I understood at that time, I knew that there is a difference.
Anthony: What do you recall doing on September 1, 1939?
226 Lillian: I was still in the country. We were usually going in the summer for two months to the country like you go here to the Catskill Mountains or to the seashore.
Anthony: So you weren't in Warsaw?
Lillian: No, not in Warsaw. They were talking about it and we started packing our things to go right back home. They thought that fall might come any minute, and I remember my mother was afraid, because my father was an officer in the army, that he might be one of the first to go back to the service. We left the country, we came back to Warsaw before the first, a day before.
Anthony: The day before the war broke out?
Lillian: Right. On the first the war broke out.
Anthony: So you were in Warsaw?
Lillian: Yes, and I think school was supposed to start within two or three days and of course, after the war started, the first to close were the Jewish public schools.
Anthony: Now there was a rather fierce battle for Warsaw in September 1939.
244 Lillian: It took probably a month when we saw the Germans marching into Warsaw.
Anthony: Was your father ever called up in the Polish army?
Lillian: Before the Germans even came in to Warsaw, all the young men started leaving Warsaw. They were afraid that they would be called into the army and the Germans are right behind them and we heard already that they were catching up with the Polish army and some they are taking as prisoners and some they are killing. And I asked who are they killing? Of course, the Jew. So who from the Jewish population was in the army was killed right away. Most of the young Jewish men including the officers were trying to leave Warsaw so they wouldn't be called into the army because of that purpose they knew already from other places that that's what they were doing with the people that they were catching in the uniforms.
Anthony: But your father remained.
264 Lillian: No, he left for a few weeks, and then he came back.
Anthony: But not in the army.
Lillian: Not in the army.
Anthony: What changes did you notice after the war came to an end and the Germans occupied Warsaw?
268 Lillian: For Poland, the war came to an end very fast, after a month or six weeks Poland was occupied, the Germans came in.
Anthony: Were you surprised, or was your father surprised, that the war ended so quickly and so disastrously, or was it expected?
Lillian: We were talking politics more with my grandparents, and I still remember my grandfather telling us Germans are bad, they'll hit you or they'll kill you from the back, but don't think that the Russians are much better. They'll hit you in the front, facing you, and the Germans will be behind you, but one is as bad as the other. He hated the commies and he hated the Germans.
Anthony: And he didn't expect the Poles to win?
283 Lillian: He didn't expect the Poles to win or to help us as Jews, altogether. As I mentioned before, my mother's side was the intellectuals. The schools of course right away they close all the Jewish schools. Some schools on the Aryan side were functioning, they were open, but no Jew had arrived to go to school. But my mother and other people like her would try very hard. They hired the teachers from those schools with the pupils and we had private lessons, not to miss out on time. They were so gullible probably, and they believed that another few months, another few months everything will come back to normal so we shouldn't lose time and we should be tutored privately so we can attend school after the war is over and everything comes back to normal. Each time, the lessons were in another friend's house. We were altogether about eight or nine kids with one teacher and that one teacher was teaching us a little of everything.
Anthony: Were there other changes with the German occupation?
302 Lillian: Plenty.
Anthony: Could you describe some of them and how they affected you?
Lillian: No food.
Anthony: No food. That's a major change.
Lillian: That's one of the major changes.
Anthony: You weren't planning on going on a diet then, were you?
310 Lillian: No. I was always a bad eater, so I had no problems with diets. The Aryans we suppose somehow they could buy food and in the stores was more available for them; where in the Jewish neighborhoods there was nothing available.
Anthony: How about your father's store? Were there any changes?
313 Lillian: The store was closed of course. Nobody would buy any jewelry at that time. I remember he brought a suitcase of the most valuable things from the store and he distributed everything equally to each one of the closest family. That means my grandmother, my mother, myself, my grandfather, each one of us had a few things always on them in an emergency, to have something if we need it.
Anthony: So you had jewelry in 1939.
Lillian: I had jewelry. I grew up with jewelry.
Anthony: Did you encounter any German soldiers in the streets?
324 Lillian: As I found out later like our store was taken over by Poles and the Germans were there because when my father was trying to go into the store quite a few months later in 1940 already everything was taken over. They were almost trying to kill... How dare could you even come and inquire about your store. You're supposed to come and give everything to the German people yourself. The Germans gave out orders that whatever the Jewish families have -- even radios -- everything has to be brought to the police, and the Germans probably took it from the police. All silver, gold, all jewelry, even fur coats, radios, everything had to be brought into the precinct and the Germans took it away. So what we had on us, the few things were hidden, and nobody knew about it, but it was in case of an emergency or something that we have something to save us from death.
Anthony: So you kept your jewelry?
348 Lillian: Not too much. Just enough for insurance. For one diamond ring, you could get one loaf of bread if you're lucky, if somebody wants to take that ring from you because there was no food so the gold had no value. You could buy nothing for it.
Anthony: What kinds of things did you have to give up that personally belonged to you? Did you have to give up coats? Did you have a radio?
Lillian: We had a radio. We had to give it up. My mother had a fur coat, my grandfather, my grandmother, my father had a fur coat. In Europe, men were wearing fur coats that they were lined with fur in the winter because the winters were very strong, very cold winters and men were wearing winter coats lined with fur. So everything, right away, was taken away. My personal jewelry as a young kid, a teenager, of course right away I had to give it back. Everybody knew what I was wearing so they were expecting us to give it back. But still from the store we had a few things on us.
Anthony: At any point were you forced to wear any identifying badges?
370 Lillian: That was later in the end of '40 when the Germans settled down already in Poland. Then we had to wear the yellow star. I was, of course, one of the rebels. I didn't like the idea of wearing it, and here and there, I was beaten up by Polish youngsters, so I had to wear it already because otherwise it was a matter of life and death.
Anthony: Occasionally you wouldn't wear the yellow star… Lillian: Occasionally, if I could, I would walk without it.
Anthony: But the Polish children would beat you up.
Lillian: Right.
Anthony: The Germans didn't know you were Jewish.
Lillian: They couldn't tell a Jew from a non-Jew.
Anthony: How did the Polish children know you were Jewish? They knew you personally?
384 Lillian: They knew from the neighborhood. I don't know how. They had a better way of recognizing us or sometimes just plain trying to get something out of that person so that if the guess is right if they are Jewish they would give them whatever they had on them, some money or food or jewelry or whatever they could get hold of.
Anthony: Sounds like extortion to me.
Lillian: Like blackmailing.
Anthony: Occasionally, it's been said that Poles very often, non-Jewish Poles could tell who was Jewish by the way they spoke Polish. My understanding is that you grew up learning how to speak Polish without any kind of accent.
397 Lillian: Right. But there was another way. A Jewish person when you saw a Pole, you were walking a little faster. You were looking around you a little different because you were always scared. Somehow they found out or they were guessing many times. We had no documents, no papers as Poles. If they approached and they asked you are a Jew, yes? If you say no, show me your papers. If you don't have any identification that you are a Pole, a gentile, then you are a Jew. So that's how they knew. We didn't have papers, I suppose.
Anthony: And these were Poles that would stop you?
Lillian: They were Poles, neighbors.
Anthony: Germans had never at that point....
Lillian: Not from the beginning. Germans were walking with Poles to help them identify a Jew. Like when they need a Jew for work, it wasn't the German that found out who was the Jew. It was the Pole that pointed out, oh that must be a Jew.
Anthony: Now when was the ghetto established in Warsaw?
417 Lillian: It started in '41.
Anthony: Do you recall the time of the year?
Lillian: I think it was in the fall.
Anthony: This was after you had to wear the yellow star?
Lillian: Yes. They were trying to push the Jewish population more to one section and the Poles, the Aryans on the other side, the other sections. The ghetto was closed in '42. They were pushing in more and more and more, and in the meantime, don't forget, that so many were being taken away. The Germans were surrounding two or three blocks, catching the people that were there. If they were Jewish they would put them on a truck and right away to Umschlagplatz and from Umschlagplatz, the trains were taking them to different concentration camps.
Anthony: Did you know of anyone who was taken away during these months?
438 Lillian: A lot of our friends. A lot of our relatives. In' 42 my grandparents, all my cousins, my aunt, my mother was killed but that was when she was trying. ...I have to go back to the beginning.
Anthony: Yes. We're still getting into the ghetto now. The Germans...
445 Lillian: There were two ghettos in Warsaw. There was one big ghetto where there were more factories working for the Germans, and there was a small ghetto where there was one factory Tobbens factory. That was the small ghetto on Prosta. The Jewish people had to live in one of those two ghettos. Between the small ghetto and the big ghetto was a little bridge-like going from one to the other on Leszno. We had to leave our homes, everything we had there, only what we could carry that was very little, find a place and move into the ghetto.
Anthony: Which ghetto were you moved into?
Lillian: Part of my family was in the big ghetto. I was in the little ghetto.
Anthony: With your parents?
Lillian: With my parents from the beginning. Later on my father left. He got some papers as a Pole, as an Aryan and he left to the Aryan side with an understanding that he'll make papers for us and later on we'll be able to go out from the ghetto and live as Aryans.
Anthony: Do you have any idea how he got these papers? Was there an underground active?
Lillian: There was an underground, yes, that was trying to help people that didn't look Jewish and trying to give them some papers.
Anthony: Were these Jews or non-Jews that were helping?
480 Lillian: Jews and non-Jews together. Now, to get into a factory, you couldn't live in the ghetto doing nothing. Not that there was too much to do, but you didn't have any papers. If a German would catch you in the ghetto, the first thing is who are you and where are your papers? If you could identify with a factory that works for the Germans, or that you are in any contact or you have a connection with somebody that does work for the Germans, then you got your papers and you could get into the factory or whatever and have the right to live in the ghetto. If you didn't have the working papers, you had no right to live altogether. In other words, if a German would catch you, you went on the track and they took you right away to Umschlagplatz, from Umschlagplatz to Treblinka, that was the gas chambers where they were gassed and killed. I had the luck since I was the youngest in the family. My grandparents and my parents decided to get a sewing machine. With a sewing machine, you could get into a factory where they were making uniforms for the German soldiers. They felt since I was the youngest in the family...
Anthony: Now you're working in the factory?
Lillian: I had to be in the line with the sewing machine for two days. That's how big the lines were to get in. They looked me over to figure out if I'm strong enough or young enough, whatever, because many people they turned away. Maybe they were too old, whatever, I don't know the reason. They accepted me, and I was officially a worker in the Tobbens shop.
Anthony: Were these Germans?
Lillian: Tobbens yes. Germans, making uniforms for the German army.
516 Anthony: Private sector or were they army? The people who were running the factory.
Lillian: Those were private people making uniforms for the army.
Anthony: Were you paid?
518 Lillian: No, of course not. No pay at all. Once a day they gave us a little soup. That was during working hours but we worked 12 hours.
Anthony: So your reward was the working papers and the ration card?
Lillian: I had a paper that I'm working in that factory. At that time, I was alone already and living across the street from that factory because the ghetto was getting smaller and smaller, and at the time they accepted me in the Tobbens factory it was closing already. So we couldn't move freely from one place to the other. They gave us like a family of four or five people sometimes in one room.
Anthony: Was the factory in the ghetto or outside the ghetto?
526 Lillian: In the ghetto.
Anthony: You were in the small ghetto?
Lillian: In the small ghetto, in the factory working. The big ghetto that was connected with the small one through a little bridge called Chlodna, they had other factories like in one they were making brushes, combs, other things probably also for the army's supplies. There was a hospital in the big ghetto for whoever got sick. Very few people came out of that hospital. Who went in, I don't know, probably they were killed or they didn't survive.
Anthony: Who were the doctors in the hospital?
534 Lillian: Jewish. All Jewish, nurses and Jewish doctors.
Anthony: Were there any Germans in the ghetto at any time?
Lillian: Only when they were surrounding a few blocks and trying to catch people without papers. They said that they are relocating them to other working places. What they actually did straight to Umschlagplatz from Umschlagplatz there were the cattle trains that were going straight to Treblinka, Majdanek, or other places.
Anthony: You didn't know they were going to Treblinka.
539 Lillian: At that time, we were not sure of it.
Anthony: Where did you think they were going?
Lillian: Probably to other places to work like I was working in one factory, maybe they were going someplace else where they need people more to work in another factory.
Anthony: Did you know they were going in cattle cars? Did you ever see them?
542 Lillian: This we knew. People started escaping from the carriages. That's how we found out where they were taking them and how it looked.
Anthony: So eventually you began to realize… Lillian: Putting two and two together, we realized from people that were escaping from Treblinka and were escaping from the cattle trains because they were holding them in the trains for days sometimes. They were pushing into one cattle train a hundred people. It was one on top of the other standing. There was no air. The train was closed, and even the little window there that was supposed to be open was also closed so the air didn't come in at all and people were just dying in the cattle trains.
Anthony: Do you recall when you first realized that these cattle cars were going to such terrible places and the people were dying on these relocation trips?
554 Lillian: That was not too long after I started working. Like I said, my mother's sister, my grandparents, cousins, they were all in the big ghetto. I was the only one in the little ghetto with my mother. My father went out of the ghetto to the Aryan side to make some papers for us.
Anthony: Who were you living with? Were you living with your mother?
Lillian: With my mother in one small little room. In that room was only one bed and a tiny little table.
Anthony: You didn't have to share it with others, then?
561 Lillian: That was one apartment. And that apartment had probably seven or eight rooms so each room had another family. And somebody escaped and came over and told us what happened. My mother didn't work, didn't have any working papers. I was hiding her during the day. I was going into the factory. And that little soup they gave us in the factory was shared with my mother when I came back. There was no food to be gotten and the jewelry, whatever we had was gone.
Anthony: So you were getting food because you were working in the factory, and you were the only source of food that your mother had.
569 Lillian: Right. My mother became sick from not eating, from being sick, whatever. I found out from one of the doctors that lived in the same vicinity that she had a heart condition. She was getting weaker and weaker by the day. I remember one day I didn't know anymore where to hide her and I was leaving the room to go to work and an idea came to my mind to go down to the basement. We had from feathers, pillows, and I opened the pillows, and my mother was sitting there. I covered her with the feathers. The Germans wouldn't go near something that was dirty, so I knew that when they see the feathers they wouldn't go into that basement, the Germans I mean, being afraid that they would get dirty from it and they probably would leave it alone, and that's what exactly happened. Always everybody was being taken out from that building where we were living except my mother and maybe another two or three people.
Anthony: Do you recall when this was?
Lillian: Yes. That was the end of '42 or the early beginning of '43.
Anthony: In the middle of winter?
587 Lillian: January. There was no heat. There was no electricity. Water was sometimes cut off, too, so the people who were living in the ghetto wouldn't have almost nothing, no electricity, no water, except they couldn't cut off the gas pipes and somehow some buildings had the gas pipes. That was the light at night. I opened the pipe and lit a match and the little flame that came out from the pipe because we didn't have gas stoves or anything. Don't forget it's Europe. In '43 there was no descendant of living quarters that it was here. I don't know, the United States had stoves, probably yes, but we didn't. That was the light and the heat, the little flame that came out from that pipe and that pipe was connected once to another pipe, who knows. That was the heat and the light for the room. Cooking, we had nothing to cook and no place to cook. Forget cooking. Whatever I brought from that factory when I was working there, a slice of bread and that little soup, that's what we had. Once in a blue moon, when I could exchange clothes or sheets or linens or whatever we had left yet in that little room, for a piece of bread or a potato if we could get it. That's all we had, so I was actually the supporter of the whole household, that was my mother and myself. My cousins, aunts, uncles, my mother's sister that was in the big ghetto they didn't have much more. So it wasn't like go to somebody else, maybe they'll feed you. Nobody had. People were dying. You were walking over dead bodies in the ghetto like you walk over a piece of paper here. It was nothing. You were surrounded with dead bodies.
Anthony: Did anyone die in your building?
Lillian: All of them.
Anthony: No one you knew.
612 Lillian: My grandmother from hunger, my other relatives. My grandfather, he was such a beautiful good-looking man. I remember when they surrounded the buildings, the Germans, and they took him out of the building -- my aunt was telling us how it happened. He put on his slippers. He said he doesn't even need shoes like he was sure where he was going. That that's the end. He only took his prayer shawl with him and a prayer book and he told everybody not to cry that probably he'll see us in a different place. Like the way he sounded like he knew where he's going, that that's the end. He doesn't need nothing, just the prayer shawl. You know that the Jewish people pray with a special shawl, a special garment that they put on them and a prayer book and that was a good-bye.
Anthony: Were you able to say good-bye to him?
626 Lillian: No. I wasn't there. My aunt saw him. As I mentioned before, my mother was getting more sick by the day, swollen from not eating. I couldn't get in touch with my father. I didn't know if he was alive or not. He couldn't get in touch with us or probably he wasn't alive either, who knows. The whole family that was with us in the ghetto was gone except my aunt, my mother's sister was still alive and one of her sons that was living in the same building with her in the big ghetto. I asked the doctor what to do with my mother. She's so sick I couldn't even move her out of bed anymore. She had a heart condition. So he said that if she would be able to get into the hospital for a few days they would help her a lot and she would be able to come back and be all right again.
641 I got in touch with my aunt because my mother suggested that she wanted to get in touch with her, go into the hospital for a few days to get medical help. There was no other way of getting any medical help. There was no medicine except in the hospitals. They had a little something. And then my mother said that she'll go out on the Aryan side to look for my father who got out. We can't survive here any longer. There was no way of transportation to go from one place to another. They had rickshaw -- a little like a bicycle with in front two seats and that's how one was driving that bicycle taking you from one place to another. So I put my mother in that rickshaw that she wouldn't have to walk to go across on that little bridge that was connecting the small ghetto with the big ghetto and the next day trying to get in touch with my aunt to call her if my mother's there, should I come too if she's going to the hospital or what she decided. If she wants to go to see my father to look for him or where she's staying and I found out that my mother was shot crossing the bridge by Germans.
Anthony: Trying to go from the small ghetto to the big ghetto?
658 Lillian: Right. My aunt was waiting for her, her sister, in the big ghetto and they were trying to figure out what to do, how to get medication or go across to the Aryan side. When she heard that my mother was shot she got a heart attack and on the spot died together with her sister. So I was left all alone with nobody.
Anthony: Was your mother alone when she was shot?
Lillian: Yes.
Anthony: No reason?
665 Lillian: No reason whatsoever. The German just decided with the rifle whoever was at that time, at that moment on that little passage was killed. And my mother was just one of them. That was January 18, 1943.
Anthony: How did you find out about this?
670 Lillian: The next day when I was trying to get in touch with my aunt if my mother arrived, if they're going across to the Aryan side or if she can get some medication or if she has to go into the hospital or if I should come over. I found out that my aunt is dead. Her son answered that she's dead. She got a heart attack when she saw what was happening to my mother.
Anthony: So your cousin told you.
Lillian: Yes. And by the way, my cousin a few weeks later was killed by a German thought he was hiding in a bunker. The Germans came. They took everybody out of that bunker. That was during the uprising already in April and they killed him too. I was left all alone in the ghetto, a teenager, 15, 16 years old. But my 15 was like now 10 or 8. I was always sheltered. I was the only child. I never had to work. I never had to take care of myself. I didn't even know how to prepare anything. So it's not like a mature 15, 16 year old now but it's like an eight-, ten-year-old child.
Anthony: By now you had learned how to sew.
Lillian: No.
Anthony: So you were working in the factory - 687 Lillian: I was working there. I remember I put on a button nobody could button it. I didn't know how to sew.
Anthony: So you did a bad job?
689 Lillian: I did a bad job so I got a slap or a smack. They hit me, and then somebody else was trying to put on the next button to show me how to do it the next time, and I learned little by little. Not to be a professional. Then they gave me another job to pin the things with pins -- the clothing that had to go under the machine. Because I didn't know how to sew, so I would be better with the pins putting two pieces of fabric like together with a few pins and somebody else did the sewing so I was doing that for a while, and I was better at pinning it. That was already the end of winter 43 and we heard that something is going on in the big ghetto, and people are starting to rebel. They know what's going on. We didn't believe it. We couldn't believe the horrors that we heard, that it's impossible. Why would they do this to innocent people? They would just kill and take them to gas chambers.
Anthony: The rumors were of gas chambers?
703 Lillian: The rumors were there because people were escaping and coming back but nobody could really believe in it. It's impossible. The stories were so terrible. One day, it was after walking in the street in the big ghetto, I was trying to get in touch with my cousin he was still alive at that time and again they were surrounding four or five blocks cutting off from the rest and whoever was there without any papers that is working someplace or belonging someplace they were putting them on the trucks and straight into the cattle trains. And I see the Germans screaming and killing people, and that I'll never forget I guess for as long as I'll live. In the street, a mother was running with a baby and he killed the mother. She was willingly going to the truck to be taken away but evidently she wasn't running fast enough or whatever. He killed her. She fell down and the little baby was there next to her crawling and crying. And another German was standing next to him, he was pointing at the baby, to kill the baby and he said something in German that for a baby you're not wasting a bullet. He took the baby [Mrs. Lazar was in tears] by a leg, threw it in the air and showed the other German that's what you do with babies, you're not wasting bullets on them. I was with a small group of people that had working papers that we're working in that factory so we had to stay there and wait and watch them. We couldn't even put our heads down. We had to keep our heads up and look.
Anthony: These were SS?
Lillian: SS.
Anthony: And then came the rebellion.
741 Lillian: I don't think you can ever get it out of your mind. But I don't talk about it. It's dead, buried in your subconscious mind but when you start remembering and talking about it, it comes back.
Anthony: This is the first time you saw somebody killed right in front of your eyes.
Lillian: Yeah, and I had to look at it. I heard shots. I saw people falling down, being killed. But I never saw anybody taking a baby by a leg throwing it in the air and the baby fell in pieces. I left the ghetto at that time and went back to the little ghetto to go to work. That was June. Sorry.
Anthony: So you were ready for the rebellion?
755 Lillian: Yes. The rumors were what they were doing in the gas chambers and in the showers and I witnessed it myself already and was telling others what I saw. And as we were putting two and two together, we were making sure in our minds that that's actually what was going on. Who was next. That's the handful of people that is left in that factory. It was a few hundred of us. That was all that was left and those are mostly teenagers, the ages between 13, 14 up to 20, 21, 22. The younger ones that looked older and were very developed, somehow the Germans accepted them more as the healthy element to work because they were young and well-developed. None of the older people above 35 were accepted by Germans as working element. So we were a few hundred left in our factory thinking of what to do. After dark, we couldn't work anymore. We had to be in our rooms. There was no food. People were lying in the streets crossing over dead bodies. It was an every day incident.
770 In the beginning of April, we had the big ghetto getting ready for an uprising. We knew that something is going on, but there's nothing to fight with. There was no ammunition, nothing. How can we ever defend ourselves if we have nothing to fight with to defend ourselves. We said that whatever they'll decide to do, they should let us know that we want to be part of it, the little ghetto with the big ghetto.
786 April, I think, the 19th, I got up in the morning, and I saw flames from the big ghetto. You could see the flames were there. Something was going on there. And, as we later found out, the big ghetto was trying to defend themselves, and wouldn't let the Germans in. Probably it took them five or six weeks. They wouldn't let the Germans in through the ghetto gates. Fighting with whatever they had. What we had there was no ammunition at all. Throwing bottles or handmade ammunition, whatever they could get for the little they had to offer, money or jewelry.
802 There was very little help from the outside. The underground was working somehow together with the Jewish people, but really not helping. I don't know if they didn't have the money or didn't have the power to help, but they didn't give us anything to protect ourselves. After six weeks or so of fighting, the big ghetto was in ruins. Everything was burning down. The Germans couldn't get into the buildings. The people were fighting, throwing hand-made bombs, so they were afraid to approach a building. What they did was try to burn one after the other, and they felt that the fire would burn the Jews alive and somehow make a way for them to come in. It was unbelievable. We felt good when we heard that the Germans are actually afraid of that handful of Jews to go into the ghetto. But it was the truth. They did not go into the ghetto.
822 The beginning of May, when the big ghetto was almost finished, we heard there are still a few people hiding someplace in the bunkers. The bunkers were places that they built for themselves in a cellar someplace or in a corner wherever they could cover it up that nobody knew that a place exists there. There was room enough in a bunker for somebody to sit or to stand stiff without moving or to lay down without being able to sit down, just like you make room for a coffin to put in. Even those bunkers the Germans found and killed whoever they got hold of and in one of them was my cousin that he was killed too one of those bunkers. It was the last one of my family that was killed.
840 So now I'm the only one. Not even any friends from my school that I went together with were alive. They were all transported to the gas chambers. So according to our knowledge, there was nobody left in the big ghetto, just a few bunkers maybe if the people could survive. How could they survive without food and without water? What the Germans did at the minute they cut the gas pipes so they would be poisoned by the gas whether could survive someplace or not in a basement. So the gas finished them, and then they were throwing in whatever was flammable so the gas exploded. So the fire was spreading from one building to the other. On the eighth of May, that's another date that I don't know why because we were living without a calendar, but I remember for the rest of my life -- the Germans came to our factory. We were like the last ones already a few hundred people that was left. They surrounded the factory. We didn't even go home anymore to sleep like we were working constantly, being afraid to leave the place. The factory, if we leave, would be caught in the street and sent out right away to the concentration camps or gas chambers or wherever they sent at that moment. So we were actually staying and working continuously. They told us to leave everything and come out from the factory in a big courtyard that was next to it. The rumor spread from one to the other -- don't go, defend yourself just like they did in the big ghetto.
873 How can you defend yourself if we have nothing to defend ourselves with? I was working at that time by the uniforms and somehow I see a pair of big scissors on the table. I grabbed the scissors thinking of it -- I had to defend myself with what. I found the scissors. I'll defend myself with the scissors. We'll fight. We're not going. And in the meantime, the Germans start yelling that we should come out fast, come out to that courtyard. And I'm going with the rest -- not going but you're being pushed actually out with the scissors and the German sees me walking with the scissors he comes over. What is this? I didn't know what to answer, before I had a chance even to answer, with the rifle he started hitting me. He hit me here and I have a big scar here on my thigh. Then he hit me in the face. Here is the scar. And I covered my face and the blood was running. So here I had a third scar. He hit me. He almost broke my arms, or maybe he broke, I don't know. And that's when I lost consciousness. The blood was running, probably they wiped off, whoever was next to me wiped off the blood from me. I don't remember how I arrived in Majdanek.
Anthony: So your girlfriends picked you up and took you.
894 Lillian: They dragged me just into the train, however they took us, into Majdanek. Because the whole lot whatever was still alive went to Majdanek. I woke up actually in the cattle train when it stopped in Majdanek. I came to, and one of my friends that was next to me told me to cover my arm and to cover my leg so they wouldn't see the scars. In the meantime, the face was bleeding. They washed me up. And I came out from those cattle trains. I think I was there probably 24 hours because they came in the morning and they took us out. I was unconscious, they said, the whole night, so it must have been the next day when I woke up still in the cattle train.
Anthony: This would be May 9th you were in the cattle train?
911 Lillian: But probably 24 hours because they said I was the whole night unconscious and they gave up already. They thought that I'm dying but somehow I survived. There was still a selection.
Anthony: This is after you get out of the car?
Lillian: Right.
Anthony: Your face had been cleaned and you covered your arms when you were in the car?
916 Lillian: They told me to put the cloth over my arm and my leg and my arm was covered. And I said, but what will I do with my face. It's a big scar there all cut up. Hold it with your hand so nobody will see it. And I was holding it and that's how I passed. We went in, we washed up luckily they were going left and right and left and right and I was the one that had the showers not with gas but with water. We survived. We washed up. They gave us clothes. The clothes were spitefully. For a small person, they gave big clothes. For the big ones, they gave very small clothes so nobody could put nothing on to look like a human being. They looked like a circus.
Anthony: Clowns.
932 Lillian: Clowns. Luckily I was small, so I got a big garment and I could tear pieces to make bandages out of. So that's how I was the lucky one. There was no medication of course for a Jew. There was the Red Cross but they didn't help us. They would give medication for the Poles, for the gentiles. Majdanek had political prisoners. They had Russian prisoners. They had gypsies. They had communists. The Red Cross was helping everybody except the Jews.
Anthony: So the Red Cross was at Majdanek?
945 Lillian: Yes but not the Jews. The Jews they didn't help.
Anthony: What kind of help did they give these people?
947 Lillian: They cleaned them up if they were cut up with something and they let them go. They wouldn't keep them there. There was a hospital, but nobody wanted to go into that hospital because whoever went in wouldn't come out alive, but at least it was the first aid. I was getting infected from the wounds that I had. I remember friends, older people that were in the same group with us, they told me that maybe the only thing that is good to keep it clean because there was no medication to get leaves and cover the wounds with leaves. Maybe this will help. I was still running a fever from time to time which means I wouldn't be able to work.
Anthony: What kind of work were you doing there?
962 Lillian: In Majdanek, there was no work. We were carrying stones from one place to the other like one day carrying it one place and the next day bring them back. The stones were heavy -- even for three people would be too heavy to carry or push that little wagon that we had and here one had to do it. Sometimes here and there one or two were lucky that were picked to work in the kitchen or segregate the clothes like shoes, glasses, coat, silver. They separate piles out of it. It was at least a little easier work than to carry the stones, and many of us among clothing or pictures their own friends or relatives because it was the same time that we came and their belongings we had to segregate. We didn't know it that time, but later on we figured out how come if my cousin or my aunt left a month earlier and here I'm finding something that I recognize belonged to somebody, relatives or friends. That's what they did. They're not alive anymore. So we knew already for sure what's going on.
Anthony: Did you discover any clothing or items of people that you knew?
989 Lillian: I discovered pictures, but you couldn't hold on to them. You couldn't keep nothing. You were beaten up right away. These are photos.
Anthony: Yeah.
993 Lillian: Photos of relatives or friends from the same time approximately that they were making the segregations, and we knew that they were supposed to take them to another place of work, but then we figured out that was the working place where they killed them in the gas chambers because they're not here anymore.
Anthony: When did you suspect there were gas chambers at Majdanek?
000 Lillian: The smell was terrible.
Anthony: So, immediately?
002 Lillian: After a few days. Men were working and cleaning up the gas chambers. There were five divisions. Four were for men and the fifth was the women. And somehow, as we were going from one place to the other to work or something, we exchanged ideas or notes. Oh, do you know what happened to this and this one, or did you see that one or you heard what's going on now? Now the ovens are on. Don't think that they're cooking there a meal for you. Those are your relatives and those are my relatives. I was working there. I know what's going on. Like here and there sentences that we started realizing what's going on. Usually, they wouldn't let people work there more than a few days. They were killed on the spot or exchanged like to another part of Majdanek for another work. Those that were stopped from one work and sent to another could exchange ideas or whatever gossip was going around. That's how we found out, one from the other. Like let's say if I was working selecting the clothes, and another group of men was passing by, and you could whisper something. You know, I was working with clothes and I found this and this clothes. Is she alive someplace? So they were laughing yeah she's alive in the crematoriums because I come from there. I was working there four days and they all gassing them in the showers. Instead of the showers, the gas comes out, they're gassing them and sometimes they're half alive and they're putting them straight into the ovens. That's how we're finding out, by exchanging the gossips and the news that we had from each other.
Anthony: Could you see the gas chambers and the ovens from where you were staying.
Lillian: Yes. They had very high big chimneys and you could see the smoke coming out.
Anthony: Where were your living quarters like at Majdanek?
045 Lillian: It was one huge room with to explain to you for people that didn't see it like bunk beds. One on top of the other but here you have two bunk beds one on top of the other. We had three. On each bed were three or four people. On one side two and on the other side two. You couldn't turn. When you had already your bunk bed and you're lucky as we came in those bunk beds were occupied and we were sitting on a stone floor or standing and to sit down everybody had to be willing to sit down because we were so tight together as a group that one couldn't sit down by himself or by herself. You would be stepped on or squashed to nothing. So everybody had to do the same thing. If you sit down and then you want to turn around, everybody had to turn around.
Tape II, Side A Anthony: So we were describing the big room - 500, 600 women.
001 Lillian: No water, no toilet facilities nothing in the room, just a stone floor. One big barrel that's supposed to be the toilet for everybody. During the day you could go out to the outhouses that they had, but the minute it got dark, you were not allowed to leave that barrack, whatever they called it. Of course, that one barrel that was put by the door in that room was not enough for 5, 600 women so it was always overflowing, the smell was unbearable. Cold, it was winter, early winter.
Anthony: So you were there from May 1943 through the winter.
012 Lillian: Through the summer, starts the fall. Months I don't know. Nobody had a calendar. I just know when they came to take us out of the ghetto. That was the last day of the ghetto uprising.
Anthony: Then it was warm.
015 Lillian: It was May the eighth 43. One day we had some news that they put in some pipes. They were supposed to be water pipes or sewer pipes, we didn't even know. We were carrying it from one place to another. As we were walking there, the women, we got one idea. The pipes are big, maybe we can hide, and on the right time, maybe we would be able to escape some place. There was a group of us that we decided there is nothing that we can lose. Another few weeks without food. Getting up when it's dark, so it's dark, so probably it was three or four o'clock in the morning. It was dark, yet when they woke us up to stay on an appeal that we are counted every single day the same for hours till a German SS man or SS woman came to count us, and sometimes you were standing there and we had to stay stiff like for three, four, five, six hours, rain or shine.
030 They didn't give us too much even of food, a little colored water we called it that was to wash up and to drink and to eat. That was the breakfast. A little cup of that water, whatever it was, I don't know. At lunchtime, it was some sweet soup made out of who knows what but the taste of it was sweet. Later on during the day, one slice of bread that was as heavy as stones, it wasn't even made out of flour. I don't know what it was made of, dark and terribly heavy. The gossip was going on later on that some of the soups were cooked with human bodies. So we knew that we cannot survive much longer under those circumstances, being beaten up every day for no reason. I was beaten up once. I was taken to clean up a little garden for a German that was in front of her house.
Anthony: Her house?
044 Lillian: Her house. An SS woman. With another few women. And as I was cleaning, I saw carrots growing there. I was so terribly hungry, not eating for days when I saw the carrot. Of course, I grabbed the carrot and put it in my mouth. The SS woman probably saw it. She was riding a horse. On the horse, she came to me and started screaming and beating me up. I should spit out what I had. She saw me swallowing the carrot. So I was beaten up till I was half unconscious.
Anthony: How did she beat you?
052 Lillian: With a whip. With a whip from the house.
Anthony: Is this the woman whose house it was?
053 Lillian: I don't know if it was her house or not, but she was on a horse riding around and she must have seen me eating that carrot. Another time I was beaten up I had in my mouth that last piece of jewelry, a little diamond, a tiny little diamond, a ring with a diamond and I was keeping it in my mouth when I was afraid that somebody would see it on me and that piece of jewelry I exchanged for a slice of bread. In Majdanek, the Poles were coming there to work too, in the kitchens, in the offices. I don't know what kind of work they did, but not the same work that we did, Jewish people. And one gave me a slice of bread for that diamond ring. You couldn't save it for later because you wouldn't have it anymore. There was no place to hide or to save. So as I got that slice of bread, I put it in my mouth and one of the Germans must have seen me eating it and also ran over what I'm doing there. I said nothing. What you have in your mouth? So I'm trying to swallow it as fast as I could but they saw me swallowing it, and I was beaten up again.
Anthony: By the German guard.
070 Lillian: By the German guard.
Anthony: And these guards at Majdanek, they're all Germans or did you notice whether they were… 071 Lillian: They were a few so-called Volksdeutsche. Those were Germans that they claim that they were born in Germany or they come from German parents or they were born in Germany living in Poland something like this. So they were working there too. So we knew that we could not survive there, and we knew already what was going on. And that group, those few young girls, we said that one night when it's raining and that they're not going to count how many of us are still alive or whatever, that maybe we hide in one of those pipes and we can escape some place. One night came, a very dark raining night, and we were hiding in the pipes. A few heard the Germans yelling, screaming.
089 They were counting or they were trying to tell the people to get in line to go back to the barracks, and one of them came out from a pipe was shot, killed on the spot. Another two were killed a little bit later. I was still hiding in one pipe with one other girl. It was already very dark and quiet.
Anthony: This was the next night.
093 Lillian: That was at night, the middle of the night probably or the next night. We decided it's safe to look out, maybe the Germans aren't around. Around Majdanek farther up where the homes of the Germans that were watching the camp, there was no place to escape. We realized that later. Without clothes and without proper papers, we could go nowhere. As we were walking, we found the railroad station and again a transport going to a camp to Skarzysko (Skarzysko Kamienna). They were there being counted and standing and again standing and being counted. We got into that transport when nobody looked around pretending that we are one of them. We asked where they're going. They said that they are going to a factory for work. They needed some workers and they picked them to go there to work and we were one of them. At that point, at that time we didn't know if we are the lucky ones to go to another working place or to another concentration camp and be killed.
Anthony: And you had no idea where this place was?
109 Lillian: No. But there was no way out to escape anyhow. So what difference is where we go if we'll be killed today or the next day doesn't matter anymore. We knew that is coming any minute. As it came out we went to a munitions factory Skarzysko (Skarzysko Kamienna) where they were making the ammunition for, the part I was in, for rifles. I guess luck was always behind me watching over me. The part that I was assigned to work was the last step almost where they put the bullet on a scale. If the bullet reaches a certain size and a certain weight if it’s okay then it goes one place and if it's not, then it goes another and then it goes into the boxes and being packed. So that was like the last step of packing the bullets. We had to work with white gloves because the finger marks on the bullets would damage the weight of the bullets. And I was working there. Again we had one big room with the bunk beds sleeping like herring one next to another. Food was a little better than in Majdanek but not too much more. We were working around the clock, sometimes night shifts, sometimes day. The rumors were going around if we can do something to damage the bullets would be very helpful for us. That was from the underground.
Anthony: So the underground had contacts in the factory?
134 Lillian: Here and there, yes. Some Poles were coming into work too, in the same factory so they were spreading the rumors and telling us.
Anthony: Were you all women again in this factory?
Lillian: Yes Anthony: Were they Jewish or were they non-Jewish?
137 Lillian: Jewish. The supervisors were only the Poles, gentiles. But the workers were all Jewish. Sometimes men were coming like when the bullets were packed already in the boxes to take outside into the trucks, the boxes. Sometimes men were coming to take it, transporting from one place to the other. But where I was in that place were only women. They called that part Werk [Factory] A. There was a Werk B and C. Werk C people were getting yellow from the powder they were using for the bullets and dying like flies. Nobody survived too long on that Werk C they called it. Werk A and Werk B people survived longer. The powder, the gasses, whatever they used, were not as dangerous for the body as the other.
152 Once I had a lucky incident with one of the Germans. I guess it’s worth to mention it that here and there maybe that there were some human beings. I was working as I said before with white gloves, you couldn’t touch the ammunition any other way, just in gloves, and I hurt my finger in the machine and all of a sudden I see the gloves are getting red from blood. I must have hurt it badly. A German passes by. He sees me and he says in German, wait, don’t do nothing. He comes back in a few minutes. He gave me another pair of clean gloves to put on and at first he tells me to put them on that nobody should see it. In the meantime, I stopped the blood from my finger, put on the other gloves and went to work. If another German would see it I would be killed on the spot.
Anthony: Was this a soldier or SS?
164 Lillian: A soldier, not SS. A few days later he passed by and he was pretending like he dropped something like he would throw a bag with garbage towards my side. Then he passed away already and I picked up the bag. I saw that it was maybe one bite of a piece of bread and one bite maybe of a cucumber or something like that. Instead of throwing it in the garbage, he threw it in my direction that I could have it. Even that one bite was worth more than a million dollars. We had no food so that one bite had to be enough for I don't know how long.
Anthony: He could tell that you were quite skinny, hungry?
176 Lillian: Terribly hungry. We were eating potato peels, whatever we could get hold of. After a few weeks, the same German soldier, as he was dropping the bag with the garbage that I'm sure he wouldn't eat this, that instead of throwing it in the garbage he threw it under my machine. He told me that he has a daughter back home, and I remind him of her. His daughter must look like I do now, the same age probably, and looked like me. A short time later, we find out that he was sent to the front lines because he was too friendly. Because I started to cry what happened I don't see him anymore. And that's what the men that were working in the office, cleaning the offices whatever, they told us that the SS man they saw that he was talking to me and to others probably too and he heard the gossip that they sent him straight to the front lines because of his friendship with the workers and I never saw him again.
196 I was trying to do something to spoil the bullets that they wouldn't be able to use it, the Germans. And once as they were coming out from the machine after being checked if they could or not and we could tell when they were not the right size, whatever, that they're not good that we shouldn't okay that bushel of bullets. They were coming into the machine in bushels and packed. And I was pretending I didn't see it. They were all ruined. Quite a few bushels went through. I okayed them, that they are okay, pretending that I don't know that they are spoiled. And that was my satisfaction that I let through bad ones that they wouldn't be able to use them to fight.
Anthony: These were bullets that had less gunpowder in them?
200 Lillian: The weight of it wasn't right so that means they wouldn't explode or something. That's what we were told by the underground. The gossip was going around, if we could do something to do it. Then one day, the gossip comes the Russians are not far behind. That they heard that the camps would be evacuated again.
Anthony: Do you remember when this was?
Lillian: No. No calendar, no dates.
Anthony: Summer, winter?
Lillian: Not very cold. It must have been fall. And we were sent to another city, Czestochowa where they were also doing the same thing, just another part of Poland.
Anthony: In the south.
Lillian: Away from the Russian border, more to the south.
Anthony: Another munitions factory.
Lillian: Yeah.
Anthony: You're still with that girl. Remember you were with the girl in that pipe? Were you still together at this point?
225 Lillian: No. She went one way, I went another. I don't know what happened to her. I saw the people that are going as a group being sent someplace and I forget. There is no other way of surviving, of escaping anyhow, if I'll die here or if I'll die in the cattle train or if I'll die in another place wherever they send us is just the same. I'll take my chances of going with that group. And that's how I went.
Anthony: But I mean did you separate at the rifle munitions factory?
Lillian: No, No before. I didn't see her with my transport.
Anthony: So she didn't go with your transport?
233 Lillian: No, but I know that she went some other place. She wasn't killed. Now we are in Czestachowa, in that other ammunition factory. The work was more or less the same, working around the clock. Food, very little. Sometimes in the garbage you could find a cigarette that a German was throwing away and that one drop could go among five, six or seven to take one puff. That was a substitute for food.
Anthony: Otherwise you had never smoked before.
243 Lillian: No. You had to be one of the very lucky ones if you could share one cigarette among five or six or ten people. One puff. That had to satisfy your hunger. Many times when somebody died overnight, we were keeping him on the bunk bed on the bridge for another day or two till the body started smelling already so we could get an extra portion of soup or bread for him, pretending that she's alive and we’re taking that portion for all of us, or taking her name that we're taking that portion. That's how we changed names by the hour, by the day just to get an extra slice of bread or something so you could stay in the line, let's say twice, if they didn't recognize you. Once as yourself; the next time as the person that was dead. But we were sharing it among ourselves. But usually there were groups of five, six, and whatever extra food we could get, one was helping the other.
259 And it became already standard like if somebody dies, till the Germans come and smell it already miles away and know that somebody is dead, that body was lying there, and we had an extra slice of bread for it. We were working there under conditions -- they are not human, because even a dog you don't treat that way. I don't know how you could ever survive to get that far, if it was luck or if it was meant to be. I know that among ourselves we were always talking that probably we are the only ones that survived that it's impossible that there is somebody else, another group or another factory or another place of Jews that survived.
277 That we must be the only ones and the lucky ones so in a way we have to survive to tell what happened, where is the rest. And that's what kept us going. When we heard the rumors again that the Russians are in back coming very fast towards our direction. The Germans surrounded all the people from the factory, the workers, men and women and started a march towards the woods. Later, quite a while later, we found out that most of them were killed in the woods, they didn't even get to the railroad. I was working in that last stage of packing the bullets, so I was left to the last minute to put everything in boxes that's supposed to be transferred to another place or to the front, we didn't know where. That was just a few hundred people. Those that were packing the boxes, packing the documents, packing the bullets in the boxes. All of a sudden it was night, a night shift. And we're looking around we want to ask for something, what to do or where to put it away and we see there are less and less Germans around.
296 Finally, we don't see any of them and we don't know where to go and look for them and we look at each other. What's going on? No Germans. We look into the office, no Germans. What happened? That night the Russians were really coming. They were so close, all the Germans as fast as they could they escaped and they left that handful of people to pack the bullets. They couldn't do nothing to them. They didn't have the time to destroy them or destroy the factory so they ran away, changing into civilian clothes. When we were looking what to do next when we finished with our work, we realized that nobody's around. And we start walking. We would take advantage of it. Nobody's around. We walk straight to the gate and we see fire. Again they put the places, the living quarters and part of the factory on fire. We couldn't go back and we couldn't get out. Out was where the train was, the railroad where they were packing the bullets. We couldn't get to the trains because they put everything on fire when they escaped. And we couldn't get back to our barracks because on the other side that was fire and we're standing in the middle.
Anthony: With gunfire, with bullets.
318 Lillian: With nothing. The bullets are in the boxes. What can we do? We didn't have the rifles. We couldn't do nothing. Just a bullet without the rifle you can do nothing.
Anthony: You realized that the flames if they reached the bullets that everything would go up.
322 Lillian: That's the end of us, yeah. And a very large group of people marched out already of the camps. They were taking them into the woods, we didn't know where. The Germans were telling us that they're taking them to another place of work. But later on we found out that they were killed on the way to the railroad station. And we see nobody' s around, no Germans, so we start walking. Somebody said that they broke a little opening not a gate but it was a fence. The place was fenced in and there is an opening someplace that we could get out not to be burned alive. We're all pushing toward that opening and we start walking. We walk and walk and walk and then we see one of the buildings that must have been occupied by Germans. We walk in, dark, no light, no electricity. Instead of going up, I don't know how we wound up going down to a basement.
340 We walk into that basement terribly hungry and thirsty and there's absolutely nothing to eat and nothing to drink. One starts screaming she found a bottle and there's some liquid in it, some fluid. Probably it was a basement where the Germans had like a wine cellar. The Germans were hiding wine there. We were so terribly thirsty. That was one of the German tricks. They gave us sometimes salty food without water. So we started taking each one a sip from that bottle, whatever it is, as long as it's some fluid to drink. And of course we were drunk, sick. Half of us was left dead. They died actually from the liquor or whatever they could get hold of. Then we found honey. So we had a little of that honey. I think we were standing there for two days in that basement. A group of women.
Anthony: Do you remember when this was?
Lillian: In ’45.
Anthony: Do you remember the month?
Lillian: Beginning, January.
Anthony: January, still winter.
360 Lillian: Still winter. After two days it's very quiet. We don't hear anymore. The fire probably was out because we looked out. It was early in the morning. How long can we stay here? There were a few dead already in the cellar from drinking and eating that honey, whatever? How long are we going to stay there in that cellar? And as we're coming out somebody approached us from the underground, a Pole, gentile. And he said he's from the underground, go back, stay there for another few hours till I'll tell you it's safe to come out and he was telling us that the Russians liberated the area and they're here already. We're actually free but that it's not very safe to be in the area, the bullets are still flying. He'll come back and he'll tell us when it's safe to come out. I think it was the following day that he came and he said now it's safe that you can come out from that basement and he brought us some bread and water and I remember I asked him, he was a young fellow, "What day is it?" It was January 18.
382 It was the same day two years later that I lost my mother. I lost my mother January 18. My mother was shot in 1943. January 18, 45, approximately the same time I was liberated. What came to my mind right away like my mother gave her life so I can live and survive. Probably it was a coincidence that the same time the same day two years later I was liberated.
Anthony: You realized it that day?
Lillian: Yeah. And I asked what day is it? He said January 18. So we must have been liberated the seventeenth. I don't know. Who knows the time when we were standing there in that cellar. But that was the time I was liberated, January 18, when my mother was killed trying to go to the other side, to the big ghetto. Now if you think that the liberation was a picnic for us, that starts another story with the Poles.
Anthony: This was an underground man, a Polish. Do you recall which army he was in?
401 Lillian: No, civilian clothes. No army. He was just probably a nice human being that brought us bread and water and whoever came out survived. And he said go into the city. In the city were a lot of Germans living wherever you find an empty apartment or an empty place go in and stay there. Don't walk around in the streets it's not very safe. Whatever place you find after a German, you can stay there and live there for a while. The Russian army will come into the city; they'll take care of you. We came into the city and as we're walking, we're trying to get water and that's where we met the Polish people and each one of them said the same. So many of us still alive? We thought you were all killed. Who needs you? What for so many. Like we should go back and be killed.
422 That was our welcome after all that hell that we went through. We found an apartment in Czestochowa where that factory was. There was no food. We went out to look for food. We couldn't find nothing. We found one bakery. They were baking bread. We took hot bread that they gave us, the bakers. Some started eating right away that hot bread and they got sick from it. Many of them died. I never liked hot bread. I didn't eat it. As you saw me, I made hot the bagels for you people, I didn't eat it. Maybe that was a miracle that I survive. If I would take that hot bread maybe I would die because a lot of the girls died from the hot bread, too. Their stomachs couldn't accept or whatever it was they got sick from. So I took that bread home, ate later, and I was okay.
Anthony: Cold bread.
441 Lillian: Cold, not hot. The Russians gave us like coupons that we're supposed to come everyday and get food from the army. But they were not a bowl of cherries to swallow. They felt that each one that they liberated they owned that woman. And that woman or that girl was supposed to be their slave or go to bed with them. As a matter of fact, they raped one of the girls and she hanged herself. She couldn't accept the fact that after what she went through a Russian soldier will rape her and then what.
Anthony: This was the liberation.
Lillian: That was the liberation. So we were not too long in that city, Czestochowa. That's supposed to be a holy city, they call it.
Anthony: The Madonna.
Lillian: Right.
Anthony: Yes, the Black Madonna.
Lillian: So you know the story.
Anthony: Yes, the savior of Poland.
460 Lillian: Right. That was maybe the savior of Poland but not the savior of the Jews. And not the savior of humanity either. The memories were too bad and we couldn't stay there any longer. Besides, there was no food. We couldn't turn to the Russians. They wouldn't give us nothing. Where we heard on the American side or on the English side they fed the survivors like human beings. Here, the Russians felt that we are their slaves and we're supposed to in return sleep with each one of them.
Anthony: So what are you going to do?
471 Lillian: We went to another city. We couldn't go back to Warsaw. There was no Warsaw left. Not even enough to stay overnight. Everything was in ruins so we went to Lodz, Litzmannstadt that's in German. That was a bigger city and more places to stay and somehow the Jewish population from all around from the smaller places came into the big cities. They felt more security or more friendly people. We liked it better. So we stayed in the big city and the rumors were that we found out later that was true that the Poles were killing the Jews after the liberation just like the Germans were killing them during the war, the pogroms. It was one big one Radom and Kielce, all the smaller cities, even in the big cities. Poles it was the Armia Krajowa.
Anthony: Yeah, the Home Army.
Lillian: The Home Army. You understand Polish already?
Anthony: AK 495 Lillian: AK and they were the biggest anti-Semites. So they were killing. Again how long can you stay there? Is that what I survived for to be killed now by my so-called friends? I'm supposed to be a Polish citizen. I am a Polish citizen. My father was an officer in the army, and again now they're going to kill me. Why? Just because I am a Jew. Nobody could even tell us apart, the Jew and the non-Jew. We were going to school together, playing together, living together next to each other. Why are they killing us? Some couldn't even say why. Like when we asked why are you hitting us? They were coming in the middle of the night into the apartments where they knew that a group of Jewish people lived and killing them one after the other. Why are you doing it? Because you are a Jew. That's enough to be killed.
515 At that time, I met somebody during my staying in the factory that we got very friendly and we were so-called couple. You couldn't call it a marriage because there wasn't a marriage like you see today, you go the Justice of the Peace and you sign up it's a marriage. There was no rabbi or priest or anybody to marry you.
Anthony: So you had a boyfriend in the factory?
Lillian: Yeah, so whoever knew how to say it, whatever, that’s how they pronounced them husband and wife.
Anthony: And when did you tie the knot so to speak?
530 Lillian: Right after the war. All we were thinking of is that we are so terribly lonely. We're all alone, no family, that we have to start another family just not to be all alone. The couples were not even couples that had something in common. It was just couples not to be alone, not to wait for that knock on the door that the Russians would come and rape you, or the Poles will come and kill you. As long as you're more than one, you're safer. So that's how marriages started.
Anthony: To not be alone in the world.
Lillian: Not to be all alone.
Anthony: When did you first meet this boyfriend?
Lillian: In the camps.
Anthony: Which camp?
Lillian: That was before we even got into the camps.
Anthony: In Warsaw?
Lillian: Yeah.
Anthony: From the ghetto then?
Lillian: Yeah, and here and there we were meeting and we got together.
Anthony: And he was Jewish?
Lillian: Yeah, of course.
Anthony: So there you are 1945, married.
532 Lillian: Married, and of course the first thing that came to his mind is start a new family. I was against it. I was still afraid of the killing and the shooting and the pogroms what was going on. When I found out I'm pregnant there were two ways. I leave Poland immediately or I get rid of the pregnancy. But I wouldn't give birth where my whole family perished, and where the grounds are soaked with Jewish blood. And that's where I start a new life now. And that's how we left Poland and wound up in Italy where I gave birth to my first child.
Anthony: So your child was born an Italian citizen?
Lillian: Yeah.
Anthony: Male or female?
Lillian: Female.
Anthony: And her name?
Tape II, Side B 571 Lillian: I named her Isabella. It's an Italian name. When we came to the United States, they were calling her Isa and from Isa came Liz because Isa is not an American name, and from Liz we changed officially the name to Liz as Elizabeth and that's how she wound up to be Elizabeth because everybody was calling her already Liz.
[Tape II, Side B is blank from here onward] Anthony: Elizabeth, born in Italy in December 1945.
Lillian: December 22.
Anthony: So you didn't waste much time?
Lillian: No. We didn't believe it that we can start even a new family. It was one of the miracles that happened. After what we went through, no food, and the circumstances we're surviving. It was really a miracle how we could create a new family.
Anthony: So your family, your entire family was Elizabeth and your husband, and his name?
Lillian: Edward.
Anthony: And how did you get to America?
Lillian: I was thinking at that time of going to Israel but I was torn away from the group three times. Once it was in my eighth month. They said that it's too dangerous for me to go. I should wait till the baby is born. When the baby is born, maybe I'll get legal papers and go with the baby. I was waiting when the baby was born. When the baby was six weeks old, I came the second time to go to Israel. They said the baby is too small. They don't have room for small babies. I should wait till the baby is older. How long am I supposed to wait now? At least till the baby is three months old. I was waiting. When the baby was three months old, I came the third time. They didn't have room for me. They don't want to take the risk of sending women and babies when there is no peaceful time and they cannot give me legal papers to go to Israel. So I said if three times they're turning me back, that means that it's not meant to be and I'm not going anymore. At that time in one of those DP camps they were signing up people who want to go the United States. We signed up, and we said we want to go to the United States. In a few years later we came to the United States to a small town in Pennsylvania, Uniontown. It's not far from Pittsburgh. It's farther north.
Anthony: And it was much better than anything… Lillian: It was paradise. If there is a paradise, that was our paradise. Like the saying if there is a Santa Claus and if there is a paradise after the concentration camps. Italy was the small paradise and that was the big paradise. And here I had my second child. My marriage didn't work out. Like I said those were not marriages because we had something in common as a couple, just not to be alone, to have whoever you have just as long as it's two, not one and start another family. That was the end of that marriage. But I always had in mind one thing. Knowledge is something that you never lose in your life and I have to make sure what I couldn't reach, my children would. So I pushed them as much as I could. I actually brainwashed them. That without knowledge, without finishing they would be nobodies. And if you're a nobody, you cannot survive. So it was actually brainwash. And they knew that well Mommy said if we're not going to go to school what will happen to us? We'll be nobody. So we'll have to go to school, we'll have to finish and we have to study even harder and go to college and so on. And they did go through college and they're professionals. I'm very proud of them. That's why I said I feel I made my contribution to society. If my life is fulfilled, no.
Anthony: You never got to be a district attorney.
Lillian: I don' t know what would become of me, how my life would turn around. There are many things that are missing in life that would never be because under the circumstances, that's the best I could do. I couldn't go to school in the United States. The small town I was living in there was no night school; there was no day school for newcomers. Beside, I had a baby in my arms. How can you leave a baby and go to school. You can't go to school with a baby. You can't without. So I don't know what would become of me under normal circumstances. That's why I said my life is never fulfilled. In a way of thinking what I would do if I would be with my family together how I would find out. But where my family is concerned I suppose I'm lucky, having beautiful children, remarrying and with a nice husband. We're very happy together and I hope we'll stay happy for many, many more years.
Anthony: So do I. Do you have any further observations or comments? Now that you've gone to paradise and been through hell. You certainly can't forget the hell.
Lillian: I don't know how much I believe in it myself. But that's what I taught my kids. Where there is a will there is a way. That feeling, that drive to survive and to tell, to tell what I saw and what I went through that nobody would believe even was so strong. Maybe that's what made me survive. That willpower to survive and to bring another family, to raise the family, to make my children be somebodys, to reach the point that I couldn't. Again, there is the willpower. Maybe if we would try harder for something else maybe we could accomplish too. I don't know. All I know I was trying my best, and that's what I accomplished.
Anthony: You did quite a bit.
Lillian: I hope so.
Anthony: Thank you. Do you have anything else to add?
Lillian: I guess I do. I said I survived and I accomplished a lot. And you even agreed with me that I accomplished a lot. If I can call it an accomplishment for living, I don't know. Since I'm the only survivor of quite a large family. Like my mother's maiden name is Szarnowska. The immediate family that I'm saying immediate is brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles. In the Szarnowska family was 14. Nobody survived. My maiden name is Guzenfiter. My father had three sisters. They were married with children. Twenty-eight people, that's the immediate family, brothers and sisters with their husbands and children, none of them survived. My mother's sister was married. The name was Lehman. They came from a large family of 19 children. Nobody survived. The whole family was completely wiped out. My grandmother's maiden name was Hershkowitz. Her brothers and sisters, the immediate family that we were always visiting each other, 18. Nobody survived. So that means of 109 people, I'm the only survivor. All those names perished completely. They don't exist anymore. If you can call this living, with all those memories, I don't know. I think I just exist. I was just asked how I spent the holidays. I said it was nice but sad. You can't help it. You're always thinking of those that perished. How different it would be if you could share something with them, any happiness. It's not a happiness if you cannot share with somebody. You cannot be happy all by yourself for accomplishing something for yourself. You have to share it with your dear ones, and they don't exist. Who is proud of you? I can't be proud of myself. My mother, my grandparents, my aunts and uncles, cousins, there's nobody left, even for a holiday to sit at the table together except for the family I created, my children that I'm very proud of, but it's not enough. That's all I want to add to it.
Anthony: Thank you, Lillian.
