id="s116">Everybody was assigned to some job and that was my job, taking care of the little ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Did you have a garden with your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Yes, we had a big garden right on the back of our house and then we had two other fields right near our house to grow corn and hay for the cow.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: You had a cow?</span> <span id="s120">Who did that work, your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: My father, that we all had to do.</span> <span id="s122">I never milked a cow though.</span> <span id="s123">I was afraid of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: The cow was afraid of you too?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: I don’t know but I never milked a cow.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: It sounds like you ate well?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes, it was -- everything was very, very good.</span> <span id="s128">Everything was made at that time, for when you are going to use it.</span> <span id="s129">Everything was fresh and everything was good until the Hungarians came in.</span> <span id="s130">When the war broke out, the situation changed drastically.</span> <span id="s131">Then you couldn’t get supplies, there was a shortage of everything so everything changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Now you mentioned that when the Hungarians came in, you were forced out of school.</span> <span id="s133">Then you -- of course the war had meanwhile broken out.</span> <span id="s134">Did your parents ever discuss politics or your older brother or sister ever discuss politics, or the Nazis.</span> <span id="s135">Had you heard of the Nazis and Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Well, let’s say like when the Hungarians came in, they kind of made us use, have flags and greet the soldiers in and praise them.</span> <span id="s137">Of course we didn’t want to; right away we knew the Hungarians are not as good as the Romanians and we were very upset.</span> <span id="s138">When the Romanians left, we were very much afraid that they are going to start something bad, the soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: The Hungarian soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: The Romanian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: The Romanian soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: The Romanian soldiers when they had to pull out but everything went very smoothly when they pulled out.</span> <span id="s143">But when the Hungarian soldiers came in, after they occupied and after a few weeks, they pulled out, they started fires.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: The Hungarian soldiers started fires around Ruscova or in Ruscova?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yes, in Ruscova.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: What was the purpose of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: I guess anti-Semitic, no other purpose.</span> <span id="s148">But yet we were afraid of the Romanians and the Romanians didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s149">I was very young at the time, you see.</span> <span id="s150">I really wasn’t that much involved but I remember my mother like saying that we were afraid of the Romanians and yet they didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s151">The Hungarians we weren’t afraid of because they remained.</span> <span id="s152">They remained in Hungary and yet they did it anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: That’s interesting, that your parents would be afraid of the Romanians.</span> <span id="s154">Was there any --?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: We were afraid when they pulled out.</span> <span id="s156">As a matter of fact, we didn’t sleep in the house, we went to sleep in the fields when they pulled out.</span> <span id="s157">That they going to do some damages and they’re going to do some killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Vandalism?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Killing, vandalism because they had to pull out for the Hungarians to come in.</span> <span id="s160">I remember we were afraid and we didn’t sleep in the house and yet they didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s161">They just pulled out and everything was quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Had you heard of Hitler at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Me, personally, no.</span> <span id="s164">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s165">It was a small town and nobody had a radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: No radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: So you had to depend on a newspaper, you didn’t get many newspapers either.</span> <span id="s168">We were very remote, you know, we are twelve miles away from the Russian border, the _______.</span> <span id="s169">It’s a remote place, we didn’t ….</span> <span id="s170">.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: So you probably didn’t even know where Germany was.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No, but we weren’t involved, as I say.</span> <span id="s173">And even in 1942, even though it was Hungary, they were already taking away people that weren’t legally married, from different towns and different cities, but somehow our town they left alone.</span> <span id="s174">They didn’t touch us until ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: So from 1940 when the Hungarians came in until 1944 they did little other than close down the schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: And draft …</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Oh, no, no, no they did lots of other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: The Jews couldn’t, had to keep open the stores on Saturday and on holidays and then they had to hire, whether they needed them or not, a Christian person in the store to stay at the store.</span> <span id="s181">They didn’t leave you alone, they were, right away they showed their anti-Semitism in many, many ways.</span> <span id="s182">But it wasn’t as bad as when they took us into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Now another thing you mentioned earlier, your oldest brother he was drafted into the Hungarian army labor service.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yeah, labor service, right and he worked in the coal mines and then he worked in the battlefield, they didn’t let Jew fight, they couldn’t fight.</span> <span id="s185">So he had to clean up the, after the battle, clean up the bodies.</span> <span id="s186">That was his job and he got liberated by the Russians and six months before, in ’44, 1945, I would say in January, six months before the war ended.</span> <span id="s187">So he came back home to Ruscova.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Now were there other changes under the Hungarians that you remember, other than the ones we’ve just mentioned?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Well, they came around, the Germans came around and they started to say they’re going to start a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: This is in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: In 19…before 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: The Germans came in before 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Germans came in and they said that they’re going to have a ghetto, they’re just going to have us together, just for the duration of the war, and then they planned a ghetto and then they made the ghetto and _______</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Which is near where?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Next town, it’s only a few miles away.</span> <span id="s196">But that was the nearest city.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: _________</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Did you do any traveling at all during these years as a young girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: So you were always in Ruscova.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I was always in Ruscova.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: How about any of your brothers and sisters, other than the brother who was in the Hungarian army, were there other members of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Well, my sister she was the one who went to Budapest, in ’42 or ’43, in between then she went to Budapest and she was a dressmaker so she was able to go there and work.</span> <span id="s205">And then when it became so bad for the Jews she had these Christian friends and they got the Christian papers and she lived under the Christian name all those months, but it was very, very stressful for her.</span> <span id="s206">Very scary for her and one man found out she’s Jewish and he was going to report her and she was hidden for three days, she was hidden and without food or drink or anything and she was very upset.</span> <span id="s207">Finally she said she doesn’t care, she has to give up and go out and see and go out because she can’t stay there and what ill happen will happen.</span> <span id="s208">She found out that her Christian friends were looking for her and they couldn’t find her.</span> <span id="s209">That man that was going to report her, got killed by the first Russian bombs when the Russians started to invade Budapest.</span> <span id="s210">He got killed with the first Russian bomb, so she got saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: She knew that?</span> <span id="s212">Did she know that he’d been killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: After she got out, after the three days of hiding, she said she can’t stay there any more, she’s thirsty, she’s hungry, there is nothing there.</span> <span id="s214">She got very scared, she says, they’ll send her to a concentration camp, they’ll send her if they catch her.</span> <span id="s215">There is nothing she could do any more.</span> <span id="s216">So that’s when her friends told her, the Christian friends, “I was looking for you, Lily, I was looking for you.</span> <span id="s217">That man got killed with the first Russian bomb.”</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did she know how this guy knew she was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I really don’t know how he knew….</span> <span id="s220">oh he kind of guessed, he kind of guessed.</span> <span id="s221">She didn’t look Jewish at all because she’s blonde, and German she spoke.</span> <span id="s222">So the blonde people and speaking German, you could get away with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: So your sister Lily could speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Had she learned it in Ruscova?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Yeah, we had a German family there and, like I spoke to them too.</span> <span id="s227">We were friends with the kids and we spoke to them, so you picked up these languages from that area, which I forgot most of hem because I don’t use them.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Was Lily able to send letters to Ruscova?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: No, so there was no correspondence?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: But I knew where she lived so when I came back from the concentration camp I stopped off in Budapest and I found her.</span> <span id="s232">She lived at 31______, and it’s still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: On the Pesht side of the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yes, when I went the last time I went to look at that street again at that house, I found it.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: But until 1944, you living in this small remote town, near the Carpathians, the Hungarian police are running the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Well the Hungarian police and we had, I told you, the aristocratic Hungarian family and they had a lot of children and their children took over everything.</span> <span id="s237">And everybody was kind of their slave, you had to do what they say, they said, and when you met any of them you had to say “____________” which you know what that means, “I kiss your hand.”</span> <span id="s238">And to the older ones, the elderly you had to go over and kiss their hand, if not they would let your parents know that the children weren’t nice to them and they were very anti-Semitic, but when my brother came home and two other guys came home, from the ______ they were going to kill them.</span> <span id="s239">So they took the Russian soldiers and they got after them, but somehow they found out and they all ran away and they don’t live in Ruscova any more, they live in _____.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: So when the Hungarians took over this local Hungarian aristocrat became the master of the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: The masters of the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: In all probability, this same family controlled the area before the Romanians took over in 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: They owned a lot of property, a lot.</span> <span id="s244">They happened to live right across the street from us, fortunate we were, huh?</span> <span id="s245">But, so we had to be their slaves all the time.</span> <span id="s246">I mean, whatever they wanted we had to do for them, baby sit, go shopping for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: So you would describe them as anti-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Oh yes, and yet they were only friends with the Jewish people, they didn’t have other people to be friends with.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: The Slovaks were probably not their friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: They were too, very common people.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: And Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Very common people, they were not better class, so the only body they can mingle with was the Jews.</span> <span id="s253">So, they were all very friendly with the Jews.</span> <span id="s254">I played with their children and their grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Until…</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Until…</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: The deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yes, I played with them because they lived across the street and we were all friends.</span> <span id="s259">My mother was very good friends with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Did she do sewing, dressmaking for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Oh yes, they would pay in food, most people paid in food -- beans, flour, potatoes, chicken.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Would you happen to remember their last name, this aristocratic family?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: You know, I really couldn’t tell you because we called them the Preesin.</span> <span id="s264">You know what that means the Preesin?</span> <span id="s265">It’s like a queen or a king.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: The lords?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: The lords, like.</span> <span id="s268">That’s what we referred to them.</span> <span id="s269">They’re all in ____ now because when I came home none of them were found, they were all gone.</span> <span id="s270">They ran for their lives because they knew what they did and they were afraid the Russians were going to get them.</span> <span id="s271">One thing the Russians, they paid back for people, what they knew were bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Were there any Hungarian fascists, Herrocross, in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: No, the only thing what happened, I remember once, maybe they came the Herrocross or somebody, they instigated those Christians there and for a little while they were very anti-Semitic, but then it calmed down.</span> <span id="s274">Okay, like on Christmas and Easter we would be afraid to go out, we kind of, even during the Romanians we kind of didn’t go out too much because we were afraid of them, the Christians what they would do.</span> <span id="s275">So we kind of stayed out of their way.</span> <span id="s276">But otherwise they left us alone, they didn’t bother with us too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: There weren’t any

politicians.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: The council the Jewish council?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: The Jewish council.</span> <span id="s450">They should have known.</span> <span id="s451">They were saying, “Follow instructions”.</span> <span id="s452">Now I guarantee those Hungarian aristocrats knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s453">But they didn’t tell anybody because they were friends with all the Hungarian officers and I’m sure the officers knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: So suddenly you are ordered to report to the train station for another trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s456">They stacked us in again, locked the doors and that was it.</span> <span id="s457">And unlocked them and

id="s464">Plain, plain nightmare.</span> <span id="s465">Then when we arrived and we finally thought we were arriving someplace, like I was going to help my mother with the little sister to take her out of the train, and one of the workers, the Jewish workers, pushed me away.</span> <span id="s466">I understand they did it to a lot of people.</span> <span id="s467">They saved a lot of young girls.</span> <span id="s468">Because if you had a child in your hands, you went to the crematorium immediately; if you were a certain age an a certain time and a certain body, they sent you to work so I guess those Jewish workers unloading the people from those trains, they knew what’s what so as I was going to help with the child, he pushed me away and he says I should go away.</span> <span id="s469">I didn’t know, so I listened and that’s the last I saw of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Your younger sister and your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: My whole family

rush.</span> <span id="s475">They take you away and I thought I’d see them.</span> <span id="s476">They told you you’d meet the parents at night.</span> <span id="s477">So then they took us to a different place, they showered us and they cut off our hair and took away our clothes and gave us the camp clothes.</span> <span id="s478">The striped uniforms, whatever.</span> <span id="s479">No hair.</span> <span id="s480">Nobody recognized any body Everybody thought, “I don’t look like that, I don’t look like that”.</span> <span id="s481">You didn’t have a mirror, you didn’t see yourself.</span> <span id="s482">Until one day, I saw myself in a window.</span> <span id="s483">The kitchen had windows.</span> <span id="s484">Our barracks didn’t have windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Now, when you got on the train, your family was together?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: We were all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: And a lot of the people that were on the train, you knew them?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Everybody, we knew everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Now, the trip you say took bout four days?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Four days and four nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: What did people do, what did they say, what did they think?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: They cried and cried and cried and cried and cried and cried ----- the kids cried, the people cried, we all cried.</span> <span id="s493">We didn’t have a bathroom facilities, we didn’t have water.</span> <span id="s494">The little children were thirsty, we gave them urine to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Nobody fed you during the trip, no water to drink?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Just what you took with you.</span> <span id="s497">We didn’t know what to take or how long it would take or anything like that.</span> <span id="s498">We didn’t take water, we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: You didn’t know where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: It rained one day so we stuck a cup through the wire window, we stuck out a cup to catch a little rain.</span> <span id="s501">It was a horrible, horrible experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: And when you arrive it is even worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: When you arrive, it’s even worse.</span> <span id="s504">They rush, rush, rush, rush, here, there.</span> <span id="s505">Mengele did the picking.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Was it daylight when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Daylight.</span> <span id="s508">He did the picking.</span> <span id="s509">As I say, I didn’t have a child so I went that way.</span> <span id="s510">I didn’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Were there any friends with you after the selection?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Yes, my cousins, my friends.</span> <span id="s513">We stayed together the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: What were you forced to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Well, we got into the saylager in Auschwitz and we chopped down stones, broke up stones and carried them to a certain spot.</span> <span id="s516">Then we had to, every morning the saylafeller, I don’t if you heard about that, the saylafeller, we fainted away, me too, we all fainted away, cause we stood there for hours in the same spot.</span> <span id="s517">And that went on for six months, from May to October</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: This was the first time you’d seen Germans, in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Now, you were there until the fall of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: And you know what they did?</span> <span id="s522">On Yom Kippur, they came to see if we were eating.</span> <span id="s523">They didn’t want us to fast.</span> <span id="s524">So some girls didn’t fast.</span> <span id="s525">I fasted.</span> <span id="s526">Some girls didn’t fast so they were eating and they were satisfied to see some girls eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: What was the normal food when you weren’t fasting?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Well, you got a slice of bread, that sawdust bread that’s what we called it.</span> <span id="s529">Soup and a piece of liverwurst for dinner and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: So a normal day was almost a fast?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s532">What was it, 600 calories.</span> <span id="s533">How long could you survive on 600 calories, like six months or so and then you should die.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: And that’s about how long you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: And that’s how long I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Performing hard labor for those months.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Definitely, definitely.</span> <span id="s538">And no clothes and no nothing.</span> <span id="s539">So, all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: And you knew what was going on in the rest of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Let’s say we saw the smoke from the crematorium.</span> <span id="s542">Next door to us there was a gypsy camp also.</span> <span id="s543">And one morning we woke up and they weren’t there.</span> <span id="s544">So they took care of them very quickly.</span> <span id="s545">We didn’t see any of the crematorium, we only saw smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Did you know they were gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: We knew, and we knew and as I say I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s548">I couldn’t absorb what was going on.</span> <span id="s549">I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s550">I couldn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s551">I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s552">I just didn’t believe that this could be going on.</span> <span id="s553">I always said we going to meet my family when this war is over.</span> <span id="s554">They were in a separate working camp and I’ll meet the family.</span> <span id="s555">Until I went into the working camp, the labor camp, and then I began to realize I think, they gave us that stuff in Auschwitz that we shouldn’t get our period.</span> <span id="s556">.</span> <span id="s557">I think that made me very blurred because I remember not being very clearly thinking.</span> <span id="s558">Could be that stuff made me not alert at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: You were like in a daze while you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: I remember always thinking not being able to think too clearly.</span> <span id="s561">So it possibly was that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Did you see any people getting killed with your own eyes?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A I was very fortunate.</span> <span id="s564">I didn’t see anything like that.</span> <span id="s565">I saw once a lady went on the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s566">She didn’t want to live any more so she threw herself on the electric wire and she died.</span> <span id="s567">The only thing I knew, we had a hospital in Saylag, the only thing I knew nobody should go to the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: And why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Because then if they would go to the hospital, we would never see them again.</span> <span id="s570">So I happened to have been, as you say I ate very good and I was a healthy child and I was able to ….</span> <span id="s571">And in our area we weren’t spoiled people.</span> <span id="s572">We were used to working hard.</span> <span id="s573">And we weren’t used to sleeping on a soft bed because we had the wooded boards and a straw mattress and rough sheets.</span> <span id="s574">We didn’t have the fine linens like the city people had.</span> <span id="s575">And things like that.</span> <span id="s576">So we were able to withstand all that hardships better than city people.</span> <span id="s577">That’s why a lot of us survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: From your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: From my town.</span> <span id="s580">I would say, and I’m sure from a lot of other little towns.</span> <span id="s581">But if you were from any kind of softer upbringing you couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s582">Today, I couldn’t survive that.</span> <span id="s583">My children could never survive because you would just go on that wire and kill yourself because it wouldn’t pay to live.</span> <span id="s584">You have to give up all that.</span> <span id="s585">But we were very roughened up.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: O.K., we were talking about what it was like as a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: As I was saying, city people could never survive.</span> <span id="s588">And they didn’t.</span> <span id="s589">They fell like flies.</span> <span id="s590">They couldn’t handle that bad situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: What else in your opinion, were important factors in survival in a place like Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Well, the thing was this.</span> <span id="s593">We were together.</span> <span id="s594">When they say misery wants company, that’s the truth.</span> <span id="s595">We were all in the same situation.</span> <span id="s596">Nobody was any different.</span> <span id="s597">We were all kind of young and there wasn’t mature person who was married and had children because once you had children, you went straight with your children.</span> <span id="s598">And we kind of stuck together the whole time.</span> <span id="s599">So that you didn’t feel alone.</span> <span id="s600">You had your family, people that you grew up with, with you.</span> <span id="s601">Your family, your friends, everybody.</span> <span id="s602">And then we slept like herrings, you know like a can of herrings, this way and that way, that’s how we slept, seven this way and seven that way and one blanket.</span> <span id="s603">And you couldn’t turn around.</span> <span id="s604">And that’s how you had to sleep, the way you lay down, that‘s how you had to sleep on the same side.</span> <span id="s605">And the one that was at the end, was never covered.</span> <span id="s606">That was Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Now, when some people describe Auschwitz, they describe what you just described.</span> <span id="s608">They cooperated and helped one another.</span> <span id="s609">Others, sometimes depicted Auschwitz where everyone is trying to survive and where even a little bit of food is something you fight for.</span> <span id="s610">Did you see any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: I saw some of that, yes, not amongst us.</span> <span id="s612">Not amongst our friends.</span> <span id="s613">I saw some people were able to go into the kitchen, they went into the kitchen and they did get something extra and like you say, they would kill you for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Now you were with women all the time, you were separated from men?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: It would be interesting to do a comparative study of how women behaved with each other and how men behaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Our barrack, I tell you -- there was never any incidents in our barrack.</span> <span id="s618">They came, they brought a pot of hot water, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s619">They gave you in a bowl a little scoop full, a ladle of hot water and you took it and you ate it and the bread and the kopel that we had happened to be a nice woman.</span> <span id="s620">And thanks to her, we went into the best labor camp when we went to work in the working camp when they sent us.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: When you were transferred from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: When we were transferred from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s623">I think it was thanks to her; she was a nice intelligent woman.</span> <span id="s624">It must have been hard that she kept us in line, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Was she Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Czechoslovakian.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: So someone you never, nobody knew before?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: You see, all the people in charge were Polish or Czechoslovakian because they were there years before us.</span> <span id="s629">Like they said, they built the camp for us.</span> <span id="s630">They had it very, very rough.</span> <span id="s631">We got there, they said this is a vacation for you.</span> <span id="s632">Because we had to build it all.</span> <span id="s633">They went through terrible hell, they went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: You guys had a higher number than they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: But I didn’t even get the number because we were not even considered people any more.</span> <span id="s636">Those that got a number were considered at least a worker.</span> <span id="s637">We were not even considered that.</span> <span id="s638">Because we were not given a number.</span> <span id="s639">We just had a number sewn on a piece of paper on our uniform.</span> <span id="s640">Most of the Hungarian Jews don’t have numbers.</span> <span id="s641">Only those that went in 1942.</span> <span id="s642">Like I was telling you they took them whose parents weren’t married and then maybe those that went at the beginning but otherwise once we came, it was already they didn’t want us any more</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Also when you arrived, there were such large numbers, massive.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Day after day, day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: How did you get transferred, now, you said you think your kapo played a role in your transfer?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Well, they came, in Auschwitz you mean to go to work, they came, I have to mention one more thing before I get to that.</span> <span id="s647">One day they came and took blood from everybody for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s648">I held out, I didn’t want to give blood.</span> <span id="s649">And the people that they caught to give blood, they said they were never the same again because they didn’t have food to make up for the loss of blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: So you managed to avoid?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: I managed to avoid.</span> <span id="s652">I had one motto -- I run to nothing and I don’t hide from nothing.</span> <span id="s653">Whatever God will give me, that’s what I’ll take.</span> <span id="s654">I had that motto.</span> <span id="s655">That’s one thing I ran way from, giving blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: How did you manage to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: I went to another barrack when they took our barrack.</span> <span id="s658">They only took the people in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: You were the only one in your barrack that did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: I don’t know if others did it but I did it and I’m very glad I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Because you needed every drop of blood?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: You needed every drop of blood but those poor people, the kids said they were never the same again since that blood, they were so weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Do you remember whether this was soon after you arrived or much later?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Much later, much later.</span> <span id="s665">Shortly before they took us away to the working camp.</span> <span id="s666">So anyway, the kapo said they were going to come and select us, they needed 250 girls for the working camp and they took you to a different area, different camp, a different area and again they showered us, oh God, again, naked and disinfect you.</span> <span id="s667">A man had to disinfect you, prisoners, and we were shy, so shy and so ashamed for the man to disinfect you, with the hose, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: When we got to Auschwitz and when we went to the working camp, again this was.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: No, I mean, do you remember when this was, when they were getting ready to move you to the working camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: That was in October, October of ’44.</span> <span id="s672">Then they showered us and disinfect us and gave us different clothes and they had us sitting in a room on concrete stairs.</span> <span id="s673">So that’s where we spent the night, on these concrete stairs.</span> <span id="s674">And they came and took two girls out and they sent two nurses along, so we knew it was going to be a good camp.</span> <span id="s675">And then they sent us to the camp which was in Weisswasser and they had the barracks when we got there, I don’t know how long it took to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: By train.</span> <span id="s678">From Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Weisswasser.</span> <span id="s680">This is in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Czechoslovakia, yes.</span> <span id="s682">Sudatin.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: That was the German name for this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s685">There is Rodwasser also, you know, there is red water after the camp, I saw it.</span> <span id="s686">It’s red water too.</span> <span id="s687">So when we got liberated and we took a walk to the next town, there was Rodwasser and there was red water.</span> <span id="s688">Anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Were you transferred in a cattle car again?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: I don’t remember that time.</span> <span id="s691">It could have been a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: The disinfecting and all that occurred after you arrived in Weisswasser?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: No before, everything was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s694">In Weisswasser, we were treated like people.</span> <span id="s695">You got your own bed, your own sheet, your own blanket.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: So no cattle car this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: No cattle car.</span> <span id="s698">Everything, they couldn’t, the Wehrmacht, that’s the __________, and the Wehrmacht ran the camp, ran the factory.</span> <span id="s699">They ran the camp.</span> <span id="s700">Actually, the Nazis ran the camp.</span> <span id="s701">But one day one of the SS women beat up a girl for some reason and the next day she wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: The SS woman wasn’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s704">And there we had more food, another clothing, another change of clothing, they gave us.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Did you get warmer clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: In the winter, we got warmer clothing for the winter, yes and a different pair of shoes already.</span> <span id="s707">There they treated us more like human beings.</span> <span id="s708">It was an ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s709">You made radios for the planes and the ships, we made.</span> <span id="s710">And there we were until May 9th.</span> <span id="s711">It got slow after a while and we got scared they were going to send us someplace else but we were very, very fortunate they didn’t send us away.</span> <span id="s712">And the Russians came in and the head of the camp even held us a speech and said we should all leave the camp and go to the next town is the Czechs and they’ll take us in.</span> <span id="s713">Because the Russian soldiers will arrive and here there are so many women, they’ll come and rape us and that’s what I did, most of us went away and the ones that remained, they did get raped by the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s714">I did stay with a Czech family for three weeks and then I made my way home which took four weeks.</span> <span id="s715">On top of railroads.</span> <span id="s716">It didn’t cost you any money because there was chaos.</span> <span id="s717">How I ever got back, I’ll never understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Because you’d never been away from home?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: I’d never been away from home, I’d never traveled on trains and how to get back from there to Ruscova, I don’t know how I ever made it.</span> <span id="s720">But I got back, it took like four weeks.</span> <span id="s721">And in between I stopped off to see my sister in Budapest.</span> <span id="s722">She remained there because she had her people, she already was getting married.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: So she did find a husband in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yes, and I came home and I found my brother there.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: The one who had been liberated by the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s727">And a lot of other people came home and we were there until October.</span> <span id="s728">And in October already, a lot of people started to leave Ruscova to go back to Germany either to go to Israel or to America.</span> <span id="s729">So, again, it took four weeks but at time already we had a lot of help.</span> <span id="s730">There were a lot of organizations already working and helping us.</span> <span id="s731">They had already set up places in Budapest where we should stay and then they smuggled us across the border to Austria.</span> <span id="s732">We went to Austria.</span> <span id="s733">From Austria to Germany.</span> <span id="s734">But there already you had lots of organizations helping you.</span> <span id="s735">And then I wound up in a DP camp and _________ in Germany in the American zone.</span> <span id="s736">That’s because we had an aunt here and we knew ---five of us came, my cousin Dave, my cousin Nathan, my cousin Ceil and my cousin Ruchel and me and we all made it to Germany on the American zone.</span> <span id="s737">And we were there ‘till --- I came in February 18 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Were you in a DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: I was in a DP camp.</span> <span id="s740">They treated us very good in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s741">We had everything.</span> <span id="s742">They threw out the Germans of apartments and they gave us their houses so we had a house and piano and they had kitchens for us.</span> <span id="s743">Or either you could go and eat in the soup kitchen or you could cook yourselves.</span> <span id="s744">They gave us packages of food from the joint and then the joint took us out here.</span> <span id="s745">And I came here on a Tuesday and Monday I went to work as a finisher.</span> <span id="s746">I had no trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: You didn’t want to be a dressmaker again?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Yeh.</span> <span id="s749">So I went to work as a finisher.</span> <span id="s750">And I worked until I became pregnant and I got married two years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: You got married first and then you became pregnant?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s753">I got married and then I became pregnant.</span> <span id="s754">I worked until I became pregnant.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: It came out the wrong way.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: In those days you didn’t do those things.</span> <span id="s757">No, you first got married.</span> <span id="s758">I met my husband.</span> <span id="s759">His mother is from my home town, from Ruscova.</span> <span id="s760">So, I met him.</span> <span id="s761">And when I met him, we couldn’t even talk two words because he doesn’t speak Yiddish and I didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s762">I was here six weeks.</span> <span id="s763">So then we didn’t see each other for a year and we met a year later and we started to date.</span> <span id="s764">And we got engaged six months later and six months later we got married which was June 4th 1949 and our first daughter was born November 15 1950.</span> <span id="s765">So, I worked and I’m still working.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: And the family grows.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: God bless them.</span> <span id="s768">Should only keep growing.</span> <span id="s769">So now I have two wonderful daughters and a wonderful husband.</span> <span id="s770">He’s a very nice man.</span> <span id="s771">And five grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: When did you realize that you lost your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: In the working camp.</span> <span id="s774">By then, we knew already more what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: In the working camp of Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: And then we had, we were only 250 girls and after a while they brought another 250 girls from another camp plus they brought a doctor to camp and they said what’s going on.</span> <span id="s777">And they told us all the things what’s happening and what’s going on.</span> <span id="s778">So then we began to realize but I still didn’t believe until I got home after the war and nobody came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: When you went back to Ruscova?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: When I went back to Ruscova.</span> <span id="s781">I was sure the family was going to come home.</span> <span id="s782">And I understand my father lived until Purim.</span> <span id="s783">That’s when he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: In Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: No, in a labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: So he was put in a labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: He was put in a labor camp, my fathe3r’cause I know people that was with him.</span> <span id="s788">And then he got killed in the crematorium one of the crematoriums, possibly Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: So when you arrived in Auschwitz, you were separated from your family and your father was also separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: After they went together and after they separated the men from the women, the children went with the mothers and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: So your father was put into slave labor in Auschwitz and then transferred to a labor camp and then probably to Buchenwald until Purim.</span> <span id="s792">the following year.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Which was another month, till May 9th, when the Russians came in and we got liberated.</span> <span id="s794">If he could only have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: He died about a month before?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: About a month before, ‘cause that’s what a man who was with him told me, that till then he was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: In Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s798">In fact, the man I interviewed this morning was in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: The men, they went through horrors, the men.</span> <span id="s800">They were worse to the men then to the women, those Nazis.</span> <span id="s801">And they were worse to the Polish, then the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s802">They were pretty bad to everybody, they were pretty bad.</span> <span id="s803">Just no reason for it.</span> <span id="s804">I still can’t understand it.</span> <span id="s805">How it happened, how the world allowed it.</span> <span id="s806">It makes no sense to me until today’s date.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: So although you were in a daze in Auschwitz, even when you came out of the daze, it still doesn’t make sense to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: And it still doesn’t.</span> <span id="s809">Does it make sense to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: No, it doesn’t.</span> <span id="s812">I can’t understand it.</span> <span id="s813">It wasn’t one person who did it, Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Couldn’t have done it by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: He had to have, there was a lot of help, or Mengele.</span> <span id="s816">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s817">It’s such a -- if I really think about it, I could just kill myself, because it’s unbelievable, such a horrors.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: For you, though, you didn’t know anything about Hitler.</span> <span id="s819">It began with the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s820">Without the Hungarians, it wouldn’t have happened the way it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: No, because I have my uncle, Mendel Hyam, he was in Romania and he survived with his families, three boys and his wife.</span> <span id="s822">My cousin Hycha was in Romania.</span> <span id="s823">She survived with her three boys and her husband.</span> <span id="s824">My cousin Shay was in Romania and she survived also with her four children and her husband.</span> <span id="s825">They had it very bad.</span> <span id="s826">They went through such hells.</span> <span id="s827">But they survived with their families.</span> <span id="s828">The Romanians didn’t give out their families.</span> <span id="s829">They imprisoned them themselves.</span> <span id="s830">They made camps for them themselves but they didn’t give them out to the Germans.</span> <span id="s831">The Hungarians gave them out immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: In your particular town, it was a particular family, this aristocratic family which you described earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Well, they were Hungarians and they could have saved us.</span> <span id="s834">If they had any kind of heart, they could have saved at least some of us.</span> <span id="s835">They were in business with a lot of the Jewish people and they let those people also go.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Now you said you played with their children, right up to the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: You never suspected that they hated you so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: No.</span> <span id="s840">They were friends with everybody.</span> <span id="s841">We had to cater to them a little more when the Hungarians came in and everybody was afraid of them and they tried to please them and all of that but we never believed they could be like that.</span> <span id="s842">One good satisfaction, at least they are not living in that mansion and that mansion is completely destroyed.</span> <span id="s843">When I went back a few years ago, it wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: But it was there when you returned in the fall of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: When I returned, it was there.</span> <span id="s846">When I went back in ’84, I had to go back once more and see; I went to the cemetery, I went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s847">We had two synagogues so one synagogue is destroyed already and one is falling apart.</span> <span id="s848">By now, it is probably destroyed too.</span> <span id="s849">There was three Jews left and I understand one of them moved to Israel since then so there’s only two Jews left in all of Ruscova.</span> <span id="s850">The cemetery is beautiful -- it’s still there and they have, I guess, they hire -- the Joint has a caretaker taking care of it, which is very nice.</span> <span id="s851">I guess they must be doing it all over Europe to take care of the cemeteries that they shouldn’t get destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: You mentioned that your sister in Budapest married.</span> <span id="s853">Did she also come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: She stayed -- my sister remained in Budapest until 1965.</span> <span id="s855">In 1965, I took her out here and then her husband died, and then her two daughters came here.</span> <span id="s856">First one daughter she took out and then another daughter.</span> <span id="s857">She has two grandchildren.</span> <span id="s858">And they are all here now, thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: And your brother also came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: My brother came to America in 1949 and at that time, they didn’t let him settle here any more, so they sent him to California.</span> <span id="s861">So he had three children and he passed away in 1963 and my sister-in-law just passed away in 1989.</span> <span id="s862">And the three children are there -- he has three very beautiful children and three grandchildren but he is not here to enjoy them.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Do you have any additional observations or thoughts about your experiences and your family’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: My family that is dead?</span> <span id="s865">All I can tell you is -- but I told you I was the baby sitter most of the time -- my two little brothers and little sister.</span> <span id="s866">But I remember from them.</span> <span id="s867">Whenever I used to sit down they used to hang on to me and kiss me and hug me and that is what I remember most about them.</span> <span id="s868">How they used to kiss and hug me.</span> <span id="s869">They really loved me.</span> <span id="s870">(survivor starts to cry)</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: And you weren’t even able to say goodbye to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: No.</span> <span id="s873">One day in the concentration camp, someone told me that they saw my older brother Burachal??</span> <span id="s874">, he was twelve years old.</span> <span id="s875">He’s alive (they said).</span> <span id="s876">I went looking in that camp every day to see him.</span> <span id="s877">And you know what?</span> <span id="s878">The whole time, I saved up four portions of bread to give him and I never saw him.</span> <span id="s879">So I don’t know if they said the truth or not.</span> <span id="s880">And another thing I have to say -- when we went to the working camp, I had this very good friend of mine from my home town -- Rochela.</span> <span id="s881">And they chose us naked to go to the working camp.</span> <span id="s882">So she was very skinny and she was right behind me and I went forward -- they let -- they pointed me to go forward, I went forward and I am there and I am looking for my friend Rochela and she is not there.</span> <span id="s883">I give a look to the other side and she is over there -- purple and blue and that is the last that I saw of her.</span> <span id="s884">You see, you had to be perfect to survive.</span> <span id="s885">You couldn’t have a pimple on your body and here they gave you for six months not to get your period and we broke out in all kinds of boils and as a matter of fact, ,I did have a boil on my belly but the SS men didn’t see me, he must have been distracted so he didn’t see the boil, he just pointed me to go ahead.</span> <span id="s886">But we all had something from that -- it wasn’t normal and that is the last I saw Rochela.</span> <span id="s887">So they chose you naked -- you couldn’t be too skinny, you couldn’t be too fat.</span> <span id="s888">You couldn’t have a boil, you couldn’t …… can you imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: You couldn’t be sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: You couldn’t be sick.</span> <span id="s891">Can you imagine how many people survived really?</span> <span id="s892">How few survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: I mean just to think of it.</span> <span id="s895">If you had a child you went right away.</span> <span id="s896">If you were old, you went right away.</span> <span id="s897">So there was only a certain few that were old enough -- if you were young.</span> <span id="s898">I mean the youngest people that could live is two years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s899">There is three girls from my hometown and then there’s me.</span> <span id="s900">Because I was sixteen.</span> <span id="s901">So you had to be a certain age and a certain weight and a certain shape -- too fat and they wouldn’t -- you went right away if you were too fat.</span> <span id="s902">And then finally when you made it and after six months in Auschwitz you had to be -- you couldn’t be too skinny, you couldn’t have any pimples on you -- you know?</span> <span id="s903">It’s unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: But you survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: I was husky.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: And you didn’t come down with any diseases?</span> <span id="s907">You didn’t mention typhus, for example.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s909">I never was sick a day.</span> <span id="s910">I was husky and I had a very, very nourishing upbringing.</span> <span id="s911">Everything was very natural and very healthy and that is how we should eat today.</span> <span id="s912">All that good, healthy natural food.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: I will say yes to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s915">So I had good stock -- as my son-in-law says “peasant stock.”</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Peasant stock -- good genes -- good upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: So all those little things that I guess God was with me.</span> <span id="s918">I put myself in God’s hands.</span> <span id="s919">As I told you a while ago -- I made up my mind, I am not going to run to and I am not going to run away.</span> <span id="s920">Where God will put me, that is where I am going to go.</span> <span id="s921">And that is what I did.</span> <span id="s922">I didn’t run to and I didn’t run from.</span> <span id="s923">Like they used to say, they’re picking from this block or that block and they ran to that block to be picked or ran away from our block so that they shouldn’t be picked.</span> <span id="s924">I let God’s hands and then I never believed … Oh -- this you must hear too.</span> <span id="s925">In the labor camp, I have -- I happened to have a mechanical mind.</span> <span id="s926">So they put me to work -- to do a man’s machine -- work a man’s machine.</span> <span id="s927">So because I understand machinery.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: This is when you were working on these radio controls?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Right, yes.</span> <span id="s930">So, some of the girls -- now here, I worked between all the men -- and some of the girls used to flirt with the men --they used to meet them in the hallway and flirt with them and I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s931">I said like this -- if I’m going to burn -- there will be less of me to burn.</span> <span id="s932">If they give you a slice of bread, an apple -- I don’t need that.</span> <span id="s933">If I’m going to burn, there will be less of me to burn.</span> <span id="s934">If I am going to survive then I have a conscience I want to live with my conscience -- that is not to sell my soul for a piece of bread or for a piece of apple.</span> <span id="s935">And I didn’t get anything from them, but I did the delivery -- the food, the mail back and forth.</span> <span id="s936">That is another thing -- I am very proud of myself that I was young and yet I had my principles.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: You had your honor and your dignity.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: My honor and my dignity.</span> <span id="s939">First I didn’t believe that they’re going to let me survive.</span> <span id="s940">Would you believe they’re going to let you survive and tell the world what happened?</span> <span id="s941">I never believed.</span> <span id="s942">The only thing I hoped was for the bombs to come.</span> <span id="s943">So then I said, if they put me in the crematorium, I will burn quicker if there is less fat on me.</span> <span id="s944">So that is my morals.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: So there was flirting between males and …</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Males and females.</span> <span id="s947">Oh, we had a French labor force.</span> <span id="s948">That is where the flirting went on -- they were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: These were French P.O.W.’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: I forget what they are called.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: They were men though?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: They were men.</span> <span id="s953">They were forced laborers but they lived free, they didn’t live in camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: But they worked in the same camp as you?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: They worked in the same -- they worked in the same factories.</span> <span id="s956">So, they met in the hallways and they flirted with each other.</span> <span id="s957">I was too young for that anyway.</span> <span id="s958">For flirting, or for anything like that.</span> <span id="s959">But I didn’t get anything from them but I did deliver the messages.</span> <span id="s960">That was something huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Do you remember anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: There were probably a lot of incidents -- there is probably a whole year of incidents that you can’t just -- you know -- think of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: You remembered quite a bit today.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: On that note, I thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: I thank you Tony.</span> <span id="s967">You are a very nice man.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: You are welcome.</span> <span id="s969">You are a very nice lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Your mother did a good job.</span> <span id="s971">Thank her for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: I will.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Bye.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Bye.</span></p></body></html>
