My father's date of birth was uh 1901.</span> <span id="s34">My mother's date of birth was 1905.</span> <span id="s35">If you want more background I can go back generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: No.</span> <span id="s37">What I'd like to know is what was your household like?</span> <span id="s38">What, what did you do as a little girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Well, we were three children and I was the oldest this and they called me Shari at the time.</span> <span id="s40">Yaffa is my new name in Hebrew and my sister who is fifteen months younger, Eva, and my brother was five years younger than me, was named Kalman Yoszef.</span> <span id="s41">We were children in the usual sense.</span> <span id="s42">We had a home, a small home.</span> <span id="s43">We were not very rich but we were comfortable.</span> <span id="s44">My mother was a very beautiful, immaculate woman, household.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">01:03: The children...very strict.</span> <span id="s46">They were very disciplinarian for the children.</span> <span id="s47">I remember hearing my mother say to her friend, you can't show children too much love because then you won't be able to discipline them.</span> <span id="s48">That's was the style at the time.</span> <span id="s49">We had to listen to our parents .</span> <span id="s50">My father, as I said, worked for the Czechoslovakian government.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">He also had parts in a butcher shop or he went to the cattle markets to help buy the cattle and by our home we had a yard with geese and chickens and a vegetable garden.</span> <span id="s52">As I remember the town was divided.</span> <span id="s53">The lower part was where the river was.</span> <span id="s54">Then was the middle part and then was up, the upper part where the Okno ??</span> <span id="s55">_, where the mines...there were salt mines in that town.</span> <span id="s56">We lived in the middle of the town.</span> <span id="s57">Slatina, the part that I knew and most Jews know was the main street with main stores and they were mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s58">We hardly knew the Christians because they didn't live between us.</span> <span id="s59">We really separated ourselves.</span> <span id="s60">It was not a shtetle atmosphere.</span> <span id="s61">It was more because of the border town, was more sophisticated, let's say than the shtetl.</span> <span id="s62">However we Jews did stick together and we lived together and we were separated from the other people.</span> <span id="s63">My grandmother lived in...I remember my grandmother.</span> <span id="s64">She made a living off making popcorn over flames and selling (it in) newspapers made into cones.</span> <span id="s65">Our family lived in that town for many...for quite a few generations.</span> <span id="s66">Naturally it was not the same nationality because the place changed hands and not the town .</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: What about school?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: We went to public school.</span> <span id="s69">Under Czechoslovakian government every...all children went to school.</span> <span id="s70">However, let's say gymnasium, high school and things, that was percentages for Jews.</span> <span id="s71">The numerus clausus.</span> <span id="s72">Not all Jews could go because there was only certain percentage that could go...even under the democratic Czechoslovakians it existed.</span> <span id="s73">So we all, all of us children did go to school, public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">01:06: We were mixed with Christian children, but there was never closeness with the Christian children and our Jewish children in our town.</span> <span id="s75">There was a beautiful park that we used to go to because it was salt mines in town, and salt baths, you know, for health purposes they had baths.</span> <span id="s76">They had beautiful parks where we went sometimes to listen to music, but not always did we dare go because there were always bad times for Jews.</span> <span id="s77">I do remember as a young girl the Czechoslovakians had a sport complex called Sokol and they played tennis there and I just drooled.</span> <span id="s78">I wanted to play so terribly, and naturally I wouldn't have been accepted and we don't even try.</span> <span id="s79">I'm making up for it now.</span> <span id="s80">Again my father knew many Czechoslovakians because he worked with them and the only intermingled my father used to go in once in a while in the billiard clubs.</span> <span id="s81">At the time they played billiards, and he used to know a lot of people.</span> <span id="s82">I remember one...my parent's anniversary was on Purim, the holiday, and he got drunk once a little and he ran into the mayor of the city and we ran after him.</span> <span id="s83">We were kids.</span> <span id="s84">We didn't want him to because we were afraid, but he said, what is it you want from us Jews?</span> <span id="s85">What did we do to you?</span> <span id="s86">That was one occasion that sticks in my mind, but he was kind of a little fighter, my father, and that is how we lived until 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: What happened in '38?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: In 1938...I don't know the dates or so...but the Czechs left.</span> <span id="s89">I remember they had colonies of beautiful homes, the Czechoslovakian people, up on the upper part of town and they left and the Ukrainians took over and I remember it only because we had to change schools.</span> <span id="s90">I mean the place was the same, but the language we had to change.</span> <span id="s91">We studied up till now in schools Czech, and we had some good teachers, some not so good teachers, like every place else I would say.</span> <span id="s92">Now the were the Ukrainian fasc...uh fascists, like the SS the German, the the Hungarian, the was the Ukrainian uh fascist organization, but in school we started learning the alphabet.</span> <span id="s93">That's what Ukrainian use.</span> <span id="s94">We learned their anthem, their national anthem, , which I still remember, and uh but they...Ukrainian hated the Jews more than the Czechoslovaks.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">There was lots of fear and panic and sometimes they picked up some men and we never saw them again.</span> <span id="s96">And uh I only remember vaguely that there was a lot of panic around.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">01:10:09 Supposedly there was a list of about three hundred Jews, maybe not all in our town or the surrounding area, to be killed.</span> <span id="s98">Just a list of Jews to be killed.</span> <span id="s99">But it seems to me that as of the same time when the Jews were supposed to be killed, the Hungarians came in and took over and we were very happy that the Hungarians came in naturally.</span> <span id="s100">At least for a day or two we were happy, but then the atrocities started with the Hungarian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Generally, it was accepted that armies marching in will commit atrocities.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">01:11: As kids we only heard that there were rapes and women tortured, breasts cut off...as children we heard those things happening.</span> <span id="s103">However we kind of for a while felt comfortable because they didn't kill all those Jews with the list and the Ukrainians were gone.</span> <span id="s104">Naturally my father didn't have a job by then because the Czechoslovakian government wasn't there and they put him to work in the mines, in the salt mines, down deep in the mines.</span> <span id="s105">And we became very poor.</span> <span id="s106">However we were kind of proud people, my family.</span> <span id="s107">And I remember on Friday nights for the Sabbath that my mother covered empty pots on the stove so we don't show anybody that we have nothing to eat, and that we have nothing to cook with, but all in all, my grandmother was making her popcorn and she then she moved in with us, and somehow we survived that part too.</span> <span id="s108">And there were a lot of beatings from the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s109">Sometimes they went around the streets, the Hungarians, all the villagers together which were not pure Hungarians...they were mixed Romanians, Hungarians, Slaves, Ukrainians, even Shobs (ph) were around in the area and whoever was in their way or whatever they felt like attacking, they attacked and they hurt and they killed and</span></p> <p><span id="s110">01:13: they took what they wanted.</span> <span id="s111">My father worked in the mines and he also tried to go to the cattle markets to see if he can do some business because people still ate.</span> <span id="s112">There were still a lot of butchers around and cattle and many times he came home beaten up and in the spring or early summer of 1941, while my father was away in a market, the gendarme or whatever...I don't remember anymore what they were calling the police...came with an order to tell my mother that in a week, in a week we will be taken away, that we are not Hungarian citizens and we will be taken away someplace else, to someplace where there is work, in work camps.</span> <span id="s113">Now as I say, my father was not home then.</span> <span id="s114">What my mother did at first is what every Jew, good Jew will do...take the children and go to the temple and open the Torahs (ph) and cry and beg.</span> <span id="s115">.....</span> <span id="s116">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">01:15: And we went home and that evening when we came back from the temple, there was a cart with horses in front of the house.</span> <span id="s118">My father was brought home beaten very severely and we took him in the house.</span> <span id="s119">We did to him what we can and when my mother told him that we'll be taken away, she suggested we hide out and go to another place Sziget or wherever and hide out, not to go.</span> <span id="s120">But my father felt it can't be any worse than it is.</span> <span id="s121">Let's go.</span> <span id="s122">So we went.</span> <span id="s123">In a week's time everybody got a bundle.</span> <span id="s124">We took what we can.</span> <span id="s125">We were not allowed to take anything else except what we can carry.</span> <span id="s126">We went to the train station.</span> <span id="s127">They packed us into in cattle cars.</span> <span id="s128">I don't know if there were seventy or a hundred or how many.</span> <span id="s129">I know there was no place to sit.</span> <span id="s130">We were able to somehow stand and I also cannot tell you how long we were in those cattle cars.</span> <span id="s131">They were not fast, and they took us...we don't know how we traveled...the geography of it.</span> <span id="s132">I can look at some names on the maps and remember where we were, but I don't know how we traveled with the trains and where the trains existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Can you tell us about that ride?</span> <span id="s134">What was it like inside the cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s136">It was hot and crowded.</span> <span id="s137">No water.</span> <span id="s138">No hygiene.</span> <span id="s139">No toilets.</span> <span id="s140">They didn't open the doors for two, three days at a time.</span> <span id="s141">We had dead people in with us and when they stopped maybe every every three days when they stopped, we handed out the dead.</span> <span id="s142">They didn't let us do any hygiene or wash our clothes or anything.</span> <span id="s143">If you had some food with you, you ate something but you shared with your people that you were around, but there was no place to move.</span> <span id="s144">We kind of sat down everybody and where you could, but we really couldn't move.</span> <span id="s145">We stayed in the same place, night and day.</span> <span id="s146">Hygiene or not.</span> <span id="s147">Went on for I think about a week or so, because I think the trains were put on side lines and we stayed standing still.</span> <span id="s148">We were not always traveling.</span> <span id="s149">I don't know if they had a name where to bring us or not, but we were definitely standing still for many hours and hours and hours.</span> <span id="s150">The heat and the smell were... a young girl...in 1941 I was twelve going on thirteen, I think...I can't count now.</span> <span id="s151">I just remember the terrible smells and the terrible situation that it was.</span> <span id="s152">But we arrived...I think the place was called Yassinga (ph) in the Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s153">We got out from the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">01:19: I don't know how many died on the way, how many we handed out.</span> <span id="s155">Most of the older people did go.</span> <span id="s156">Our grandmother stayed home.</span> <span id="s157">It was my family, my father, mother and the three children that were taken.</span> <span id="s158">In Yassina they put us on trucks, also piled very close on and drove and I think they dropped us off in Kolomeia, I think.</span> <span id="s159">I'm not sure of the names and the route.</span> <span id="s160">And we were still with the Hungarian guards when they dropped us off, and they said in the middle of a highway they dropped us, you cannot come back.</span> <span id="s161">We will shoot you.</span> <span id="s162">You can only go inside, but from the inside Ukrainian guards came with rifles and said to us, you can't go this way.</span> <span id="s163">You can only go back.</span> <span id="s164">We were on this on the middle of the road and the Ukrainian shot started shooting and people were killed and I remember one of the men.</span> <span id="s165">His arms were shot off but it was hanging and bleeding and we were still in the middle of the road and we walked away to the side of the road and most of the people sat down.</span> <span id="s166">Now we were a big group of people,</span></p> <p><span id="s167">01:22:00 because wasn't only from our town but it was from other towns doing the same thing, but the man that had his arm hanging begged, shoot me please.</span> <span id="s168">Please shoot me.</span> <span id="s169">At that time they didn't.</span> <span id="s170">They just let him stand and walk around with the families crying and begging.</span> <span id="s171">After a time...I don't know how much time.</span> <span id="s172">I don't know.</span> <span id="s173">I can't say.</span> <span id="s174">They let us walk towards inside Galacia (ph) and but before that the man with the hanging arm was taken away and we heard the shots and the family dug a grave at that time and they buried him.</span> <span id="s175">I don't know where it is, but there in that area we also met people from Bukovina that came at that time.</span> <span id="s176">Now they did not have places where to take us.</span> <span id="s177">We only walked.</span> <span id="s178">Not in towns.</span> <span id="s179">Outside of the towns by the fields and we kept on walking, day in and day out.</span> <span id="s180">No food.</span> <span id="s181">No water.</span> <span id="s182">No hygiene.</span> <span id="s183">Nothing.</span> <span id="s184">If we were lucky enough to be by a field that was growing something that we could eat and we can take it, we tried to do that.</span> <span id="s185">The shooting was very easy.</span> <span id="s186">Anything they didn't like...that was the Ukrainian .</span> <span id="s187">Anything they didn't like or if they were annoyed they just take out the rifle or they hit with the rifle or they shoot with the rifle.</span> <span id="s188">They gave us rest maybe once or twice a day, and we walked.</span> <span id="s189">I don't know if it was twenty, twenty-five kilometers daily, children and older people.</span> <span id="s190">I remember there was a boy that walked next to us.</span> <span id="s191">It was a big transport by then...a few thousand people.</span> <span id="s192">He carried his sick old mother whose legs were very swollen, on his shoulder.</span> <span id="s193">He was young, about fifteen, sixteen year old boy...for a long time.</span> <span id="s194">Each time we rested he took her off the shoulder, put her down to rest.</span> <span id="s195">Then he got up, took her on the shoulder and carried her further and one day he didn't do it fast enough.</span> <span id="s196">They killed the mother right then and there, by the side.</span> <span id="s197">They wouldn't even give him time to bury her.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">01:24: We had to go on.</span> <span id="s199">The , they were very primitive people, very religious Catholics but very primitive.</span> <span id="s200">Very hateful towards us Jews.</span> <span id="s201">Some of them were happy to kill us and hit us and do the worst that they can do to people.</span> <span id="s202">Now at this time I only remember the walking and incidents that stand out.</span> <span id="s203">We came to a place, a small town that there was a well.</span> <span id="s204">I see it in the middle like.</span> <span id="s205">I don't know where it was and what but it was a well and we were like around the whole transport and the were standing close to the well.</span> <span id="s206">A little boy...to me he looked very little...went over to him.</span> <span id="s207">Said can I have water.</span> <span id="s208">He said you want water, and the boy says please, water.</span> <span id="s209">He could hardly speak.</span> <span id="s210">And he took his rifle and shot him right there, next to him by his feet, because the boy wanted water.</span> <span id="s211">And that picture is with me through the years.</span> <span id="s212">I I live with it.</span> <span id="s213">I mean I don't think about it all the time but it's there.</span> <span id="s214">Sometimes when we rested like next to the Dnjestr, the River Dnjestr, we rested and there was a little girl from Bukovina with her brother, with a big tall brother and a girl about...I don't know...she was older than me.</span> <span id="s215">She was beautiful with gold earrings, big black braids she had and they dunked in the Dnjestr, held her down.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">The two braids were on top of the water.</span> <span id="s217">They dunked her down into the water and held her and then they pulled her up and they did that a few times and then they brought her out.</span> <span id="s218">Same day they picked out when we were resting at night by the side of the road, they picked out men.</span> <span id="s219">They took them away.</span> <span id="s220">I remember it well because we lay on my father.</span> <span id="s221">We covered him, the children and my mother covered my father so they don't see him, so they don't take him away.</span> <span id="s222">They took...picked out ten, fifteen, twenty men, almost every day.</span> <span id="s223">We never heard from them again.</span> <span id="s224">We never saw them again.</span> <span id="s225">They were killed.</span> <span id="s226">They were killed like there is no consideration at all.</span> <span id="s227">In transport after transport, wherever we went...killing old men in all way.</span> <span id="s228">And we walked that way until we came to Kamenitz- Podolsk.</span> <span id="s229">Kamenitz-Podolsk was like a farm, enclosed with barbed wire and we saw machine guns around the whole farm, with the barbed wire around and machine guns and as we entered in that corral a Wehrmacht officer said to my mother and father, if you don't run away you'll be dead.</span> <span id="s230">A Wehrmacht officer.</span> <span id="s231">So as we came in, there was a farm house and most people from the big transport, many thousands of people came in and we slowly sneaked into that farm in a very little room, like a two by two size room.</span> <span id="s232">My family of five.</span> <span id="s233">Some other people that we were twenty-two together, children and adults together, and we closed the door...no windows or nothing, and we just sat there and we we wanted to get out because we believed the Wehrmacht officer that we will be killed.</span> <span id="s234">We saw their machine guns.</span> <span id="s235">I don't know how and why they searched.</span> <span id="s236">We heard them search upstairs, next to us, below us, every corner that you can imagine we heard them.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">We don't know how long we sat there.</span> <span id="s238">It seemed to us like a very long time.</span> <span id="s239">And the children didn't cry and my brother was younger with five years and there were younger children even.</span> <span id="s240">We just sat, bundled all of us in that two by two cell until it got dark outside, and they didn't find us.</span> <span id="s241">And somehow...the fence, the wire fence somehow didn't reach that house and at night we we went out through that house.</span> <span id="s242">Out, and we ran away there, the twenty-two people.</span> <span id="s243">We heard later that they did kill most of the people because we know somebody that came out from under the dead, but I don't know if you want to hear this now or shall I go into this later.</span> <span id="s244">When my sister went to Israel and she jumped from the ship so they don't take her away to Cypress, a person that we were very friendly with, that was supposed to be killed in Kamenitz-Podolsk saved her.</span> <span id="s245">She cannot swim.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Saved her in the sea in Israel and she didn't know if she's alive or she is dead, that she sees somebody what she thought was dead and he said no, I am alive.</span> <span id="s247">Not only dead, under the dead, as he moved to get out after waiting a long time, he heard somebody else moving and his own son somehow did not get the bullets and they came out from under the dead.</span> <span id="s248">That was in Kamenitz-Podolsk.</span> <span id="s249">We heard that everybody was killed, not on all those machine guns and the helped.</span> <span id="s250">We slowly walked back and we walked back...I have on the map marked out the towns that we passed like Chortkov, some other towns on the way.</span> <span id="s251">We arrived in Stanislav, one of the towns.</span> <span id="s252">I can give you the exact location...but I have it marked out here, and Stanislav...and we went into the Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s253">There were still the Jews...in 1941 was fairly early.</span> <span id="s254">They didn't have the camps at the time.</span> <span id="s255">I think the camps started in 1942.</span> <span id="s256">And in the ghetto my sister was very out- going and very smart, very talented, what she knew how to speak to people.</span> <span id="s257">Let's say she had a way, as a little girl,</span></p> <p><span id="s258">01:32:30 and a German officer gave us food from the officer's kitchen.</span> <span id="s259">For about three weeks we rested in Stanislav.</span> <span id="s260">Once or twice a day they gave us food from the kitchen.</span> <span id="s261">And that was lucky.</span> <span id="s262">We kind of rested and built up some strength and then we went on to Nadvorna, another town on the way and in Nadvorna we were invited to some Jewish family's also in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s263">These were all in Ukraine naturally and we found in Nadvornia a beggar that used to cross the Carpethian Mountains to beg and he for jewelry that we had left was willing to take us across the Carpethian Mountains back to Hungary, and he said it will take us two days from Nadvornia walking and we started out.</span> <span id="s264">It was late autumn by that time, because it was before the Jewish holidays and however the two days turned into eight days.</span> <span id="s265">We got lost, with the guide together.</span> <span id="s266">I remember Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s267">My mother left burning candles in the forest in there, just covered up for Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s268">We still believed that we .</span> <span id="s269">We still had to fast and we were still good Jews to observe what we can observe.</span> <span id="s270">We had no food.</span> <span id="s271">We had some...my mother had left had some ground like coffee with some sugar that she mixed together and gave the kids a teaspoonful every few hours or so.</span> <span id="s272">Water we found once in a while in the forest in the little streams.</span> <span id="s273">We found...it was cold.</span> <span id="s274">We were almost naked.</span> <span id="s275">No clothes.</span> <span id="s276">And we found blueberries, frozen blueberries.</span> <span id="s277">That kept us alive.</span> <span id="s278">We picked the frozen blueberries.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">They kept us alive.</span> <span id="s280">One day we were walking in the forest and all of a sudden my mother looked like she fell into something.</span> <span id="s281">It looked like it was a well and it was not closed up.</span> <span id="s282">It was just like one piece of wood across the well, and that one piece of wood saved my mother from falling into that well, and we helped her up and we continued walking and we arrived in someplace in Hungary across the mountains.</span> <span id="s283">I don't know the town.</span> <span id="s284">I know there were Jewish people there.</span> <span id="s285">I'm sad to say they wouldn't let us sleep in the barn.</span> <span id="s286">They said they're not Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">01:36: They're Hungarians.</span> <span id="s288">And they wouldn't give us the help.</span> <span id="s289">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s290">The fear, the fear was terrible.</span> <span id="s291">They were afraid that if they let us stay out they will be taken away from their home.</span> <span id="s292">Somehow we arrived very late autumn back in Slatina where we lived, but we couldn't stay there.</span> <span id="s293">They would have taken us away again.</span> <span id="s294">So I went to Nojvarod which is in Transylvania to my uncle.</span> <span id="s295">My sister went to Budapest.</span> <span id="s296">My brother stayed with my grandmother home.</span> <span id="s297">My father was hiding out in Sziget.</span> <span id="s298">My mother was caught and put in Goeren ?</span> <span id="s299">in a camp.</span> <span id="s300">It's like a prison in Hungary.</span> <span id="s301">She was there for almost a year.</span> <span id="s302">Then from my uncle's...I wasn't very happy there either...</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Tell us about what it was like at your uncle's.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Well, my uncle lived in Najvarod.</span> <span id="s305">He and his brother-in-law, they had a brush factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">They were at that time still pretty comfortable.</span> <span id="s307">They were very religious and I came from a different type of home and I did not get along with...they had one daughter.</span> <span id="s308">I was not very happy there.</span> <span id="s309">We had our bad times.</span> <span id="s310">I worked in the brush factory.</span> <span id="s311">I cut off one of my fingers with a knife there, but that wasn't the worst.</span> <span id="s312">But with my uncle I got along well, but with my aunt and the daughter who was approximately my age I would say...a little older, about three or four years.</span> <span id="s313">I remember I needed guidance and help at a time in female...</span></p> <p><span id="s314">01:38:12 it was the time for me at the time and they were laughing at me and not because they were cruel.</span> <span id="s315">Because they didn't know.</span> <span id="s316">They were not aware.</span> <span id="s317">They didn't know how to deal with what I brought home from where I came .</span> <span id="s318">I left there and I went to Budapest where my sister lived, they rented like a bed in our family in Budapest.</span> <span id="s319">My sister, a girlfriend of mine Franceska Nemeth, from the same town, and myself.</span> <span id="s320">My sister worked in a sweat shop sewing buttons and making buttonholes.</span> <span id="s321">I took on the same sweatshop, the ironing, for twelve, fourteen hours because it paid better and I was the older one.</span> <span id="s322">I was thirteen, fourteen ??</span> <span id="s323">already.</span> <span id="s324">I remember when I get my first pay, I mailed home five Pengo, the Hungarian money at the time, to my parents.</span> <span id="s325">And that was 1942 when I went to Budapest, and worked there in Budapest.</span> <span id="s326">When I could, I sent some money home for my parents.</span> <span id="s327">I understood from letters that my mother came home after a year in Goeren_, later on my father came home from Sziget where he was hiding out, so they were together.</span> <span id="s328">We worked in Budapest, and we were young people.</span> <span id="s329">We tried to make the best of what we had.</span> <span id="s330">We met...in Verilatse ?</span> <span id="s331">Utza there was a Jewish temple, so we many times we went there to just be together with other young people at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: What was Budapest like then?</span> <span id="s333">01:40:15</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: At the time uh Budapest in '42 and '43...there was anti-Semitism and there was hatred for the Jews.</span> <span id="s335">However, you somehow could still work and live.</span> <span id="s336">You didn't need to be in a ghetto at the time either.</span> <span id="s337">And you didn't have the yellow star at the time yet either.</span> <span id="s338">Later on it came.</span> <span id="s339">We lived and mixed with Christians and non-Christians, but the minute they found out that you're Jewish, they did not care very much.</span> <span id="s340">The majority of people.</span> <span id="s341">Now I can't say that everybody was, but the majority of people did not like the Jews 10:41: and they didn't want to have anything to do with the Jews, but we were kids, young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">And we didn't feel...as a matter of fact I was going out with somebody that was non- Jewish.</span> <span id="s343">He wrote poetry to me that I still remember by heart in Hungarian.</span> <span id="s344">(in Hungarian) .</span> <span id="s345">What it says that you are a prisoner.</span> <span id="s346">He wrote it for me, that you are a prisoner in your dream, but don't dream so much because when you wake up, you have to face reality.</span> <span id="s347">Yeah.</span> <span id="s348">So it it was, you know, you went to a movie.</span> <span id="s349">You ate.</span> <span id="s350">You clothed.</span> <span id="s351">(dressed?)</span></p> <p><span id="s352">01:42 You did the usual things that when we went to the synagogue to meet other Jewish young people, that's what we did.</span> <span id="s353">This went on till 1944.</span> <span id="s354">October of 1944 there was a coup against Hitler.</span> <span id="s355">It was a happy day at the time.</span> <span id="s356">I'm sorry to say nothing happened to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">After that though we had to start wearing Jewish stars and we moved away from the place where we had a bed only.</span> <span id="s358">At this time we already had some money from working, many hours of very hard work, but we worked and we had some money.</span> <span id="s359">I lived for about two years on bread and jelly.</span> <span id="s360">It was OK.</span> <span id="s361">I didn't mind it.</span> <span id="s362">We moved away to a better place we lived.</span> <span id="s363">I lived as a matter of fact in a what is called Okatsvo ?</span> <span id="s364">Utca.</span> <span id="s365">( It's a..</span> <span id="s366">.</span> <span id="s367">well, later it became the ghetto for the...I don't know whether for the towns the numbers it became.</span> <span id="s368">???)</span> <span id="s369">That's how it went on till 1944.</span> <span id="s370">My sister lived someplace else from me and the real serious trouble with ghettos and everything started in Hungary.</span> <span id="s371">You couldn't go to work anymore.</span> <span id="s372">You had to wear your stars.</span> <span id="s373">You couldn't go any place.</span> <span id="s374">After a certain hour you had to be back in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s375">You you couldn't go out of the ghetto and it was very, very, very hard because nobody was prepared for that.</span> <span id="s376">You had to get out of your own apartments and move in the ghetto part.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">01:43:50 In late 1944...I think in the middle of the summer of 1944 all the Jews had to go to a raceway in Budapest.</span> <span id="s378">I don't know if you ever heard about that gathering of the Jews on the raceway in Budapest.</span> <span id="s379">And from there...</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Tell us about it.</span> <span id="s381">Excuse me...tell me what happened at the gathering.</span> <span id="s382">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: In the raceway...it was just people.</span> <span id="s384">Just more and more people coming into the raceway because they were gathering all the Jews from there.</span> <span id="s385">I haven't got a clear picture of it.</span> <span id="s386">I just know that we were put in certain transports, groups of people, and they started marching us towards the border to Germany, which naturally we don't...at this time I didn't even know that we're not bordering Germany...we approach Austria, and we marched in groups, but it seems to me that there were a lot of young people, because I remember I had experience from 1941 that I tried to gather young people and we sing songs, most Hungarian, because Hungarian Jews didn't know any other language.</span> <span id="s387">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s388">I knew other languages, but Hungarian Jews knew only Hungarian.</span> <span id="s389">That's it.</span> <span id="s390">And we started singing songs.</span> <span id="s391">It somehow kept the spirits going.</span> <span id="s392">I didn't think of it consciously at the time, but that's what was happening.</span> <span id="s393">And we walked and walked, but one good thing...in Hungary the villagers and the people, they're not as bad and as cruel as in Galicia.</span> <span id="s394">In Hungary we sometimes, we were cute little girls, you know, go to a fence and they will give us a bread or something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">01:46:00 It was very bad.</span> <span id="s396">It was for them too very bad.</span> <span id="s397">It was towards the end of the war.</span> <span id="s398">There wasn't much left there either.</span> <span id="s399">But they once in a while did reach out and gave us some food and we came to a place called close to or ...I can't even pronounce it.</span> <span id="s400">I have it marked out on the Hungarian map.</span> <span id="s401">There were boats on the Danube and they...we settled in on those boats on the Danube because they said that's where we have to wait for transportation to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s402">Dysentery broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Diarrhea and stomach upset for the people.</span> <span id="s404">It was very bad.</span> <span id="s405">Again, no hygiene.</span> <span id="s406">And I don't know how we survived and how we were on those boats.</span> <span id="s407">We were there about two, three weeks and there I heard that there was .</span> <span id="s408">.</span> <span id="s409">I don't think it was an order or a request...that children under thirteen should be returned to Budapest, and by that time I was about close to sixteen, seventeen, and I said to my friend Francesca, who was with me at the time...now and again my sister lived in Budapest but she had Christian papers in her own name made.</span> <span id="s410">I don't know to whom or who did it.</span> <span id="s411">It could have been Wallenberg or not, I don't know.</span> <span id="s412">She had in her own name, Eva Joszef, Christian papers, and she lived out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s413">She didn't go to the raceway.</span> <span id="s414">She stayed out.</span> <span id="s415">In between I tried to study in one of the basements Catholic religion.</span> <span id="s416">They said that if you became Catholic, they will keep you alive.</span> <span id="s417">They will not take you away, so I studied the Catholic religion and then I found out it wasn't true.</span> <span id="s418">I did not take on another religion.</span> <span id="s419">I stayed Jewish.</span> <span id="s420">So my sister was in Budapest someplace.</span> <span id="s421">I don't know where she was...safe supposedly with Christian papers.</span> <span id="s422">I was with Francesca, my girlfriend, Francesca Nemeth, and I said let's go back.</span> <span id="s423">I don't want to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s424">I know what they do to people there, and she didn't want.</span> <span id="s425">She was afraid and I begged her and kind of coerced her.</span> <span id="s426">I said you carry on, put your hair in braids and uh let's try and let's try and we we succeeded.</span> <span id="s427">We walked back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s428">I called Francesca.</span> <span id="s429">She lives in Ohio, Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span id="s430">I wondered if she remembers names or something.</span> <span id="s431">She does not remember anything, but she was just thanking me for keeping her alive, because she says that if not you, I wouldn't have been alive today.</span> <span id="s432">But at the time I just felt that this is our way of surviving, to go back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s433">We walked again back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s434">I don't know how many kilometers, how we did it.</span> <span id="s435">We were a small transport of children and we walked but while we were still on ship, on boats, we got some of the Hungarian village people to gave us geese.</span> <span id="s436">We cooked the geese and we gave the soup for the dysentery sick people, the soup, and we handed out meats for the children to eat, for the young children to eat.</span> <span id="s437">I remember I was very involved in that and many people</span></p> <p><span id="s438">01:50:00 ...I don't know where they went from there, but some died.</span> <span id="s439">Some got better.</span> <span id="s440">I don't know if it was from the soup or not, but that's the way it was.</span> <span id="s441">We went back to Budapest and we went into the ghetto, into a Red Cross.</span> <span id="s442">I don't know if it was a Swedish or a Swiss Red Cross.</span> <span id="s443">I don't know.</span> <span id="s444">Supposedly a safe building in Budapest, on Okativo ?</span> <span id="s445">Utca.</span> <span id="s446">It was the same street I lived, but further down.</span> <span id="s447">We were there...it was across the street from an electric I think public electrics or something like that and they had anti-aircraft guns on the same street right across from the building that we were in.</span> <span id="s448">Budapest was at that time being bombed from the Russians.</span> <span id="s449">Constant bombing.</span> <span id="s450">Terrible bombing.</span> <span id="s451">All that time we were in that house.</span> <span id="s452">I was on the fourth floor with helping mentally disturbed people in the ghetto, as a result from the war.</span> <span id="s453">They were all lying on floors.</span> <span id="s454">No medication.</span> <span id="s455">No food.</span> <span id="s456">No hygiene.</span> <span id="s457">Some I remember they bring in people who got hurt from the bombs, you know, from shrapnel, they brought them in.</span> <span id="s458">It was terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s459">Some of them lay there for weeks.</span> <span id="s460">The the meat was rotting away from their bodies.</span> <span id="s461">The smell...it was horrific.</span> <span id="s462">The dead people were taken out to the streets.</span> <span id="s463">It was winter.</span> <span id="s464">They were piled like wood logs piled, cross-wise.</span> <span id="s465">One on top of the other, the dead people, and I know only about the Jews because that's where we were.</span> <span id="s466">We were in the ghetto, but I know it was not very good in the rest of Budapest either, but we were there.</span> <span id="s467">To that to the bombing and everything else, the Nilosz (ph) which was like the SS in Germany, came in many times to safe houses or basements to people and started killing and letting their angers and fear go to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s468">We being Red Cross used to go out and help save whoever we could save at the time.</span> <span id="s469">We walked even while they were bombing.</span> <span id="s470">We walked in the streets and go into buildings and see if we can help as much as we could with just get living out from under the dead or whatever we can do.</span> <span id="s471">I was sick.</span> <span id="s472">I had a bladder infection.</span> <span id="s473">We had no sulfa or anything like that.</span> <span id="s474">I remember somebody handed me a little...an old sock with sand.</span> <span id="s475">They said heat it someplace and put it and try to make yourself comfortable.</span> <span id="s476">I survived it.</span> <span id="s477">I don't know how and when I'm OK, but this is...I'm bring it up only as to show you what it was like in Budapest until of January of 1945.</span> <span id="s478">I never went down in the basement with the bombings.</span> <span id="s479">I was at the stage where I didn't care if something gets me, if I stay alive or not.</span> <span id="s480">At that stage I didn't care, and one morning I looked down from the fourth floor and there was the Russian army, and being that I speak other languages, some Czech, some Yiddish...there was a Jewish officer in the Russian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">01:54:08 He came from Lvow and he said you're free.</span> <span id="s482">I said what!</span> <span id="s483">He said you're free.</span> <span id="s484">And he came out with breads, loaves of breads.</span> <span id="s485">There were very few people left alive, but whoever was we all went down in the yard where he was with the bread.</span> <span id="s486">That's how that's how we freed, and that was in January of 1945 in Budapest.</span> <span id="s487">Do you want me to go on anyplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">01:54:44</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Let's stop for a moment now and we'll change tapes.</span> <span id="s490">This is a good place to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Tape #2 Life has a different meaning...it has a different flavor I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s493">We're back on camera.</span> <span id="s494">A: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: I'd like to go back to the safe house, and would you...would you tell me more, as much as you can remember about the people in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: It's very unclear about the people.</span> <span id="s497">I do not...I cannot pinpoint an organization, if there was one.</span> <span id="s498">I just know that the house had a sign, a Red Cross sign out.</span> <span id="s499">I know it was a foreign Red Cross, Swede or Swiss Red Cross.</span> <span id="s500">It keeps in mind more Swiss than Swedish Red Cross.</span> <span id="s501">I don't know.</span> <span id="s502">The people whenever they picked up people in the ghetto streets that had no place to go and we brought them in, not that there was place but we just put them down next to somebody else.</span> <span id="s503">After bombing, people were injured.</span> <span id="s504">If they were injured we brought them in.</span> <span id="s505">If the horses were killed, we used the meat.</span> <span id="s506">That's what kept us going.</span> <span id="s507">It was winter, so even the horse laid in the streets for many days, we used it, kind of gave us some food.</span> <span id="s508">I don't remember people themselves, if there was anybody to instruct us.</span> <span id="s509">I know that there was some sick people that turned to me.</span> <span id="s510">I was working.</span> <span id="s511">I was healthier.</span> <span id="s512">I was around.</span> <span id="s513">My friend Francesca was there on a different floor, and we tried to do best we could.</span> <span id="s514">There was nothing to work with or help with.</span> <span id="s515">I remember one young man.</span> <span id="s516">He had internal injuries.</span> <span id="s517">There was one doctor there.</span> <span id="s518">I can't remember his name.</span> <span id="s519">But he said he has internal injuries.</span> <span id="s520">He will go.</span> <span id="s521">But he was young.</span> <span id="s522">He was twenty...I don't know...to me he looked young at the time, and I remember holding him and he says, just stay.</span> <span id="s523">Just stay.</span> <span id="s524">Just stay with me.</span> <span id="s525">I tried as long as I could.</span> <span id="s526">When the sirens went on, the majority of people that could move went down in the basement to protect themselves from the bombing.</span> <span id="s527">I never went down to the basement.</span> <span id="s528">I picked...I didn't care if I live or die at that time.</span> <span id="s529">We were at the state of non-caring and that is the worst human state that you can imagine.</span> <span id="s530">Nobody should go to that state, but we were.</span> <span id="s531">I can't clearly bring up people to remember them or or names or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">01:03: I haven't got them.</span> <span id="s533">I just know that one day in 1945 we looked down in the yard and there were the Russians.</span> <span id="s534">And we couldn't care less who it was.</span> <span id="s535">They brought us bread and water.</span> <span id="s536">We had no water.</span> <span id="s537">No heat.</span> <span id="s538">No hygiene.</span> <span id="s539">Nothing.</span> <span id="s540">For weeks on and weeks on we had nothing.</span> <span id="s541">I don't know how it was in the rest of Budapest, but in the ghetto it was inhuman.</span> <span id="s542">Inhuman state of...I don't even remember how we dispersed from that safe home very fast because we were afraid that the Hungarians will come back or the Germans will come in.</span> <span id="s543">So we ran from Budapest.</span> <span id="s544">I ran from Budapest, but I wanted to find my sister.</span> <span id="s545">She was in Budapest but not in the ghetto and I was going from street to street at the time the Russians freedom, it was kind of open.</span> <span id="s546">It was snow all around and I was walking towards where we used to live before and I see a black coat with a white fur cap and I started screaming Eva, Eva.</span> <span id="s547">It was my sister.</span> <span id="s548">That's how I found my sister in Budapest, right after we were freed by the Russians.</span> <span id="s549">It looked that she was searching for me and I was searching for her, and we walked</span></p> <p><span id="s550">01:05 somehow going towards the same direction, and with all those people and all the war and everything, somehow we kind of ran into each other and I can't tell you that feeling to be able to see my sister and her black coat that I remembered with the white fur around her head and find my sister there.</span> <span id="s551">We started back.</span> <span id="s552">We were...today they call it hitchhiking I think.</span> <span id="s553">Whatever transportation we could find...we wanted to get out of Budapest the worst, the worst way because we were afraid that the Nazis might come back in any way.</span> <span id="s554">I remember we were on trains.</span> <span id="s555">There was no organized trains or anything.</span> <span id="s556">Whatever came along and went someplace, we hopped on and we went.</span> <span id="s557">We also had to kind of at that time worry a little bit about the Russians not grabbing young girls.</span> <span id="s558">They grabbed other people.</span> <span id="s559">I know they grabbed many watches and an army, as an army and any army that comes in first, you're better off not to encounter with them, but somehow we made it to Debrecen, and stayed for a few weeks with a Jewish family in Debrecen.</span> <span id="s560">And then we went on further and I went, I went towards home.</span> <span id="s561">I don't know where my sister went, but she wound up in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s562">We young girls we were not very close.</span> <span id="s563">Sibling rivalry.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">We're very close in age...fifteen months apart.</span> <span id="s565">She's younger...fifteen months.</span> <span id="s566">We went our different ways, but she went to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s567">I went home and as I said before that I think I mentioned it to you privately that uh when I saw the house...it might have been a lot of things together...I found high temperature.</span> <span id="s568">The house was ripped...the windows were ripped out of the house.</span> <span id="s569">The doors were gone.</span> <span id="s570">The roof was gone.</span> <span id="s571">Papers thrown everyplace.</span> <span id="s572">Nothing...I collapsed and they took me into Sziget to a hospital and they took my tonsils out or whatever they did for me, and when I got better I went to Bucharest to see my sister.</span> <span id="s573">We traveled all over and when I came back...then I went back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s574">Another thing...in every terrible thing there is something that happens that can give you hope in life.</span> <span id="s575">I heard that my mother was in Budapest and when we came to Budapest, you know, if you went you...in certain centers they gave you disinfection, DDT, and shower treatments for the people that came out from ghettos and camps and...and they also gave you some money.</span> <span id="s576">The Americans at that time were there.</span> <span id="s577">They gave you some money to help you over...peanut butter and some food and things like that and we kids went in for that to help us travel around.</span> <span id="s578">And I went into one of the schools where they did it, and in the foyer I hear Sharika, Sharika.</span> <span id="s579">My mother was in that school.</span> <span id="s580">She came from Bergen- Belsen and she came into Budapest and she was there in transfer in a school, in Elizabeth School it was called.</span> <span id="s581">Ersebet School.</span> <span id="s582">And I ran into her like that in that school.</span> <span id="s583">We just couldn't believe that that what we ran into.</span> <span id="s584">As I say, there is always some kind of hope that gives you a will to go on.</span> <span id="s585">I found my mother.</span> <span id="s586">She wasn't the same person anymore but I found my mother.</span> <span id="s587">My mother lost her will to live.</span> <span id="s588">However, we were together for a while and we went to...we had an uncle in Galanta and we went there.</span> <span id="s589">Later on uh my mother married that uncle.</span> <span id="s590">It was...let me see...my father's sister's husband who never came back and my father never came back.</span> <span id="s591">That was a year or two later after the war and they married and they went to Israel, but they went to Germany camps to wait, waiting camps until they were transferred to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">01:10 I joined in Budapest the Zionist organization and we traveled around to Vienna and for a while I worked in Vienna in the hospital.</span> <span id="s593">The transient people from camps and I worked in the lab.</span> <span id="s594">They called it a clinic where the doctors examined and I was kind of an assistant in there for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s595">Then I went back to Budapest with the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s596">Dror Habonim was the name of the organization, and for a while I still helped out with the Brichah to transfer people over the borders.</span> <span id="s597">They were in transferring the people to Slovakia and then transferring them back to towards Vienna where there was a transient camp and then toward Italy and then from Italy the boats, whatever boats can be arranged for the people to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Tell us, tell us what that was like?</span> <span id="s599">How did you get involved in....</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Well we...the way it was, you know, it was the young people were searching for company for each other.</span> <span id="s601">They wanted to be close.</span> <span id="s602">They had no families left to many, so the young people...wherever there were young people, we kind of got together.</span> <span id="s603">I don't remember details either very much, even though it was later.</span> <span id="s604">It was '45, '46, '47, up to '48 but I know eventually I</span></p> <p><span id="s605">01:12: joined a group and we went down to uh where there was a Hakhshara, a training camp for the Zionists to go to Israel as a group and we trained there.</span> <span id="s606">We trained....we called it support.</span> <span id="s607">We trained for the army, but we had no grenades so we used stones or whatever we can use.</span> <span id="s608">We were trained to be in the army, and I got a special training to be able to train other young people to go to the army.</span> <span id="s609">our group was called.</span> <span id="s610">Aff al pi Kein (nevertheless), is our group, and eventually in 1948 when we when they were searching for me in Hungary, they wanted to me to go to communist school, the Hungarians, because we were kind of active in the socialist organizations to cover the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s611">And I was very active in the politics.</span> <span id="s612">I went out talking to people, Jewish people most of the time in temples and wherever I can find them and begging and cajoling and doing whatever you can to get the young people to go to Israel, and it was illegal at the time.</span> <span id="s613">In 1948 they were searching for me and that's when the organization...we had in Budapest we had an office of the organization.</span> <span id="s614">They said this is your time to go and that's when I left to Vienna and from Vienna to Bari, Italy.</span> <span id="s615">That is again.</span> <span id="s616">And then with the boat Galilea which was very crowded, to Israel.</span> <span id="s617">And in Israel the whole group of Hungarians...I was the only one non-Hungarian Jew...but the whole group was called Aff al pi kein, and we went to...we had training in Giv'at Khain, a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s618">We trained for a year.</span> <span id="s619">We...not only did we train to build a new kibbutz...we were also were in the Palmakh at the time.</span> <span id="s620">That's the elite of the army.</span> <span id="s621">We belonged, and then we went out on Hityashvut (Resettlement).</span> <span id="s622">We went out to build a new kibbutz and we built Yad Khanna.</span> <span id="s623">Yad Khanna still exists naturally and I was a very active participant naturally in the army and Palmakh in 1948 and our kibbutz was right across from Tulkerem by the Jordan border, between Khadera and Nathanya, actually seven kilometers south of Nathanya is the kibbutz and we built a wonderful kibbutz.</span> <span id="s624">We were very active until political problems developed.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">01:15: In our kibbutz we kind of had a tendency to bear left politically and they send me in 1951, they send me to study.</span> <span id="s626">The kibbutz sent me to study in Eifal(?)</span> <span id="s627">with Yitzkhag ?</span> <span id="s628">who was one of the greats in Israel, was my instructor at the time in Eifal.</span> <span id="s629">It was general study but study, very detailed studies of anything from economics to Marxism to anything else to be a good kibbutznik.</span> <span id="s630">After that I worked with transient young people coming from Europe, the transient young people.</span> <span id="s631">They went to school but after school I was with them in the camp and I left the kibbutz when the serious political problems started.</span> <span id="s632">My kibbutz was divided.</span> <span id="s633">Some of it was, went with Meki which was the Communist part and some of it stayed with Mapam, which was a fairly left wing workers organization.</span> <span id="s634">And as a matter of fact I went to visit my sister in another kibbutz in Israel and I was beaten up (laughter) because (laughter) because like in the dining room because of political ideas, of you know, God bless two Jewish people to get together and we have three parties.</span> <span id="s635">That's when I left, but I lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s636">I lived in Israel until 1959.</span> <span id="s637">That is a good time for me.</span> <span id="s638">That was...to have a name after the camps and ghettos and wars, to have an ideal, to be willing to give everything you've got for that ideal, saved me.</span> <span id="s639">Saved me mentally and emotionally and this is what I am here today.</span> <span id="s640">I think I tried to give you an overall picture, but the important part is that it should be known that we were not loved any place.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">01:17:30 We were not wanted anyplace.</span> <span id="s642">We have to have a Jewish country.</span> <span id="s643">We have to have an Israel.</span> <span id="s644">Otherwise as Jews we cannot and we will not survive unless we assimilate, which then we will disappear.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: This is what I was trying to say.</span> <span id="s647">I don't know if you got what you wanted, Linda.</span> <span id="s648">Please ask me questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">01:18</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: You're fine.</span> <span id="s651">You're fine.</span> <span id="s652">Now I..</span> <span id="s653">.</span> <span id="s654">tell me what happened after '59?</span> <span id="s655">Why did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: I married an American gentlemen and I settled in America.</span> <span id="s657">We lived in New York.</span> <span id="s658">I had two wonderful daughters and I have two wonderful daughters.</span> <span id="s659">We built a very good business.</span> <span id="s660">We had a lab for color photography and advertising agencies, and we started literally in the kitchen sink in our home but then we had problems in the marriage and we divorced.</span> <span id="s661">My children though are fine.</span> <span id="s662">The business...I didn't get them naturally.</span> <span id="s663">In the divorce women do not get yet their equal share, so but business...in the last few years the business went, was ran into the ground.</span> <span id="s664">No more.</span> <span id="s665">It was a few million dollar business gross, like ten million gross three years ago.</span> <span id="s666">Nothing left now.</span> <span id="s667">So economically I have a tough time now.</span> <span id="s668">I'm working now as a health and life insurance and investment counselor.</span> <span id="s669">I'm a specialist in disability income protection.</span> <span id="s670">It's a commission-type of business.</span> <span id="s671">I have my good times and my bad times.</span> <span id="s672">Nobody promised me a rose garden and I uh I think I do the best I can.</span> <span id="s673">Uh that's my personal history, but I finished college as an adult in America.</span> <span id="s674">I finished para-legal training which I didn't like after I had my own business, brokerage business and fashion consulting business.</span> <span id="s675">I always try new things.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">One of them perhaps the results of being a Jew.</span> <span id="s677">I was very easy on the go.</span> <span id="s678">Not since I have children naturally can move so fast, but one of the things I was a real "take your bundle and go", you know, but it stopped when I had my children.</span> <span id="s679">Naturally I couldn't go.</span> <span id="s680">I had my share of guilts of survival.</span> <span id="s681">I had my share of uh emotional problems.</span> <span id="s682">I had my share of sicknesses and all which go together with emotional problem.</span> <span id="s683">I think I'm dealing with it the best I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: That's all anyone can say.</span> <span id="s685">Is there anything you want to add?</span> <span id="s686">01:21:02</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: I was trying to figure why now, why did I come forward now to tell this?</span> <span id="s688">I felt that I have to say it.</span> <span id="s689">I felt that it should not disappear.</span> <span id="s690">It should be said.</span> <span id="s691">I don't know how much information there is about those places that I went through.</span> <span id="s692">I felt it should be said.</span> <span id="s693">It should exist.</span> <span id="s694">Perhaps somebody can learn something from it.</span> <span id="s695">Perhaps it can help somebody some place.</span> <span id="s696">Perhaps it can help for the survival of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s697">I don't know if that is important or not, but that's how I feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Thank you, Linda, for listening.</span> <span id="s700">Q:

CONVERSATION That is from the picture you know, enlarged from that picture taken out....there's my father.</span> <span id="s706">Yeah.</span> <span id="s707">Could you believe this.</span> <span

id="s715">A: 1901.</span> <span id="s716">But at that time in 1940, he was...no...he looked older there than 40... We tried to enlarge it in our own lab at the time, you know, but it's pretty sharp here.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION My father, Shalom (ph) Joszef, from the picture of the camps when they took him to work camps in front of the cattle train.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">END OF INTERVIEW</span></p></body></html>
