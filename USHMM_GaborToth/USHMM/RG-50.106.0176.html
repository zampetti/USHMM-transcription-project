October 29th, 2009 in Rockville, Maryland.</span> <span id="s12">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s13">What is your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: My full name is Melvin Galun.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And is that the name you were born with?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: No, the name I was born with was Mendel Galoon, and I was at various times also called Misha, which -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I was born on May 10, 1940, which incidentally was also the day that Winston Churchill became prime minister of England.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I was born in a little village -- little town by the name of Nisrege, which is a bit of a distance from Kowal.</span> <span id="s21">I was actually born in Kowal.</span> <span id="s22">Kowal was the big town and the hospital was there.</span> <span id="s23">Nisrege is a place that very few people have heard of except Hasidim because it was the home of a famous Hassidic old master by the name of Reb Mordechai of Mishizh.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Country was -- well, it was Poland when I was born there, it’s western Ukraine.</span> <span id="s26">It is, of course, u -- part of Ukraine now.</span> <span id="s27">When I was born there in 1940 it was still part of Poland.</span> <span id="s28">At the end of the war it was occupied by the Russians and integrated into the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s30">Let’s talk a little bit about the background of your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Your parents’ names were?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: My mother, Esther Galun, neé Elbert married my father, Yorel Galun.</span> <span id="s34">He was killed, I actually never knew him.</span> <span id="s35">He was taken away by the Nazis when I must have been maybe a year, a year and a half old.</span> <span id="s36">My mother survived the war and we both came to the United States, she passed away in the late 90’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Where was she from originally?</span> <span id="s38">Was she st -- also from that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: She was from that same town, they were both from that same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And do you know how far back her generations went, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I haven’t made up a family tree, it’s something that I’m -- I’ve been talking about, in fact, with a cousin’s daughter in Israel.</span> <span id="s42">But they went back for quite some time in that area.</span> <span id="s43">That was part of this -- the [indecipherable] of settlement in --</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: And did she have brother and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: She did.</span> <span id="s46">My mother had -- well, it men -- her family -- originally my grandmother had 10 children.</span> <span id="s47">Four survived.</span> <span id="s48">A son didn’t survive childbirth.</span> <span id="s49">The four that survived together the war, two brothers and two sisters, my mother and her sister Rachel and her two brothers, Herschel Swi and Zelig.</span> <span id="s50">And we were together off and on during the war in the forests, and then after the war in DP camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Let’s talk about your f -- your father’s family.</span> <span id="s52">I know you said you don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: -- really don’t remember your father, but what do you know about his [indecipherable] and how long -- was he from that area also?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes, he was, and my father -- my paternal grandparents, Admonis and Rachel had three children.</span> <span id="s56">My father, Yorel, his little brother, Zisa, or Zisl, and his sister, Leia.</span> <span id="s57">My father and my mother’s younger brother, who also was killed in -- in -- by the Nazis, her younger brother Ruvin, married each other’s sisters.</span> <span id="s58">He -- he was best friends -- my father was best friends with Ruvin and he married my mother and -- and Ruvin married Leia.</span> <span id="s59">Sadly, when we ran away to the forests later on, and my father and Ruvin had already been taken away at that point, Leia refused to go.</span> <span id="s60">She had -- they had three children, three di -- girls, and they also perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Do you know what your father did as a trade, or a --</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: They -- they were in the textile business and I can’t tell you how sig -- my mother would as it was a significant business, I have no idea whether it was a dry goods shop, or you know, really something more significant, but they were in that business.</span> <span id="s63">They were fairly well-to-do in -- in that small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: That’s -- that’s all I can tell you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Yeah, are you -- do you have any siblings from that marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: I have no si -- no siblings, I’m an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: I’m sure they would have had more children if -- if -- you know, they were quite young at the time.</span> <span id="s70">My mother and my father were in their early 20’s.</span> <span id="s71">And -- and my mother incidentally came from a -- the poorer part of town, she was from the wrong side of the tracks, so my fu -- she married into -- somebody of more means than her, because my -- my mother, like I in some ways, I lost my father when I was one and a half, she lost her father when she was five.</span> <span id="s72">So may -- my grandmother, after whom I’m named, Menachem Mendel, died when she was five.</span> <span id="s73">So they grew up and so my grandmother was left with all these children and they grew up in utter poverty.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Do you know if your parents were religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: They were traditional.</span> <span id="s76">They weren't the -- I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: They were observant.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: They were observant, yeah, they observed holidays.</span> <span id="s79">My -- my uncles and my grandmother, may she rest in peace, who also survived the war, my -- my maternal grandmother, Chava, you know, she was with us until ’48, when they left for Israel.</span> <span id="s80">But she was quite a religious woman, as were my uncles, my mother’s brothers.</span> <span id="s81">And my mother and her sister, maybe it was partly life in the United States, became, you know, less -- I mean, they were more secular as the years wore on.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s83">Now, I know that your memory doesn’t start for --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: -- for a few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: But can you just -- from -- from the time you were born til the time your first memory is, can you maybe just fill in that space a little bit for us to say what -- what you heard happened in that town.</span> <span id="s88">Your first memory was when?</span> <span id="s89">Let’s -- let’s start from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: My first memory is actually I would say that e -- that the end of 1943, maybe the beginning of ’44 --</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: -- when we were liberated, because we were in the forests and the Russian army advance -- it could have been ’44, I may be -- it -- it -- it probably would have been ’44, passed the Russian army as it advanced westward --</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: -- would have passed that point -- at that point.</span> <span id="s95">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: -- so we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: -- your family stayed in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: No, they didn’t stay in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Okay, what’d they do after then?</span> <span id="s101">That’s what I want to know --</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: -- what happened with your family?</span> <span id="s104">Obviously you don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yeah -- no, I’ll -- I’ll -- I’ll -- I’ll try to fill that in.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Between ’40 and ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: We lived in the town and in fact my mother said that we even had a German officer who was one of the nice ones at that time, quartered in our house, because what they used to do is to put the officers into people’s homes, very often.</span> <span id="s110">And she said he was quite sympathetic to the Jews, but was removed at some -- at some point.</span> <span id="s111">My father and my Uncle Ruvin, when -- when rumors started to come up that bad things -- that there was a threat -- rumors of threat were in the air, and my father and his -- and -- and my Uncle Ruvin actually started to moo -- to try to get into Russia and then maybe bring the families with them.</span> <span id="s112">But a lot of Jews were going east to Russia, even though they knew it was no picnic and they’d wind up in Siberia very often.</span> <span id="s113">But for some reason they couldn’t get in and they were turned back and they came back into town and then eventually, when the Germans began to round up all able-bodied men and take them away for labor, and we never heard from them again.</span> <span id="s114">And -- and my mother variously said -- I still don’t know and I still want to do some research in the newly opened ar-archives in Germany that he -- they were killed in Chelmno in the extermination camp, or whatever.</span> <span id="s115">But meanwhile we were left behind in the town and when -- one day -- and I don’t remember, I wish my mother were around now to fill in the gaps, we -- she got wind that there was going to be some action against the Jews.</span> <span id="s116">So my mother alerted her brothers and sisters -- and sister and -- and my grandmother, and we left and ran away to the woods surrounding that town.</span> <span id="s117">And we remained -- that was the beginning of our period in the forests of the Ukraine, which lasted for a bit over two years, living -- if you’ve seen the movie “Defiance”, living in holes in the ground or in huts made out of branches, but also moving around.</span> <span id="s118">People think it was a stationary, you s -- you settled down in one place, no, you didn’t settle down in one place, you moved to -- from dangerous places to safer places.</span> <span id="s119">And you’re constantly -- were on the lookout.</span> <span id="s120">So going through that kind of, you know, typical stuff, looking for food from surrounding villages or peasants.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Did your mother ever tell you who was in the group?</span> <span id="s122">Were there other children?</span> <span id="s123">Were you the only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Well initially we -- when we left it was just our family unit.</span> <span id="s125">It was my mother’s two brothers and their families, my aunt, who was a single woman.</span> <span id="s126">My Aunt Rachel was single, and my --</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: So you were not part of a partisan group or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Not initially.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Not initially.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: But eventually what happened was we were in --</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Let’s talk about initially first.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Well initially -- the first night I can tell you my mother claims th -- because she -- they ran away, she said she didn’t even have time to take wa -- it was already tow -- it’s towards fall, I believe, getting close to winter and she didn’t take any clothing for me.</span> <span id="s133">So come nighttime, you know, I was crying and you know, and she was ready to go back and she started to go back and she met a peasant along the way who said, where you going?</span> <span id="s134">And she said, we’re going back to Nisregin, he said, the town’s been burnt down.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Are we talking about fall of ’41?</span> <span id="s136">Is that what you --</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Probably, is my hunch.</span> <span id="s138">But I -- you know, I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I’m not keen on the dates.</span> <span id="s141">In any case, when we -- when we ran -- so she turned back and we stayed in the forests, you know, and we continued in our wanderings, so we’d meet up with other groups, and what happened was that people find each other.</span> <span id="s142">So there was other stragglers, other civilians, Jews, but in our peregrinations we also wound up meeting with partisan groups eventually, sometimes hostile and sometimes friendly.</span> <span id="s143">Sometimes -- we didn’t have Jewish partisan groups like you -- you had sometimes further north in Lithuania, per se, but we met up with a number of different non-Jewish partisan groups.</span> <span id="s144">And they weren't all friendly.</span> <span id="s145">And -- but I do begin to remember -- you know, it’s hard to distinguish sometimes what you’ve dreamed and what stories you’ve integrated from other people.</span> <span id="s146">I do begin to remember the lib -- the liberation, when the Russians came in and -- and -- and thereafter.</span> <span id="s147">I was very sick in the forest, and this I was told by my mother.</span> <span id="s148">I developed -- because I was an infant, I was what, less than two years old when the war -- and I developed diphtheria and I was close to death, I mean, I -- s -- you know, so my mother took me to a field hospital, miles away, where the Russians treated -- th-the partisans and the military had a field hospital and she wanted them to treat me and -- and the officer in charge says look at all the people, we have soldiers in there and I don’t have time for -- for you.</span> <span id="s149">So she took me back and -- to our encampment and through some -- I forget what she told me, they -- in e -- in essence they gave me what would today be considered a vaporizer treatment and it seemed to work, some remedy that they found, and I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Are there any other -- I hate to used the word anecdotes, but stories that your mother told you about that time, before you remembered.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Y-Yeah, I mean, she would tell me about what it was like to go and search for food, for example, and how dangerous that was.</span> <span id="s152">And some of the people, because you would -- you would have to leave -- you were in the forest.</span> <span id="s153">The forest was both safety, but it was also deprivation.</span> <span id="s154">Safety in the sense that organized armies don’t go into forests.</span> <span id="s155">Not out of fear, but you know, it’s -- you -- you just don’t.</span> <span id="s156">I mean, you don’t bring in tanks and armor and what have you into forests.</span> <span id="s157">So you -- you -- so people can hide in a forest.</span> <span id="s158">On the other hand, you’re deprived of food and y-you know, we weren’t hunters, you know what I mean, it’s not like -- yeah, I mean people ate -- you know, they ate berries or they ate mushrooms of they f -- whatever they found.</span> <span id="s159">But they would also go out, leave the forest and go to some peasants that they knew or some farmer, because the woods were still in the area and we wa -- we had not yet wandered far enough into it, so you were able to leave and go and get some food.</span> <span id="s160">But of course that presupposed that the -- th-the peasant you were going to was not going to sell you out and was not going to inform the Germans that you were there.</span> <span id="s161">So it was fraught with danger and of course some of the people that they knew, other Jews, were killed on these missions.</span> <span id="s162">So she would tell me about these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: How would you describe your mother?</span> <span id="s164">She sounds like a very strong woman to have gone through this, and kept you alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: She was -- I do [indecipherable] describe her, an-and the way I have described her is she was great in a crisis, but she was not so great in dealing with normal day to day life.</span> <span id="s166">And I really mean that.</span> <span id="s167">And there are certain people who, when they face a crisis can galvanize and mobilize all their -- you know, their -- their resources, psychological, physical etcetera and move into gear.</span> <span id="s168">And there are others who are paralyzed by it.</span> <span id="s169">And she was able to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Well, here she was a young woman in her 20’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: She was a young --</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: -- with a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: That’s right, a young woman with a baby.</span> <span id="s174">And it’s something that -- it wasn’t until I was much older that I was able to appreciate what it took.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: All right, now let’s move up to your [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: -- and what -- what you said your first memory in [indecipherable] before --</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: My first memory was actually being liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Well, describe that, what your memory --</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Oh, there’s another anecdote, you asked for anecdotal information.</span> <span id="s181">I actually had my first taste of alcohol when I was a child in the forest, because one of the groups, the -- this again my mother told me, not that I remember it, one of the partisan groups we met up with -- and -- and the relation with the partisan group, even if they were unfriendly, they were like protectors, you know, so you wanted -- civilians wanted to be near partisans.</span> <span id="s182">On the other hand, you were also -- sometimes feared them.</span> <span id="s183">This group was not well disposed to Jews apparently, but they took a liking to me because I was a cute -- according to my mother, a cute child.</span> <span id="s184">So they took me -- they would take me away.</span> <span id="s185">They would ad -- literally take me away from her and take me to their camp, a military camp and there taught me how to drink booze.</span> <span id="s186">So -- but my own memory that I can, you know, say this, I remember this, was actually riding out of the forest on an ox drawn cart heaped with whatever belongings people had.</span> <span id="s187">So when you see those films of refugees, you know, and in that’s -- you know, I remember sitting on top of that cart and being afraid I’d fall down.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Did you have any idea, being a toddler at the time, what was happening?</span> <span id="s189">Was it something good, was it something scary?</span> <span id="s190">You know, do you remember being scared or do you remember being excited?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No, probably scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Yeah, because you were in the car --</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: I -- I would say that the -- the -- at that time, you know, there were, a little bit later -- because the war was still going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: And we were, in our part of western Ukraine, because don’t forget, the -- the geography is -- I mean, not -- [interruption] Excuse me, does anybody want tea or anything?</span> <span id="s196">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Anyway, when we were liberated, this was only the beginning of the westward march in a sense, not -- not quite the beginning, but it -- I would say the -- the war still had a long ways to go.</span> <span id="s198">But our area was clear, but it doesn’t mean the war stopped, we still experienced air -- air raids, for example, constantly the Germans would come over and bomb, and I remember those.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: What were they like?</span> <span id="s200">A: So we -- we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Can you describe --</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: When we were liberated -- yeah, I can -- I -- I can describe it.</span> <span id="s203">I remember running with my mother into -- we think of air raid shelters as being something under a building and you know, room, and you sit there and -- you know.</span> <span id="s204">Poor lighting maybe, but you -- you know, you’re comfortable inside some place.</span> <span id="s205">The air raid shelters very often that the Russians or Ukrainians had were simply ditches dug around the perimeter of the town or sometimes in the town, but sometimes on the outskirts of the town, because they knew they would bomb in the town.</span> <span id="s206">So they would dig a ditch -- ditches on the outskirts of the town and when the bomb -- when the sky was lit up by these lights, the planes would come over and the search lights would go up, you know, to look for the planes and stuff, you would be running, the civilians would be running to the outskirts of town to these ditches and would, you know, jump in them and you’d sit there, you know, hoping they wouldn’t have a stray bomb hit you on the head, and seeing these planes, you got, you know, all the stuff going on around you.</span> <span id="s207">So I do remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: You have memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yeah, I have memories of that.</span> <span id="s210">When we were liberated we moved to a town by the name of -- this I remember, is Rafalovka.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: What langu -- by the way, what language were you speaking to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Well, my native tongue is Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: My -- I mean, had I grown up in normal circumstances I would have also spoken Ukrainian or Russian or whatever.</span> <span id="s215">I did speak Russian when I was a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: But at that time did you understand Russian -- at the -- before --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: When I wa -- we were liberated --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: You -- you -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: -- an-and we lived -- and we moved back into town, I learned Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Okay, but up to that point you only knew Yiddish</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Basically --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Up to the lib -- liberate --</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: -- basically, because in -- in the house -- in the home we -- we spoke Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s225">But I meant when you were in the forest and -- and of course you were -- were too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Well, I probably learned some Russian too --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: -- but -- but it wasn’t like going to school --</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: But you didn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: -- I wasn’t old enough to go to school, so I would -- obviously I had to communicate with the Russian partisans and stuff to the extent that I could.</span> <span id="s231">So I did speak Russian, I can -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Where did your mother get clothes for you di -- while you were still a two year old, three year old, four year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Well, whatever I had, I had, I mean I have no idea where she got additional stuff.</span> <span id="s234">They could have sewn things, or you know, or gotten them from, you know, surrounding connections, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: So you said now you’re -- you’re [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Yeah, so we’re in a town Rafalovka, th-that -- when we were liberated, and we had -- I remember this -- that we had -- we lived -- again, it was my -- my mother, my aunt, my grandmother, Chava, my uncle at that point, one of my uncles, Herschel was taken away to the coal mines in the Doniets basin, Donbass, which is one of the world’s big coal mines -- coal mi-mining areas.</span> <span id="s237">So he was taken away with his family.</span> <span id="s238">My other uncle, Zelig was drafted, so after spending two and a half years in the forests, he’s drafted int-into the Russian army.</span> <span id="s239">We stayed in Rafalovka with -- and we had a cow.</span> <span id="s240">I remember that we had a cow for milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Where did you live in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: You know, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s243">Probably in some bombed out building, I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: And then we moved from Rafalovka -- we -- we stayed there for maybe a couple of months, three months, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s246">But then we moved to Kowal, which is the town I was born in.</span> <span id="s247">And they’re all in the same area, basi -- I think Rafalovka is north of Kowal, northeast.</span> <span id="s248">And we moved to Kowal and we moved into a -- what people did was to move -- find the housing that was not totally shattered.</span> <span id="s249">So even if a house had been damaged by bombing raids, but it was in reasonably good shape, you moved in.</span> <span id="s250">You fixed it up and you lived .</span> <span id="s251">And that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s252">And we -- again, we lived as a -- as a family unit.</span> <span id="s253">And -- which included my mother, her sister Rachel, my grandmother.</span> <span id="s254">My Uncle Zelig had been taken away but his wife, my Aunt Sosil remained with us, and he had two sons, Aaron and Menachem and they stayed with us.</span> <span id="s255">And they were like older brothers to me, they’re -- they -- I was five, four or five and they were six, seven years older than I, maybe eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Do -- do you remember seeing other little children your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s258">I wasn’t old enough to go to school.</span> <span id="s259">I don’t really, not at that point remember other little children.</span> <span id="s260">It’s -- it’s interesting, I do later.</span> <span id="s261">But I do remember my -- my cousin Aaron, may he rest in peace, who was like an older brother to me, and I going to the train station -- and people had to make a living you know, we -- the war was going on.</span> <span id="s262">So one of the things that I know they did is the women started to bake bread.</span> <span id="s263">And they would bake bread and give it to me and to Aaron and we’d take it down to the train station and try to sell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Sell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Sell it to soldiers, sell it to whoever was willing to buy it.</span> <span id="s266">I remember that.</span> <span id="s267">I remember long, mile long marches of Russian troops coming through from the east and going to the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: As a little boy --</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: -- what did that mean to you?</span> <span id="s271">Did you want to be a soldier?</span> <span id="s272">Was it scary, or was it wonderful [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: The Russians at that time were my heroes.</span> <span id="s274">And one had a very -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s hard today and -- and -- and you know, knowing with hindsight.</span> <span id="s275">W-We -- we were liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s276">We knew their shortcomings and the shortcomings of the system they were trying to impose.</span> <span id="s277">But they were also our liberators and our heroes.</span> <span id="s278">And yeah, I admired them.</span> <span id="s279">And in fact, I remember in Kowal, because my mother also -- at some point they started to sell vodka.</span> <span id="s280">How they s -- made vodka, I have no idea, but somebody got -- knew how to do it and they -- and it was a barter economy at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s281">So people with -- salt was, for example was -- was a commodity that was amazingly expensive to get.</span> <span id="s282">And you need salt.</span> <span id="s283">I mean, you can’t do without salt.</span> <span id="s284">So people would trade vodka for salt.</span> <span id="s285">And I remember one of the Russian soldiers who came in, and I wish I could remember his name, but he was a tailor and I wanted a uniform.</span> <span id="s286">You’re talking about how I felt about the Russians and -- and he made me a uniform.</span> <span id="s287">The only thing I remember he -- I even had epaulets on me so I could look like a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s288">The only thing I couldn’t get was the red star that they wore, and that was my big disappointment.</span> <span id="s289">But that’s the way, you know, i-it -- it was, life was ironic that way, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Do you know, going back --</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: -- some years earlier, if your parents were members of the communist party?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s294">My father was very active in Betar, so he was a -- he was a right winger.</span> <span id="s295">They used to call -- call us because I joined Betar in DP camp when I was a -- a -- six, and they used to call us the Jewish fascists.</span> <span id="s296">But no, we -- we didn't have any -- any communists in -- in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: So he was a Zionist</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: He was a Zionist, oh yeah, absolute.</span> <span id="s299">Ardent, ardent Zionist.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: -- your mother was</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Ardent Zionist.</span> <span id="s302">And my mother was too.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: My mother was too, and ma -- in -- and the rest of the family, I’d say those that were politically conscious at all were more left wing Zionists.</span> <span id="s305">They wound up in Israel and today they’re more right wing than I am, so -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Melvin Galun.</span> <span id="s307">This is tape number one, side B. And you were talking about how you ha -- your -- your -- your parents were Zionists, but you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Right.</span> <span id="s309">Yeah.</span> <span id="s310">Well, my father --</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yes, my father was very active and there is no doubt in my mind that Israel could have been a destination had he survived the war, for us.</span> <span id="s313">I know that I wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s314">When I wound up -- when my mother decided to come to the United States, for me, I had a deep sense of disappointment.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s316">Okay, that’s -- we’re back in Kowal you said, and you -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yeah, well from gur --</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: A soldier made you the --</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: He made me a uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: -- uniform, minus the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I remember my fa -- I admired the soldiers.</span> <span id="s322">I remember the first one of them demonstrated me one evening how to fire a rifle, and of course f-for a little kid that’s -- I mean, I didn’t fire it, I couldn’t even hold it, it was -- but -- and I learned to sing Russian songs, some of which I can still remember.</span> <span id="s323">A couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Can you sing -- can you sing a line or two?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Can you sing a line or two?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Oh, I ra -- I would -- yes, I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Yeah, do it, do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: I can in a good -- no, but I’d ra -- rather not, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s331">Did you -- do you know if there were any incidents of anti-Semitism between the Russians and the Jews at that time?</span> <span id="s332">Or did you exper -- did anybody say anything to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: We experienced it later, a little bit later --</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: But at this point --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: -- down the road.</span> <span id="s336">Not at this point, although we did know the misgivings.</span> <span id="s337">We had a neighbor that the -- the Russians themselves, non-Jewish Russians had about the system.</span> <span id="s338">We had neighbors -- the-they were -- admired the United States greatly.</span> <span id="s339">We had a neighbor who was a prosecutor, they call them procurator in the -- in the system.</span> <span id="s340">But they were quietly critical of the system they had and that that was our first ec -- exposure that maybe things were -- you know, I was -- little kids are not politically sophisticated.</span> <span id="s341">But we left Kowal I would say -- I’m trying to sort -- I would say probably in ’44 - ’45, we left Kowal.</span> <span id="s342">We stayed there for awhile.</span> <span id="s343">We moved on to Chelm, which is connected to Kowal actually by railroad, it’s -- they’re both railroad junctions.</span> <span id="s344">So Kowal -- Chelm is further west.</span> <span id="s345">And Chelm is already Poland proper.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Poland.</span> <span id="s347">What was that journey like?</span> <span id="s348">Do you have any [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: -- you don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: -- I don’t really remember, but I remember living in Chelm, you know, I remember living in Chelm in a also semi-bombed out building.</span> <span id="s352">I remember -- one of the childhood memories I had was the -- one stairway didn’t have a railing and walking up was always scary to me.</span> <span id="s353">I said, what if I fall off, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Why did your mother move to Chelm?</span> <span id="s355">Why did she choose that?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I can’t really say, but the urge to move west was there, somehow, I -- unspoken, I don’t know, I -- I never asked her.</span> <span id="s357">People also -- one of the things people don’t understand is there was no home to go -- left to go to.</span> <span id="s358">So you kind of -- you’d go elsewhere, you know what I mean, but going deeper into Russia was not something that they would have found attractive.</span> <span id="s359">So you went west.</span> <span id="s360">I mean, you -- you -- going back to our town was not an option, and with that -- that was the case for many Jews, most Jews I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Do you have a sense of your mother’s frame of mind that time?</span> <span id="s362">Was she full of tension, or -- she was your mother and you were a small child.</span> <span id="s363">Did you have an -- a sense as a child that she was tightly wound going through all these very challenging --</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Well, I’m sure she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: I’m sure she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: -- but she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: -- no, I meant on the outside [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: -- no, no, no, I’m sure she was.</span> <span id="s369">She -- she was -- she was -- yeah, she was a nervous woman, but she was also an enterprising one.</span> <span id="s370">And even there when we moved to Poland -- I mean, don’t forget, Poland was no long -- Poland was now occupied by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: We were Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s373">I mean my -- that little card I showed you says place of birth, Poland.</span> <span id="s374">So I -- we were not stateless in that sense, we were Polish citizens, because western Ukraine where I was born was Poland when I was born there.</span> <span id="s375">But you asked about anti-Semitism or do I -- in Chelm -- in Chelm we did experience anti-Semitism, and I -- and I remember it.</span> <span id="s376">I remember it as in --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Can you describe some of those --</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: -- as a little incident with a dog being sicced on me by -- by Polish children and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: And how did you handle that?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Probably I me -- I don’t remember, but I probably ran home crying to my mother.</span> <span id="s381">But we also remember a small pogrom that took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: In Chelm?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Well, you -- how man --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: I mean those were -- they were always -- there were beginning to be incidents of anti-Semitic nature almost immediately in the wake of -- in the wake of the liberation.</span> <span id="s386">Q: Did -- did -- did you experience that pogrom at all?</span> <span id="s387">Do yo -- do you have memories --</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Not personally --</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: -- I mean, I don’t ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Not personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: -- no, I don’t -- I don’t have any memory of it.</span> <span id="s393">But I -- I remember hearing talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Hearing about --</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: -- about it, yeah, I remember hearing talk about it.</span> <span id="s396">I wasn’t -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: And we also lived, but this one I can’t place, we -- we moved from Chelm to Lódz, which is another big Polish [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: How long were you in Chelm?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: A few months.</span> <span id="s401">Maybe six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: A few months, oh, okay.</span> <span id="s403">And then to Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Then to Lódz.</span> <span id="s405">One of the things that happened and I -- I should interject that I forgot to, is my -- is son -- th -- my uncles -- my uncle who had been sent to the coal mines, Herschel and with his family, and my Uncle Zelig, who went to the army, we were all reunited.</span> <span id="s406">How Herschel got out of the coal mines I don’t remember, but he came back with great stories.</span> <span id="s407">One ince -- well, my Uncle Zelig I remember c -- his army unit was passing through Kowal and he said, I want to visit my family.</span> <span id="s408">And they said okay, you have an hour or whatever, and he came back and -- to visit his family.</span> <span id="s409">And we said, you’re not going back to the army.</span> <span id="s410">And that same night we left and we crossed over into Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Oh my [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Of course he would have been shot had he been -- you know, the Russians realized it.</span> <span id="s413">So he essentially deserted the -- the Russian army.</span> <span id="s414">But one of the incidents that I didn't tell you, and -- and that is significant, when I -- many, many years later when I went to Israel, because after the war the family split and two brothers went to Israel, two sisters to America.</span> <span id="s415">My Uncle Herschel would tell me this story, that when we were in the woods, there was one night early on when it was cold and I -- I was crying.</span> <span id="s416">And my Uncle Zelig was -- got panicky that my crying would attract attention from the Germans, and he -- according to Herschel, started to strangle me, and -- until they were able to overcome him and stop him.</span> <span id="s417">He always told that story -- I mean, I loved both my uncles dearly.</span> <span id="s418">They were very -- two different characters and he would -- so I never -- you know, I never knew whether he told the story to provoke him or to -- you know, but that’s what it was like.</span> <span id="s419">So -- so, anyway, to come back, we wen -- we then --</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: To Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: -- Lódz and then we --</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: How long were you in Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: I -- you know, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s424">I -- I would say by the beginning of, or middle of -- trying to remember -- ’45 - ’46.</span> <span id="s425">Again, we didn’t spend more time than a few months, maybe half a year in each town.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: In each town, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: And then we moved to -- to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: So up til that time you don’t remember really playing with other little boys your age, or anything like that?</span> <span id="s429">You didn’t have a childhood, an early childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: I remember -- no, I don’t really.</span> <span id="s431">I mean, I di -- I’ll tell you someth -- I remember some of the Polish kids, but I remember not being -- being wary of them.</span> <span id="s432">I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Even at the age of five you had that knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s435">Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: These children were different than you.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Could you understand Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Polish was actually something I never learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: I -- I spoke Russian, but I didn’t speak Polish.</span> <span id="s442">I don’t remember anyway.</span> <span id="s443">My mother did, my mother spoke Polish and Ukrainian and Russian and all that.</span> <span id="s444">I -- one of my early memories when we were liberated was going to synagogue with my Uncle Zelig, the one who allegedly tried to choke me.</span> <span id="s445">And was a very -- it’s a wonderful memory which I stored away.</span> <span id="s446">I mean simply -- I remember it was a beautiful, sunny day and was kind of a sense in wa -- it was a Sabbath.</span> <span id="s447">It was a very peaceful kind of experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Can you describe any more, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No, I mean that’s -- I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Where -- where -- where was this at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Thi-This was in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: This was in Poland and it’s the first experience I remember having in a synagogue, other than in Kowal, when we went back to Kowal, I’m trying to remember if I visited th -- the synagogue there with writing -- because the Germans often used the synagogues as round-up places and -- and there’d be writing on the wall from the -- but then we wound up, after Lódz we wound up in East Berlin, my mother and I, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: How did you get there, by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: We -- we crossed borders illegally.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: How did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: On trucks, backs of trucks, or wa -- you know, people or -- ther-there was an organized -- I can’t say Israeli, but it was like -- there was something called the Bricha, which got a lot of Jews like us out of eastern Europe, you know, to points west or points south.</span> <span id="s458">Sometimes people wound up in Italy, too.</span> <span id="s459">We wound up in East Berlin, my mother and I in a bombed out building in East Berlin, my uncles in different zones, I’m trying to remember where they were.</span> <span id="s460">But they were not in the communist -- they were not in the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s461">They got into the American zone, I think one may have been in the British zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: And you and your --</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: There were four zones --</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: -- i-in -- in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Wi -- and you are in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: We were in the Russian zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Russian zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: And of course this was in the early days and right after the war, 40 -- middle of 1945 and so things were still a sense of -- I mean, it’s like if you look at films, American films from that time, they speak about Uncle Joe and that everything was friendly and these were our allies and blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s470">But of course shortly thereafter the Iron Curtain came down in ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: You’re talking about Uncle Joe Stalin?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Yeah, oh yeah, absolutely.</span> <span id="s473">And so there was a different spirit that existed then.</span> <span id="s474">And so we were in the Russian zone, but then at some point people said well, you know, things are becoming a little more strained in terms of relations.</span> <span id="s475">Maybe we better get out of here, because the restrictions will be imposed.</span> <span id="s476">Because before that you were able to get on a train and -- and there was no wall, of course, there.</span> <span id="s477">The wall was built much later, the Berlin wall.</span> <span id="s478">But you were able to get on a subway and go from one point of the city to another, no problem.</span> <span id="s479">So the fact that you -- somebody lived in the French zone, or the British zone, or the American zone, didn’t matter, you could come and visit them.</span> <span id="s480">But we got out of the Russian zone and came to the American zone and sort of towards the end of ’45, maybe beginning of ’46.</span> <span id="s481">And we wound up in Munich and then in one of the first of five different DP camps, displaced persons camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: One of the e -- es -- asides I want to say, one of the things that always fascinated me is in the forest my grandmother was with us, but she was a kosher and a very observant woman, is how she survived the war never eating anything un-kosher just amazed me.</span> <span id="s484">I have no idea how she --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: [indecipherable] a vegetarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Yeah, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Did y -- did you grandmother ever talk about Shabbat or any of the holidays while you were -- in those years in --</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah, later, yeah.</span> <span id="s489">She -- she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Or your mother, did your mother talk about holidays while you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yeah, I mean we --</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: -- running for your lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: But I don’t remember, you know, how we observed them --</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: In -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: -- in -- in -- in the very early days.</span> <span id="s496">Later on I do, I mean, when we got to Germany and we got to the first DP camp, which was Poking, P-o-k-i-n-g.</span> <span id="s497">That’s the one, the picture I showed you before.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: We standed -- and we lived in barracks essentially.</span> <span id="s500">These wer -- these were long rows and barracks just like you see in stalag --</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: How did your family know to go to that particular one?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Well, I think by that point when we got to Munich, we probably got in contact with the Jewish community and -- and some of the relief organizations, because what was set up at that time, it may have be -- been the be -- it was the very beginning of the United Nations.</span> <span id="s503">And so they had an organization even before the United Nations, the relief works association, whatever they called it, they had something called the IRO, the International Relief Organization.</span> <span id="s504">And so we -- we would have contacted them.</span> <span id="s505">My mother certainly would have.</span> <span id="s506">She was -- I told you she was enterprising.</span> <span id="s507">Even in Poland, I mean, she started to do a little bit of -- of you know, handling and -- and -- and you know, moving around in -- to make a living, scrounge up a living.</span> <span id="s508">So she would go on trips to various places and so when we got to Germany, she would -- we would have -- you know, by ’46 we would have been in touch with the Jewish community, or the -- some of the relief organizations and we wound up -- how the decision was made to go to Poking, I mean, it probably wasn’t our decision, they just sent you there.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Was this, for a six year old child a fearful time?</span> <span id="s510">Do you have memories --</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: I-It was a -- a time I -- I will descri -- well, let me -- let me -- I -- y-y -- I was interviewed a number of years ago.</span> <span id="s512">Somewhere if I find it I’ll send it to you, but -- an article in the Washington Post, somebody wanted to know why I was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s513">And the woman who was conducting the interview, and I said, well, I can give you a sh -- very short answer, or I can give you the long answer.</span> <span id="s514">She said no, I want the long answer.</span> <span id="s515">So I told her about -- a bit about my background, this.</span> <span id="s516">And I tried to describe the feeling of what it meant for Israel, because I was in DP camp when Israel was established.</span> <span id="s517">The world was very gray, very threatening, s-still -- still threatening in some ways.</span> <span id="s518">You felt defeated in spirit.</span> <span id="s519">Not just personally, but also as part of a people.</span> <span id="s520">You didn’t even -- you know, I -- I know I sensed that.</span> <span id="s521">In other words, if you were a Jew, how could you not feel defeated?</span> <span id="s522">But also, of course, if you’re a child who has lost the parent and who has lost -- you know.</span> <span id="s523">So you feel -- you feel a s -- a sense of anguish about ya -- everything.</span> <span id="s524">So, when Israel was established it was just the opposite.</span> <span id="s525">It was sunshine, it was freedom, it was strength.</span> <span id="s526">So suddenly people who are ex -- terribly weak and have been beaten by everybody are suddenly on the ascent.</span> <span id="s527">So that early time was definitely a period of grayness and -- and no question.</span> <span id="s528">And just like our barracks, I mean, if you look at them, they were just these dingy, gray on the outside barracks, in which each family got a room, essentially.</span> <span id="s529">My grandmother, my mother, my aunt and I shared one large room, and we put up a curtain across, you know, a blanket or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: What did you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Well, I’m --</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: We’re talking about the first camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: First camp I actually start school.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: I’m six years old, I start school and I remember that.</span> <span id="s536">But my grandmother -- and I told you, my grandmother was -- was Orthodox, observant woman, and she was in [indecipherable] the school was conducted in Hebrew, everything in Hebrew, because even though it was 1946, they had to choose a language that would suit everybody, so they said Hebrew.</span> <span id="s537">And all the subjects we’re talking here [indecipherable] it wasn’t taught as a language.</span> <span id="s538">It meant my math books were in Hebrew, my geography, history books, blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s539">But my grandmother said well, but what about Yiddishkeit?</span> <span id="s540">She understood that there’s a distinction between learning secular subjects in Hebrew and so she also put me in something called a chayder, and I wound up going to a chayder from Lubovich.</span> <span id="s541">I -- first they put me in with satmar, we had a very large contingent of satmar in the camp.</span> <span id="s542">But I didn’t like satmar for lots of reasons including the fact that they’re anti-Zionist and so I wound up going to Lubovich, and you know, learning Hebrew the way it’s pronounced in Israel in the morning, daytime, and learning it differently pronounced in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s543">So I was getting two different points of view of Jewish history and pers -- my perspective was totally schizophrenic.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: So you spent the days going to school and to chayder.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Going to school in the afternoons, I wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: And now you’re with other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s548">Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And what was that like for you for the -- in a sense for the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: It was fun, I mean I -- I just --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Did you know how to talk to them, did you -- cause you had been in a world of adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I had been in a world of adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Up to that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: -- absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: But it was easy to --</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yeah, I still remember some of my childhood friends, very much so.</span> <span id="s559">And I -- and I remember some of the adventures we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Oh, we g-going to the surrounding farms, there were German farms that surrounded us, stealing vegetables and -- from their fields.</span> <span id="s562">Walking to the outskirts of the camp, where there were craters from bombs that unexpl -- finding unexploded bombs, or going to -- I remember there was -- there were like warehouses, huge warehouses on the outskirts which had been bombed out, it was dangerous to even walk in there.</span> <span id="s563">And we’d go, you know, kids are like that.</span> <span id="s564">You know, walking around and of course when my mother would find out she’d be very upset and very angry.</span> <span id="s565">Walking around, finding all sorts of stuff at th-the -- this is what wartime is, nan -- and aftermath of a war is like, I mean you find stuff.</span> <span id="s566">You find unexploded shells, you find goodness knows, you know.</span> <span id="s567">But we were in a camp of our own, we were not in touch.</span> <span id="s568">The adults were, some of the adults.</span> <span id="s569">My mother learned German.</span> <span id="s570">But I had no contact with, let’s say, German kids.</span> <span id="s571">You lived in Germany, but this camp was a community unto itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s573">Did the other Jewish children -- a-again, you were young --</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: -- talk about what -- what was happening, were they -- or what had happened to them during the war, or -- was that a topic of discussion or you were just playing games and going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: They probably did, but I don’t remember it --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: You were still very young, you were very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: -- and I -- maybe we didn’t -- didn’t focus on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: You know what I mean, I -- I had --</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Did you have a ball to play with, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yeah, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: [indecipherable] games?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: -- yes, we -- we had a soccer field, I remember people started, we -- we’d go there, we started to -- trying to re -- we -- we got -- started to get stuff from the States, I mean, packages from -- with crayons and pencils and coloring books and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: And the food was -- was substantive?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: You had communal --</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Dining room?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Yeah, communal -- I th -- I -- I think so.</span> <span id="s589">I think so.</span> <span id="s590">Except for the Shabbas meal.</span> <span id="s591">I think I ate my Sabbath meals at my uncle’s, cause they lived across the hall in the same building and the Sabbath was always spent eating at their table.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s593">With blessings and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yes, yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s595">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s596">I also remember going to a summer camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: While you were still in this first --</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: In this first camp, I -- my cousin Aaron, may God rest his soul, took me -- he and I went together, he was in the older unit, but he took good care of me.</span> <span id="s599">I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s600">In a different mo -- ba -- in a different camp in Germany, which was sort of nicer than ours was.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s602">You didn't mind leaving your mother at such a young age?</span> <span id="s603">Here you had been so close with her all during the terrible times?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: I probably did mind, but you know, it was a necessary experience for me.</span> <span id="s605">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: And how long -- so how long did you stay in -- in that first camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: First camp we stayed until 1948.</span> <span id="s608">Early ’48, maybe like -- yeah, early ’48.</span> <span id="s609">My -- my --</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: So that’s the camp you were in when the state of Israel --</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: No.</span> <span id="s612">I-Israel was born in May ’48 --</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Spring -- May ’48, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: -- and we moved --</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: You moved before May?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: We moved before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s618">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: I can’t remember was -- what happened in ’48 was also important.</span> <span id="s620">My two cousins, the ones I was telling you about, Aaron and Menachem, my like two older brothers -- because I didn’t have any siblings, my -- my Uncle Herschel had two daughters and my Uncle Zelig had two sons.</span> <span id="s621">My -- my older cousin Menachem just passed away this year, so [indecipherable] he was a source of -- he was like a brother.</span> <span id="s622">They want -- they wanted to get into Israel.</span> <span id="s623">And we all joined Zionist youth movements in the camps because --</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: In the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yeah, i-in -- in -- in Poking.</span> <span id="s626">So I joined the right wing movement, I joined Betar, they joined left wing movements.</span> <span id="s627">And they wanted to go and get into what was at that time still Palestine illegally, and they wound up getting turned back.</span> <span id="s628">But they didn’t get sent to Cyprus, they wound up on the French Riviera, which was one of the -- we used to crack up about that.</span> <span id="s629">And they wound up in Nice, but then they said we still -- we’re going back and they eventually got in and fought in the War of Independence.</span> <span id="s630">So their parents, of course, said we’re not going to leave them in Israel alone, we’re going after them.</span> <span id="s631">So they left.</span> <span id="s632">And then my other brother als -- mother’s other brother, my other uncle, also went to Israel.</span> <span id="s633">So they wound up in Israel and we wound up, you know, coming here eventually.</span> <span id="s634">But it wa -- so they left from Poking.</span> <span id="s635">We then went to another camp, the second camp, Heidenheim.</span> <span id="s636">And in Heidenheim --</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Why did you change camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: We were not asked, we were -- they were -- they sent us there.</span> <span id="s639">They sometime disbanded camps.</span> <span id="s640">I don’t remember what happened with Poking exactly.</span> <span id="s641">It -- it may have been, but sometimes they said this camp is at an end, you gotta go elsewhere.</span> <span id="s642">Or someth -- you know, I really don’t recall what the reason was.</span> <span id="s643">We went to Heidenheim where we had -- which was a much nicer in terms of the living arrangements, cause we were in a -- I remember it being a house.</span> <span id="s644">Now whether we had one apartment in the house, which is probably likely, and we had a garden in the back.</span> <span id="s645">Even in Poking in the -- in the barracks, I remember we s -- the people started to raise chickens and I had my own little garden that I planted.</span> <span id="s646">I ra -- my interest -- I have an interest in gardening, it goes back to then.</span> <span id="s647">My Uncle Zelig and I raised pigeons together, except I saw them as pets and he saw them as, you know, a food source.</span> <span id="s648">But when we moved to Heidenheim is when, in the school, th -- I was in the choir and they taught us songs.</span> <span id="s649">I still have the songbook, which was written out by hand, to sing on the occasion of Israel’s establishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: You gotta sing one or two sentences of a song.</span> <span id="s651">Can you sing one or two sentences?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Oh God, yeah, I ju -- I -- I -- I remember those songs, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Just one.</span> <span id="s654">Can you do one line, or two?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: [sings] That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: One more line.</span> <span id="s659">One -- one more line.</span> <span id="s660">One more line.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Anyway.</span> <span id="s662">I mean I -- I have -- I have -- I have my report cards from those schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s664">So you stayed in a second camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: We stayed in the second camp for I -- you know, I can’t remember exactly how long.</span> <span id="s666">This was ’48?</span> <span id="s667">I would say probably til the beginning of ’49, maybe.</span> <span id="s668">And then we moved to a third camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: -- called Wasseralfingen.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Melvin Gal-Galun.</span> <span id="s673">This is tape number two, side A, and we were talking about your life in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s674">Were there newspapers or publications?</span> <span id="s675">A: Yeah, there were publications, there were newspapers, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: -- and there was radio.</span> <span id="s678">I mean, I’d -- we listened to the radio to get the news.</span> <span id="s679">I was always interested in -- in news, of course, especially from news about the Jewish community and Palestine, the nascent state of Israel.</span> <span id="s680">We all joined Zionist youth movements.</span> <span id="s681">What happened was that emissaries came from Palestine, Israel.</span> <span id="s682">In those days a Palestinian referred to a Jew, you knew -- you knew the other residents of that area as Arabs, they were not called Palestinians.</span> <span id="s683">So emissaries came over to organize the kids into sports clubs, youth groups, etcetera.</span> <span id="s684">Some of them were -- had specific ideologies.</span> <span id="s685">So the s -- so you had labor Zionists, you had religious Zionists, and you had -- you know, the -- the one I joined, which was Betar, which was considered right wing Zionists, or nationalists.</span> <span id="s686">But I was very much aware of the news in pre-state Israel, no ca -- and -- and -- and you know, pre-state Palestine when the Haganah and the Irgun were fighting the British, for example.</span> <span id="s687">So the Haganah at that time had a policy called Havlagah, restraint.</span> <span id="s688">Irgun was not, the Irgun believed in hitting back, which some considered to be too provocative and that -- you know.</span> <span id="s689">I actually used to cheer for -- for Irgun, you know, as the -- you know, other Jews, different places, but that depended on your own outlook and your own -- your own experience.</span> <span id="s690">But I was very much aware of what was -- what was going on, as were the other kids, I think.</span> <span id="s691">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s693">I know you said you were at the next camp at the time of the establishment of the state of Israel --</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Th-The [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: But preceding that, had you heard of a man named Hitler?</span> <span id="s696">Did that name mean anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Oh of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: What -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: -- again as a six year old, what is a six year old’s perception, seven year old’s perception of some --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Well, I mean I -- I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Or did you know what had happened the pri -- I mean, did your mother tell you what had happened, or wa -- what does a mother tell a six year old child about the terrible things that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Well, I mean, I -- I think you certainly knew who Hitler was.</span> <span id="s704">I mean, that -- not -- not just knew, but you knew that i -- I had a sense of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: In other words, I’m trying to get a six year old’s perception.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Right, no, I -- I understand and I can -- I can relate to that more easily on the positive side.</span> <span id="s707">I know that the Russians were my heroes because they liberated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: The Americans were heroes, but the Americans were also sometimes seen as not being tough enough on the Germans, an -- oddly.</span> <span id="s710">So the stuff, if you read history now, that -- you know, th-the Russians did some terrible, brutal things when they went west and we all -- we know that.</span> <span id="s711">I just got finished reading a book not long ago about the -- you know, the battle of -- of Berlin.</span> <span id="s712">And so they did some awful things.</span> <span id="s713">But don’t forget, if you’re a victim of Nazism, you want revenge.</span> <span id="s714">So war means some terrible things are done on all sides, so you mean as a child I certainly was aware of Hitler as the -- you know, the ultimate evil to beset the Jewish people, but I was also aware, from what my mother told me about, that he was only the latest and greatest if you will, in a long line of people as -- as the Hagadah says, in every generation somebody rises against us to destroy us.</span> <span id="s715">So I was aware of that.</span> <span id="s716">I was also -- there was something else that -- that maybe my -- when you don’t know who your father is or was, you can grow up with -- you hear stories.</span> <span id="s717">And my mother helped in some ways to give me this mythic vision of my father.</span> <span id="s718">What kind of man he was or would have been, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s719">I can speculate about it because I knew some -- you know.</span> <span id="s720">And -- and -- and -- and -- and on my father’s side, I mean sadly, of the family there was almost nobody left that I could even say, well he would have been like this, or like this guy, or somebody else.</span> <span id="s721">My father’s side there were only two relatives left that I met.</span> <span id="s722">One in the United States, the one who actually brought us over, who was his -- his -- my father’s uncle, my great uncle and his sister in Brazil.</span> <span id="s723">I never even knew what my father looked like until my aunt -- great aunt in Brazil sent us a photo.</span> <span id="s724">So yeah, I mean, you grow up with a child’s perception of all these -- these things, but -- but I think was also fairly grounded in reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Well now we’re in your second camp, [indecipherable] the state of Israel has been formed.</span> <span id="s726">Were there specific celebrations at the time when you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: What did -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: I mean we had -- they had celebrations throughout, it’s not like -- the ki -- the camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: It wasn’t a specific --</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: -- the camps, it -- the camps developed, and this is the -- the -- the -- the beauty about the Jewish people is the ability to bounce back from utter despair and -- and grief is -- is amazing, because di -- don’t forget -- I mean, I was in the first camp a year or half a year after the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: And people started writing newspapers, and people published newspapers, people started schools again and people -- so there’s a whole -- they started an institutional framework.</span> <span id="s734">My aunt -- my Aunt R-Rachel was married in the camp, I remember that wedding, I remember going there.</span> <span id="s735">I mean, I ca -- you know, we had meetings, we had political groups.</span> <span id="s736">So life swung back into action.</span> <span id="s737">I don’t remember specifically -- I do remember singing in the choir and how exciting it was when Israel was born.</span> <span id="s738">But I don’t remember any other -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s740">And anything else about that second camp you want to describe?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: I remember just -- I -- I remember in the second camp we already would go into the town, because th-this camp, unlike the other one, which was kind of a circumscribed area was closer to the town, you could actually walk out -- it was actually part of the town but sort of on the outskirts.</span> <span id="s742">And -- and I reme-member feeling a sense of jealousy.</span> <span id="s743">Yo-You know, the Germans were not back yet, but somehow this was their country and --</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Jealousy on whose part, on your --</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: On my part.</span> <span id="s746">On my -- that -- that this was their turf, this was, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: That you really didn’t belong there, is that what you’re saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s749">And it was a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s750">I mean, the outskirts I remember really liking.</span> <span id="s751">We went -- I remember going with my mother and some of her friends, because she had some friends, she had -- you know, she was socializing.</span> <span id="s752">She met my stepfather, whom she would later marry in the United States, actually in the first camp.</span> <span id="s753">He was the movie projectionist, we had a movie the -- set up in the barracks.</span> <span id="s754">Which was a whole other story, that’s an experience I remember.</span> <span id="s755">But we -- we -- the second camp was -- was -- oh, we would go on trips to some -- th-this was part of Bavaria, the camps were in Bavaria, which was beautiful.</span> <span id="s756">And parts of Bavaria was like being in the Swiss Alps.</span> <span id="s757">So we -- I remember one place we went to called Ludwigsburg, named after German King Ludwig.</span> <span id="s758">And it was gorgeous, you know.</span> <span id="s759">So -- but I knew that wasn’t us, you know what I mean, I knew it wasn’t ours in the -- in the -- I thought I -- I -- I lost my train of thought, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Let’s jump back, you said your mother met your stepfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yeah, in -- in -- what happened in the -- I -- I said that li-life sprang back, you know, in terms of institutions.</span> <span id="s762">We had a movie theater in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: First camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: In the first camp.</span> <span id="s765">I’m sure we did in the other too, but I don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s766">And was -- it was set up in a -- in large barracks again, and my stepfather Saul -- Shaul, whom she wound up marrying when she got to the States was the projectionist.</span> <span id="s767">And he was a jack of all trades, he was a very talented electrician and he could make things.</span> <span id="s768">So he made me -- he took a cigar box, I remember this, and sh -- he made me my own little slide projector with a cigar box so that I could take bits of film that they snip off from a movie trailer or something and show it like -- pu-push the film through the opening and it -- he’d project it on the wall.</span> <span id="s769">He used to have me -- let me sit in the back, you know, where they sit, the projectionist sits.</span> <span id="s770">So they made up, he lost his entire family in the war.</span> <span id="s771">He had been newlywed when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s772">Lost his wife, lost his parents, his brothers.</span> <span id="s773">And he came from White Russia.</span> <span id="s774">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: His -- his full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Shaul -- Saul Pikus.</span> <span id="s777">P-i-k-u-s, that was my mother’s second name.</span> <span id="s778">And his father was a school -- headmaster of a -- of the school and h-he -- he had nobody left.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s780">Now, you are -- y-you had gone -- y-you had been in two camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: And then we wound up going to a third camp called Wasseralfingen.</span> <span id="s784">I don’t remember much about that camp except having a crush on an older girl.</span> <span id="s785">Oh, and the family split.</span> <span id="s786">My aunt, who had gotten married -- I told you my Aunt Rachel married and from Heidenheim they were sent to -- and she had a -- a kid, my cousin Susan was born in camp also.</span> <span id="s787">She was -- I -- I loved Susie.</span> <span id="s788">Oh, she was -- she’s seven years younger than I am, so she was like -- and -- and they left to another camp, we split, and we went to Wasseralfingen.</span> <span id="s789">And in that camp I remember there was a girl whose name I no longer remember.</span> <span id="s790">But I would have been nine and she was probably 11 or 12 or something.</span> <span id="s791">I remember having a giant crush on her, but other than that I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s792">And of course continued going to school there, same kind of thing.</span> <span id="s793">And the -- and the foundation, I speak some Hebrew now, a bit.</span> <span id="s794">Enough to kind of get around Israel.</span> <span id="s795">But the foundation for it was really based on those schools, the first three years of my schooling was in these camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: And then from there -- all these camps were -- Heidenheim and -- and Wasseralfingen were both shorter term camps, like six, seven months.</span> <span id="s798">Poking was three years, ’46 - ’47 - ’48.</span> <span id="s799">And then we went to a place called -- now it escapes me.</span> <span id="s800">There was -- there was a final destination.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Another -- another camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Another camp before, but that was for a short period before we went to -- to -- to port, to Bremerhaven -- Bremenhaven to come to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: So that’s when your mother decided to --</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: My mother decided that -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Not to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Not to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s807">She felt that as a widow with a child that Israel was a nice new state, but as such she --</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Too hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: -- she would have to face greater hardship there.</span> <span id="s810">So we had -- my -- my father had an uncle here and he signed an affidavit to sponsor us.</span> <span id="s811">We were able to accelerate the process and --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: What did the new -- the United States mean to a nine year old?</span> <span id="s813">Were you looking forward to going?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: No, I told you, I had my heart set on going to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s816">But once --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: So in some ways it was disappointing.</span> <span id="s818">It was daunting.</span> <span id="s819">It was certainly daunting, I mean wa -- but I remember the ship, I remember coming over, I remember the ship, the u --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: -- the USS General McCray.</span> <span id="s822">It was an army transport and we took -- we arrived -- next Thanksgiving is 60 years since I arrived.</span> <span id="s823">We arrived on Thanksgiving day, they didn’t even let us disembark until the following day cause it was a holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Now this is nine --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: -- nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: How -- how long a voyage was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: 10 days, a week?</span> <span id="s830">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s831">Not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: And you pulled into New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Did that -- did you see the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: We saw the Statue of Liberty, we came in -- I can’t remember if it was at night with all the lights.</span> <span id="s836">I had never been in that big a city, you know, with --</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: You were coming into New York harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Right.</span> <span id="s839">I remember being met by our American relatives and being taken to -- guess they lived in Burrough Park in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: You did not know English, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: I did not speak a word of English.</span> <span id="s842">And the first memory, I walked into the place, their place and they were watching -- or my cousin -- they had an adopted daughter, was watching Six Gun Playhouse.</span> <span id="s843">I don’t know if you are old enough to remember that.</span> <span id="s844">And then I remember they were taking me, cause it was already getting chilly, shopping for a heavier jacket than I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: When you arrived in New York and your mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: -- mother saw relatives, was that a -- was it a particularly emotional time for this young woman to be in United States after all that she’d lived through, now losing her husband, raising this young child?</span> <span id="s848">Do you have any memories of that being an emotional scene, getting off the boat and seeing the relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: I don’t remember an emotional scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: But you were young to --</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yeah, I -- I don’t remember an emotional scene.</span> <span id="s852">They -- I mean, I’m sure they were warm and friendly --</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s854">I just meant --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: -- but if it wasn’t -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: -- it wasn’t overwhelming for your mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Right --</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: -- going through so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: -- and it -- it wasn’t close family.</span> <span id="s860">It wasn’t like being reunited with your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: These were -- these were cousins who had left many years before.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: And, you know, we went to live with this uncle who had signed the affidavit for us, so we essentially had a furnished room in an apartment.</span> <span id="s865">The building belonged to my uncle, but we had just one room.</span> <span id="s866">And my mother went to work almost immediately in the garment district, sewing in a -- in a shop, making children’s clothing.</span> <span id="s867">And -- and I, after having my first hot dog, this is another early memory, is being taken to Nathan’s in Brooklyn to have my first hot dog, which probably cost 10 cents at the time, and -- and then s-starting school here.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s869">What was that like for a child who doesn’t speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Tough.</span> <span id="s871">Tough.</span> <span id="s872">It di -- it didn’t take me a long time.</span> <span id="s873">I was fortunate that it didn’t take me long to learn the language or the -- the fundamentals, but the first couple of months were tough, yeah.</span> <span id="s874">I remember feeling very strange and out of it and i --</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Were there other refugee children?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Some, but most of the kids were American kids.</span> <span id="s877">It wi -- my mother enrolled me in a Yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: So the advantage I had was that -- and it was an Orthodox Yeshiva, my -- th-the -- the -- the rabbis spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s880">The other children spoke English, by and large.</span> <span id="s881">And it was tough.</span> <span id="s882">I remember feeling left out.</span> <span id="s883">You know, I have to check on -- my oldest and best friend also came over at the same time, we met at that Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s884">He was -- he’s a survivor from Paris and lost both his parents in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s885">When I met him in Yeshiva, I remember I felt lucky that I had lost one parent, he lost both.</span> <span id="s886">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Did the teachers ask you about what happened to you during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s889">I -- I -- I think they -- no, I think they just accepted it.</span> <span id="s890">I mean, in some ways it -- we -- I also became a bit of a behavior problem to some of them, because I was -- I was ahead of -- they -- they put me, because of the language inability -- I was much more advanced in my year -- now, in a Yeshiva you have studies in the religious section --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: And in -- in the secular.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: -- which is like in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: And the secular subjects in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s895">You’d have lunch in between.</span> <span id="s896">I was doing bang up job in my religious studies because of my knowledge of Hebrew, blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s897">They thought I was going to be a genius and I was good at my -- I mean, I got to the top class in my religious studies two years ahead of time, so I had the same teacher for three years in a row.</span> <span id="s898">I -- I loved that rabbi.</span> <span id="s899">In my secular subjects I was also good, but in -- only in math.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Because that’s an international language, so I was actually ahead of the kids.</span> <span id="s902">The teacher would give me the test papers to grade.</span> <span id="s903">I knew more than the rest of the class.</span> <span id="s904">But of course in the other subjects, where language wa-was an issue, I had to catch up.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Struggled, mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: And it was a struggle, but it wasn’t so much an intellectual struggle, cause -- cause I wasn’t a dummy, but it was a sense of loneliness and you know, isolation and that -- that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s907">So that was kind of tricky.</span> <span id="s908">But it -- you know, kids make friends kind of easily.</span> <span id="s909">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: And then you stayed in that school for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Stayed in that school from -- from 1950, I guess, ’49, cause we arrived at the end of ’49, so I figure until ’54.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: They had a -- actually the first year of high school was like a middle school [indecipherable] you know, was -- was there.</span> <span id="s914">And then went on to Yeshiva Universities High School in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: And oh, i-it was in some ways fun, I have some good memories of that first Yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: We used to cu -- Yeshiva [indecipherable] we used to call it YTC, your torture chamber.</span> <span id="s919">But I had -- th-they used to use me because of my proficiency in Hebrew to greet visiting dignitaries from Israel and I remember there was an Israeli wrestler around at the time.</span> <span id="s920">I don’t know if you remember this, Raphael Halperin was his name.</span> <span id="s921">He was like oh, big stuff.</span> <span id="s922">He’d be on television.</span> <span id="s923">So when he came to America to visit and I had to greet him, that was really --</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: He came to your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: At my school.</span> <span id="s926">And then they, one day -- and this man is no longer alive, the Minister for Social Welfare in the Israeli government, Yosef Burg came, and I greeted him.</span> <span id="s927">So, it was kind of fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s929">And then you -- so you -- you became an American teenager?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yeah, not your typical teenager, I -- I won some nice awards at the school, for my Jewish studies primarily.</span> <span id="s931">I did pretty well, I was in -- in -- in my English studies til I was wo -- what are they -- I was salutatorian.</span> <span id="s932">Number two, didn’t make number one.</span> <span id="s933">The number one guy was a -- a classmate of ours who used to memorize books.</span> <span id="s934">He was like amazing guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Were you interested in athletics?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s937">I -- the answer is -- and I’ll tell you what I mean.</span> <span id="s938">I -- I regret that I never actually played enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: But I was interested as a spectator, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s941">You ask me any question, to this day, although I have senior moments, of course, about scores and baseball.</span> <span id="s942">I mean, I got into -- baseball is such a foreign game, and I really got into that.</span> <span id="s943">It’s -- I still remember my first in -- from the school -- you know, the triple A has these school crossing guards with the -- we used the wear the -- took us to our first baseball game in the early 50’s.</span> <span id="s944">A no-hitter pitched by Carl Erskine against the Chicago Cubs, five nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: By the time you were finishing high school, did you feel then like an American, or did you still feel like a refugee?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: No, I felt I -- I felt like an American.</span> <span id="s947">There were always little things that happened, you know, I remember when -- this is -- when my English was really good, very quickly, after few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: With no acc -- with no accent?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: With an acce -- well, I had th-this spi -- that’s what I was going to tell you about.</span> <span id="s950">My English was good.</span> <span id="s951">To this day there will always be somebody in a crowd who will say, are you American born?</span> <span id="s952">Somebody can pick up.</span> <span id="s953">I couldn’t pronounce the A. I couldn’t distinguish between Barry and berry.</span> <span id="s954">And what I remember, we went to camp.</span> <span id="s955">I went to a summer camp run by a -- an outfit that’s no longer around, the Hebrew Educational Society.</span> <span id="s956">They ran a camp in Bear Mountain, New York.</span> <span id="s957">The kids would make fun of my inability to pronounce the A.</span> <span id="s958">They also made fun of my name.</span> <span id="s959">You know, my name is Menachem Mendel.</span> <span id="s960">And how did I get the name Melvin?</span> <span id="s961">Well, the American relatives got together.</span> <span id="s962">There was a powwow, I remember this.</span> <span id="s963">And they said, let’s choose a name with an M. And they said Melvin.</span> <span id="s964">Well, a few months later Jerry Lewis -- remember Martin and Lewis, when they used to be on?</span> <span id="s965">Jerry Lewis made fun of the name Melvin.</span> <span id="s966">And it became like the worst name that you can have.</span> <span id="s967">So hence I was Mel after that.</span> <span id="s968">Did I feel -- the answer is yes, I continued to feel like a refugee even -- I mean, part of me became very American, but even in high school there would be periods when I felt that these other kids are more fortunate than I am because they’re real Americans and I’m not.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: When did you become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: I beca -- that’s a very good question.</span> <span id="s971">I -- actually my citizenship was a -- what they call a derivative citizenship.</span> <span id="s972">My mother became a citizen first and then for me it was just, you know.</span> <span id="s973">So I don’t remember the exact year.</span> <span id="s974">Probably -- I want to say --</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Five years after you got here?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Maybe a little later, maybe -- maybe a year or two later.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s978">Did that mean anything to you, to become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: To become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Yeah, that many --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Oh sure, yeah.</span> <span id="s982">My mother went to night school and she took -- she took courses and -- and she pa -- you know, I still remember the questions and all that.</span> <span id="s983">Yeah, I did -- it did mean a lot to me.</span> <span id="s984">But I also have -- people who grew up with that kind of sense and th-this unrequited love, if you will, for -- you know, and regret that I never went to -- didn’t go to zi -- I mean, I’ve been to Israel umpteen times and very close to my family there and all that.</span> <span id="s985">And I love America, I mean I -- you know, it goes without saying.</span> <span id="s986">I mean, I’m a patriot.</span> <span id="s987">I mean, I really consider myself a patriot and I -- and I find some of the stuff I read now in the paper, the -- th -- some developments intolerable, you know, when people kind of disparage the country, or -- you know.</span> <span id="s988">But as -- as a kid here, ye -- it -- you -- there are certain things that leave scars and they never go away.</span> <span id="s989">It’s like if I go to a doctor and get -- I -- I had, when I was a teenager, I had a -- a duodenal ulcer.</span> <span id="s990">Went away.</span> <span id="s991">It healed completely.</span> <span id="s992">If I go to a -- and they take an x-ray somebody will say, oh, there’s a scar there.</span> <span id="s993">The same with this.</span> <span id="s994">If you -- I -- I had -- there is a sense of homelessness one grows up with, with that kind of background, and it’s hard to fill that.</span> <span id="s995">And that’s no reflection on -- on America, which is -- gives a home to so many people.</span> <span id="s996">But if you’ve had that kind of background and -- and you’ve moved around a lot as a kid, that’s hard to fill that void.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mel Galun.</span> <span id="s999">This is tape number two, side B, and you were talking about sense of homelessness that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: -- people with your background would have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Did it stay with you all these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: It has stayed with me all these years and I would say that it’s -- it’s a special sensitivity, okay?</span> <span id="s1005">It’s like if you grow up -- and I think a lot of these things are foundational, I’m not saying anything profound, but it -- it’s simply that if you grow up with -- with a sense of rootedness when you’re young, that stays with you the rest of your life.</span> <span id="s1006">It doesn’t mean that when you’re traveling to a foreign country you don’t experience a certain discomfort at not knowing the language, oh -- but you -- it’s different.</span> <span id="s1007">If you have -- don’t grow up with that, and if you’ve missed it for the first 10 years of your life, it’s very hard to replace something like that, and it means you carry it with you into all sorts of situations.</span> <span id="s1008">It may take you a little bit longer to adjust to a particular thing, or may -- you know.</span> <span id="s1009">But you do carry it with you and it’s not that you can’t -- you know, we learn to articulate certain things and we become aware of them, but that doesn’t mean that they -- there aren’t certain predispositions that remain there.</span> <span id="s1010">And I think that -- that happens, and I -- and I know about it, bu -- you know, and -- and -- and also attempts I made to overcome it.</span> <span id="s1011">I -- I had a job for ORT, wonderful organization that did a lot for Jewish youngsters like me in the camps.</span> <span id="s1012">I remember ORT and I rem -- when I wa -- came for the interview with ORT, the m-man interviewing me, who was David Dubinsky’s son-in-law, Shelley Appleton, a wonderful man, and Shelley said -- asked me what I knew about ORT.</span> <span id="s1013">I said, I don’t know anything about your American organization, nothing whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1014">But I said, I do remember it.</span> <span id="s1015">I remember the ORT workshops from my childhood.</span> <span id="s1016">That impressed him.</span> <span id="s1017">So later on I had a job working for the international office of ORT and I traveled the world.</span> <span id="s1018">When I would travel to different countries, whether it was in South America, or di -- I would feel -- re-experience that sense of rootlessness that I’m telling you about, but in a more, I think in a more heightened sense of it than another person would.</span> <span id="s1019">And I felt that sense -- so we carry our sense of home in us.</span> <span id="s1020">And I think that it’s -- it’s hard to replace.</span> <span id="s1021">If y -- if y -- if you didn’t develop it by a certain a -- it’s hard to replace it and it does have -- leave an impact, cause that’s what I talked about, leaving a scar.</span> <span id="s1022">It’s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: You finished high school, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: I finished high school and -- in Brooklyn Talmudical Academy used to be called it’s -- Yeshiva University used to have two high schools, one in Manhattan, one in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1025">And then went on to Brooklyn College, majored in political science, and didn’t have a particularly distinguished academic career, and graduated in 1961.</span> <span id="s1026">And my mother asked me what I would like for a present upon graduation, and I said I wanted a trip to Israel.</span> <span id="s1027">And so my friend Gil, the one I was telling you about who lost both his parents in Auschwitz, he and I -- he had just lost his grandmother, he and I decided to go to Israel together.</span> <span id="s1028">And I decided, having a bit of a flair for the dramatic that I didn’t want to notify my relatives in Israel that I was coming.</span> <span id="s1029">And my mother said, my ga -- you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s1030">You can’t -- I mean, it’s a fi -- another country, it’s thousands of miles away and what if they’re not home, this and that.</span> <span id="s1031">I said look, we both speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1032">I speak Hebrew, he speaks French, we both speak English.</span> <span id="s1033">How can we get lost in Israel?</span> <span id="s1034">So we get to Israel and sure enough I go to my uncle’s house, nobody home.</span> <span id="s1035">And I -- but I had -- I won’t bore you with these stories, I had the most dramatic and memorable reunion with my family whom I had last seen when I was eight years old in DP camp.</span> <span id="s1036">And it was really wonderful.</span> <span id="s1037">So that -- that sort of brought things full circle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: You stayed there how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: I stayed in Israel at that time for, I would say, a little over two months.</span> <span id="s1040">Volunteered to go out and work in a kibbutz, waiting -- working in the cotton fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Which kibbutz?</span> <span id="s1042">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Gesher HaZiv.</span> <span id="s1044">It’s a beautiful kibbutz north of Nahariya, toward the Lebanese border.</span> <span id="s1045">Used to be known as an American kib -- an Anglo-Saxon kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1046">It was established actually by Americans from Habonim, and they used to host a lot of Americans who wanted to work there.</span> <span id="s1047">So I ju -- we just went up there, took the bus and walked in.</span> <span id="s1048">We didn't -- we weren’t on any organized program, we said, we want to work.</span> <span id="s1049">They said fine.</span> <span id="s1050">So we -- we had a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s1051">A lot of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Did you still have Betar leanings at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: I never joined amer -- that’s interesting, that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1054">I never joined American Betar.</span> <span id="s1055">The answer is yes, I still have Betar leanings to this very day.</span> <span id="s1056">And when I wound up working in the Jewish world, in nonprofit Jewish world, I actually was responding to a blind ad in -- in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s1057">And my boss, knowing of my right, and the sort of right of center Jewish leanings and wi -- he hi -- we were hosting, I remember, a visit by Ariel Sharon one time.</span> <span id="s1058">He said, I want you to take him around the campuses.</span> <span id="s1059">So I did.</span> <span id="s1060">That was one of my [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1061">I spent -- I spent almost a week with General Sharon and his wife.</span> <span id="s1062">Late wife.</span> <span id="s1063">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: So you spent the two months, came back to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: And then?</span> <span id="s1067">And that’s when you started working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Yeah, I -- well, I me -- I -- I -- I had a number of jobs before the Jewish world, but they were sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Temporary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: I taught for a couple of years.</span> <span id="s1071">I wa -- I was a sa -- a -- a -- a being -- in those days -- you should pardon the expression, we had an -- and -- a -- not a politically correct term to use, but we used to have what were known as liberal arts cripples.</span> <span id="s1072">I don’t know if you remember that term.</span> <span id="s1073">That meant that you graduated college with a major in some of the social sciences, history, political science, whatever, and then you said, what do I do now?</span> <span id="s1074">So people usually wound up teaching or, I don’t know, working for the welfare department at that time, whatever.</span> <span id="s1075">I just finished the -- the -- reading a very good book where the guy -- I’m reading this and I’m saying, gee, he had the same experience I did.</span> <span id="s1076">Except he was a lefty, he was -- he was a communist, actually car -- card carrying --</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: What did you major in -- in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: I majored in political science.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Oh, you said that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: So I did wind up teaching and during the f -- I don’t know if you remember, there’s a -- a watershed teachers’ strike in New York, Ocean Hill-Brownsville.</span> <span id="s1081">I was teaching in Bushwick section.</span> <span id="s1082">Joyce was teaching --</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Teaching high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Teaching -- I was teaching junior high school.</span> <span id="s1085">Joyce also.</span> <span id="s1086">Joyce was teaching in Bedford-Stuyvesant.</span> <span id="s1087">Both of us were very liberal, but liberal in the context of those days.</span> <span id="s1088">We actually moved into Ebbets Field apartments, which was built on the gravesite of Ebbets Field.</span> <span id="s1089">And it was an integrated development, you know, one-third Hispanic, one-third Jewish, one-third Black.</span> <span id="s1090">And we both taught in ghetto schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: When did you meet her and when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: I met Joyce in ’62 on a blind date and we married in ’63.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1094">And then after you finished teaching what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: So, I was coming to that.</span> <span id="s1096">There was a teachers’ strike.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Oh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: So suddenly she and I are both not working.</span> <span id="s1099">No income.</span> <span id="s1100">Ah.</span> <span id="s1101">You know, not -- you need to sustain yourself.</span> <span id="s1102">So I get a call one day from her late uncle.</span> <span id="s1103">The -- my friends used to call me SuperJew because Jewish affairs was always part of me, not just because of intim -- intellectual interest, it was in my gut.</span> <span id="s1104">So her uncle, who also -- her aunt and uncle were both teachers, so they were in the same position.</span> <span id="s1105">And he called up and he said, there’s an ad in the “New York Times” Sunday Times education section, you know, the week in review.</span> <span id="s1106">He said, it’s you.</span> <span id="s1107">So I applied for the ad.</span> <span id="s1108">It was to organize Jewish students in college campuses.</span> <span id="s1109">And I sent in my application and I got the job.</span> <span id="s1110">And that began -- that was one of the most fun jobs I’ve had.</span> <span id="s1111">Fascinating because a lot of my so-called kids are now 12 years younger, but friends of mine, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: What was the name of the organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: American Zionist Youth Foundation at the time.</span> <span id="s1114">I don’t think it’s around any more.</span> <span id="s1115">Did some important work.</span> <span id="s1116">And then I went to the Zionist organization of America as their national youth director and then from there to ORT.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: And it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: And what were your duties at ORT?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Basically my -- my -- I was in charge of their organization department.</span> <span id="s1121">So it meant doing essentially what -- what ha -- life comes full circle -- what I had been doing on the college campuses I was now doing internationally for ORT.</span> <span id="s1122">So that if they needed a new organization in Sao Paolo or somewhere, my boss would say, go in there and form a new committee or strengthen a committee and so on.</span> <span id="s1123">It was working with the volunteer dimension, cause ORT has two dimensions, there’s the -- the school system, the educational programs and there are the support organizations that -- volunteers that help to sustain the school system.</span> <span id="s1124">So my job was to deal with the volunteer organizations and help them function and to solve problems and what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Were there other -- many other refugees like you on staff at ORT who’ve had experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1127">My -- my former boss was in fact in the partisans.</span> <span id="s1128">And yo-you’ve heard of the partisans of Wilna.</span> <span id="s1129">And his -- his commander was Abo Kovner and Harmatz is his name.</span> <span id="s1130">Josef Harmatz.</span> <span id="s1131">So yeah, th-the -- but there were a few other --</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Did you feel a closer connection to people with that kind of background, that you have, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Not necessarily.</span> <span id="s1134">Sometimes.</span> <span id="s1135">Sometimes yes, sometimes no.</span> <span id="s1136">It really depended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: On personalities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: [indecipherable] on personality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: It really depended on personalities.</span> <span id="s1141">And in general -- I mean, look, I mean I -- I can’t say -- I was much affected by this stuff.</span> <span id="s1142">I’m very Jewish, I’m very -- but that doesn’t mean that I only eat, sleep and drink this kind of stuff 24 hours a day, you know, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Are you still with ORT now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: No, no, I’m -- I’m retired now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: But you stayed with ORT until you retired?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: I stayed with ORT til 90 -- think ’93, and then I spent a few years with Yeshiva University and then did working with the Sy Sims school of business, raising money for them, and then worked as an independent consultant running campaigns, fundraising campaigns for either endowment or building campaign, you know, capital campaigns.</span> <span id="s1147">And then went to B’nai Brith for a stretch.</span> <span id="s1148">That’s -- that’s what brought me to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: That’s [indecipherable] And you came to Washington what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: ’98.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: It be -- close to ’99.</span> <span id="s1153">It was actually the end of 1998.</span> <span id="s1154">Great town, I like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Can we talk a little about some general issues --</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: -- at the moment.</span> <span id="s1158">Do you think it was an advantage that you were so young at the time that you really weren't aware of the danger of what your mother was going through?</span> <span id="s1159">Was it an advantage being young instead of being a lit -- a bit older and maybe knowing more of what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s1161">It’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1162">I think I suppose so, I -- I -- on -- on balance.</span> <span id="s1163">Not everybody had that advantage, I mean they had -- there’s also a disadvantage of being young.</span> <span id="s1164">I mean, y-you just reminded me of a very painful memory or story that I -- my Uncle Herschel -- I told you my mother had two brothers who went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1165">The one with the two daughters, who always regretted he didn’t have a son, but he did have a son.</span> <span id="s1166">And they had a child and -- who was abandoned in -- in the forest.</span> <span id="s1167">Anyway, so th-there are i -- you know, the same pain is experienced somewhat differently by children and by adults.</span> <span id="s1168">So yes, to answer your question, there are advantages, but there are also disadvantages.</span> <span id="s1169">And the -- the ability of an adult to articulate or to do certain things, an-and certain actions that an adult can take that a child can’t, are -- you know.</span> <span id="s1170">But the advantages are also burdens.</span> <span id="s1171">And I remember feeling as a child, one of the things I remember, the burden that a child feels, especially when you’re a certain age, not -- not when you’re very little, but when you’re older, when you’re like eight, nine or so and you’re already developing a little bit of a sense of yo -- of yourself is being very, very much upset about this sense of impotence and weakness.</span> <span id="s1172">An-And I felt it both as -- as a child, knowing what -- you know, feeling all the resentment, feeling all the -- you know, the anger, and not being able to do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: A-And that’s something that -- it -- it’s very hard to relate to unless I -- this is where I sometimes tal -- when I talk to my friend Gil, the one I was telling you about, he and I can both relate to that, we don’t have -- you know, we know what we’re talking about.</span> <span id="s1175">It’s not just an intellectual abstraction for us, it’s an experience, and it’s very tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: So, y-you know -- and I -- and I understand survivors.</span> <span id="s1178">I’m not talking i -- you know, there are lots of reason why y-you know, I’ve never spoken about it, even with my own kids.</span> <span id="s1179">Some of them are not necessarily -- s-some is -- is that it’s very painful to talk about this stuff.</span> <span id="s1180">So it’s easier just to block things off and to kind of -- I think one of the great things, and I say this, that in what you’re doing, and what the museum -- I mean, I remember when I worked in the American Zionist Youth Foundation, when one of the first exhibits came around.</span> <span id="s1181">This was actually like a precursor of the museum in a sense, that was sent to -- we were sent, because I was working with colleges, with campuses, we were organizing a tour for this exhibit.</span> <span id="s1182">And was a pri -- it was -- who was involved in it?</span> <span id="s1183">God.</span> <span id="s1184">Eli Zborowski, I don’t know if you know Eli.</span> <span id="s1185">Eli Zborowski is -- has been for many years the chairman of Yad Vashem, or American Friends of Yad Vashem, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: [indecipherable] Zborowski, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: He is -- was the owner of Schaeffer pen or something.</span> <span id="s1188">I remember him, he’s a well-to-do man who’s done a lot of stuff to create this awareness and all.</span> <span id="s1189">And I appreciate what people have done with that.</span> <span id="s1190">I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1191">I really appreciate what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: You couldn’t do it because of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: I -- I find it too painful to deal with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1196">My friend Gil went to one of the i -- gone -- when we went to Israel, ’60 w -- ’61 - ’62 and then he said I’m going to do research and write about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1197">He’s a sociologist.</span> <span id="s1198">Great.</span> <span id="s1199">He went to the Hebrew University or wherever, I mean, he started to look through the stacks, couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1200">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: So you know, you appreci -- but there are different people, you know, there are people who can do it.</span> <span id="s1203">My old boss Harmatz at ORT that I’m telling you about, one day I put on “Nightline.”</span> <span id="s1204">Remember “Nightline” with what -- what’s his name, I forget his name already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Ted Koppel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Ted Koppel, thank you.</span> <span id="s1207">So you can say Howdy Doody.</span> <span id="s1208">But Ted Koppel suddenly says, and I have here Mr. Josef Harmatz.</span> <span id="s1209">He was doing a program and I said, it’s Yosul, what’s he doing here, on Ted Koppel?</span> <span id="s1210">Ted Koppel did a program.</span> <span id="s1211">After the war there were a bunch of Jews who wanted to go and kill ex-Nazis.</span> <span id="s1212">Koppel did a program on it on “Nightline.”</span> <span id="s1213">And Harmatz was one of those.</span> <span id="s1214">So, you know, I’m saying there were all sorts of people.</span> <span id="s1215">But of course he’s older than I am so he would have been probably in his late teens by then.</span> <span id="s1216">When you’re a kid of eight or nine, or five or six, you f -- you’re aware already of what’s going on around you, and what wa -- what happened, and you heard the stories, but you feel a utter sense of helplessness.</span> <span id="s1217">You feel your -- you feel, really feel a sense of victimhood.</span> <span id="s1218">I had to talk to kids here at the Jewish Day School a few years ago.</span> <span id="s1219">My friend [indecipherable] finagles me always at -- and she said, can you talk to the kids about, you know, your experience?</span> <span id="s1220">I said sure, okay, I’ll do it.</span> <span id="s1221">I tried to get the kids to understand.</span> <span id="s1222">I said, I’m not a hero.</span> <span id="s1223">Cause the kids a -- I -- I’m not a hero.</span> <span id="s1224">I’m not being falsely modest, I’m really not a hero.</span> <span id="s1225">I’m a victim.</span> <span id="s1226">There’s a difference, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Let’s -- with some of the things that you’ve just been saying, do you feel that you would be a different adult today if you had not gone through what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Oh, un -- unquestionably, yeah, no doubt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: I mean, I don’t know, I mean I can tell you wha -- in one way is that I would probably be less cosmopolitan in a certain way.</span> <span id="s1231">There’s a certain, you know, knowledge of the world, that you may not have gone about it through positive experience, but that’s what happens.</span> <span id="s1232">You’ve been around, you’ve been wandering around and so that brings a certain familiarity with things that other people didn’t grow up with.</span> <span id="s1233">I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1234">I mean, I don’t know if any -- I can ar-articulate it more.</span> <span id="s1235">I think that the -- all you can do is, in a certain sense is that the suffering makes you able to, if y -- there’s a big if in between, is you -- you can teach others, perhaps, sometimes about it.</span> <span id="s1236">But to do that you have to be able to open up and in a lot of -- a l -- a lot of us can’t, u-unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1237">That’s just the fact.</span> <span id="s1238">It’s hard.</span> <span id="s1239">But I’ve also learned as I got older, not to -- not to be too self confident in my hunches sometimes.</span> <span id="s1240">You know, I would think that when I was growing up that these kids who grew up here and had it -- you know, had stable home life, they had it better and all.</span> <span id="s1241">Well, not necessarily.</span> <span id="s1242">In certain ways they did, in some ways they didn’t, I mean it’s -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Did you identify -- because you had mentioned about difficulties of others, did you identify or be active in the Civil Rights Movement in the 60’s and 70’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: I wasn’t particularly active, but that’s not because I -- I didn’t support it, I did support it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: But I -- in -- it -- only because I wasn’t an activist in that sense.</span> <span id="s1247">When I think that our need to -- we both -- we were both liberal -- a liberal couple, Joyce and I.</span> <span id="s1248">But old liberals change.</span> <span id="s1249">I mean I -- I did more.</span> <span id="s1250">I mean, I -- I sort of became more closer to a NeoCon than -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1251">But I -- I wasn’t active and that’s not because necessarily an -- an ideological reflection as -- so much as I -- I just -- inertia, in a sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: You -- do you -- do you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Yeah, couple of kids.</span> <span id="s1254">One living in Arlington, single, Josh.</span> <span id="s1255">And Julie is living in Malvern, Pennsylvania, married with two redheaded boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: When the children --</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: One is there.</span> <span id="s1258">The other one, I don’t know if you can see him there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1260">When the children were little --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: -- and -- and were the age that you were up to the -- did that bring back memories of your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Of my own childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: When they were that little [indecipherable] the first part of your life.</span> <span id="s1265">Let’s say the first 10 - 11 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Si -- I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1267">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: But you did say you had a greater appreciation of what your mother did for you, wha -- I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Well o-of -- yeah, of what she did and -- and of -- but more so of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Once you became the parent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: -- of the difficulties and of -- yeah, that she faced.</span> <span id="s1272">And that it’s not as simple as all that.</span> <span id="s1273">You know, when you’re growing up and you’re relating to somebody as a child and you know, you -- you’re -- you’re having fights or you’re having -- you know, th -- it -- it -- it’s different, I mean, you get older and you say gee, I’m now -- you know, the first time it hits you -- I -- yeah, I remember the first time it hit me that I had outlived my father.</span> <span id="s1274">I have to think of my father as a -- as a kid.</span> <span id="s1275">But I think that -- no, it’s appreciating the difficulty and -- and -- and that, you know, yo-young people are -- think they know it all, and I thought I knew it all, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: When your mother remarried did she have more children with your stepfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: So you’re still the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: -- only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: And I -- one of the things I regretted was not having been able to get closer to my stepfather.</span> <span id="s1284">He died very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: He died at the age of 49 of a heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: And I liked him, but my mother overshadowed him, she was too tough for him in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Did she ever remarry again, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: No, she didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: No.</span> <span id="s1293">She remained widowed after that.</span> <span id="s1294">See, she was twice widowed after relatively short periods of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Melvin Galun.</span> <span id="s1298">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1299">What are your thoughts about Germany today?</span> <span id="s1300">Or in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: I -- t-today I -- you know, I -- we haven’t been -- we have not -- I have not been back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: You have not been back since --</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: I have not been back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Since the DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Since the DP camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Because?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Well, I was going to say in-initially there was a barrier, there was a real barrier there, but by now it’s no -- I would go back, it’s not like I am boycotting, I would go back today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: When you say there was a barrier, you mean a psychological barrier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Yeah, a psychological barrier.</span> <span id="s1310">I really didn’t like the Germans.</span> <span id="s1311">That’s to put it mildly.</span> <span id="s1312">Joyce when I met her had a German pen-pal and it became an issue, became like a -- a -- an irritant in our relationship.</span> <span id="s1313">And that pen-pal’s sister came to visit, and we invited her to our apartment.</span> <span id="s1314">This -- way back when we were young.</span> <span id="s1315">And I said, look, I can -- I can deal with individuals and I judge them as individuals, but if you ask me how do I feel about Germany, I still had, you know.</span> <span id="s1316">And -- and I don’t say that I’ve even overcome it, except it’s many years thereafter, I’m aware of what Germany means and what it -- its government is like and what its relationship with Israel is all about.</span> <span id="s1317">So, you know.</span> <span id="s1318">Have I come to terms with what the Germans did to the Jews?</span> <span id="s1319">Absolutely not, I will never come to terms with that.</span> <span id="s1320">But you know, do I think that Germany has been at the forefront of countries that have really tried to come to grips with its history and with this issue?</span> <span id="s1321">Yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1322">I have to acknowledge that.</span> <span id="s1323">And I d -- and I -- and I don’t want to give vent, sometimes, you know, we all deal with periods of paranoia and you know.</span> <span id="s1324">I think the Germans have tried in -- in all sorts of ways to come to terms -- even in their relationship with Israel.</span> <span id="s1325">I was just reading a wonderful piece about that, how they, you know, some can feel a real sense of responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Do you speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: I don’t speak German, but I can, because of my knowledge of Yiddish, I can read sometimes some stuff in German and make some sense out of it.</span> <span id="s1330">And it’s a language that I probably -- well, I was toying with the idea of maybe learning it.</span> <span id="s1331">But its grammar is too complex and kind of -- I find grammar can be -- I -- I have a -- a -- a -- an ear for languages, and -- and I -- my pronunciation is usually very good, but I can’t stand grammar.</span> <span id="s1332">And the German grammar is too complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1334">And in the DP camps it was Yiddish and Hebrew that you sp --</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: In DP camps it was Yiddish and Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Yiddish and Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: My mother spoke --</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Even though they were in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: -- my mother spoke German because she would --</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: -- go into town and you know, conduct whatever affairs she wanted to.</span> <span id="s1342">So it happened, people picked it up, but I -- you could read -- when you were in the camp, you were really in a -- a self contained community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: What were your reactions dur -- during the Eichmann trial?</span> <span id="s1344">Do you have memories of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: A sense of pride in the people who had abducted him.</span> <span id="s1346">I followed the trial like everybody did, almost daily on television.</span> <span id="s1347">I felt -- y-you know I feel -- listen, we felt -- I felt a sense of the historical justice, but I -- you know, did it mean that it evened the score?</span> <span id="s1348">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1349">It was -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1350">I don’t know if I have any -- any thoughts beyond that.</span> <span id="s1351">I’m a great -- I -- even at that time there was controversy about did Israel conform to international law, was it the right thing to abduct somebody and all that.</span> <span id="s1352">I’m a great believer, unapologetic, in Jewish power, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1353">So I was very -- that was ma -- the overriding thing was it’s about time that we did this.</span> <span id="s1354">I’m glad Israel executed him.</span> <span id="s1355">I’m glad he is the only one that Israel ever executed in its history.</span> <span id="s1356">Israel has no capital punishment.</span> <span id="s1357">But we -- we have -- I mean, I -- we’re [indecipherable] we have a sense of loss, which is -- is there, it can’t be -- you know, even -- even a state of Israel, let’s say, cannot even out the score for the loss we experienced.</span> <span id="s1358">That’s just the way it is.</span> <span id="s1359">It’s a great gain, but it doesn’t -- and this is something else.</span> <span id="s1360">The loss that we suffered was not just in people, it was on history.</span> <span id="s1361">I was talking to my cousin Menachem who just died this year and my aunt, my mother’s sister is still alive.</span> <span id="s1362">So she’s approaching her 90’s, but Menachem, unfortunately was very ill and died in his 70’s.</span> <span id="s1363">My aunt, however, has dementia so I can’t ask her anything and I’m -- and we don’t have a family so I was on the phone with my cousin Menachem’s daughter, who is now 50.</span> <span id="s1364">And of course she wants to know her history.</span> <span id="s1365">I said, we gotta do a family tree.</span> <span id="s1366">But now it means filling in gaps, you know.</span> <span id="s1367">So we lost that historical thread.</span> <span id="s1368">That’s why I do appreciate the kind of work you’re doing here and what, you know, what everybody does.</span> <span id="s1369">It’s -- it’s fabulous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Have you been to -- back to Poland or Ukraine -- the Ukraine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: I want to go.</span> <span id="s1372">I e -- I have -- no, the answer is no, I haven’t been back.</span> <span id="s1373">I’ve toyed with that idea, I want to do it.</span> <span id="s1374">In fact, I spoke to Mishelin about doing this.</span> <span id="s1375">I did a lot of traveling but never got to eastern Europe or even -- or to central Europe.</span> <span id="s1376">I’ve -- I’ve thought about it, I -- and -- and I know people who did, who -- who went back to -- to the town where I was born, to Kowal.</span> <span id="s1377">And today you can, you know, go on Google Earth and you -- it’s amazing what you can do.</span> <span id="s1378">But I -- I have mixed feelings about that too, I really do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: In what sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: Yeah, I don’t know what I’m looking for.</span> <span id="s1381">You know, I don’t know why I would want to go back.</span> <span id="s1382">There are lots of places on earth which I enjoyed traveling to.</span> <span id="s1383">I mean, I enjoyed ga -- a few years ago going to Peru, or to Mexico or something.</span> <span id="s1384">So why am I going there?</span> <span id="s1385">What am I going to find there?</span> <span id="s1386">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1387">I am interested, I mean in -- in one respect, I do want to do something about filling in the gaps in my own family history, just so -- so my kids and my grandkids will know.</span> <span id="s1388">And it’s something we all fall prey to, I have a -- a vanity book that I have downstairs that it was given to me by a man who was -- when Reagan was president [indecipherable] very wealthy man from a s -- Iraqi Jewish banking family.</span> <span id="s1389">I mean a billionaire.</span> <span id="s1390">And he gave me a signed copy of his book, and he said it’s a history of his family.</span> <span id="s1391">I said why’d you do it?</span> <span id="s1392">And of course he, you know, he hired somebody to write it for him.</span> <span id="s1393">He said, because I want my children and grandchildren to know where they were coming from.</span> <span id="s1394">So I said wow, this guy’s a billionaire, if he -- he -- but he also delayed.</span> <span id="s1395">It happens to all of us, you know, so I feel I delayed, I mean, I should have started this process and -- and -- and your call was important in that, it really was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Are you -- d-do you consider yourself religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1398">Yes, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Because -- I-I’m -- not because of your education at let’s say Yeshiva High School and so forth, but because of what you went through?</span> <span id="s1400">What are your thoughts in that general --</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: It’s an amalgam of things.</span> <span id="s1402">It was partly my mother’s influence.</span> <span id="s1403">My mother’s influence is very important because quite frankly, it was important in my Zionist beliefs.</span> <span id="s1404">It was important in my religious -- in my grandmother’s.</span> <span id="s1405">I sh -- I should say my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1406">And in some way -- and when I think about it sometimes I say I -- because I became ultimately, after winding -- I -- I -- my first half of my career or first third if you will, was in youth work, organizing people in college campuses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: College.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Leon Wieseltier of the “New Republic” was my campus rep, to give you an idea.</span> <span id="s1409">I had a good -- the one talent I think I had was sizing people up.</span> <span id="s1410">My mother was interested in a business career for me.</span> <span id="s1411">My grandmother, Yiddishkeit, so I combined the two of them, became a Jewish fundraiser.</span> <span id="s1412">I said, this is like.</span> <span id="s1413">My religion, I would say was transi -- a religious sensitivity, if you will, was transmitted by these two women, but also by the Yeshiva, and by some of the teachers I had in Yeshiva, more importantly.</span> <span id="s1414">The -- the -- my mother’s and grandmother’s may have been tinged a bit with superstition, which also comes from that part of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1415">I -- I’ve always -- I’ve -- one of my good buddies who is also one of my former kids, ise -- I -- in quotation marks.</span> <span id="s1416">I just -- he’s a very successful lawyer in New York whom we just had dinner with.</span> <span id="s1417">And he and I would always argue cause his grandfather was very important to him, his -- his grandfather was from Lithuania though, so they were the midnagdin.</span> <span id="s1418">I came from there, I said Ukraine was the birthplace of Hasidism, right?</span> <span id="s1419">There’s always a little bit of -- you know, Hasidim are emotional and the others are rational and intellectual.</span> <span id="s1420">I got the emotional part from my mother and grandmother and if you will, the rational part from some of my rabbis.</span> <span id="s1421">I am religious.</span> <span id="s1422">Was I -- but I was also angry at God.</span> <span id="s1423">And I had this discussion with my oldest and best friend Gil, cause he’ll always say -- we’ll have conversa -- I -- I have used reference points from Genesis and from different books of the Bible, and he’ll say how come you remember this stuff?</span> <span id="s1424">I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s1425">And he says -- he always said he was a non-believer.</span> <span id="s1426">And I said to him once, because he was talking wi -- full of anger at God, I said, are you sure you don’t believe?</span> <span id="s1427">Because if you’re angry at God, presupposes that you believe.</span> <span id="s1428">So I was angry at God.</span> <span id="s1429">No doubt about it, and still am from time to time.</span> <span id="s1430">But that doesn’t preclude the fact, quite the opposite, it affirms it.</span> <span id="s1431">And -- and th -- th -- I had -- one privilege I had and I -- I told you I had great experience working in -- in -- and when I was working as a college -- I was really a field organizer.</span> <span id="s1432">I took around some wonderful people.</span> <span id="s1433">I’d come back all excited at the end of the day.</span> <span id="s1434">So one of the guys I took around was Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, I don’t know if you know -- familiar with him.</span> <span id="s1435">And I -- this is many years, it was probably his first trip to America.</span> <span id="s1436">And they said, take him around to Jewish Day Schools or whatever.</span> <span id="s1437">And I came back and I told Joyce, I said, [indecipherable] this blew my mind, you know?</span> <span id="s1438">And I only dealt with bright peop -- they’re all bright, you know what I mean, th -- you know.</span> <span id="s1439">So I said, but he -- he -- I still remember what he said.</span> <span id="s1440">He said, I would rather, when I’m working with students, I’d rather work with somebody who is angry at God than somebody who is indifferent to God.</span> <span id="s1441">Because if he says he -- if he’s angry, he cares, and I can turn that around.</span> <span id="s1442">If he’s indifferent it’s much tougher.</span> <span id="s1443">So in that sense, yeah, I mean I felt myself like a lot of other Jewish people and kids especially, felt myself victimized, then abandoned and all of that.</span> <span id="s1444">On the other hand, you know, go -- ge -- God can be the source of your anger, in a sense, or the object of your anger, but can also be a sense of your regeneration of spirit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Did your children ask you about your childhood when they were younger?</span> <span id="s1446">And did y -- and if so, did you tell them about it, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: I’ve told them s -- y-yes, I have told them certainly, I mean, it’s not like I’ve tried to a -- that I’ve tried to withhold things from them, no.</span> <span id="s1448">And -- but it was kind of as an aside if you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s1449">I -- I would tell them things, if it came up or if it was you know, but I -- I -- I wish I had done more.</span> <span id="s1450">But I did tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: When you say wish you had done more, in what sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: I -- I guess I’m -- I wish I had undertaken a more structured way, ongoing way to educate them about the family, the history and all that.</span> <span id="s1453">But, I mean, it -- it’s not as though I went from one extreme to another, I mean, they had something, you know, they -- they -- they -- they certainly know.</span> <span id="s1454">They went to Israel with us a few times, they knew the family.</span> <span id="s1455">I would very much like to reconne -- it’s hard to maintain a -- even your all -- it’s easier today with email to maintain certain things, you know, but -- but still, to maintain a relationship geographically distanced is -- is tough.</span> <span id="s1456">But I would like them to maintain a connection to -- yeah, to the Jewish people, to their family and hopefully to a sense of, you know, belief.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Have you been to the Holocaust Museum in Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: And what di -- when you walk inside the building --</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: I’ve --</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: -- did you have certain feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: -- been there a few times.</span> <span id="s1463">Do I have a certain feeling?</span> <span id="s1464">Yeah, I mean, I have lots of feelings.</span> <span id="s1465">I -- I -- once we went -- God, I’m trying to remember the first time.</span> <span id="s1466">Once we went with [indecipherable] because they -- there was something there that’s dedicated to the stepmother of one of our friends, this lawyer I was telling you about, his wife’s stepmother was one of the Righteous who saved -- and is mentioned in one of the exhibits in -- in the museum.</span> <span id="s1467">I think it’s a great place.</span> <span id="s1468">I think it’s a -- how can I put it?</span> <span id="s1469">I haven’t been to the new Yad Vashem, which I’m told is fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1471">Do you think it’s appropriate that the Holocaust Museum is in Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Oh, that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1473">That’s a very good question.</span> <span id="s1474">I’m glad it is.</span> <span id="s1475">Do I think -- but I don’t know about appropriateness, I mean in terms of would another place be more appropriate, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1476">I don’t know, but I think it’s a great museum, it’s a great institution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: I’m just saying when it first went up, some people said, you know, it didn’t happen here, it happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: -- far away.</span> <span id="s1480">Why do we have the museum here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Well, I mean, I can speculate, or let’s say -- I mean, I’m sure I -- I don’t remember reading the -- the arguments, but America is the locus and we’ve got three -- well two actually, two and a half if you will, great Jewish communities, each of which numbers about six million nowadays, ironically, Israel and the United States, although we’re always at 5.8 or whatever, we’re all -- we’ve been at that number for -- since I arrived in this country.</span> <span id="s1482">So I suppose in that sense it -- it -- there is some sense, since we have large survivor communities, that this is a Jewish -- this, if you will, it’s a -- you know, you have Jerusalem and you had Babylon -- th-the -- the Babylon Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1483">So we’re in the place of bab -- we’re -- we’re two great Jewish communi -- Russia -- Russia still has a large Jewish community but it’s much smaller, it’s about two -- two point five million, maybe.</span> <span id="s1484">These are two great Jewish communities, so it’s thoroughly fitting that there should be a serious Holocaust institution in the United States, thoroughly appropriate.</span> <span id="s1485">Is it -- it -- and -- and in Israel.</span> <span id="s1486">Can I see it in another city in America?</span> <span id="s1487">Yeah, could be in New York.</span> <span id="s1488">New York has the Museum of the Jewish Herit -- which is nice in its own way, it’s a different kind of institution.</span> <span id="s1489">But I think it’s a great museum and it does everybody proud, inclu -- including the government, including, you know, the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Do you think that the commun -- the world community has learned from the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1491">Do you think it’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: God, you -- I -- I get very cynical some days because I spend too much time reading articles on the internet, but has the world learned?</span> <span id="s1493">It has, but it’s also unlearned.</span> <span id="s1494">The answer is yes to both.</span> <span id="s1495">It has unlearned and has learned.</span> <span id="s1496">And that’s the sad part and it means that great challenges still confront us.</span> <span id="s1497">They’re -- all one has to do is look at the daily news.</span> <span id="s1498">Lo-Look at -- I mean, it’s not just us.</span> <span id="s1499">And y -- holocausts have been visited in Rwanda and in Darfur and in -- you know.</span> <span id="s1500">Maybe smaller scale, but big enough.</span> <span id="s1501">So yeah, th-th-the lessons haven’t been fully learned, no question about it.</span> <span id="s1502">I mean, how can you countenance what a guy like Ahmadinejad says?</span> <span id="s1503">And then he gets feted at the U.N. and then he gets invited to Columbia?</span> <span id="s1504">I mean, come on, you know?</span> <span id="s1505">But people don’t realize this is a crazy world.</span> <span id="s1506">Hitler was on the -- on -- on a list to be -- people recommended he get the peace prize back when, you know.</span> <span id="s1507">So what makes us think that we are different, that we, you know, we’ve outsmarted everybody.</span> <span id="s1508">I mean I -- I don’t want to get totally cynical.</span> <span id="s1509">Yes, we do learn, but we also unlearn lessons and we forget.</span> <span id="s1510">And a new -- and this is th -- it’s the same thing, I was just talking to somebody sitting next to me -- oh, that Bat Mitzvah we went to in New York.</span> <span id="s1511">Wonderful guy.</span> <span id="s1512">He said yeah, he was [indecipherable] talking about the exodus story and th-the -- a new pharaoh arose in Egypt who didn't know Joseph.</span> <span id="s1513">It’s a new ballgame.</span> <span id="s1514">So -- and I think we’re living through a particularly delicate time, but I don’t want to get into politics, cause I know that’s not your purpose here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Well, is there anything you would like to add, or that we haven’t covered that you would like --</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Well, I’m sure I’m gonna think of a lot of things after you leave, but I c -- I can’t -- you know.</span> <span id="s1517">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Any message to your grandchildren that you’d like to leave?</span> <span id="s1519">Anything you’d like to say to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1521">I think that what I’d like to sta -- say to them is to stay strong and it’s t -- it’s two things, actually, re-remember, it says that at the end, when you finish the Bible, it says, Chazak ve amatz.</span> <span id="s1522">And the other is, you gotta believe.</span> <span id="s1523">You gotta believe.</span> <span id="s1524">And I don’t -- I don’t care whether it’s in a secular sense or in a religious sense.</span> <span id="s1525">People see that -- that kind of dichotomy.</span> <span id="s1526">I said, even if you believe in a secular context, you also gotta believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Believe in -- in a secular context in what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Believe in the integrity of an idea, that in -- i-in -- in essence -- I mean, I don’t want to get too deep.</span> <span id="s1529">In the -- in -- in the Hebrew language there is really no word that is the equivalent of religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: It’s belief.</span> <span id="s1532">And you know -- anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Well, thank you very much --</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: -- for doing
