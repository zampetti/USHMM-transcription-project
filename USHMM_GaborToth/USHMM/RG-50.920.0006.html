(Hap) Chandler</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Transcriber: Stephanie McKinnell NOTE: Place names and proper nouns not completely checked for spellings.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Interviewer: Doctor, you’re from Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Morton Waitzman: Right, yes, Chicago, Illinois.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Int: … drafted or did you enlist in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">MW: I did both actually.</span> <span id="s8">I found out I was about to be drafted, and I was a hurry so I went down to the draft board and I said go ahead and take me now, which they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Int: Where did you go for induction?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">MW: I went for induction to actually Camp Grant, IL, and then went from there for training to Camp Crowder, Missouri.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Int: You went through basic training at Camp Crowder?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">MW: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Int: Was it infantry basic or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">MW: It was really a communications and infantry basic.</span> <span id="s15">Basic training I think in those days was about the same every place.</span> <span id="s16">You’d have six weeks of intensive basic infantry training and then you went into specialty training and ________________ combat communications training.</span> <span id="s17">_______ well from Camp Crowder, I was given a few options.</span> <span id="s18">I was told if I wanted to go, this was maybe July or August of 1943, I was, I first went into service of January 1943, January 2, and I was given the option after a while to go to St. Louis to go to officer training school, officers candidate school in engineering.</span> <span id="s19">I didn’t want to be an engineer so I was given the option of electing out of that and finish my training at Camp Crowder and __________</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Int: … communications?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">MW: Communications and combat infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Int: _______ communications, after your training, what did you do in communications?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">MW: Well, I was trained eventually to become what’s called a 7/7/7 fixed station radio operator.</span> <span id="s24">I was a, using Morse code, high speed Morse code, fixed station rates of speed which require that I type the coded message and be able to send and receive five unrelated letter groups of message and receive the same thing.</span> <span id="s25">And it involved also some knowledge of French, at that time I had some knowledge of French.</span> <span id="s26">I was training, being in touch possibly with somebody in the French language.</span> <span id="s27">So my fixed station radio operation was at the highest level of Morse code training.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Int: In retrospect, do you remember any of your instructors?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">MW: No, I don’t remember names, I really don’t.</span> <span id="s30">I remember a gentleman who was to become my commanding officer in England, but he’s one of the few that I do remember.</span> <span id="s31">But I didn’t stay with him because I went on to the 29th infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Int: 29th infantry was blue and grey?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">MW: Blue and gray, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Int: Famous outfit.</span> <span id="s35">When did you join the 29th?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">MW: Well, that’s kind of a long story.</span> <span id="s37">I was in training in England.</span> <span id="s38">Actually I arrived in England in November of 1944 after almost a year of training in the states and was immediately, after zigzagging across the Atlantic ocean for 14 days, winding up in England and being stationed in a place called Kilminster, England where I continued the training at Kilminster for combat communications.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Int: At some point in time, you crossed the Channel to get over to _____?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">MW: At some point in time, it was actually not on D-Day because there was some question about whether or not we would be paratrooped into the, before D-Day so we could join the French underground.</span> <span id="s41">I was fairly fluent in French and I knew the Morse code, and I was in touch with the French, FFI, Force François Interior and also intercepting German radio.</span> <span id="s42">And it was decided as we got into our jump training some place in the midlands in England, I forget exactly where, that we would instead be stationed in London, England to continue that communication with the French underground and intercepting German radio.</span> <span id="s43">We did that in London.</span> <span id="s44">We got there about the same time the German V-1 bombs were launched into England, the pilotless bombs that were launched from Germany into London to do nothing but kill, destroy, and terrorize the population.</span> <span id="s45">I was there until slightly after June, slightly after D-Day because when they aborted our jumping before D-Day, we were instead held back for a short time in London before we, then we proceeded to get on the ships and board and land in Omaha Beach ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Int: You actually were trained to go behind the lines?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">MW: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Int: ‘Course the invasion moved so rapidly that we lost the…</span></p> <p><span id="s49">MW: Yeah, we didn’t know when D-Day was going to be.</span> <span id="s50">And none of my close associates obviously knew, but when, the higher up people knew when it was going to be, they knew that we had to abort our mission and then come at a slightly delayed time.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Int: So you had a change of mission?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">MW: Change of mission.</span> <span id="s53">But while in London, when we first got there, the very first of those V-1 bombs that were launched landed on the day that I arrived in London, so it was a very, a very noisy greeting for us when we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Int: Do you remember the day specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">MW: I can only guess.</span> <span id="s56">It was about, the day’s probably on the record, but about mid June, somewhere toward the mid-June, just after D-Day of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Int: ________ broke all the windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">MW: Yeah, they were to be followed by the V-2 supersonic.</span> <span id="s59">The V-1’s were the subsonic, V-1’s, and then V-2’s were supersonic pilotless bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Int: They had a peculiar sound of the engine, it cut out.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">MW: When they cut out, we were very familiar with that.</span> <span id="s62">They were the buzz bombs and you learned very rapidly if the buzzing stopped over your head, you were safe, because by the speed of sound they had to go somewhere beyond your line, or beyond your position.</span> <span id="s63">Well we weren’t allowed to go into the shelters anyway.</span> <span id="s64">We had to hold into our positions and communications in these buildings where we were stationed.</span> <span id="s65">I have a picture of me there someplace, I don’t know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Int: V-2 you had no warning.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">MW: V-2, there was no warning in either case, but that was a lot faster.</span> <span id="s68">I remember the pictures in Hyde park just a few days after they landed, of a British Spitfire chasing one of these V-1 bombs and getting them away from the population and shooting many of them down.</span> <span id="s69">Too many landed unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Int: The fighter pilots tried to get behind these buzz bombs and shoot them down, but they would have to fly through the explosion, then that could be fatal.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">MW: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Int: What they would do, you know, they would get gyro-stabilized and they would fly alongside and simply tip the wing, in which case the buzz bomb would crash.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">MW: I never saw that, yes, I could see why.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Int: I was a north of London in those days, and we were in buzz-bomb alley, I remember well.</span> <span id="s75">And the first V-2 that came over, we had no idea what it was, but it left a big hole in the ground.</span> <span id="s76">We thought it was a plane crash.</span> <span id="s77">Well, and you were in London for a period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">MW: Yes, for a short period of time, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Int: When did you cross the Channel?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">MW: These dates are a little bit blurry to me.</span> <span id="s81">It was some time shortly after D-Day that we got on our mission to board the ships going across the Channel and landing at Omaha Beach, the same beach that the 29th infantry had landed on, and particularly the 115th Infantry regiment and the Big Red One and so many other American units.</span> <span id="s82">And we climbed down the rope ladders of these ships and out to the LCI, the infantry landing craft, and landed on the beaches at Omaha Beach and eventually joined the 29th Infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Int: What was your job at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">MW: Well, that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s85">Because my job getting off that ship was the biggest job I had to do in terms of surviving because as a communications man, I had a radio strapped to my back, and SCR 300, a rifle, bandoliers of hand grenades, and all the other requisite materials of an infantryman, except I also carried communications material.</span> <span id="s86">So climbing down the rope ladder of that ship was the most difficult feat I might have had.</span> <span id="s87">So we got into the infantry landing craft and, the bouncing little ship, and finally landed us as close to the beach as they could.</span> <span id="s88">And we waded back onto the shore.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Int: Were you a communications specialist when you landed on Omaha?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">MW: Yes I was, I was.</span> <span id="s91">I was communications specialist all the way through.</span> <span id="s92">And for that reason I was eventually assigned to the 115th Infantry regiment, the headquarters company, 2nd battalion as communications person.</span> <span id="s93">I would either do radio or code communication or voice communication using my SCR 300, or I would lay wire.</span> <span id="s94">I had to lay wire sometimes between front machine gun positions.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Int: You also had a rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">MW: I was also an infantryman, so I had a rifle that I had to use whenever I had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Int: And uh, you were in combat at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">MW: Yes, shortly after getting on the beach, yes, we were in combat.</span> <span id="s99">We were in combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Int: And I suppose you had some casualties.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">MW: There were many casualties.</span> <span id="s102">Especially on D-Day itself, I was not there on D-Day itself.</span> <span id="s103">Our main casualties were at D-Day, course there were marked number of casualties after that.</span> <span id="s104">but D-Day was the most frustrating of all.</span> <span id="s105">And I’ve had comrades whom I communicate with even to this day, some who never saw the war beyond D-Day because he was so badly injured.</span> <span id="s106">And others who, with whom I joined later on in the war in the liberation of a concentration camp, but that was a long ways away.</span> <span id="s107">That was going from June/July of 1944 into almost a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Int: Apparently in June/July they called it the hedgerow war.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">MW: It was the hedgerow war.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Int: Very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">MW: Yes, we had to dig in along the hedgerows and set up our communications at or near the hedgerows.</span> <span id="s112">Many casualties were suffered as a result of this.</span> <span id="s113">But there was some effort to keep me going as a communications person because if I were, the earlier that I got killed, the quicker that they lost my skills in communication.</span> <span id="s114">So I kind of did what I had to do to stay protected so I could maintain my communications, but also to fire when I had to, to kill the enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Int: Did you have to run strips of wire between the various command posts?</span> <span id="s116">Is that part of your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">MW: I stretched wire between CPs and between gun positions.</span> <span id="s118">That was part of my job.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Int: It seemed to be a pretty difficult job.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">MW: Difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Int: …had to move in a hurry?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">MW: We had to move fast and we had too many casualties too.</span> <span id="s123">Because the Germans were good at it, at zeroing in on a communications person, you want to get him as soon as you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Int: You know if you destroy the communications, you destroy the ability to command and control your organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">MW: Yes, and I respected my position, I didn’t try to get myself killed.</span> <span id="s126">And fortunately I succeeded until this day to stay alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Int: Do you remember, tell your most memorable experiences during this period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">MW: Outside of getting off of that ship with all that equipment, I think one of the more memorable experiences was fighting in and around the St. Lo area.</span> <span id="s129">I really joined the mass of the 29th infantry, in their efforts, to capture St. Lo in France.</span> <span id="s130">And after St. Lo, there was a lot of movement in July and into August when the 29th went from that area of France on into Brest.</span> <span id="s131">But all of our recollections indicate, and I have pictures on this too, was that I joined the general, Le Clerc, the commanding general of the French army in liberation of Paris, so I was actually with them in late August of 1945 where a large part of the 29th of the 115th went onto Brest, France to free that major, German submarine base, to capture that base.</span> <span id="s132">I was not in Brest but I went on to Paris and to help in the liberation of Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Int: A very bitter battle for Brest.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">MW: Yes it was, yes it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Int: We had hoped to liberate it long enough to have a port, but the Germans pretty well destroyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">MW: They destroyed it.</span> <span id="s137">The stories that I hear from my colleagues and what I see in my, the history of the regiment is that the pens were pretty well destroyed.</span> <span id="s138">It was eventually used as a port but I think that came later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Int: After Brest, after you captured Brest then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">MW: Went into Paris.</span> <span id="s141">The 29th got together in Paris where I had already been with the French army, and then we went on from there and headed eastward to follow the rapid movement of General Patton and the tank divisions.</span> <span id="s142">Rapid movement of the tanks and of course the airforce supporting all of this too.</span> <span id="s143">We moved rapidly across France by truck and by train into various other countries of Europe which we liberated, including Belgium, Luxembourg and then into Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Int: You fought with the 1st army at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">MW: I’m going to make a mistake at guessing which army I was with because we were in assault divisions and we shifted from army to army, but I think you’re right, I think it was the first army at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Int: If it was Luxembourg before the Bulge, that was 1st army…</span></p> <p><span id="s147">MW: That would be 1st army, yes sir, yes sir.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Int: Patton was down south and you were where when the Battle of the Bulge started?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">MW: Oh, yes, you’re talking about December and January, December ’44 and January of 1945 before it was finally neutralized.</span> <span id="s150">By the time the Battle of the Bulge came along in December of 1944, we were, we had liberated Holland and were actually into Germany in a line along the Roer river in Germany, and the Bulge took place right near that area and we fortunately were in a position where we had to hold our positions while much of the German force pushed in toward Belgium, pushed back in towards Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Int: On the northern shoulder of the Bulge?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Mw: Yes, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Int: Well, it was the bloodiest battle since Gettysburg for the American army.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">MW: It was a bloody battle, and our soldiers did an unbelievable job that’s been told many, many times of course about Bastogne, the battling bastards of Bastogne, everybody knows about, and General Patton’s contribution to that.</span> <span id="s155">General McAuliffe’s contribution to that is well known as it should be.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Int: During this period of time, do you remember being attacked by the Luftwaffe, German fighter planes?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">MW: During this particular time, I don’t remember that, no.</span> <span id="s158">The only time I remember being attacked by the German Luftewaffe was shortly, as I recall now, shortly after the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s159">We were out on the field in Germany someplace and some planes came overhead very rapidly, turned out to be German jet planes.</span> <span id="s160">We had a 2 ½ ton truck that had .50 cal machine guns attached to it, and I jumped on the truck along with several of my comrades, trying to fire those guns.</span> <span id="s161">But by the time we got our gun aimed, then got off our first shot, that jet plane was gone, we never touched it.</span> <span id="s162">But there were a few German planes shot down by some of our units, while I didn’t personally participate, I fired but didn’t shoot, didn’t participate in the shooting down of any of those planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Int: Somebody, by this time the Luftewafte was pretty much defeated and not particularly effective against our ground troops because of support from our own fighter planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">MW: Our own fighter planes were pretty active.</span> <span id="s165">I remember pretty well the P-38’s and the P-47 Thunderbolts and the bombers going overhead.</span> <span id="s166">I remember those were being some of the greatest signs that we had, watching these planes going overhead and the explosions beyond our positions, which meant that much less fighting we would get from the Germans.</span> <span id="s167">So they were a big help to us and I’m sure saved a lot of lives.</span> <span id="s168">Unfortunately, there are occasional stories about bombs falling short and obviously not intended but it happened and they were bitter scenes for us to witness.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Int: Not very friendly fire if you’re the target, it’s not very friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">MW: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Int: Well, you moved up to the Roer and you’re up the Rhine River?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">MW: Well, we’re not quite at the Roer, that’s getting us into, jumping ahead now.</span> <span id="s173">I don’t know how long you want me to stay on this particular point, because I can talk and talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Int: It’s your story not mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">MW: Well, we were up to the Roer river and dug in there and after the Battle of the Bulge was neutralized and the weather improved, it was a cold, cold winter.</span> <span id="s176">We were dug in in fox holes in weather below zero and the most severe snow storm they had in the history of Europe at that time, 1944-1945.</span> <span id="s177">But we somehow survived all that by marching together.</span> <span id="s178">If you were injured and didn’t get care right away, then it would be too late sometimes to get you back to the aid station.</span> <span id="s179">The Roer River, when the attacking finally began in about February of 1945, we captured Juelich, Germany, and Aachen, Germany and that whole area.</span> <span id="s180">Julich was referred to as a sports platz, the Germans had a major military training academy there.</span> <span id="s181">And in crossing the Roer River, there were many injuries.</span> <span id="s182">We had, some of my comrades were killed in a bridge across that river, and I myself was injured going across that river.</span> <span id="s183">I had a helmet blown off my head and a crease across my skull and was back in the field hospital for two or three days.</span> <span id="s184">I don’t really remember, I was unconscious and I was carried off the field.</span> <span id="s185">This was just after we got across the Roer near the Julich area.</span> <span id="s186">When we got over that assault and survived what casualties we had, we survived.</span> <span id="s187">The Germans I think sustained a tremendous amount of damage at that time too.</span> <span id="s188">I should say on this particular point, when the Bulge was over and we were about to start our big offensive across the Roer River we had a massive accumulation of artillery, rifle, and air support in the crossing of the Roer River, and it was a sound that no one could ever possibly imagine could be as severe as it was.</span> <span id="s189">We were firing at the German positions on the eastern side of the river, destroyed much of the sports platz area, and I remember when we fought across the river, and this was just at a period of time just before I sustained my own injury.</span> <span id="s190">I remember getting to the gun positions, the German gun positions and seeing wide-eyed stares in the eyes of many of the Germans who were there.</span> <span id="s191">They were just totally shell shocked and just totally defeated by the intensity of the noise and the fury of the fire that came after them.</span> <span id="s192">We didn’t have to fight them too hard because they were already neutralized.</span> <span id="s193">We essentially rounded many of these up and sent them back to prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s194">Those who had to be hospitalized, that was done.</span> <span id="s195">But it was a very furious time for us, but there was a lot of casualties on both sides on crossing into the eastern side of the Roer River.</span> <span id="s196">The fighting from there on was across various parts of Germany, eastern part Germany, initially capturing Munchen-Gladbach, which was the largest city captured in Germany up until that point and very near the Rhine River.</span> <span id="s197">Eventually we captured, by the way Munchen-Gladbach, the military headquarters of Paul Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister of Adolf Hitler, and captured much of his supplies in that headquarters intact, including souvenirs and cameras and pistols and so on.</span> <span id="s198">But we also liberated, we were liberators in France and Holland and all the European countries.</span> <span id="s199">Here we were conquerors.</span> <span id="s200">We liberated one small slave labor camp near Munchen-Gladbach called Dinslaken, and we liberated mainly a lot of dead bodies, there were still a few live people still alive.</span> <span id="s201">And this was the character of our march clear across Germany in many of the small towns and villages, mass graves, small forced labor camps, and that continued from early March on into late March and early April until we got near… Int: They were small forced, they were slave labor camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">MW: Every town and village in Germany practically had one of these camps, they were making something for the German war effort, they declared for their essential needs.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Int: Factories or farms?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">MW: Small factories, there could have been small farms producing food supplies, whatever it took to help move the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Int: We’ve all heard about the larger death camps, but these small camps really haven’t had that much publicity.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">MW: Well, they should get a lot of publicity because there were many of them.</span> <span id="s207">There was.</span> <span id="s208">.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Int: Were there primarily, the people who were slaves, were they primarily Jewish or were they…?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">MW: They were mixed.</span> <span id="s211">There were Jews, Russians, Hungarians, political dissidents, and in the concentration camps, the slave labors camps, the bigger ones, there were many homosexuals, handicapped people, any variety of people that was not deemed to be useful to the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s212">Hitler had to create, Goebbels or Goering that these people would not be useful for the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s213">We eventually got across to a little town in Germany, this is in late March of 1945 called Hamlin, the “Pied Piper of Hamlin” story, which is very near Hannover, which is very, just south of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.</span> <span id="s214">That was a British zone, the British occupied that area and liberated that area.</span> <span id="s215">When we got to Hamlin, we actually continued to liberate these forced labor camps.</span> <span id="s216">And recently here in Atlanta, I have met a gentleman when I was talking one time at a church gathering here in Atlanta, he stood up and hugged me and said I had liberated him in Hamlin, and he was a Roman Catholic, he was a Catholic from Poland, a Polish Catholic whom the Germans had essentially put into forced labor, he and his mother, as they did with so many of the Polish Catholics and so many other camps.</span> <span id="s217">So there was that mix of people like this as well as Jews and Hungarians and all these, all of these little camps.</span> <span id="s218">So this, in 2003, October roughly, met this gentleman and we’ve become fast friends, interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Int: It was quite a reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">MW: It was a reunion, it was a reunion!</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Int: Now that the atrocities committed against the Poles are not particularly well publicized as some other.</span> <span id="s222">First the Germans, then the Russians, it’s miraculous that they didn’t cease to exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">MW: I should say that when we were in Germany, near Hamlin, near Hannover, this was the time of, I’m of the Jewish faith, and this was the time of the Passover in the Jewish faith in March of 1945, it was very early that year, and Jewish soldiers were invited, many of us came too, back to Munchen-Gladbach, where we had a religious service in that city at the military headquarters of Joseph Goebbels, and for the record, I’ll give you a picture of this, also which is part of our history, of our division, of our regiment.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Int: ____ hold this up so we can get this picture on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">MW: This picture has been published in a few sources of the division history, regimental history, as well as 29th Infantry history.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Int: _____</span></p> <p><span id="s227">MW: And where Paul Joseph Goebbels had his military headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Int: Interesting, interesting that you still have the Nazi swastika there.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">MW: Yes, that was symbolic, that we had to have.</span> <span id="s230">The general saying in the back of this picture, holding one of the religious symbols, this gentleman here, named Minnelstein, unfortunately I found that this man passed away just about a month ago, so time goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Int: So many of our comrades are departing this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">MW: One thousand every day from World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Int: It’s a function of age.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">MW: Function of age, right.</span> <span id="s235">I should, if you want me to continue with some of this, I’ll be glad to.</span> <span id="s236">Then we had to go back, we had to go back to Hameln after these religious services were finished.</span> <span id="s237">A group of us were ordered to go south of there toward an area of enemy activity that was not identified.</span> <span id="s238">We went south of Hannover to a place called Dora-Mittelbau in an area called Nordhausen, turned out that this was a, this was a German slave labor camp, a very large one, and we, with our tank destroyer weapons, we blew down a wall of this Dora-Mittelbau and found inside thousands of dead bodies.</span> <span id="s239">Their crematoria where they were handling some of the people who died resulting from the forced labor and literally being worked to death, or I like to say murdered to death.</span> <span id="s240">And this was a new experience for us, we were trained infantry, we were trained to fight wars and to kill or be killed, we weren’t trained for what we saw there.</span> <span id="s241">So to this day, it’s become a very difficult experience to think about even today.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Int: It’s difficult to comprehend.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">MW: It’s difficult to comprehend, and going into one of the ovens of that camp, we opened up all the doors and discovered that there was a German SS officer in one of the ovens with a Luger pistol in his hand.</span> <span id="s244">He was aiming this at whoever he could reach.</span> <span id="s245">He knew the American soldiers were coming, and a comrade of mine, Lt. Ungerlyer and Billy Millander.</span> <span id="s246">Billy fired the first shots inside of this oven, killing this gentleman, soldier, this officer immediately.</span> <span id="s247">It turned out that he was the SS officer in charge of the activities of that camp.</span> <span id="s248">In other words, he was the chief of cruelty in that camp.</span> <span id="s249">This camp, I’m going to add some poetic justice… Int: This is in Nordhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">MW: Nordhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Int: Was there a tremendous tunnel where there were hidden fighter planes and V rockets…</span></p> <p><span id="s252">MW: Right, Nordhausen and Dora-Mittelbau, is the poetic justice of it.</span> <span id="s253">I was in London when the first of the V-1 bombs fell and then I wound up, I didn’t realize it at the time, that in Dornmiddlebaum, I was where the rockets were actually being made in tunnels right near the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Int: What the Germans did was take these factories under ground so they would not be attacked by our bombers.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">MW: Right, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Int: Then they put these people in there, worked them to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">MW: They worked them to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Int: Never came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">MW: They wound up corpses in the ovens of Dora-Mittelbau and other ovens in other camps.</span> <span id="s260">Dora-Mittelbau was one of thirteen subcamps nearby, and Dora-Mittelbau itself originally was a satellite of Buchenwald so it had all of the amenities, slave labor as well as crematoria of Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Int: What happened to the SS commander?</span> <span id="s262">Was he, did you shoot him, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">MW: He was dead, he was in the oven, we shot him dead in the oven, he never left that oven.</span> <span id="s264">He was going to fire and kill any American soldier he could, but we were too battle savvy, we knew enough to shoot first before he had a chance to fire.</span> <span id="s265">As soon as we opened the door and saw what we saw, it was massive M-1 fire from several of my comrades.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Int: I, you remember they had a newsreel, I think it was Leicester Square in London, it was towards the end of the war, and they were showing the first newsreel of the concentration camps, and I remember going in to see them.</span> <span id="s267">It absolutely was unbelievable, people were getting up and leaving and actually getting sick watching these movie like, I can imagine going in the camps themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">MW: Yes, a lot of us got sick, it was nothing that we were trained for.</span> <span id="s269">We were trained, dead bodies were nothing but when you see thousands of them decomposing and sick and typhus and so on.</span> <span id="s270">The same thing the British found in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s271">The same thing that was found in the other camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Int: Did the Germans who lived in the vicinity, did they claim that they never knew what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">MW: They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s274">They were innocent bystanders.</span> <span id="s275">They knew nothing about nothing.</span> <span id="s276">Of course they knew everything.</span> <span id="s277">If you are near the area, the air itself is a dead giveaway.</span> <span id="s278">Everyone has smelled a dead animal, one dead animal.</span> <span id="s279">You’re talking about thousands of dead human beings lying around decomposing, everyone is going to smell that.</span> <span id="s280">And the smoke from the ovens was very apparent too, the crematoria.</span> <span id="s281">The smoke was very apparent.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Int: A horrible time.</span> <span id="s283">Where were you when the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">MW: After Dora-Mittelbau we were already back into the Hanover area, and the 29th moved as a unit, this was in late April of 1945, toward the Elbe River.</span> <span id="s285">And on the way to the Elbe river, some comrades and myself talked about this in a meeting in Ocean City, Maryland, in October or November of 2003, that we saw a place which we didn’t liberate because there was nothing to liberate called Gardelegen.</span> <span id="s286">Gardelegen was a barn when the, just several weeks or a couple of weeks before we got to Dora-Mittelbau, there were about, there were many thousands, ten or twenty or thirty thousand people in the Dora-Mittelbau camp complex area, most of them were sent off on a death march towards Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s287">A couple of thousand between Hanover and the Elbe River where we met the Russians, there was a barn in this town called Gardelegen, and they put around two thousand people in that barn and they isolated them as Jews, this history shows, and they were burned alive.</span> <span id="s288">The barn was set afire and they were screaming at that barn, people desperately trying to stay alive, but there was no way to stay alive.</span> <span id="s289">And my comrades and myself saw that scene, there’s nothing you could say, nothing you could do except to watch and keep moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Int: It’s always been difficult for me to comprehend the Germans, the most literate nation in Europe, more universities, very heavy concentration of Catholics, Protestants, tremendous Jewish community, that these people would simply tolerate what amounted to a gangster taking over the country.</span> <span id="s291">As if the mafia took over the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">MW: But they did, and we can only hope that today the people have learned something.</span> <span id="s293">Today German is a different people and a different nation.</span> <span id="s294">We’ve got to hope and pray this because I keep telling this story and I talk to others about it because if people, young people especially don’t learn about the history, history can repeat itself in all of its horrible times and days.</span> <span id="s295">So we hope to prevent this by telling our stories as we saw them whether it’s good or bad.</span> <span id="s296">After Gardelegen, I might say, as an interesting kind of a pleasant side light, one of the people who was liberated from that camp who was not liberated, was put on that death march from Dora-Mittelbau toward Bergen-Belsen, whose name I don’t think I’ll mention, but he turned out to have been freed by the Americans not too far from the Gardelegen area.</span> <span id="s297">He was fortunately freed by the American soldiers who were coming in that area.</span> <span id="s298">I think it was the 30th Infantry Division because I got this story afterwards.</span> <span id="s299">Turns out this gentleman tells his little story about Dormiddlebau and he turned out, years later, to marry a cousin of my wife’s.</span> <span id="s300">So today he’s my cousin, we’re good friends, we share the common story about our experience of the Holocaust and the war and the fighting, and it’s a little of a bright spot in an otherwise dismal kind of a screen there that surrounds us all.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Int: I’ve noticed you have some pictures here, perhaps you’d share these with us.</span> <span id="s302">We saw the one of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">MW: Yes, well, I would like you to see this picture if you can see it.</span> <span id="s304">That’s a picture of me taken by a young Dutch girl near Amsterdam, Holland, a young woman named Maria Yacob.</span> <span id="s305">And we went back to our little town in Holland during the 50th anniversary of the landings in Normandy, and this young lady had saved this picture of me all these years and gave it to me with a book thanking her liberators in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Int: She was probably a grandma when she gave you that picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">MW: She is now, but she wasn’t then, she was about 11 or 12 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s308">But I knew her parents, I spoke French with her parents and we were living in foxholes just outside of their town, dug in before going into Germany.</span> <span id="s309">And we got permission to go to their house and have a warm meal and a warm shower, which for a dirty infantryman, that was a pretty inviting kind of… Same helmet in this picture was the one that was shot off of me, shot off my head, and when I did, I did have a scalp injury.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Int: That was 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">MW: 1944.</span> <span id="s312">This was in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Int: Sixty years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">MW: Correct, that’s right.</span> <span id="s315">Little bitty area there.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Int: I flew in operation Market Guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">MW: I know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Int: It was the subject of a book and made into a movie, so a number of years ago I was in England, a friend arranged a trip back to Holland, and I was amazed at the hospitality of the Dutch people.</span> <span id="s319">And I met a gentleman, I think he was a Catholic priest, I’m not quite sure, at any rate, he had made a career of what happened in Holland in World War II.</span> <span id="s320">I went in his office, which was twice the size of this room [with books] from floor to ceiling, and when I mentioned the 491st Bomb Group, he pulled a book out and he told me things I had never dreamed about that particular group.</span> <span id="s321">And I bet if you went there and mentioned 29th Division, he could do the same thing for you.</span> <span id="s322">It is amazing what these people have done, and the memorial they built, I went to a museum which resembled a parachute.</span> <span id="s323">One other thing, they really have no use at all for their neighbors the Germans, because of the way they were treated in World War II.</span> <span id="s324">Now we’re back to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">MW: That’s OK because my wife and I actually went back to Holland for the 50th anniversary of the landings in Normandy but was also the 50th anniversary of the liberation of that area of Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">SIDE B Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s327">MW: … parades going on at that time and we participated in parades in the area of Dimagen [phonetic], right yes, and we participated in parades.</span> <span id="s328">My wife and I participated in parades at that time and had many memories of that.</span> <span id="s329">And solemn memory is right near Amsterdam where this family came from in Holland, there was a cemetery called Margaraten which is an American military cemetery.</span> <span id="s330">And at the 50th anniversary was one of the most difficult times I’d had in 50 years.</span> <span id="s331">I saw my comrades and my units lying there, they were dead when they were 19, 20, and here at my age, I have family, children and grandchildren, and all I could do was walk through that cemetery and salute and cry for hours.</span> <span id="s332">It was a very difficult time for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Int: You know for every one of those who died, there was a mother, father, sister, brothers, fiancées, some of them had wives and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">MW: Or as surviving veterans, we suffered a lot, many clinically with post stress syndrome from grief and guilt.</span> <span id="s335">Grief over what you’re seeing of your former comrades and guilt they didn’t make it and you did and look what you have and they had nothing.</span> <span id="s336">Fortunes of war… Int: Fortunes of war.</span> <span id="s337">War was over…</span></p> <p><span id="s338">MW: War was over.</span> <span id="s339">We went on to the Elbe river, we met the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Int: Did you ever go to a place called Magdeburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">MW: Yes, Magdeburg, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Int: I made six trips there.</span> <span id="s343">It was one of the most heavily defended targets in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">MW: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Int: It was the boundary between the Allies and the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">MW: Yes, I think Magdeburg is a city where a brother of the gentleman who was eventually to become my cousin in marriage who liberated from Dormiddlebau, his brother was murdered in Magdeburg.</span> <span id="s347">There are many camp survivors in that area.</span> <span id="s348">We left off after meeting the Russians at the Elbe river, we went on to Bremerhaven and were part of the army of occupation.</span> <span id="s349">That was from May, of course the end of the war in Germany was in early, early May, from May until December of that year, we were in the Army of Occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">There initially was some concern that we would have to board boats again and go to Japan because the war with Japan was not over yet.</span> <span id="s351">And until August came around and the atom bombs were dropped, we were concerned about that possibility, which of course didn’t come off.</span> <span id="s352">‘Cause if we had gone as a rear assault division, we would have wound up on the mainland of Japan, so we remained in Germany protecting the displaced person camps, guarding the prisoner of war camps, and maintaining peace in those communities.</span> <span id="s353">We were armed all the time and I was maintaining communications in headquarters.</span> <span id="s354">And our job was then to keep the peace until it was time to go home, and that was in December of 1945.</span> <span id="s355">I was discharged in January of 1946, and I went back to school as quickly as I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Int: So you saw “everybody’s girlfriend” with the torch at New York harbor, the Statue of Liberty.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">MW: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Int: I came back on the “Ile de France.”</span> <span id="s359">We were going into New York harbor, the captain of the ship came on, he not only requested, he demanded that we not all go to the side next to the Statue of Liberty because we could capsize the ship.</span> <span id="s360">15,000 on board.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">MW: We came in on the S.S. Erickson actually, it was run by the US Navy, so we had great food, had our eggs the way we want them, and it was a good trip.</span> <span id="s362">It was a good trip across in very very stormy seas in December of 1945.</span> <span id="s363">But we were so happy about it, I don’t think any of us would have gotten sea sick.</span> <span id="s364">We didn’t get sea sick, we had our own beds, showers, good food.</span> <span id="s365">We were on the way home.</span> <span id="s366">I had a postcard of the SS Erickson in my folder, the SS Johnny Erickson that took us home, it’s a small graduation certificate there somewhere.</span> <span id="s367">OK, I’ll find it and give you a copy of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Int: Why don’t you show us some of your artifacts.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">MW: I’m sorry, yes, I take it back, this is it, this is the Army Service Forces Transportation Corps when we were sent home on the SS John Erickson in December and January of 1945, 46.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Int: Your port of embarkation.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">MW: Headquarters company 115th infantry, returned to the United States on the ship NS John Erickson on 3rd of January 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Int: You have a certificate certifying that you did so.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">MW: Yes, indeed.</span> <span id="s374">And I have also here a notice from my draft board in 1950 telling me that I was ineligible to serve because I was too old.</span> <span id="s375">Four years later.</span> <span id="s376">I was classified 5-A which was a lot different that 1-A, that I was classified as originally.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Int: Were you married during the service or was it after?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">MW: No, it was after.</span> <span id="s379">I was married in 1949.</span> <span id="s380">So not too long after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Int: New York harbor, what did they do, take you to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">MW: Yes, from there to Camp Grant, Illinois where my separation was completed.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Int: You were separated where?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">MW: Camp Grant, Illinois, near Chicago.</span> <span id="s385">They separated you at a place near your home area.</span> <span id="s386">They did a fairly good job of that and I was out of, I remember I had been overseas over two years, I hadn’t seen anybody for over two years.</span> <span id="s387">I was in the army only three years, in combat for a year.</span> <span id="s388">Went overseas from all of 1944 and all of 1945 and so when our train rolled into the 12th street station in Chicago, my family knew that I was coming.</span> <span id="s389">And one of my brothers had to hold my mother back from jumping over the rail, I was able to wave to her, but she couldn’t come down and see me, she had to wait until I was actually discharged at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Int: You were awarded a Bronze Star medal?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">MW: Yes, this Bronze Star medal was commonly awarded to veterans who did some combat, but it was an honor to have this because I felt like this specifically had to do with my communications efforts at the front line with wire and of course it all happened about the same time when I incurred that one injury where my helmet was shot off.</span> <span id="s392">The injuries that many of us suffered that wasn’t really an injury was trench feet.</span> <span id="s393">There was a lot of trench feet in World War II; you hear a lot about that in World War I, but there was a lot of it in World War II.</span> <span id="s394">You never took off your shoes and socks, you never could change properly, you were wet and dirty.</span> <span id="s395">It was a natural thing for biologic agents to get in there and cause this skin disease.</span> <span id="s396">There were, there were men who did lose toes and feet, frozen trench feet.</span> <span id="s397">And at the same time I was in the hospital for that, or about the same time I think was when I was in those few days after I was carried off the battlefield.</span> <span id="s398">I don’t remember the exact dates of these because so long ago and you try to get on with your life.</span> <span id="s399">Fifty years after the war was over, I didn’t get on with my life in terms of accepting what took place and telling the stories to others.</span> <span id="s400">So at the fiftieth anniversary when my wife and I went to celebrate at the various events all over Europe, we realized there were a lot of Holocaust survivors all over the country and all over the world, and you can’t tell somebody like myself who was an eye witness to what you saw both in the forced labor camps and the slave labor camps like in Dora-Mittelbau that it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s401">So many of us started to tell our stories and we’re out telling our stories now so the young people will be careful to not even think about making wrong decisions, making right decisions so we don’t make the same mistakes that we made at one time.</span> <span id="s402">So I’m a believer of that now, very intensely, and so for ten years from the fiftieth anniversary to the days of the sixtieth anniversary of our landings, I’ve been talking very openly about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Int: My daughter-in-law is an attorney and one of her close friends is Stuart Eisenstadt [Atlanta attorney], who was ambassador to NATO.</span> <span id="s404">President Clinton asked him to look into reparations for those who were in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s405">It came to his attention because of a lady from New Jersey who wanted to collect on their life insurance policies of her father, and Stuart has written a book about his experiences, it’s called Justice Denied.</span> <span id="s406">He was able to obtain considerable, I say considerable, a measure of justice for some of these people for monetary compensations from Germany and other countries.</span> <span id="s407">And the thing that really appalled me, there’s a book about an incident that came out about two years ago, so Stuart was kind enough to send me a copy.</span> <span id="s408">The thing that really appalled me was the attitude of the Swiss government.</span> <span id="s409">The Swiss government, the Swiss banking system was actually the conduit for the wealth of the Jewish people who died in concentration camps, you know _________.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">MW: We had the pleasure of hearing Mr. ________ here in Atlanta, he’s from this area, and he spoke at the Breman museum not long ago, and at that time had copies of his book which we purchased and we have since read.</span> <span id="s411">So, yes, he told the story at the William Bremen Heritage Museum here in Atlanta, and yeah, we’re familiar with that story, and it’s not over with yet.</span> <span id="s412">They’re still trying to settle the thing.</span> <span id="s413">I hope it will be settled.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Int: It’s very difficult to obtain justice.</span> <span id="s415">There’s no way to obtain justice for what happened, you can only, that’s what he did __________ significant but it really was appalling to me the attitude of the government.</span> <span id="s416">I’m involved with the American Legion and other organizations.</span> <span id="s417">One of the things that really upset me was that ________ and the gist of it was to portray the Japanese as victims, fortunately between the ________ American Legion and some other people, we managed to get that corrected.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">MW: I must say in passing then, I’ve certainly appreciated the opportunity to come back after the war and get an education that allowed me to eventually become very involved in areas of research that I’ve been very interested in.</span> <span id="s419">So I was a professor at Emory University where, from which I retired about twelve years ago, thirteen years ago.</span> <span id="s420">And I am very pleased about the developments in life since that phase of it is over.</span> <span id="s421">We do want the young people to know what took place, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Int: If you had not had the GI Bill, would you have been able to pursue your academic career?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">MW: You know, I am going to answer that in an interesting way.</span> <span id="s424">I have a copy of the letter that I brought with me that’s in the folder, in one of these folders.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Int: You had a very distinguished academic career, I noticed you went to the University of Miami.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">MW: Yes, I went to the University of Miami in 1947 and graduated, got my bachelor’s degree there.</span> <span id="s427">And then went on from there to the University of Illinois and went on to get my master’s and my doctorate’s degree at the same time that my wife also got her degrees.</span> <span id="s428">Interesting question about would I have been able to go to school.</span> <span id="s429">I happened to find in these old papers of mine that the stipend from the Veteran’s Administration that I would be given an adequate allowance for education and subsistence.</span> <span id="s430">This was the original letter which is about falling apart, of ninety dollars a month and plus my education and training.</span> <span id="s431">I’m not sure in answer to your question I would have been able to do all that because I didn’t have a very substantial source of income to do otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Int: In effect, I was bankrupt as I graduated from high school so I went to work at the local auto dealer for $12 a week.</span> <span id="s433">And I had eighteen months of college but the way I did it was I washed dishes 40 hours a week and got paid $68 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s434">So the GI Bill was really a Godsend to me.</span> <span id="s435">Did you know that the educational establishment, the president of Harvard, fought the GI Bill because they figured that education belonged to the elite and this would make college degrees available to the great, pardon my French, great unwashed.</span> <span id="s436">And it passed by one vote, the one solid vote was a congressman from Waycross, Georgia.</span> <span id="s437">Very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">MW: Well I’m sure glad to have had this opportunity to speak to you, I hope that I’m covering the points that you want covered.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Int: How did you wind up at Emory?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">MW: Well, actually when I finished my graduate training at the University of Illinois, I took a job, I was offered a job in industry, pharmaceutical industry in Cincinnati, Ohio.</span> <span id="s441">The industry did not appeal to me.</span> <span id="s442">I stayed up there about a year, not even a year and found out through a fellow graduate student of mine there was an available position at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, and I had my Ph.D. degree by this time.</span> <span id="s443">And I stayed there for six or seven years, became director of research in the department of ophthalmology.</span> <span id="s444">And then about that time, an old comrade of mind, friend of mine from academics invited me to come to Atlanta to Emory University.</span> <span id="s445">They were looking for somebody to start a research program at Emory University.</span> <span id="s446">This was in 1962, and I came up, was interviewed several times, and we’ve been in the same house, I was with the same institution all these years until my retirement in 1991 or 92.</span> <span id="s447">I’m professor emeritus at Emory University now, I’m a director of research in the Department of Ophthalmology and also professor in the Department of Physiology because I got my doctorate degree in physiology at the University of Illinois.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Int: I had a good friend who died about a year ago, Jake Goldstein, Audrey is his wife’s name, had some great times with Jake, he really was a remarkable man, did fantastic research in physics.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">MW: Yes, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Int: It’s interesting to me that a _________to this fantastic________.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">MW: He was a big contributor directly to much of my research.</span> <span id="s452">It was called the Trebor Foundation.</span> <span id="s453">I had an endowed professorship and much of my research support from Trebor, well, Trebor is Robert spelled backwards, Robert Woodruff, so they’re very helpful to us, and my old boss, Dr. Calhoun, Phinezy Calhoun, his father was an ophthalmologist in Atlanta, but Phinezy, Jr., brought me here to Atlanta to develop the program in ophthalmology.</span> <span id="s454">It was his great grandfather, his kin, who actually were eye doctors in the Confederate army during the Civil War, so they go back in history.</span> <span id="s455">I’ve enjoyed this.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Int: An eye doctor in the Civil War.</span> <span id="s457">I have a great uncle who was a Confederate surgeon fortunately, and my grandfather was left for dead at the second battle of Bull Run and his brother-in-law, Oliver Doyle was his name, saw him lying in the ditch on the roadside and rescued him.</span> <span id="s458">So except for Dr. Doyle’s kindness I would not be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">MW: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Int: Well, Dr. Waitzman, thank you for an intriguing interview.</span> <span id="s461">In reflecting on World War II, that is now sixty years ago, what sort of final words for future generations do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">MW: I’ve heard it said recently by some very dear friends of mine that people don’t want to hear anymore about this stuff.</span> <span id="s463">They’ve had enough.</span> <span id="s464">They’ve had enough of the Holocaust, they’ve had enough of the war, and they’ve… My reflection is very clear, I don’t think anyone has had enough, I think this is a perpetual education that we have to keep teaching this generation and future generations about what took place so they can handle all the information they can to make the best decisions they can make about how they run their lives and how they treat their fellow human beings.</span> <span id="s465">These are the things that we must learn and we can’t learn it unless we understand what took place in history, the good and the bad and the indifferent, we must know about it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Int: I was appalled at the attitude of the second generation of Filipinos.</span> <span id="s467">The Philippines were effectively destroyed by the Japanese, 100,000 civilians were killed, slaughtered, by the Japanese, it’s a horror story.</span> <span id="s468">But the young folk, they don’t think that if the Americans had not been there the Japanese would not have invaded!</span> <span id="s469">That’s far from the truth.</span> <span id="s470">The Japanese were for taking over the whole Pacific, and I understand that the same attitude is now apparent in Korea.</span> <span id="s471">Having spent several months there towards the end of the Korean war, if we had not chosen to stand, Japan might well be in the same category as North Korea.</span> <span id="s472">The Communists were just as difficult, what’s the proper word, ruthless, probably more so.</span> <span id="s473">It’s a continuing problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">MW: I thank you very much for having me and helping us both understand all that took place and passing it along.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Int: Thank you for coming, thank you very much for your support.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s477">PAGE 1</span></p></body></html>
