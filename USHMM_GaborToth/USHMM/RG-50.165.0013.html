’51…on the General Eltinge…</span></p> <p><span id="s13">WH: During the war, you fled across the border into Russia…</span></p> <p><span id="s14">MC: Yes…into Siberia…a lot of them didn’t make it…they got sick…and a lot of them I think, losing hope, that was the main reason for giving up.</span> <span id="s15">They, - there was no – no hope that they’ll ever get out of there and these people went like flies…in 1941 we were free to leave…</span></p> <p><span id="s16">WH: …You have a (younger) brother, Eddie, do you have any other siblings?’</span></p> <p><span id="s17">MC: I have another brother.</span> <span id="s18">Bernie…</span></p> <p><span id="s19">WH: You all live in Kenosha?’</span></p> <p><span id="s20">MC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">WH: In Siberia, the three of you were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">MC: Yes…my parents together, too.</span> <span id="s23">On the way back from Russia in ’46 and …she died…my father lived here with us.</span> <span id="s24">He passed away in ’73…we came to New York first, my father had a brother in New York, and he also had a brother in Kenosha…they left Poland in 1912…the one in New York, he gave us some money, and the uncle here helped us with an empty store to start a business, so I came first, and I arranged for the business and then my father came with his – he got married, Mrs. Kramer, and the son.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">WH: That’s your step-brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">MC; Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">WH: …how did you get the idea to go into the furniture business?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">MC: Well, I came mainly hoping that maybe I could get my father established here somehow, and I could go back, because I didn’t plan to stay here, because for a single Jewish boy, there was no place in Kenosha.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">WH: Wasn’t this true of your brothers too?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">MC: Well, Eddie stayed in New York…and Bernie went to Israel…when I started in the business, I took in Eddie and he’s been with me since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">WH: …what were your first impressions of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">MC: It was very exciting, but a lot of it was very disappointing to me…the disappointing was, you could see the disparity between the rich and the poor.</span> <span id="s33">And coming here as a refugee, you were considered less than what you were considered over there.</span> <span id="s34">In the camps I was more than the average.</span> <span id="s35">Better than the average.</span> <span id="s36">I was working for the Joint…and Immigration, and I was working in food supplies, in the office, I was looked up to.</span> <span id="s37">I was a little better than the average there.</span> <span id="s38">I had very decent jobs.</span> <span id="s39">I came here, they didn’t know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s40">I wasn’t a doctor, I wasn’t an engineer – but they all came, my uncles came…to the boat, and we told him that we worked for the Joint and the HIAS and he said, ‘Take that HIAS and the Joint, they can throw it in the garbage.</span> <span id="s41">As long as I’m alive, I’m going to take care of you people.’</span> <span id="s42">That was a big mistake too.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">WH: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">MC: Because he lived in Mamaroneck and we settled in Sunnyside, and he couldn’t do very much for us and the Joint and the HIAS, they were experienced to find jobs for people, and find a decent apartment, and they paid for the first year.</span> <span id="s45">We didn’t get a nickel from the Joint or the HIAS because he took charge of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">WH: You couldn’t change your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">MC: No.</span> <span id="s48">We didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s49">We didn’t want money from anybody.</span> <span id="s50">We just wanted – we were hoping that we could start some kind of a business, but you just don’t get off the boat and start a business.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">WH: …the majority of the refugees did not have any money when they came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">MC: Well, we had some money that we made there, but we bought all kinds of gifts.</span> <span id="s53">We bought like crystals, and silver and candelabras, and all kinds of gifts for the relatives here, we didn’t think that we needed to bring any money to the United States.</span> <span id="s54">Having, you know, we had here rich relatives.</span> <span id="s55">We didn’t expect anything from them, except to show us how to make a good living, you know, to get started…the uncle in Sunnyside found me a job in the jewelry section on 47th Street…in the Shipping Department to fill orders and to pack them…I was making like $50 a week…</span></p> <p><span id="s56">WH: …when you came here…what about the Jewish community?’</span></p> <p><span id="s57">MC: The Jewish community didn’t do anything for us really.</span> <span id="s58">We were involved, we did go to services, like in New York…Sunnyside…we never, we were never invited by anybody.</span> <span id="s59">We really didn’t look for it.</span> <span id="s60">We had our – see, my father, with a step-mother, they had an apartment in the building, so we ate there, myself and my brother.</span> <span id="s61">And we slept at my uncles.</span> <span id="s62">He had only one bedroom apartment, and he kept us there (Sunnyside) for 7 months in the living room.</span> <span id="s63">And we slept on the couch, and on a roll-away bed…and he was very nice, and he didn’t get tired of us…they were very generous…he had a fish store, he worked very hard, he had to get up at 4 o’clock to go to the fish market, but he took us in and the wife is not European, she was American, and she was very nice to us, and until today we are very good friends…and I was very determined to start my own business…I was 25 when I came here…I could speak and write (English) when I came here…</span></p> <p><span id="s64">WH: …what did you do in your free time…social life…</span></p> <p><span id="s65">MC: …we did go to social events, went on dates at the week-ends…we would go to a movie, dancing or to a restaurant…the first one was at the Hotel Diplomat…all the refugees had a big dance there…there was also a get-together at the HIAS like on Sundays, because there were new arrivals…and everybody would come there, and some would brag, you know, how well they’re doing, and – some of them would exaggerate how well they’re doing, and some would complain about the relatives, because most of them were disappointed.</span> <span id="s66">Most of them were disappointed in the relatives because the relatives really couldn’t do very much for them.</span> <span id="s67">No.</span> <span id="s68">And when I came there – before I was leaving, I met some of the people that I knew and I told them we have an uncle, who is giving us some money, and the other uncle is going to give us an empty store, and we’re going to start some kind of a business.</span> <span id="s69">And they said to me, ‘We know you for a long time, you’re not a bragger, but we don’t believe what you’re saying because it’s not believable that the American relative is going to give money and the other one is going to help, because it’s not -.’</span></p> <p><span id="s70">WH: …what was the reputation of the HIAS staff?</span> <span id="s71">Were they considered people who understood the problems of the refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">MC: Yah, the HIAS I think did a very good job.</span> <span id="s73">The HIAS and the Joint did a very good job…</span></p> <p><span id="s74">WH: …what finally made you leave (New York)?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">MC: Well, first we had to find (a job) for my father, so that he could make a living, he found a job there to wash dishes in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s76">Never did it in his life.</span> <span id="s77">He was always a businessman…he wasn’t well…he didn’t know how to read or write, he didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s78">But my main job was to get my dad, my father, settled and that he could make a living.</span> <span id="s79">And that was my purpose to come to Kenosha when my uncle offered the empty store.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">WH: Did you have mixed feelings about coming to Kenosha?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">MC: Of course!</span> <span id="s82">This was worse than Siberia to is.</span> <span id="s83">It was.</span> <span id="s84">Because many times we would cry for days, for weeks.</span> <span id="s85">We were so lonesome here, so alone that we remembered the good times in Siberia where we had another 1,000 Jews there, we could have gone out on the street and have somebody to talk to.</span> <span id="s86">And here we were isolated.</span> <span id="s87">The business was no business yet.</span> <span id="s88">There was no big business.</span> <span id="s89">I went to work at American Motors.</span> <span id="s90">My father and my uncle were in the store the first year…I worked in a factory in Russia, but that wasn’t my dream, to come to the United States and work in a factory but I didn’t mind it.</span> <span id="s91">I got very nicely a, - I worked for the first year to save up enough money and bought myself a new car.</span> <span id="s92">And when I had the car, it was already easier.</span> <span id="s93">I would drive to Milwaukee, to Chicago, go out on dated.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">WH: …out here in the wilderness, you’re by yourself…</span></p> <p><span id="s95">MC: No, we made the best of it.</span> <span id="s96">You know I didn’t mind, I went to work, and I wasn’t complaining, I liked the money, and I knew it was temporary.</span> <span id="s97">I was hoping to come into the business and either make a success of it or we were going to leave Kenosha and go back to New York, because that’s where the most Jews are, in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">WH: …most of the people who were sent to these places left…the majority of survivors didn’t want to stay…</span></p> <p><span id="s99">MC: The only reason we stayed is because we started the business, and the business got successful…and here, everybody is a Yankee.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">WH: Did you become more of a Yankee too?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">MC: We tried to.</span> <span id="s102">We had most of – once we had a house, and once we got married, and we had children, we had more in common with the other couples, who were American couples…</span></p> <p><span id="s103">WH: Was it difficult to make friends here because of your background?’</span></p> <p><span id="s104">MC: No.</span> <span id="s105">Once we had a house, and once you made a living, people were not afraid of you that you’re going to, that they gonna have to help you.</span> <span id="s106">And you invite them to dinner, and they’ll invite you for dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">WH: And you go to the movies with them -.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">MC: Yah.</span> <span id="s109">That’s right.</span> <span id="s110">And that’s the way it is.</span> <span id="s111">And that’s the way it’s been.</span> <span id="s112">You’re not very close with anybody in particular…here we are involved with the Temple and the shul and involved in B’nai B’rith…Hadassah, Israeli bonds, UJA, we involved in everything.</span> <span id="s113">We’re involved in everything, we’re part of everything, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">WH: …how many children do you have?’</span></p> <p><span id="s115">MC: Two daughters…one on Israel (Marsha)…they both went to school in Madison, University of Wisconsin…the older is a dietician the one who went to Israel, and the other one (Natalie) is a teacher here in Kenosha…not married…and this was one of the things that we were concerned about Kenosha, you know, we hope they’d meet somebody…Marsha studied in Israel for a year and met an Israeli…they have two children…Israel is good, but unless you are professional or businessman, you have a hard time making a living.</span> <span id="s116">So if it wasn’t for us, we went there, we bought an apartment for them, and we send them all the furniture and the appliances, and we keep sending and sending which we don’t mind, they just couldn’t make it on their own…</span></p> <p><span id="s117">WH: So how do you feel about your daughter having made aliyah?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">MC: Well, we’re not very happy about it because of the fact that we are here, and she’s there.</span> <span id="s119">We can’t spend enough time together, Otherwise we love Israel, but it would be nice if either we were there or she was here.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">WH: …do you ever think about moving to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">MC: We think, but we are comfortable here.</span> <span id="s122">Too good to give it up, you know…you learn to live with it.</span> <span id="s123">Until we go and we make the best of it.</span> <span id="s124">We help her.</span> <span id="s125">If it was our choice, you want to be closer to your daughter and your grandchildren.</span> <span id="s126">And this makes it – we go just about every year and she came here a few times with the family, it’s expensive, but we can afford it, thank G-d and we don’t mind it…</span></p> <p><span id="s127">WH: …your living here sort of resulted in your Americanizing faster…</span></p> <p><span id="s128">MC: Yah, but I didn’t forget, I never forget where I came from, and I’m not a Yankee.</span> <span id="s129">I know who I am, I am more (inaudible) in Kenosha.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">WH: Really.</span> <span id="s131">You say that after all these years.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">MC: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">WH: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">MC: In every way.</span> <span id="s135">It’s the upbringing, the family, the uncles, the -.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">End of Tape #1, Side A Tape #1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s137">WH: …you kept the ties…</span></p> <p><span id="s138">MC: I spoke to my father in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s139">I still speak to my brother in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s140">In the store we speak Yiddish by ourselves.</span> <span id="s141">So we really didn’t forget about it.</span> <span id="s142">But we do everything else, we do just like everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">WH: But there’s a bond between you that always remains.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">MC: Of course.</span> <span id="s145">.</span> <span id="s146">My heart is in Israel, my heart is with Jewish people wherever I hear on radio, on television, when I see something, I stop my business with my customers I have to see what’s happening in Israel, what’s happening with the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">WH: …your family in Ruminoff, was Hasidish?’</span></p> <p><span id="s148">MC: We had both…(Shows WH pictures of family and early years and a kepah from home.)</span> <span id="s149">…</span></p> <p><span id="s150">WH: Are you faithfully observant now?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">MC: Here, I’m considered religious, but I’m not that, because I work on Saturdays and on holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">WH: Do you keep a kosher house?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">MC: ‘No – we don’t mix fleishig and milchig but we eat out , but we go out to shul and we, actually I do the services at the shul – with Rosen, together we do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">WH: So, you were involved in a family business since the beginning, since you started it, tell me, when the ‘6o’s came and the war in Viet Nam started and everything else.</span> <span id="s155">What was your reaction to all that?</span> <span id="s156">What did you think of that as a person who had lived through everything in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">MC: I felt that the government had more information than I had, and whatever they were doing was necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">WH: What about the Civil Rights Movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">MC: I was never involved in it.</span> <span id="s160">Was I sympathetic to it?</span> <span id="s161">Yes, I’m sympathetic to minorities, you know, but I feel that I’m a minority myself, and I’m preoccupied with myself – (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s162">WH: Do you think that the minorities in America today are deserving of all the help they get?’</span></p> <p><span id="s163">MC: I know that they don’t like us.</span> <span id="s164">A lot of them, the Black – a lot of the Blacks – but even a lot of the Blacks don’t like us because we’re more successful than they are, and a lot of them work for Jewish people and they resent it.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">WH: Do you have Blacks working for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">MC: We had a Black guy working with us, it was very unpopular in the ‘60’s when we bought this house.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">WH: You had a Black guy when it was very unpopular?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">MC: It was unpopular then, at least nobody else had anybody Black in the Businesses working.</span> <span id="s169">He was delivering furniture for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">WH: Did you hire him as a matter of policy?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">MC: No, we just needed somebody, and just because he was Black, it didn’t bother us.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">WH: Did people ever make anti-Semitic remarks in the store?’</span></p> <p><span id="s173">MC: No…but I identified myself whenever I get the chance, that I’m Jewish, and we talk about it, we talk about Israel to all of them…most of them know we are Jewish – and we don’t hide it, never – if they ask us, because we have an accent, or whatever, we always tell them that we are Jewish…(non-Jews) most of them come to the store and they want to know my story, my life (inaudible) story, and they sometimes sit down and they get very personal, and I tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">WH: Do you ever speak in public about it?’</span></p> <p><span id="s175">MC: I spoke in some schools… our daughter asked me to – (she’s teaching the gifted program) and they were studying the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s176">So she just thought that it would be nice to go to these 3 schools…5th and 6th grade…to give my personal, experiences…most of those kids never saw a Jewish kid in town.</span> <span id="s177">I even asked them, ‘Did you ever meet a Jewish boy?</span> <span id="s178">Do you know a Jewish person?’</span> <span id="s179">And most of them wouldn’t know what a Jew looks like.</span> <span id="s180">What a Jew is.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">WH: …when you say a Temple and a shul…Reform…you belong to both?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">MC: Yes…there was a split…</span></p> <p><span id="s183">WH: Do you have any regrets coming here/</span></p> <p><span id="s184">MC: No, I don’t have any regrets because I didn’t give up anything there that I had, you know, when I left.</span> <span id="s185">And here, I was very happy that what I accomplished, at least financially, as far as making a decent living, we always lived comfortably, financially, we didn’t have to worry about anything…we didn’t need anything from anybody, we were very self-sufficient, and independent, and that’s very important, you see.</span> <span id="s186">Because (inaudible) a lot of Jews, and if you’re making a living, nobody wants to know you.</span> <span id="s187">Everybody shies away from you.</span> <span id="s188">Including your relatives – They’re afraid you’re going to need something from them.</span> <span id="s189">And this we never needed, because even in the camps, I made a lot of money in the camps, and I never asked for any money from the relatives here.</span> <span id="s190">When my father used to ask me to write a letter to the uncle and to ask him to send some money, I said, ‘What’s he gonna think about us?</span> <span id="s191">We’re young people.</span> <span id="s192">We’re healthy and we need money?</span> <span id="s193">We can’t support ourselves?’</span> <span id="s194">I went out into the city and I made myself $50, a $100 under any circumstances, in Russia, in Austria, any place.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">WH: Doing trading?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">MC: Yah, I didn’t steal,,,sort of gray market…</span></p> <p><span id="s197">WH: Do you feel that your experiences there helped you when you came to America?’</span></p> <p><span id="s198">MC: Of course!</span> <span id="s199">All the experiences, I was in business since I was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s200">We had a gasoline station and oil business…and my father used to take me out there (to resorts) when I was 12 years old and he would introduce me to all these barons…and ‘he’s going to be coming here every month and he’s going to bill you and he’s going to collect from you’…I took a very big interest in the business…</span></p> <p><span id="s201">WH: …when you came here, could you give me an example of…how you seized opportunities here…</span></p> <p><span id="s202">MC: In the American context, I…would find out that there was a competitor only a block away from us who handled the same merchandise.</span> <span id="s203">I knew that in order to make customers I have to be a little bit cheaper than the next guy, and I have to make a little less.</span> <span id="s204">It’s better than nothing…and we were flexible, they could bargain with us, and we would come down, you know, we would kind of compromise, and they liked that.</span> <span id="s205">Even lately.</span> <span id="s206">(Wife: Today we’re not only selling their children, but their grandchildren).</span></p> <p><span id="s207">WH So you built up a business on personal (inaudible-contact?)</span> <span id="s208">.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">MC: We had five families made a good living from it.</span> <span id="s210">There’s myself, my two brothers, my step-brother…my father, my wife is working, she gets paid, - so, we all make a living from the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">WH: …what is business like today?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">MC: We’re not making millions, we’re making a good living, and we’re comfortable, and we all paid for our homes, we always have new cars, we never borrowed any money, we never owed anybody, everything is -.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">WH: America was good to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">MC: I would say so.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">WH; It’s a
