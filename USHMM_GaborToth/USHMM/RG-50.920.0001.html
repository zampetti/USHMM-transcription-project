Center</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Interviewer: Marilyn Parr</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Transcriber: Joyce Dumas [Tape 1, Side A] Interviewer: Today is Wednesday, January fourteen, two thousand four.</span> <span id="s7">My name is Marilyn Parr and we’re at the Atlanta History Center in Atlanta, Georgia.</span> <span id="s8">Could you tell us your name and your date of birth, sir.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Burgess: My name is James Montgomery Burgess and my date of birth is May thirty, nineteen twenty-four.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Interviewer: And were you born here [inaudible]?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Burgess: I was born in Athens, Georgia.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Interviewer: Athens, Georgia.</span> <span id="s13">Could you tell us just a little bit about your early upbringing?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Burgess: Well, we didn’t live in Athens very long.</span> <span id="s15">I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s16">I grew up basically in the South, mostly in Atlanta and I’ve lived here, except for two or three times when in my business I was in other cities.</span> <span id="s17">This has been my home all along.</span> <span id="s18">I lived in San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s19">I graduated from North Fulton High School here and from Georgia Tech.</span> <span id="s20">So I’m pretty much of an Atlanta person.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Interviewer: Now were you…when you went to Georgia Tech, did you finish college before the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Burgess: No, I had two years before I was called up in the service.</span> <span id="s23">And then after the war I went back and graduated.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Interviewer: So you were drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Burgess: No.</span> <span id="s26">Well, I was an ROTC at Tech and they called up all of the ROTCs at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Interviewer: What year would that have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Burgess: Nineteen forty-three.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Interviewer: So the war had been going on for a while.</span> <span id="s30">You were in ROTC.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Burgess: Yeah, it’d been about a year and a half it’d been going on.</span> <span id="s32">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Interviewer: And you expected that eventually you would be called up.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Burgess: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s35">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Interviewer: Can you tell us what that was like when you first actually, officially knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Burgess: You mean being called up or after I got in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Interviewer: Either.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Burgess: Okay.</span> <span id="s40">Well, there were many rumors around at that time that they were gonna activate the ROTC, which they did.</span> <span id="s41">And they took us out to Fort McPherson and swore us into the service, sent us back to school and we were there for about two or three weeks and then we were sent to basic training at Fort McClellan, Alabama.</span> <span id="s42">And we were there for seventeen weeks, about four months being trained.</span> <span id="s43">And then from then on, it became strictly a military thing.</span> <span id="s44">I was through with the school until after the war at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Interviewer: In your training, you had basic training and then how did you get into a particular area, I believe you were in rifle?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Burgess: I was in infantry, yes.</span> <span id="s47">Well, I was in the infantry ROTC, so that was my…my ah…ROTC training.</span> <span id="s48">And then I stayed in that once I went into the Army itself.</span> <span id="s49">And we got infantry training at Fort McClellan and then later went to Fort Benning and got further training before we went overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Interviewer: Can you tell us a little bit about that basic training?</span> <span id="s51">You went with your unit…I’m gonna stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Burgess: Is this okay the way…what we’re doing?</span> <span id="s53">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Interviewer: We just had a brief mike adjustment and we’re going to go back and continue the conversation.</span> <span id="s55">We were talking about your beginning basic training.</span> <span id="s56">And you were in the ROTC, so when you went to the first place, were you with fellas that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Burgess: Yes.</span> <span id="s58">In fact, it was…our entire ROTC class was sent en mass over to Fort McClellan, Alabama.</span> <span id="s59">Then we got basic infantry training over there for four months.</span> <span id="s60">Very hot cause it was in the summertime and the training was very rugged.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Interviewer: Were you anxious at that time to go overseas?</span> <span id="s62">What was the feeling amongst the… Burgess: I think so.</span> <span id="s63">I think just out of patriotism, I think most people in my age group and all at that time were very anxious to go in the service and to be part of it.</span> <span id="s64">So in that sense, yes we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Interviewer: So you’d been following what had been going on in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Burgess: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Interviewer: Did you know at that point during your training, did you know which theater of operations that you would be sent to?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Burgess: No, it could have been either the Pacific or Europe.</span> <span id="s69">As it turned out, we went to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Interviewer: When you went to Europe, can you tell us what month and year that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Burgess: Nineteen forty-four.</span> <span id="s72">We went over in April.</span> <span id="s73">We arrived in…we left from Boston and we arrived in Liverpool, England, about the first week in May.</span> <span id="s74">We were just a general group at that point.</span> <span id="s75">We weren’t assigned to any particular division or anything.</span> <span id="s76">But we were…once we got to England, they assigned us to…in my case, to the Fourth Infantry Division and they were, at that time, had already been there and they were training their troops in southern England in Exeter and Exmouth and Portsmouth area.</span> <span id="s77">And we were brought into there.</span> <span id="s78">And see, this was very close.</span> <span id="s79">We got there in mid-May and the invasion was in the first week in June.</span> <span id="s80">So we only had about two weeks or three weeks to learn the people there that we were gonna with and be integrated into their operation.</span> <span id="s81">So it was a very tight schedule at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Interviewer: And at that point, you didn’t know what the invasion plans would be, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Burgess: No.</span> <span id="s84">We just…no.</span> <span id="s85">We just knew that we were ultimately going to invade Europe, but didn’t know where or exactly when.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Interviewer: So when did you find out and what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Burgess: Well, they sent us to a marshalling area, which was near Plymouth, England.</span> <span id="s88">And it was totally isolated from a security standpoint.</span> <span id="s89">There was a barbed wire in this big, wooded area.</span> <span id="s90">We were in tents.</span> <span id="s91">We had absolutely no communication in or out with anyone.</span> <span id="s92">And we were there for a week before they loaded us onto boats to make the invasion.</span> <span id="s93">So there was no in or out communication at all for that week.</span> <span id="s94">And we knew then that it was very…serious, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Interviewer: It was real and it was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Burgess: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Interviewer: Were you apprehensive, excited?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Burgess: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s99">I think so.</span> <span id="s100">Because, you know, it’s so brand new.</span> <span id="s101">You’d never…had never been through anything like that before.</span> <span id="s102">In training, we had had exercises where we’d crawl on the ground and they would shoot machine gun, live machine gun fire over us.</span> <span id="s103">But this would be the first when someone was actually shooting at you and also the artillery that we had not had any of that shot at us.</span> <span id="s104">So, yeah.</span> <span id="s105">Everybody was very apprehensive about it because it was so new and dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Interviewer: So they’re loading you on the ships.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Burgess: They put us on the ship, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Interviewer: What was your expectation of what was the first thing that was gonna happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Burgess: Well, we didn’t…they told us just briefly what was gonna happen.</span> <span id="s110">They told us this was the invasion.</span> <span id="s111">And they put us on an ocean-going ship—it was not a large ship—in Portsmouth, England.</span> <span id="s112">And we pulled out into the English Channel and we went almost to the French coast.</span> <span id="s113">And I might say one thing.</span> <span id="s114">The one group, not my group but another group ahead of us had gone out the night before and weather was bad and they had to come back in.</span> <span id="s115">We did not.</span> <span id="s116">We stayed in the port.</span> <span id="s117">And then when we finally went, we went all the way on over.</span> <span id="s118">They anchored the ship out of sight of land.</span> <span id="s119">We could not see the land.</span> <span id="s120">We could hear some guns going off.</span> <span id="s121">Then we climbed down what’s called a Jacob’s ladder.</span> <span id="s122">It’s a big rope, mesh rope ladder that’s on the side of the ship and they put us in LCVPs.</span> <span id="s123">That’s landing craft vehicle and personnel.</span> <span id="s124">And these were the landing craft.</span> <span id="s125">And the whole front of it is a ramp, a metal ramp.</span> <span id="s126">So they put us on that and then we went into the shore on the LCVP until it grounded on the sand there.</span> <span id="s127">And then the ramp came down and then we went onto the beach itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Interviewer: Before we get to the beaches…</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Burgess: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Interviewer: Can you tell us a little bit about…you’re in first the larger ship and then in the LCVP.</span> <span id="s131">What are you seeing around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Burgess: Other ships just like that.</span> <span id="s133">[laughter] There were lots of them.</span> <span id="s134">And then there were a lot of warships there, too.</span> <span id="s135">The Navy had battleships and cruisers and all.</span> <span id="s136">They were firing at the time that we were transferring to the LCVP.</span> <span id="s137">They were firing into the shore.</span> <span id="s138">Again, we couldn’t see where anything was landing.</span> <span id="s139">It was dark for one thing.</span> <span id="s140">That was it.</span> <span id="s141">But there were ships all around us and LCVPs coming and going.</span> <span id="s142">It was just like a traffic jam almost.</span> <span id="s143">They would take a group in and then they would come back and get another group and go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Interviewer: So at…about the time that you hit the beaches, could you remember about what time that would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Burgess: It would have been in mid-morning.</span> <span id="s146">My regiment was not the first one.</span> <span id="s147">There’s three regiments in the division and another one of the regiments went in first.</span> <span id="s148">They went in about six o’clock.</span> <span id="s149">Another group went in shortly thereafter.</span> <span id="s150">It must have been, I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s151">It must have been ten or eleven o’clock in the morning on June six.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Interviewer: And this…could you tell us a little bit about the number of men that were actually in the LCVP that you were in?</span> <span id="s153">And did you know all of them?</span> <span id="s154">Were you still together as a unit [inaudible]?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Burgess: Well, we were all the same unit.</span> <span id="s156">I didn’t know all of them though because I hadn’t been with them that long.</span> <span id="s157">Probably fifty were in there.</span> <span id="s158">There were no vehicles in ours.</span> <span id="s159">It was strictly just troops and we were lined up and we had to come off two at a time once we got to the grounding of the LCVP.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Interviewer: So the door comes down.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Burgess: The whole front comes off…comes down, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Interviewer: Just tell us about those next few minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Burgess: Okay.</span> <span id="s164">I have a funny little thing that happened there, too.</span> <span id="s165">[chuckles] At that time, I smoked.</span> <span id="s166">So I had taken a bandolier, which is a canvas or cloth type arrangement that you wear on your shoulder and you put cartridges in there, a clip for the M-1 rifle, in the little pockets in this sash that you have.</span> <span id="s167">Well, we were told ahead of time that they didn’t know when they could re-supply us with things like cigarettes, so we cut the straps off and sewed the bandolier inside of our field jackets and these pockets that fit…the eight-round clip fit into were exactly the same size as a pack of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s168">So I had ten packs of cigarettes sewed into my field jacket.</span> <span id="s169">Well, we got onto…when the ramp came down, I was the second one off on my side.</span> <span id="s170">The first guy had got up there and he and the one beside him got up and he yelled back at the man who was running the LCVP and said, “The ramp’s not all the way down”.</span> <span id="s171">At that point, he steps off and he’s about knee-deep in water and by that time, I had gotten into the middle of another man next to me and he let the ramp down the rest of the way and it flipped both of us over.</span> <span id="s172">We went head first and I cigarettes all over me.</span> <span id="s173">I had tobacco coming down my clothes.</span> <span id="s174">[laughs] Anyway, but I was frightened and I didn’t pay much attention to it at that point.</span> <span id="s175">We were being shot at.</span> <span id="s176">There were shells coming.</span> <span id="s177">The LCVP right next to us was hit and sunk.</span> <span id="s178">But most…I think most of the guys got off of it okay cause it was shallow water at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Interviewer: And you just told…you were just pushing forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Burgess: Correct.</span> <span id="s181">And then when we got onto the…we fortunately had a fairly easy beach from a geographical standpoint.</span> <span id="s182">We went in Utah Beach and Omaha Beach was to our left.</span> <span id="s183">It was a lot rougher cause they had cliffs there and they had some severe fighting trying to get up those cliffs.</span> <span id="s184">Ours was very much flatter than that one was.</span> <span id="s185">And it was a flat beach and then sand dunes beyond there.</span> <span id="s186">And there’s one other thing I’ll tell you in a minute though.</span> <span id="s187">But anyway, we came and got off and as soon as I got up out of the water [laughing] with all my cigarettes, we went onto the beach itself and our assistant division commander was standing there.</span> <span id="s188">He was General Teddy Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s189">He was the son of President Teddy Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s190">And he was a brigadier general.</span> <span id="s191">He was the number two man in our division.</span> <span id="s192">And he was standing on the beach and he was yelling at everybody, “Get off the beach.</span> <span id="s193">Don’t get killed here.</span> <span id="s194">Keep going.”</span> <span id="s195">And all of that was easy as far as walking and that’s concerned.</span> <span id="s196">We were getting no small arms fire.</span> <span id="s197">There were no rifles being shot at us.</span> <span id="s198">Artillery was coming in.</span> <span id="s199">But see, up ahead of us were two other regiments of our own company that had gone ashore for several hours before.</span> <span id="s200">So they had pushed on through and it made it a lot safer for us to get in.</span> <span id="s201">But just over the sand dunes was a marsh area there and it was controlled by some canals that they had, some irrigation canals.</span> <span id="s202">And the Germans had opened them all up and flooded it as soon as the shelling started.</span> <span id="s203">And you had parallel roads off the beach that there were maybe four or five of them that got you across this marshland.</span> <span id="s204">But…and we had to use those.</span> <span id="s205">You couldn’t walk through the marsh.</span> <span id="s206">But the problem is the Germans had all those roads zeroed in with the artillery.</span> <span id="s207">So you had to pick your time when you ran down it.</span> <span id="s208">And that was probably five hundred yards that you had to go on those roads.</span> <span id="s209">That was the toughest part.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Interviewer: It sounds like it.</span> <span id="s211">What were the noises like?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Burgess: Lots of noise.</span> <span id="s213">[laughs] Great deal of noise.</span> <span id="s214">Explosions, ours and theirs both.</span> <span id="s215">But it was shocking because none of us had ever been through anything like that before.</span> <span id="s216">So, then I think finally you just go on adrenaline.</span> <span id="s217">You get paralyzed as far thinking about anything except what you have to do itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Interviewer: So even though you were trained to fight, there wasn’t an opportunity for you then to use your rifle.</span> <span id="s219">You weren’t shooting… Burgess: Well, not at the moment.</span> <span id="s220">There was very shortly thereafter, as soon as we got to the hard land, then they started spreading us out and the units that had gone ahead of us were off somewhere else.</span> <span id="s221">And we just went on.</span> <span id="s222">We had objectives that we had to reach, a crossroad.</span> <span id="s223">We were going toward a town called Sainte Mere-Eglise, which is very well-known in that area.</span> <span id="s224">But we went in maybe a mile, something like that.</span> <span id="s225">And then turned and started toward the city of Cherbourg which forty, fifty miles away.</span> <span id="s226">It was our objective ultimately.</span> <span id="s227">We didn’t get there for two, couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Interviewer: So that first day though, you land around maybe nine in the morning or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Burgess: Except it would be a little later.</span> <span id="s230">Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Interviewer: And then how long do you go that day before that day ended for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Burgess: A long time because at that time of year it doesn’t get dark until ten o’clock at night, in that northern latitude.</span> <span id="s233">So you fight as long as you can see something and then we stopped and dug foxholes and got in there.</span> <span id="s234">So that was it.</span> <span id="s235">So I’d say we were actually…of course, we’d been on the LCVP since sometime during the night.</span> <span id="s236">That must have been four, five o’clock in the…no, earlier than that.</span> <span id="s237">Two or three o’clock in the morning we got on it.</span> <span id="s238">So we’d been on it since then.</span> <span id="s239">Landed say eleven o’clock, something like that and then we were fighting until ten o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s240">And you don’t stop.</span> <span id="s241">You keep…guns are still firing all night.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Interviewer: Did you have a sense then that you were part of something really…</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Burgess: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Interviewer: You knew then.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Burgess: Yeah.</span> <span id="s246">With all those ships and all…everything that was going on, we knew it was large.</span> <span id="s247">And of course, we knew it was the invasion of Europe, which everybody had talked about before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Interviewer: And did you have a sense from your commanders and what you were doing that things were going well?</span> <span id="s249">Did you have a sense of how things were going that day outside of your unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Burgess: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s251">I think no, you don’t know overall how it’s doing because you’re too compartmentalized and everything.</span> <span id="s252">We knew what our company was doing and what our platoon was doing.</span> <span id="s253">But as far as the First Army or what another division was doing, we had no knowledge.</span> <span id="s254">You could hear sounds and you could figure they were inland, so they had landed.</span> <span id="s255">The paratroops had jumped the night before at midnight, around midnight.</span> <span id="s256">Two divisions there, eighty-second and the hundred and first.</span> <span id="s257">And one of our missions was to connect up with them.</span> <span id="s258">And we started connecting with them that same day, later in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s259">And they were…they came through us and then went on back to England after they had been relieved by us.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Interviewer: But you stayed on in France and your objective then…[inaudible].</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Burgess: First…first…excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Interviewer: You said you were on your way to Cherbourg.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Burgess: Cherbourg.</span> <span id="s264">That was our big, main objective early on.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Interviewer: And you got that objective.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Burgess: We got that about the eighteenth or nineteenth of June, yes.</span> <span id="s267">So what…that would be what?</span> <span id="s268">Two weeks.</span> <span id="s269">Something like that.</span> <span id="s270">We had to fight all the way there.</span> <span id="s271">There were Germans everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Interviewer: And then how long did you stay there before you… Burgess: Not long.</span> <span id="s273">They pulled us back out again and we leaped [sic] around and came back down to Saint Leu and there we had a big bomb raid.</span> <span id="s274">They used three thousand American planes that bombed in front of us.</span> <span id="s275">And then they got out of the way.</span> <span id="s276">Then we made an attack.</span> <span id="s277">We’re going south.</span> <span id="s278">And I didn’t get very far cause I got wounded.</span> <span id="s279">[laughs] Right after that I was hit with some shrapnel from an artillery shell and I went back to England at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Interviewer: So at that point near Saint Leu is where is when you first got wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Burgess: Yeah.</span> <span id="s282">Just about three or four days after Saint Leu, yeah.</span> <span id="s283">I was wounded on the thirtieth of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Interviewer: So from that point, can you tell us a little bit about what…you’re a wounded soldier.</span> <span id="s285">How does that work to be taken off the battlefield and sent back to England?</span> <span id="s286">Give us some details on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Burgess: Yeah.</span> <span id="s288">Well, I was hit in the leg so I couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s289">I was helped out by some of the guys in my unit.</span> <span id="s290">We didn’t have a stretcher or anything like that, so I leaned on them and they got me back…I guess, several hundred yards until there was…there were some medical people there and they had a stretcher.</span> <span id="s291">They put me on that and carried me another few hundred yards to a Jeep.</span> <span id="s292">[coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s293">Put me on a Jeep and I was taken from there to an aid station with was, I guess, a couple of miles more back.</span> <span id="s294">And I got my first treatment there.</span> <span id="s295">They had to cut my clothes…some of my…legs of my pants off and they had to work on the wound and all.</span> <span id="s296">And they gave me some…a bandage there.</span> <span id="s297">Then I was put in a…there, I was put in an ambulance and taken to a field hospital, very much like a MASH that you can…have seen on television.</span> <span id="s298">From there, I was put on a hospital ship and went back across the English Channel to Southampton and then they…then I was put in an ambulance there and taken to Oxford.</span> <span id="s299">And I spent two months in the hospital there recovering and riding bicycles a lot, [laughs] rebuilding my leg.</span> <span id="s300">And then went back to my unit again.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Interviewer: Did you expect when you got wounded and sent back to England that you would be back in France again?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Burgess: Didn’t know.</span> <span id="s303">You always…you were hoping you were going back to the States, [laughing] but…mine was not that bad.</span> <span id="s304">It was bad enough.</span> <span id="s305">But you just don’t know.</span> <span id="s306">You have no idea how serious it is or you know, what the recovery period is gonna be or how you’re gonna be after you recover.</span> <span id="s307">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s308">Could I have some water, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Interviewer: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">[tape stop] Interviewer: So we were talking about…you’d been…you were in England, you recovered and now you’re going back…</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Burgess: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Interviewer: …to France.</span> <span id="s313">Do you join up with the same… Burgess: I did.</span> <span id="s314">You didn’t always.</span> <span id="s315">Many times they sent people to other units.</span> <span id="s316">I made a lot of noise and said I wanted to go to my old unit, so they did.</span> <span id="s317">They sent me back there.</span> <span id="s318">I missed one thing.</span> <span id="s319">My division was the…were the first Americans to go into Paris to relieve Paris and I missed all that completely.</span> <span id="s320">I was in the hospital in England so I didn’t get to see Paris then.</span> <span id="s321">I saw it later.</span> <span id="s322">But by the time I rejoined them, they had gone back into the area of the German/Belgium border and the Siegfried Line, which was a big fortification that the Germans had were there.</span> <span id="s323">So I rejoined the unit there.</span> <span id="s324">And shortly after that we got into the roughest fighting that I was in.</span> <span id="s325">Much worse than the beach was the Hirken [phonetic] Forest, which was a major forest just south of Cologne, Germany.</span> <span id="s326">And we were in there for the whole month of November.</span> <span id="s327">I got back about the end of October.</span> <span id="s328">Shortly thereafter, we went into the Hirken Forest and as I say, we had a month of absolutely the toughest fighting that we had.</span> <span id="s329">I was later in the Bulge.</span> <span id="s330">It was not nearly as bad as Hirken Forest.</span> <span id="s331">Hirken Forest was the roughest thing that I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Interviewer: What was different about it?</span> <span id="s333">Could you tell us what a typical day would have like?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Burgess: [laughs] Yeah.</span> <span id="s335">The roughest thing…first of all, there were excellent German troops there.</span> <span id="s336">Probably their best divisions, I think, that we saw at all were defending it.</span> <span id="s337">They were trying to protect Cologne as a major city in Germany.</span> <span id="s338">It would have been the first major city that Americans had captured.</span> <span id="s339">So there was a psychological reason, I guess, for them to fight there.</span> <span id="s340">So they had excellent troops.</span> <span id="s341">The terrain was very hilly and heavy woods, very heavy woods.</span> <span id="s342">And occasionally they’d have fire breaks cut through the woods and the Germans would bring the tanks into the fire…into the fire breaks and shoot at you with…and we had great difficulty getting our equipment in there because there were no lead-in roads from our direction.</span> <span id="s343">And then it was very cold.</span> <span id="s344">We’re into November then.</span> <span id="s345">We’d get periodic snow.</span> <span id="s346">And remember, we were living on the ground.</span> <span id="s347">We were living in holes in the ground.</span> <span id="s348">There were no buildings for us or anything like that.</span> <span id="s349">So it was very tough in that respect.</span> <span id="s350">So you had excellent German soldiers against you, you had bad terrain and you had bad weather.</span> <span id="s351">So the combination was about everything that you don’t want.</span> <span id="s352">And it lasted a month.</span> <span id="s353">It took us a month to get through this forest till we finally broke out and got through it.</span> <span id="s354">But I think that was my, without any doubt, was my toughest time.</span> <span id="s355">I also got a silver star in there.</span> <span id="s356">[laughs] So I was…that came much later.</span> <span id="s357">I got the award very much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Interviewer: Will you tell us a little bit about the service that warranted the silver star?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Burgess: Well, it was in the Hirken Forest and we were dug in in foxholes [sic] along a fire break.</span> <span id="s360">And we’d been there for a couple of days, I guess, fighting with the Germans and the Germans brought some tanks up into the fire break and started shooting at us.</span> <span id="s361">And then they brought some sort of vehicle.</span> <span id="s362">It must have been a halftrack or something like that.</span> <span id="s363">It had a loudspeaker on it.</span> <span id="s364">They were…they asked us…not ask.</span> <span id="s365">They demanded that we surrender.</span> <span id="s366">So we didn’t and they said they would give us thirty minutes to surrender when… Interviewer: They did this in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Burgess: Yes.</span> <span id="s368">And…so at that time, I crawled out of the hole and went back to our company command post and got with the artillery forward observer and we called for artillery fire on those tanks.</span> <span id="s369">We got the tanks out of there.</span> <span id="s370">They pulled out when artillery shells started hitting all around them.</span> <span id="s371">Well then we got an order evacuate, to pull our…all of our troops out.</span> <span id="s372">So I went back up there and we got…one of them…I had to help one guy out.</span> <span id="s373">And we got out and we were missing one of the guys.</span> <span id="s374">So I went back and got him.</span> <span id="s375">He didn’t get the word.</span> <span id="s376">And I brought him out and they gave me an award for all that.</span> <span id="s377">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Interviewer: I’m sure both not only the country but that individual is very happy that you went back there.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Burgess: Yeah.</span> <span id="s380">I lost track of him.</span> <span id="s381">I have no idea what happened to him afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Interviewer: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Burgess: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s384">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Interviewer: But you mentioned that it was for that the you got the Silver Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Burgess: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Interviewer: You got the Silver Star when?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Burgess: It was awarded…I don’t know.</span> <span id="s389">It was about the end of the war in Europe.</span> <span id="s390">I knew I’d been put in for it, but I didn’t know it was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Interviewer: Can you tell us about that day that you got it?</span> <span id="s392">I know we’re kind of jumping ahead here, but… Burgess: You mean when it was awarded?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Interviewer: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Burgess: Well, they had…it was in Germany.</span> <span id="s395">It must have been after the war was over.</span> <span id="s396">And they had this big parade ground.</span> <span id="s397">They made the awards and they called…they had that…our whole regiment was there.</span> <span id="s398">And they called your name and you had to go up and you were given that out in this field.</span> <span id="s399">That was one award.</span> <span id="s400">The other important award I got was…well, I’m jumping ahead on it.</span> <span id="s401">Cause it…</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Interviewer: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Burgess: Okay.</span> <span id="s404">At that point, I had gone into the beach when we landed in Normandy.</span> <span id="s405">I was a corporal.</span> <span id="s406">I went up, got promotions right up because people were getting killed and wounded and all and became a tech sergeant, which is the…it’s the highest rank in the individual platoon.</span> <span id="s407">The second lieutenant is the officer and the tech sergeant is the next ranking person.</span> <span id="s408">So I had reached that.</span> <span id="s409">Unfortunate, [sic] most of the…I guess it was unfortunate.</span> <span id="s410">Most of the time, I had no lieutenant.</span> <span id="s411">They would get hit or wounded or something.</span> <span id="s412">So I ended up running the platoon most of the time.</span> <span id="s413">So my company commander put me in for a commission.</span> <span id="s414">So I got a battlefield commission and it was awarded to me by George Patton, which was an interesting thing.</span> <span id="s415">It was in Luxembourg City where Third Army headquarters were [sic] and this was in January.</span> <span id="s416">They took us into…there were eight of us who were getting them and they took us into a building that…must have been a school building or something.</span> <span id="s417">It looked like that.</span> <span id="s418">And this very large room.</span> <span id="s419">It would have been a…to us it would be like an auditorium in a grammar school, except there were no seats in there.</span> <span id="s420">So we were lined up.</span> <span id="s421">The eight of us were lined up and we waited and we were very grubby looking cause we’d all been line soldiers who were dirty and unshaven and everything.</span> <span id="s422">And in walks George Patton [laughing] with his pearl-handled pistols and his riding boots on and all.</span> <span id="s423">A very striking man.</span> <span id="s424">And he walked in and spoke briefly to all of us.</span> <span id="s425">And then he came down the line and there was a major with him and the major had a clipboard with name and all on it.</span> <span id="s426">He would show it to General Patton and he’d stop at each one.</span> <span id="s427">He got to me and he said, “Where are you from?”</span> <span id="s428">And I said, “Atlanta”.</span> <span id="s429">And he said, “Atlanta’s a good town to go to.</span> <span id="s430">Columbus is terrible, but Atlanta’s good.”</span> <span id="s431">[laughs] Just to lighten the thing up.</span> <span id="s432">And then the major did pin my bar on my collar and then Patton went on.</span> <span id="s433">Then he made another little brief talk and left.</span> <span id="s434">But it was something I’ll never forget anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Interviewer: That must have been such a highlight.</span> <span id="s436">Did you have an opportunity to write home to family to tell them about that experience then?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Burgess: Not entirely.</span> <span id="s438">I just told them I’d gotten the commission and I increased my allotment, I think, at that time.</span> <span id="s439">[laughs] I was single in those days so I didn’t have any responsibilities much.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Interviewer: We’re just gonna go back a little bit we left off [sic].</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Burgess: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Interviewer: So after the Hirken Forest…</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Burgess: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Interviewer: That was successful, but then you had the Battle of the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Burgess: Yeah.</span> <span id="s446">And that was unexpected.</span> <span id="s447">Of course, it was a big surprise to all of us.</span> <span id="s448">Anyway, they took us out of the Hirken Forest and we were pretty well decimated as far as troops were concerned.</span> <span id="s449">A normal platoon, my platoon, would have had about fifty people in it.</span> <span id="s450">I had no officer at that time.</span> <span id="s451">I was a sergeant at that time.</span> <span id="s452">I had no officer, so I was responsible for it.</span> <span id="s453">And out of the fifty, we came out of Hirken Forest…we had about thirty.</span> <span id="s454">The others had been either killed or wounded.</span> <span id="s455">So we lost maybe twenty people in there.</span> <span id="s456">And then…so they said, “Okay.</span> <span id="s457">We’re gonna give you some replacements for the people that you had lost”.</span> <span id="s458">So I got nineteen replacements and the next day they evacuated twenty-one of my people with frostbite and frozen limbs.</span> <span id="s459">So I gained nothing.</span> <span id="s460">In fact, I lost two more in numbers.</span> <span id="s461">They took us at that point and moved us down to Luxembourg and [inaudible] rebuild the division and get us back at full strength again and we’d have a rest period in there.</span> <span id="s462">So we got down there and we dug in.</span> <span id="s463">We were outside of a town named Ekerknock [phonetic] and we were there about a week and the Bulge hit.</span> <span id="s464">And we were the southern corner of the Bulge and we held.</span> <span id="s465">And we were told, “You’ve got to hold” because Third Army Headquarters, Patton’s headquarters, is in Luxembourg City and it’s a straight line from where the German were coming in.</span> <span id="s466">So we did.</span> <span id="s467">We held.</span> <span id="s468">And we finally…well, the Germans were finally defeated, particularly [inaudible].</span> <span id="s469">Then we went into Baston [phonetic] to relieve some of the hundred and first there, the airborne there.</span> <span id="s470">That was the Bulge.</span> <span id="s471">The fighting was bad.</span> <span id="s472">It was very, very cold and we had ice and snow everywhere.</span> <span id="s473">I can remember seeing our tankers, the guys running the tanks, get up in the mornings and come out with a blow torch and cut the ice off of the [inaudible] of the tanks so they could traverse their guns.</span> <span id="s474">They’d freeze up solid every night.</span> <span id="s475">Again, we were living outdoors in holes in the ground and it’s not very comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Interviewer: Did the expectation that the war was wrapping up…when did it feel like to you that it was close?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Burgess: I think immediately after the Bulge.</span> <span id="s478">We weren’t sure about the Bulge.</span> <span id="s479">We didn’t know what anybody else was doing other than what we were doing.</span> <span id="s480">If the Germans had gotten through all the way to the English Channel, which was their goal, it could have…it would have split our troops north and south and we’d been…devastating.</span> <span id="s481">But they didn’t.</span> <span id="s482">We held.</span> <span id="s483">Americans held.</span> <span id="s484">And then they had to pull back.</span> <span id="s485">The Germans had to pull back.</span> <span id="s486">They ran out of everything; ammunition, gasoline, everything else.</span> <span id="s487">And I think once they were defeated there, we started moving forward.</span> <span id="s488">We felt like it was over.</span> <span id="s489">And literally it was, in most instances, for us because from now…we crossed the Rhine River at a town called Wrms, W-R-M-S [sic].</span> <span id="s490">From there, every day we just rode on tanks.</span> <span id="s491">We’d go from one village to the next and go in and clean up the village and then some other troops would come in behind us and they’d stay and we kept going.</span> <span id="s492">We’d go to the next one.</span> <span id="s493">We did that from…literally from February till May eighth, when the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Interviewer: Where were you at that point, when the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Burgess: We were at Badtolzt [phonetic], which is a spa and a very…a resort city south of Munich, right on the edge of the Alps.</span> <span id="s496">And there was snow on the ground May the eighth.</span> <span id="s497">[laughing] There was a lot of snow cause we were right on the edge of the Alps, so we were getting some elevation there.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Interviewer: How did you actually get word that the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Burgess: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s500">I guess…somebody got it on a telephone call or radio call, something of that type.</span> <span id="s501">It was very frightening that night cause the guys shot guns up in the air and we weren’t sure whether we’d be shot by our troops or not.</span> <span id="s502">Cause everybody was very excited.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Interviewer: Do you remember where you were when Roosevelt and how you got the news?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Burgess: Yeah and we thought it was not true.</span> <span id="s505">We thought it was German propaganda that he was dead.</span> <span id="s506">That was what?</span> <span id="s507">April the thirteen, twelfth or thirteenth, I think.</span> <span id="s508">And we were in that period where we were riding tanks everyday.</span> <span id="s509">We’d stop at night.</span> <span id="s510">The only good thing about that trip was number one, we got to ride instead of walk.</span> <span id="s511">And number two, we got to sleep in a house at night cause we’d just take over a house in one of these villages and that would be it for the night.</span> <span id="s512">So that period was very comfortable.</span> <span id="s513">And the Germans weren’t fighting much then.</span> <span id="s514">They were pretty well through.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Interviewer: So when you got the news, you weren’t sure… Burgess: We thought…yeah.</span> <span id="s516">We thought it was propaganda.</span> <span id="s517">We didn’t think it was true.</span> <span id="s518">It was probably the next day before it was confirmed that he had died.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Interviewer: Once the war was over, you stayed in Germany for a while longer.</span> <span id="s520">How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Burgess: We were there…the was over on May eighth and they…we were in the Badtolzt [phonetic]area.</span> <span id="s522">We must have stayed there for a few days.</span> <span id="s523">I might tell one little story there, too.</span> <span id="s524">And then they moved us from there.</span> <span id="s525">But on our way from…into Munich.</span> <span id="s526">We did not go into Munich itself in the beginning.</span> <span id="s527">Another division had gone in there.</span> <span id="s528">Our mission was to go around Munich and cut it off so that they could not re-supply it from any other direction.</span> <span id="s529">That’s why we ended up down near Austria and Switzerland.</span> <span id="s530">But on the way down we were straddling the Autobahn that went into Munich itself.</span> <span id="s531">And the Germans…the airport at Munich had been so bombed and torn up, they couldn’t use it.</span> <span id="s532">All the runways had huge craters in them and all.</span> <span id="s533">So the Germans had gone out to the Autobahn and they paved over the grass median and they were using that as a runway for the airplanes.</span> <span id="s534">Then they’d back their planes off into the woods on each side of the runway.</span> <span id="s535">Also, when we came down there we looked over.</span> <span id="s536">We saw Dachau, the horrible prison camp.</span> <span id="s537">And after the war was over on May the eighth, about the ninth or tenth, two other lieutenants and I got a Jeep and we went back to see Dachau.</span> <span id="s538">And that was a shocking thing.</span> <span id="s539">They had been released, the prisoners had, for, I guess, two weeks by that time.</span> <span id="s540">The gates were open.</span> <span id="s541">They weren’t leaving.</span> <span id="s542">They didn’t know where to go or what to do.</span> <span id="s543">So we went in and we were looking around.</span> <span id="s544">And I can attest to the fact, there absolutely was a Holocaust cause I saw it.</span> <span id="s545">But while we were there, a Jeep came up with a major in it and he had a film crew and they filmed something there.</span> <span id="s546">They were starting to film everything there.</span> <span id="s547">So there must be a record somewhere of all of that.</span> <span id="s548">But he came to us and he wanted to know what we were doing there and we said we were just looking.</span> <span id="s549">And he says, “You’ll have to leave”.</span> <span id="s550">So he outranked us, so we got in our Jeep and left.</span> <span id="s551">But it was really shocking.</span> <span id="s552">It really got to you.</span> <span id="s553">I can remember it even today.</span> <span id="s554">But that was…Dachau was, I don’t know, maybe ten or fifteen miles outside of Munich.</span> <span id="s555">It’s in that area.</span> <span id="s556">But anyway, afterwards, we went back and then they moved our division up north of Munich in the neighborhood of Bamberg, Germany, and we were there from May eighth…about May the fifteenth when we moved, probably till the end of June.</span> <span id="s557">And then they put us on boxcars, freight boxcars.</span> <span id="s558">This is not first-class travel.</span> <span id="s559">[laughs] But we went across from Bamberg all the way across Germany and across France and went to Le Havre, France.</span> <span id="s560">And they had a big camp there.</span> <span id="s561">So we were there for a couple of weeks and they put us on ships and brought us back to the States.</span> <span id="s562">We got home in the middle of July.</span> <span id="s563">I did get into Paris.</span> <span id="s564">[laughing] I got in there for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s565">And it was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Interviewer: To make up for the time you [inaudible].</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Burgess: Yes, it certainly did.</span> <span id="s568">And the other thing, that trip back from Le Havre, though, was not…we’d gone in convoy over when we’d gone through the year before, when we’d gone over to Europe.</span> <span id="s569">But on the way back we were just alone on a liberty ship and it took fourteen days.</span> <span id="s570">It was no challenge to the Queen Mary or anything like that for speed.</span> <span id="s571">But we came into New York City and went up the Hudson River.</span> <span id="s572">And they gave us a salute with the fireboats and all and our ship went on up under George Washington Bridge, up the Hudson, almost up to West Point.</span> <span id="s573">And then they anchored the ship in the river and they took us by boat over to the land.</span> <span id="s574">And there’s Camp Shanks, Calif…Camp Shanks, New York, was up there and we were there only a couple of days and then left and got home.</span> <span id="s575">So that was pretty much it.</span> <span id="s576">[laughs] That’s the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Interviewer: That’s pretty memorable.</span> <span id="s578">We’re about to wrap up.</span> <span id="s579">Was there anything else that you wanted to talk about or add?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Burgess: No, I guess not unless there’s, you know, some particular questions about it.</span> <span id="s581">The other thing is I finally got back home and went back to Georgia Tech and graduated.</span> <span id="s582">Got married.</span> <span id="s583">Three years later my wife was pregnant with twins and I got orders to go to Korea.</span> <span id="s584">I was in the reserves.</span> <span id="s585">And my twins were born, I saw them one day and left the next day on a troop train to go to Korea.</span> <span id="s586">And the next time I saw them they were fifteen months old.</span> <span id="s587">So, that was…my wife always said that I left on purpose, so I didn’t have to handle two girls at that age.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Interviewer: So you came from World War Two.</span> <span id="s589">Did you have any other training before you left for Korea?</span> <span id="s590">Did you have any inkling that you would serve again so soon?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Burgess: No.</span> <span id="s592">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Interviewer: So you left again, went to Korea and served there fifteen months?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Burgess: Fifteen months, yeah.</span> <span id="s595">Then came back home.</span> <span id="s596">Then I got out of the reserves immediately after coming back.</span> <span id="s597">[laughs] Interviewer: Just quickly, in comparison, Korea versus World War Two, your experience, how different?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Burgess: I was…well, it was very much different for me because I was not in the infantry in Korea.</span> <span id="s599">I was in intelligence and although I was still in the Army, I was attached to the First Marine Division in Korea.</span> <span id="s600">And my job there was really was [sic] screening prisoners and refugees and things like that.</span> <span id="s601">So I was in no great danger in Korea, so I didn’t have that threat over me at any time at all.</span> <span id="s602">The weather was bad there in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s603">I just followed bad weather wherever I went apparently.</span> <span id="s604">It was not…the danger was not there.</span> <span id="s605">So it was very different.</span> <span id="s606">I was just anxious to get home and see my family.</span> <span id="s607">In Europe, I was…you always had that constant fear because people were getting killed at all times.</span> <span id="s608">And you never got over it.</span> <span id="s609">It was night.</span> <span id="s610">Day.</span> <span id="s611">And constant.</span> <span id="s612">So, that pressure is very different, I think, from anything else that I’ve ever had in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Interviewer: That leads me to my last question.</span> <span id="s614">The impact that your having served in the military had on the rest of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Burgess: Well, I think it gave me discipline that you don’t normally get.</span> <span id="s616">I think it gave me a lot of memories and you…I guess those are the two biggest things.</span> <span id="s617">I think the other thing, the shock part of it is, I think of all the time I was in Europe, I got to the point very early that it didn’t bother me to see dead German soldiers, but I never got over seeing a dead American.</span> <span id="s618">It just…it always got to you.</span> <span id="s619">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Interviewer: Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Burgess: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Interviewer: This is Marilyn Parr again and we’re still with Mr. Burgess.</span> <span id="s623">We concluded the interview, but found that Mr. Burgess has a lot of artifacts and materials and we’re just gonna talk about some of those.</span> <span id="s624">So you had a story to tell about… Burgess: About this medal here.</span> <span id="s625">This is a German medal and it’s called a “Deutsch A Muter” [phonetic] and it was given out by Hitler to German mothers who in effect signed their children over to the German government.</span> <span id="s626">And they agreed to put them into various youth programs and bring them along.</span> <span id="s627">I picked this up as we were in the final stages of the war when we were going between say Frankfurt and Munich.</span> <span id="s628">And we came to a small village.</span> <span id="s629">I don’t even remember the name of the town now.</span> <span id="s630">There was a large building in there.</span> <span id="s631">It was a hospital and so we went into the hospital and everybody in there were pregnant females.</span> <span id="s632">So we asked questions and found out that that’s what they were.</span> <span id="s633">They were in there and they were gonna give their children after they were born to the German government.</span> <span id="s634">And for that, they gave out medals, this being one of them.</span> <span id="s635">And on the back is Hitler’s signature and that’s it.</span> <span id="s636">And I got this from one of the supervisor women there.</span> <span id="s637">She had received it earlier in nineteen thirty-eight.</span> <span id="s638">This would have been nineteen forty-four, forty-five, I guess.</span> <span id="s639">So, it was that much earlier.</span> <span id="s640">I got that and that was one of the artifacts that I brought with me.</span> <span id="s641">I have some others here.</span> <span id="s642">This is off of a cap.</span> <span id="s643">It was a swastika that was on a German soldier’s cap and this was a breast plate that was from another one.</span> <span id="s644">And I have lots of things of that type.</span> <span id="s645">You wanted to find out something about what my family was doing here while I was gone and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Interviewer: While your family was here, your Atlanta connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Burgess: Okay.</span> <span id="s648">At that point I was not married.</span> <span id="s649">I had been a student in college and my mother and father and two sisters were here in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s650">And this is…we went to Peachtree Road Presbyterian Church up at the corner of Matheson and Peachtree.</span> <span id="s651">And when I was awarded the Silver Start, my father gave them a copy of the citation [laughs], so they printed it in the church bulletin.</span> <span id="s652">And this is what this is right here.</span> <span id="s653">I have two maps here of my division.</span> <span id="s654">Half of it is from the beach up through Paris up to the German border and the other half is from the German border on down to the end of the war in Munich.</span> <span id="s655">This is a copy of the Stars and Stripes Newspaper the day the war was over.</span> <span id="s656">They had…you can see here everybody was very happy about that one.</span> <span id="s657">That’s pretty much it.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Interviewer: You mentioned being very proud of your… Burgess: My division?</span> <span id="s659">Yeah.</span> <span id="s660">The Fourth Division right now is in Iraq and they are the division, they are the people that captured Saddam Hussein recently.</span> <span id="s661">And they’re there now and they’re taking some heavy casualties, but I’m always proud of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Interviewer: We’re gonna talk again a little bit about your experience in Korea.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Burgess: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Interviewer: Talked a little bit about it before.</span> <span id="s665">Can you again tell us, when were you notified, when did you know and how were you notified that you would be going to Korea?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Burgess: I was notified with some orders that were sent to me by the Army.</span> <span id="s667">I was notified in September of nineteen fifty.</span> <span id="s668">And I was told to go to Fort McPherson and get a physical and be prepared to be called up on active duty.</span> <span id="s669">So I did that.</span> <span id="s670">And as I said, my wife was pregnant with twins at that time.</span> <span id="s671">And they were born on December first.</span> <span id="s672">In the meantime, I went to Fort Mac and passed my physical.</span> <span id="s673">A funny thing there, the psychiatrist that you had to check was…he asked me, he says, “I only have one question.”</span> <span id="s674">And I said, “What is that?”</span> <span id="s675">And he says, “Are you happy about going back to the war?”</span> <span id="s676">I said, “Absolutely not.”</span> <span id="s677">And he says, “Okay, you pass.”</span> <span id="s678">So, anyway I was put back in the service then.</span> <span id="s679">I went to…first I went to Fort Bragg, North Carolina.</span> <span id="s680">We were there briefly and then back to Fort Gordon over at Augusta.</span> <span id="s681">From there, as I said earlier, I got on a troop train after having seen my children for one day and we went to Camp Stoneman, California.</span> <span id="s682">And they put us on planes there and they flew us to Toyko, outside of Toyko to a Japanese, what had been a Japanese camp.</span> <span id="s683">And we were there for a couple of weeks, I guess.</span> <span id="s684">Then they put us on ships and took us into Pusan [phonetic], Korea.</span> <span id="s685">I was part of an organization called UNCACK, which was United Nations Civil Assistance Command Korea.</span> <span id="s686">And actually what it was, we did not function as a civil assistance unit.</span> <span id="s687">It was set up by the UN to essentially put the Korean nation back together after the fighting was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">[Tape 1, Side B] Burgess: So, we couldn’t understand why we were there yet, because it was not time.</span> <span id="s689">So, they said, “Well, you’re here and you’re trained.”</span> <span id="s690">So some of us were put into a group to serve as intelligence people.</span> <span id="s691">The First Marine Division did not have that type of organization in their structure.</span> <span id="s692">So I was attached to the First Marine Division the whole time I was there.</span> <span id="s693">And we were basically up around the thirty-eighth parallel and we spent our time back and forth in that area.</span> <span id="s694">Again, my activities there were quite different from what they’d been in Europe, because there I’d been in infantry and been fighting and this one I was basically just interviewing prisoners and refugees.</span> <span id="s695">And there were lots of refugees who came flowing through there.</span> <span id="s696">Trying to spot anybody who shouldn’t be there.</span> <span id="s697">And we found quite a few.</span> <span id="s698">And that was it.</span> <span id="s699">I lived there.</span> <span id="s700">I lived in the Marine Division Headquarters.</span> <span id="s701">And division headquarters is very different from a line company where the fighting was going on.</span> <span id="s702">I lived in a tent, had a stove in the tent.</span> <span id="s703">And it was very cold, but it was quite comfortable.</span> <span id="s704">We had hot food all the time.</span> <span id="s705">Had showers, which I had no idea existed in wartime because we’d had none of that in Europe.</span> <span id="s706">So anyway, came back after…I finally got to Korea in December of fifty, later December.</span> <span id="s707">In January of fifty-two, which would have been thirteen months later, got to come home.</span> <span id="s708">They brought us back to Japan.</span> <span id="s709">Didn’t fly us back.</span> <span id="s710">We had to get on a ship then.</span> <span id="s711">It was a slow trip.</span> <span id="s712">We came back to Seattle to…I can’t remember the name of the fort.</span> <span id="s713">Fort Lewis, Washington.</span> <span id="s714">And we were there for a few days.</span> <span id="s715">And then flew back to Fort Benning and I was released from Fort Benning then and got to see my children who were then fifteen months old for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Interviewer: During the time that you were there in Korea, what kind of communication were you able to have with your wife?</span> <span id="s717">Did she send you pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Burgess: Yeah.</span> <span id="s719">Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s720">Constantly.</span> <span id="s721">And they were good.</span> <span id="s722">She sent me little flip books with the pictures in them.</span> <span id="s723">And she wrote a lot more often that I did and she kept me informed as to how they were coming and I heard lots of terrible stories about how bad these kids were, which was not true.</span> <span id="s724">But they…she got my sympathy anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Interviewer: What were your children’s names?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Burgess: My children’s names?</span> <span id="s727">Well, the twin daughters, the one was named Jan and the other was named Kim.</span> <span id="s728">She was named after her mother.</span> <span id="s729">Her name was Kimsy [phonetic] and we called her Kim.</span> <span id="s730">That was a family name.</span> <span id="s731">And Kim lives in Atlanta now.</span> <span id="s732">She lives in Garden Hills.</span> <span id="s733">And Jan lives in California.</span> <span id="s734">The twins have split.</span> <span id="s735">And then I have one third daughter, about a year after I got back.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Interviewer: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Burgess: Her name is Katie.</span> <span id="s738">Katherine.</span> <span id="s739">She also lives in California.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Interviewer: So for you the military part was definitely going to be over.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Burgess: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s742">I got out of reserves at the end of Korea.</span> <span id="s743">I think I’d had enough.</span> <span id="s744">The one other funny thing, several years later, I guess, one morning when I walked into the kitchen, my wife was there and she said, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s745">And I said, “What are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s746">And she says, “There’s a war going on in Vietnam.</span> <span id="s747">Why aren’t you there?”</span> <span id="s748">[laughter] I said, “I’m going to skip this one, I think.”</span> <span id="s749">So I didn’t go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Interviewer: In comparison to World War Two and you had said earlier that you were expecting that you knew that you were going to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Burgess: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Interviewer: Korea was a different situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Burgess: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Interviewer: How did you feel about the war in Korea compared to World War Two?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Burgess: I didn’t question our need to be there.</span> <span id="s756">I questioned my need to be there.</span> <span id="s757">[laughs] I don’t think there were many others who could go who hadn’t been anywhere before.</span> <span id="s758">There was a small degree of bitterness there, I guess, that I got called back again five years after having been in Europe for a long period of time.</span> <span id="s759">But no, I felt that we did a good job there.</span> <span id="s760">I think we accomplished our purpose there.</span> <span id="s761">It dragged on, on and on with those talks that they had at Padamajam [phonetic].</span> <span id="s762">I was gone when they were still talking about that.</span> <span id="s763">And that part was unpleasant, but I think we proved our point there, that we stopped the…first the North Koreans and secondly, the Chinese from taking over the rest of Korea.</span> <span id="s764">And I think all of Korea today exists because we fought that war and saved the country for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Interviewer: So you were here in Atlanta then when you got news that end of Korea.</span> <span id="s766">It wasn’t the same as victory in Europe when you were in Europe…</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Burgess: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Interviewer: …when Korea was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Burgess: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Interviewer: Tell us about that day when you heard and knew that Korea was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Burgess: Well, I’m not sure that I felt like it was completely over because it was a truce, but there was no…as you said, there was no victory and I think, again, there was a feeling of pleasure that we had accomplished what we were there for.</span> <span id="s772">But you never trusted the North Koreans, that they would live up to the agreements that they made and they even sit there today.</span> <span id="s773">And I think one of the great problems today is that we’re afraid that they may come back again.</span> <span id="s774">And the city of Seoul is within artillery range of where the thirty-eighth parallel is.</span> <span id="s775">They can actually reach it with artillery pieces.</span> <span id="s776">So it’s a very touch and go situation.</span> <span id="s777">So there’s not the feeling of elation like you had when the Germans had been defeated and later the Japanese were defeated.</span> <span id="s778">So, you never had that strong feeling like that after Korea.</span> <span id="s779">You just felt like, “Well, they’re not going to fight anymore.</span> <span id="s780">We’re not going to have anymore casualties.”</span> <span id="s781">But…and we stopped them where they are.</span> <span id="s782">But beyond that it was…that was it.</span> <span id="s783">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Interviewer: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Burgess: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time again and share with us your artifacts.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Burgess: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">[end of tape]</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Atlanta History Center</span></p> <p><span id="s790">WWII Oral
