is that near?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: The Carpathian Mountain by the border of Czechoslovakia and Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: June 6th, 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Who were the other members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I have a brother named Aaron, a sister Monia, Minia, and Genia (sp.)</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And were they older or younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I was the oldest in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What were your parents' names?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: My father is -- was Marcus Kolber and my mother, Leona Mandelberg Kolber.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: What kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: My father owned a lumberyard in an adjacent town of where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: How would you describe your family?</span> <span id="s31">Was it middle class?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Well, in those days was considered middle class because we -- my father was in business and he employed some of the inhabitants of this particular town.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Was your family a very religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: No.</span> <span id="s35">My father was not very religious but we attend services in the next small town because the town where I was born and where we lived later, it was composed only of two other Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: So both towns were not primarily Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: No, they were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: How large was the town that you first lived in, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Well, approximately it was maybe hundred or 115 inhabitants but they were all Roman Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And when did you move to the next town?</span> <span id="s41">Do you remember what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Or how old you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: From the time when I was born, apparently -- I do not remember when we moved.</span> <span id="s45">Apparently, I was very young --</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: You were still young.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: -- because my brother, who was born two years later, was born already in the next town.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s49">Did you live -- what was the next town that you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: __________ (sounds like Parcheetza).</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: And is that in the same general location?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: That is the same general location.</span> <span id="s53">It's only like three kilometers away from the town where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And you had said that there were also only two other families that were Jewish in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: That is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s57">And did you grow up right in the center of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s59">I grew up in the center of the town and when -- and I attended public school there.</span> <span id="s60">And at age of 11 or ten, my father hired a tutor who taught us the -- prepared for the bar mitzvah, me and my brother.</span> <span id="s61">And we had this man -- or different men living with us.</span> <span id="s62">So he was tutoring me, my brother, and later my sisters in religious observance.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Let's talk about your experiences with non-Jews when you were a young child because you must have had many of them because there were only two other families.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Well, in my case, I have to say that the neighbors treated us quite well.</span> <span id="s65">We did not experience like in other area because my father employed quite a large number of the villagers.</span> <span id="s66">So they had to be quite decent with us.</span> <span id="s67">As a matter of fact, I went to school with one of the fellows, who later, I feel that he saved my life because he came to Auschwitz much earlier than me and he had, by the time I arrived in Auschwitz, he was a __________ (sounds like schrieber) on the block.</span> <span id="s68">That's a quite high position.</span> <span id="s69">And he helped me quite a lot with the food and protect me from the atrocities which were occurring in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s71">We'll talk about that a little later.</span> <span id="s72">When you were young, what about your playmates generally?</span> <span id="s73">Did you experience any antisemitism among your playmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s75">Very little.</span> <span id="s76">Because, as I explained previously, those people were depending on the livelihood from my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: And the teachers --</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: The teachers --</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: -- did not give you any problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: The teachers never gave me any problem, because, as -- it was a village.</span> <span id="s81">It was not a town.</span> <span id="s82">And those teachers used to be involved with my mother because she was more intelligent than the normal villagers.</span> <span id="s83">So they came and sometimes socialized together.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Were you in any youth groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Did you do any sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s90">Not organized sports.</span> <span id="s91">I played soccer, which was very popular in Poland, but nothing organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s93">When did you first notice a change?</span> <span id="s94">What is the first thing that became apparent?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Well, in 1939, when the Germans start to occupy Poland, some of the inhabitants became Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s96">That means that they were claiming that their ancestor were from German descent.</span> <span id="s97">And they got some positions of importance.</span> <span id="s98">And then there were like -- they felt they're much, they are much better and that -- but actually they did not -- maybe there was overt antisemitism.</span> <span id="s99">Did not, I didn't feel any repercussion from them except they did not socialize or have anything to do with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: You were 16 years old when the war began in Poland.</span> <span id="s101">Do you remember that actual moment when they came to your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Oh, I do remember this because we -- my father felt, the day the war broke, that was September 1st, 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: --'39, that we were not very secure in this village.</span> <span id="s105">So we packed our belongings on a horse and wagon -- actually, we didn't have no cars -- and went to the next town to be between Jews, where the town was, Stary Sacz (please check).</span> <span id="s106">And I would say it was at least 100 to 150 Jewish family live in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: What was the name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Stary Sacz.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: And then you stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: We were there for about two days.</span> <span id="s111">And there was some incident at this first encounter with the Germans.</span> <span id="s112">They order all Jews to assemble on the marketplace.</span> <span id="s113">And they selected, I don't remember exactly, ten or 15 of the people, ordering them, and they shot them there.</span> <span id="s114">Then --</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: This is something you witnessed.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes, I witnessed.</span> <span id="s117">That was my first part, encounter with the Germans.</span> <span id="s118">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: You were 16 years old at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Yes, I was 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: What were your feelings, then, when you saw that as a young man?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Well, my feeling was that, here I am, witnesses finally what I had for few years, what the Germans are capable of do to the Jews.</span> <span id="s123">After the execution of those people, they also selected a hundred of people and locked them up in a school building overnight.</span> <span id="s124">My father was between those.</span> <span id="s125">And that was quite big shock to the family because we did not know what will happen with those hostages.</span> <span id="s126">Next morning, though, they were released and after, oh, I don't know, three, four hours, we packed our belongings and went back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: And the next experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Well, the next experience was just that from time to time we were inducted in the work groups.</span> <span id="s129">In Poland the roads are not paved like we have paved here.</span> <span id="s130">They were, like, dirt roads.</span> <span id="s131">So we were, during the summer and fall, we built the roads.</span> <span id="s132">We chopped the stones that the roads are always ready for the transport of their heavy equipment and -- the German equipment.</span> <span id="s133">And in winter we shoveled snow because the climate in Poland was much more severe than we have it here.</span> <span id="s134">And we were -- the roads have to be clear for the army to be moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Are we talking about summer and fall of 1940 or --</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: We are speaking -- no, of winter of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: And the spring and fall and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: -- the winter in '40.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: In '40.</span> <span id="s142">And what was the name of the town that you were in then?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: __________ (Parcheetza).</span> <span id="s144">I lived -- I came back --</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Oh, that was back to your town.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s150">Okay.</span> <span id="s151">So you were building roads.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Building roads and cleaning roads of the snow.</span> <span id="s153">Of course we, as I previously said, there were only two other Jewish family so the workforce consisted of much more.</span> <span id="s154">They brought Jews from adjacent villages and they were always ready to, we were ready to work on --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Were you living at home at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s157">I was living at home.</span> <span id="s158">And those conditions were to about 1941, when the __________ (sounds like youthenlaut) in Stary Sacz was ordered to select about 100 young people from __________ (sounds like Ermitz) and to be sent to Rabka, R-A-P-K-A: The time when we were told that we will go to this place, we did not know what the function of our work will be.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: What part of 1941 was this, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: May.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: In May.</span> <span id="s162">Okay.</span> <span id="s163">And you were one of these hundred people.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yes, I was one of those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Are these all men?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: All men.</span> <span id="s167">We arrived there sometimes in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Were you the only member of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: I was the only member of my family because -- well, maybe that's the best time to explain.</span> <span id="s170">My father was chosen by the man who was the __________ (sounds like guylighter) for this lumberyard as a necessary operator of this -- the German needed the lumber and the wheat, which -- so my father with my younger brother were working there.</span> <span id="s171">So that's why they were not selected for any ordered transport.</span> <span id="s172">But I went with this hundred people to Rabka.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: How far away was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Oh, 40 kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: On a train.</span> <span id="s177">We got tickets.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: So it was a passenger train?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Passenger, passenger train.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Were you very frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No, I was not frightened because we did not know exactly what -- we thought that in this part of the country, they need young men for the same purpose as we were working previously because it was quite natural that they selected from one part people to go to another part.</span> <span id="s182">We were on their mercy.</span> <span id="s183">They -- So when we arrived there on Monday morning, we found that this was an SS school to train young volunteer Ukraines to become SS.</span> <span id="s184">The commandant of this school, by the name of Rosenbaum, greeted us with selecting one tenth of the transport, ten people, and he shot in front of us the ten young healthy men.</span> <span id="s185">It was -- this time it really, we realize that the German mean what they were saying, that they have to destroy the Jews.</span> <span id="s186">We lived there in Rabka.</span> <span id="s187">The Jewish community of this Rabka was assigned to provide food and shelter for us.</span> <span id="s188">And we lived there and went to the school.</span> <span id="s189">That was a very short walk, maybe ten minutes' walk, every morning.</span> <span id="s190">We walked there in the beginning.</span> <span id="s191">We built a shooting gallery, digging in the mountain and preparing the war for -- a shooting gallery they built there to train the new recruits how is the most efficient way to shoot.</span> <span id="s192">But after about four weeks spending the time there, the adjacent town, ghettos, were to be liquidated and the people were transported to Rabka.</span> <span id="s193">And Rosenbaum had a couple actions.</span> <span id="s194">And then we really knew what were our duty were there.</span> <span id="s195">We were gravediggers and we bury all people which were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: They had these actions in Rabka.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: In Rabka in this particular mountains earlier where the school was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: And you said you were a gravedigger.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s200">The other 90, 90 young men, because there were 90 in the beginning, but later on, seven of us, of the group escaped.</span> <span id="s201">And to punish the remain of us, he took 21 and hang.</span> <span id="s202">So there were only left about 65 or maybe 70.</span> <span id="s203">Life there was, I find that the first came in Rabka gave much deeper impression on us than the large camps or were much more people killed in Auschwitz but more vivid things I remember from Rabka because this commandant spent time.</span> <span id="s204">We have seen him every minute of the day and sometimes if he felt like, he came to the camp, woke us up, and direct us running all around the place.</span> <span id="s205">And his specialty, he had a reitpeitsche, that's a whip, and if he didn't like someone, he hit them from the back.</span> <span id="s206">He cut his eye or -- and by the next action, you were marked that you will be shot.</span> <span id="s207">So it was quite hard for a young man to live with this hanging all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: You had said that the Jewish community was giving you food and shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: So were you living at the camp, though?</span> <span id="s211">You had said you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Well, the school was about ten minutes away from the --</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Town?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: From the quarters where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: So you didn't live with other Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: No.</span> <span id="s217">It was made as a small camp, only we had guards on the gate where we lived.</span> <span id="s218">It was three small buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s220">You slept in barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: No, no, we slept in the -- originally there were Jewish buildings, maybe two family in each.</span> <span id="s222">So there were, let's say, eight rooms in each quarters.</span> <span id="s223">So put 24 people in each room.</span> <span id="s224">Slept on the floor, slept on the beds.</span> <span id="s225">But that was a small, very small camp, consisting of 70, 65 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: And what about the food situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: The food situation?</span> <span id="s228">The Jewish community had to provide it.</span> <span id="s229">There was somebody who cooked and when we came -- in the morning we got a ration of bread and a coffee.</span> <span id="s230">And in the evening when we came back to our quarters, we got a soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Nothing in the middle of the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No, nothing in the middle of the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: And what were you wearing?</span> <span id="s234">Your own clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: We wear our own clothes, which we brought from home.</span> <span id="s236">Every four weeks or so, we got a pass to go home, ten each.</span> <span id="s237">Each week on a Saturday he permit us to go home, ten of us.</span> <span id="s238">Then we waited for our turn.</span> <span id="s239">And Sunday afternoon we came back.</span> <span id="s240">It was a short ride on a train from time -- from the place where we were living.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Did you have to wear any identifying signs showing you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: We -- the clothes were only painted yellow stripes.</span> <span id="s243">In the beginning, it was not -- oh, yeah, we had the, every Jew had to wear the Mogen David on the white with the blue thing.</span> <span id="s244">But otherwise, in the beginning, it was not required in the small camps, work camps, to be any way else identified.</span> <span id="s245">Well, this lasted for about two months or three months.</span> <span id="s246">And we heard that the ghetto in Stary Sacz, because eventually my parents were also moved from the village where we lived to a ghetto, Stary Sacz, that the ghetto going to be liquidated and everybody going to go -- be sent.</span> <span id="s247">So on this particular week, we all got the permit from Rosenbaum to go home to say goodbye to our families.</span> <span id="s248">I don't really know if our parents knew exactly the condition because we did not share every brutality as what happened to us and what we have seen to the parents, at least I will speak for myself.</span> <span id="s249">I felt that there's no point to burden the parents what is going on with us.</span> <span id="s250">They had enough problems of their own.</span> <span id="s251">So I did not share too much.</span> <span id="s252">I went with general ideas, what's going on, that -- but I did not inform them.</span> <span id="s253">They knew that they killed ten of us because ten never came home.</span> <span id="s254">But what we were doing, that we were gravediggers and we buried people, I did not share this with them.</span> <span id="s255">But there was a general feeling that more or less they knew that they will go to some camp.</span> <span id="s256">And Sunday, when we had to go back home, my father took the group, because we still had a couple horses, from the ghetto to the train station.</span> <span id="s257">It was not a long ride but it was much better to give us a ride than we should walk because there was no other way to get there.</span> <span id="s258">So he came there to say goodbye to us.</span> <span id="s259">And I said goodbye to him already and went back almost to the train.</span> <span id="s260">And in the last minute, I decide to go back and I jumped over the fence, because by the train station there was a fence, to say another goodbye to my father.</span> <span id="s261">And the SS guard saw me and started beating me.</span> <span id="s262">And it's not the pain of my -- what hurt me but the feeling of my father, who was helpless, that he could not help anything to his son.</span> <span id="s263">That was more painful.</span> <span id="s264">But eventually we got away.</span> <span id="s265">And a few weeks later we found out that the ghetto from Stary Sacz was sent to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s266">We knew very well what Treblinka was.</span> <span id="s267">Treblinka was just a camp where people went to be killed, gassed.</span> <span id="s268">Meanwhile, those actions in Rabka continue in much bigger pace than originally because apparently they felt that this part of Poland has to ____________ (youthenlate) -- euthanized (please check) and they will have to kill more.</span> <span id="s269">So then it was almost every day that he created an action.</span> <span id="s270">Rosenbaum, when the graves were ready, dug, we dug almost from the morning into like 4:00, then he inspected all those, if they're large enough.</span> <span id="s271">Then we went to the quarters, where we lived.</span> <span id="s272">We had some food.</span> <span id="s273">And we were ordered in the evening to come back and watch the actions.</span> <span id="s274">He grouped the people by the graves.</span> <span id="s275">They had to be disrobed, put the clothes on the side, and stay by the ditch.</span> <span id="s276">He generally gave the SS men some whiskey and -- oop, sorry -- gave an order to shoot.</span> <span id="s277">Take this away?</span> <span id="s278">No.</span> <span id="s279">After the graves were filled, we had to throw the dirt with some disinfectant.</span> <span id="s280">And next morning we cut the -- make like sod from further away and brought cover, that there was no, any evidence that there were graves there.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Were there men and women together?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: To be killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: To be killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s285">Men and women together and children that were killed.</span> <span id="s286">On one action he killed a family which lived in Rabka by the name of Rosenbaum.</span> <span id="s287">He found out that the people beared the same name as him.</span> <span id="s288">Then he was -- he felt that it was -- the son had his name so he tried to kill them.</span> <span id="s289">Of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: What was the commandant's first name?</span> <span id="s291">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Some place I have the --</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: In those --</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s296">It's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: -- newspaper clipping because -- all right.</span> <span id="s298">Yeah, that, I will have to come.</span> <span id="s299">After three or four months, I was sent from Rabka to Krakow.</span> <span id="s300">Krakow at this particular time was still a ghetto.</span> <span id="s301">We lived in ghetto for about four weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Are you talking about the fall of '41 or --</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: That was in fall '41, yeah, or early winter.</span> <span id="s304">Lived there for about four weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I was transported.</span> <span id="s307">He got -- Rosenbaum sent two trucks filled up, with us on top.</span> <span id="s308">Krakow from Rabka was very, a short distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Did you go with a whole group of young men?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s311">Part -- half of the camp from Rabka was sent to Krakow.</span> <span id="s312">But I would like to go back to Rosenbaum.</span> <span id="s313">In 1968, he came back home to Hamburg and he told the German authority that he's back from the war, he was in the Wehrmacht, that's the army, and he likes to get a pension from the German government.</span> <span id="s314">When I arrived to United States, I register for Wiedergutmachung to the -- from German and I got all the -- I gave this organization all the information, which camps I spent and what the name of the commandant were there.</span> <span id="s315">So they contacted the German -- the German authority contacted, apparently, the Jewish organization and they got my name.</span> <span id="s316">And they send me, first, the prosecutor from the trial sent me a telegram if I am willing to come and first recognize -- they show me pictures of him and I recognize him, if I am willing to go to Hamburg to testify to his trial.</span> <span id="s317">In the beginning, I was quite hesitant because it was only '68.</span> <span id="s318">I started -- I was married.</span> <span id="s319">I had two young children.</span> <span id="s320">And to renew the wounds was quite hard for me.</span> <span id="s321">But after discussion with my wife, we decide that it's my duty, because there was really, there were only three left from the whole group who were in Rabka who could testify as witnesses to his atrocities.</span> <span id="s322">So we went to Hamburg and testified.</span> <span id="s323">I had my wife and my two children, then I had only two, right now I have three children, to Germany and I, I testified for, I think, three days there to his trial.</span> <span id="s324">And, I don't know, I had a feeling when I was in camp with him that he was a big statue, big, heavy-built man.</span> <span id="s325">After I met him on the witness stand, he was just a normal, small -- so apparently his authority of life and death, which he had make in our mind, the statue so big.</span> <span id="s326">And he got convicted and he got life in prison.</span> <span id="s327">I don't know.</span> <span id="s328">I didn't follow this up, if he's still alive or he's out of his -- but at least that was a satisfaction, that, after all, he killed enough Jews but he did not kill everybody.</span> <span id="s329">There were some who could witness his -- and give witness to the future generations.</span> <span id="s330">And he was punished.</span> <span id="s331">Of course I don't feel that the punishment was -- met the crime but here at least he was punished.</span> <span id="s332">And then I -- with the Germans, the young people, I have to say that at this time when we were there, we were treated quite nice.</span> <span id="s333">And the Germans had, at the time when we were there, some also guilt feeling because they, I presume they had to ask the fathers where were your grandfathers at this particular time, what did you do during the war.</span> <span id="s334">So there was some, I don't know, maybe I'm not -- I had some sympathy with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Let's go back to when you were -- you were sent to Krakow, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s337">We're going to go back, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: We were sent to Krakow because apparently the authorities there, knowing that we already experience for months how to build the quarters for -- because first we had to build a couple barracks for the SS there.</span> <span id="s340">So they decided they're going to build a camp, a war camp near Krakow by the name of Plaszow.</span> <span id="s341">For about two or three weeks, we walked every day, a group of us, from Krakow and then there was another detachment from the ghetto to Plaszow to prepare for the camp because that's where -- their way to build the camp.</span> <span id="s342">They had -- apparently, they wanted to eventually evacuate the Krakow ghetto and the people who lived in the ghetto will be sent to the camp.</span> <span id="s343">Krakow -- Plaszow, rather, at those days had another commandant than this __________ (sounds like get) who was portrayed in Schindler's List because that is the same camp as is portrayed in Schindler's List.</span> <span id="s344">Well, those days we knew there are many different industrialists who were renting the Jewish labor from the camp of Krakow, Plaszow, but we did not pay too much attention about Schindler.</span> <span id="s345">We knew he had -- that there were some people who worked in his part.</span> <span id="s346">There were parts in the pants factory.</span> <span id="s347">But later on when it was already close to evacuate Krakow and Schindler tried to organize a larger group, we knew that people who, either who lived in ghetto or previously who had some means to get on the list, I never -- in Krakow I was quite already, what did you call this then, Muselmann.</span> <span id="s348">In other words, I was not very healthy.</span> <span id="s349">I just work.</span> <span id="s350">Because the work was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s351">I -- By the end, after a year and a half working just with the digging ditches and building barracks, I was transferred to a carpenter's factory because a man who was in charge of the carpenter's factory was acquaintance of my father.</span> <span id="s352">And after he found out that I'm there in Krakow, he took me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: What were your living conditions like in Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: In Krakow they were very, very poor because there were very -- we built these barracks quite quickly.</span> <span id="s355">And we slept there three rows high, like you have here in this museum, how the sleeping, we slept on wood three story high.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: This is in Krakow or Plaszow?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Plaszow, Plaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: No, no.</span> <span id="s359">But when you were living in Krakow, what were the conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Well, that was a very short time and we spent very little time --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: -- in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: You went right to Plaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: We -- that was the purpose of bringing us to Krakow ghetto, to build, to show the people how to build a camp.</span> <span id="s365">Because we were the experienced carpenters.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: So you're sleeping in the barracks in Plaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: After we built two or three barracks, we did not go no more to ghetto.</span> <span id="s368">We slept there.</span> <span id="s369">We built a kitchen.</span> <span id="s370">And one of the -- was selected to cook.</span> <span id="s371">He was never any, had knowledge of cooking but, you know, you learn quickly.</span> <span id="s372">In Krakow, I spent about two years.</span> <span id="s373">In 1944, (inaudible) '44, one morning -- I worked on the night shift because they worked, people who worked day and night.</span> <span id="s374">There were two --</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: This is in the carpentry?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: In the carpentry, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Were you getting enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: The food were almost, in every camp they were the same.</span> <span id="s379">You got, in the morning, four ounces of black bread and a pint of coffee.</span> <span id="s380">And in the evening you got a pint of watery soup.</span> <span id="s381">If you have any means, like people who lived in Krakow previously, who brought from the ghetto something, because it was possible to smuggle stuff, then they had, for money or gold or diamonds, there were a way to buy.</span> <span id="s382">But as I previously stated, I was quite down in my life in Krakow.</span> <span id="s383">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Were you wearing, still wearing your own --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Still wearing civilian clothes and still just yellow paint.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: A stripe on your clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: A stripe on the clothes.</span> <span id="s388">And no more, even, no more, because this was a camp, no more white --</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Star?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: -- arm bands.</span> <span id="s391">You see, through the whole thing, I feel somehow that was luck.</span> <span id="s392">If I say that I was sent from Krakow to Auschwitz was luck, it was, to me, because we -- oh, I skipped.</span> <span id="s393">When we were ready to go to the barracks on this one particular morning --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: This is in Plaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: In Plaszow -- the guards took us on the appellplatz and we didn't know what, what was wrong.</span> <span id="s396">We were not permitted to go to our barracks no more.</span> <span id="s397">We were put in different barracks and the guards were all around.</span> <span id="s398">Rumors came.</span> <span id="s399">I mean, we heard from the Jewish inmates who were in the police, Jewish police, that we will go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s400">But we heard already what Auschwitz was and we were prepared for the worst.</span> <span id="s401">We told --</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: How had you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Well, people who were living in Krakow-Plaszow, they were working on certain, with certain groups, went outside, out of town, of the camp, and worked with the Polish civilians, who were masons, carpenters, or other -- so it came through the grapevine that Auschwitz was a camp where people mostly go to be gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">And the condition of our health was such that we already were resigned, well, you're gonna die, you're gonna die, what else can you do.</span> <span id="s405">There's nothing else you could do.</span> <span id="s406">After two days spent there in this barrack, finally we were, one evening we were put on a train and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: How many people were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: It was 225.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: And this was when?</span> <span id="s410">This was --</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Late in '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: You were put on a train.</span> <span id="s413">What kind of train?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Cattle train.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Cattle train.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: And you said your health was not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Not good.</span> <span id="s419">I was very weak already.</span> <span id="s420">And when we came to Krakow -- to Auschwitz --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: How long did it take?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: It took maybe two, three hours.</span> <span id="s423">That's all.</span> <span id="s424">That's short distance.</span> <span id="s425">Also, Auschwitz was on a Polish territory and originally Auschwitz was built to accommodate Polish political prisoners.</span> <span id="s426">To my knowledge, after I was liberated, I tried to research, I could not find any other transport which came directly to the central, to the center of the camp.</span> <span id="s427">Generally, all the transports came to Birkenau, where there were selection made to go to work or to go to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s428">This particular transport of 225 from Krakow came directly to the central camp, where there were 20 blocks.</span> <span id="s429">There were two-story brick buildings.</span> <span id="s430">On 16 blocks people lived who were sent to do outside work.</span> <span id="s431">Every morning they came back to work.</span> <span id="s432">One block had a hospital.</span> <span id="s433">One block was a bunker where all prisoners who tried to escape and they were caught, they were put there.</span> <span id="s434">And one block was the experimental block.</span> <span id="s435">So we came there to Auschwitz --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: What happened when the train stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: When the train stopped, the SS opened the gates of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: The doors?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Doors of the train and let us out.</span> <span id="s440">We were met there immediately by the inmates who were in Auschwitz for a longer time with the blue and white stripes and numbers on their --</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Jacket?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: -- jackets with the different angles because the political, they wore red.</span> <span id="s443">And the Jews had a red and yellow star.</span> <span id="s444">And there were also with the green German that -- well, I mean, should we go over this?</span> <span id="s445">That is well known, what they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">And they told us that we are in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s447">Shaved our heads.</span> <span id="s448">We took a shower and get tattooed and put the tattoo on the arm.</span> <span id="s449">We spent --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Do you remember what you felt like at that point, your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Well, the condition after that was already three years I went through from one to another.</span> <span id="s452">You were so conditioned, that whatever will happen, will happen.</span> <span id="s453">You did not dwell too much what you gonna do.</span> <span id="s454">You start to believe in fate already.</span> <span id="s455">There's nothing much you can do.</span> <span id="s456">You better don't think too much.</span> <span id="s457">Just watch yourself.</span> <span id="s458">Not to be too close to somebody who gonna hit you or beat you or whatever.</span> <span id="s459">You just try to be in the background and maybe.</span> <span id="s460">I had a very strong urge then when I arrived in Auschwitz that if there's any chance to survive, after what I went through, I'll have to survive.</span> <span id="s461">And, I don't know -- a good thing, though, that we were there on the quarantine.</span> <span id="s462">Each transport who come, was, I think, the whole week we didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s463">We could not get out from the block.</span> <span id="s464">We got food like normal, four ounces of black bread, coffee, black coffee, and in the evening you got a soup.</span> <span id="s465">But it was known to the rest of the inmates that the transport from Krakow came here.</span> <span id="s466">So there were some people who were already longer in the camp who were interested always to find maybe their brothers or whoever is family.</span> <span id="s467">So they came and tried to ascertain who -- the names and everything else.</span> <span id="s468">So after a while, someone somehow told the friend of mine who I lived and went to school with that I am here, you know.</span> <span id="s469">So he came visit me and brought me more food.</span> <span id="s470">And then after the quarantine, in the beginning, he arranged a good work group for me.</span> <span id="s471">I work far.</span> <span id="s472">We walked every today.</span> <span id="s473">But it was indoors.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: What block number were you living in?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: 18A.</span> <span id="s476">And every so often, he came, visit me, and helped me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: What kind of work were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: I was working in a steam producing -- my duty was they had a big, big oven and that was a factory for cabinets and they brought pieces of wood and I threw in the -- to create steam.</span> <span id="s479">It was very easy work and warm.</span> <span id="s480">No elements of cold weather go through and everything.</span> <span id="s481">So if I wouldn't have lived there -- I mean through this period of, I think I was in Auschwitz four, five months, that's where I came to more strength, because when Auschwitz was liquidated in 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Liquidated.</span> <span id="s484">Before -- the Russians were very close so they wanted to send everyone who was in camp away.</span> <span id="s485">I was almost on the last transport.</span> <span id="s486">It was already middle of December, in winter.</span> <span id="s487">And they did not, they could not spare any trucks or wagons.</span> <span id="s488">So we marched for two days and two nights.</span> <span id="s489">If I wouldn't have the strength in Auschwitz, I could not survive the march.</span> <span id="s490">For two days and two nights we walk through the snow and there were, I would imagine it was maybe one tenth of the marchers survived.</span> <span id="s491">Everybody else who could not keep up with them going was shot by the guards, who were riding on the motorcycles.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Were you with -- was it just men on your march?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Yes, there was on the particular march was men.</span> <span id="s494">And this particular -- in Auschwitz, on the barracks -- I mean on the blocks, it was only men.</span> <span id="s495">In Auschwitz, in the central lager, there were only women who were secretaries but they did not live in this particular camp.</span> <span id="s496">But a very strange thing, what I still cannot have answered to what happened on this march, sometimes during the march, there was an English military plane going quite low over our heads.</span> <span id="s497">And the Germans, the guards got panicky and started to run away from us.</span> <span id="s498">And how we were conditioned through this four years, we could not decide for ourselves what to do.</span> <span id="s499">So we followed them.</span> <span id="s500">We knew very well that there is no way to escape because we were with this blue and white stripes.</span> <span id="s501">It's winter.</span> <span id="s502">You could not disrobe yourself.</span> <span id="s503">And you could not go to a German house.</span> <span id="s504">But it is just that the conditioning through so many years, you did not function by yourself.</span> <span id="s505">You had to get an order.</span> <span id="s506">We didn't get the order to go away -- go turn right; we followed the guards.</span> <span id="s507">And it is quite puzzling to me how a human being can be conditioned to do things against their will.</span> <span id="s508">So finally --</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: How many were in your group?</span> <span id="s510">How many people were on your march?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Well, it's very hard for me to determine how many people.</span> <span id="s512">It was a long, long line of people when we started.</span> <span id="s513">Only the historian can decide that the march started in Auschwitz and how many people came here and there because it's -- you know, it was quite -- I mean, I don't know if this is a nice way to talk about our way but everyone was only concerned about himself.</span> <span id="s514">You did not care what's going on there in the front.</span> <span id="s515">You didn't care what's going on on the left side.</span> <span id="s516">You were only hoping that you will survive, so.</span> <span id="s517">But that was the condition.</span> <span id="s518">And you had to apparently adjust to the condition, what they were.</span> <span id="s519">And maybe it's, like today, it's not too good to dwell too much what -- how we behaved because, I mean, I don't know -- finally we arrived in a small town in, on some border of Poland and Germany and they gave us a big farmhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Were any of the German soldiers with you or was it just the survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s522">There were all German -- I mean the guards -- after the, after the --</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: You were still with the guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: After the plane left and they came back and we marched again.</span> <span id="s525">So after we -- they give us a rest for overnight.</span> <span id="s526">We rest there, slept there in this barn, and next morning we were loaded on some trains.</span> <span id="s527">And, well, we didn't know where we were going but we arrived in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s528">In Buchenwald, we were placed on this block for young children.</span> <span id="s529">I mean, at least I was placed there.</span> <span id="s530">And in 1945, in Buchenwald, in this particular camp, in the old camp, we were not required to do any work.</span> <span id="s531">Just they brought us there to be stored if they need someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: You were talking about how you had arrived in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s536">We arrived in Buchenwald at those times, already 1945, or might be '44, December, and Buchenwald was already in disarray.</span> <span id="s537">There were many people brought there because the place was still more or less secure from the allies.</span> <span id="s538">I was put on the young man's block and this block became quite famous by Elie Wiesel's book, "The Night" where he speaks about Gustav, who was the blockalteste.</span> <span id="s539">I lived there and during the day we were not required to go to any work.</span> <span id="s540">It is just that once in a while food got more scarce.</span> <span id="s541">Instead of every day the rations what we were supposed to get, we got every second day.</span> <span id="s542">But they told us, if you volunteer on any transport to another camp, you might get more food.</span> <span id="s543">But somehow, I decide that I will stay there, at least I know what's going on here, I don't want to volunteer for any unknown situation.</span> <span id="s544">So time was very hard to pass, because we did not do anything, and as I said previously, the food got scarce, but we tried to live from day to day.</span> <span id="s545">Close by end of March</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Did you have any contact with this Gustav, whom you mentioned?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Well, he was my blockalteste.</span> <span id="s548">He was in charge of the block and he the Jewry (ph), the book about what Elie Wiesel was not very he but ok</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: You described your experiences with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: My experience I felt that the man did the best he could under those circumstances.</span> <span id="s551">You cannot please everybody all the time.</span> <span id="s552">The man tried to do good for the majority.</span> <span id="s553">If he hurt someone sometimes then I feel because I thought about this quite many years now.</span> <span id="s554">How we survivors sometimes handle the people who got the jobs of a kapo to be in charge.</span> <span id="s555">Not always they did the best in my opinion what in their position required.</span> <span id="s556">The one who criticize, let him put himself sometimes in a position of the other one.</span> <span id="s557">You know they were required to do certain things by the German authorities there and they had to do, otherwise they would be punished.</span> <span id="s558">And so in April</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: In April?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: In April, the English and the American Army was quite close, we could hear sometimes at night when there was quiet, quiet, the explosion of high the bombs or whatever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Up to that point you said you really didn't do anything you just waited around?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes, just waited around, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: And your health was ok at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Considering the situation we didn't have to work the health was pretty good.</span> <span id="s565">But</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: In April you heard bombs?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: We heard bombs.</span> <span id="s568">The rumors started going that the army the allies are very close and soon they're going to come to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s569">And we were informed that the camp going to be evacuated.</span> <span id="s570">For about a week before we were liberated we didn't get any food.</span> <span id="s571">So you it was early spring, so we ate whatever we could find on the outside because there were quite grassy molds (ph) there so we took the grass and ate and sometimes we took some water with the grass and cooked look a soup.</span> <span id="s572">You had to somehow survive because there was yes, they tried to induce people to leave and they say that if you are going to go out from the camp, you are going to get more rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Who tried to induce you, the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: The German authorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Tried to encourage you to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Tried to encourage you to leave, and later we found out that all those people who fell for that, they were taken to next town and were shot there, where they were prepared already for well I mean, I</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: But you decided to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: I decided to stay.</span> <span id="s579">But I still cannot understand.</span> <span id="s580">They had the power if they wanted to do this, to come and say a thousand of you come with us and we would have to go.</span> <span id="s581">So I mean it is not my personal knowledge that that would have happened, but that's what we were told.</span> <span id="s582">Anyway, one morning we heard those shots very loud and a few minutes later we had seen the American Army came to the camp.</span> <span id="s583">In the first group it was a young chaplain, Rabbi Schacter, who when he saw what's going on there, it didn't take him long, he organized a transport of young people who their health was not very good.</span> <span id="s584">Half the first transport when to France.</span> <span id="s585">On this particular transport Elie Wiesel was sent to France.</span> <span id="s586">The next transport he organized to Switzerland through the world Red Cross and I went to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: When you were in the camp did you know Elie Wiesel, had you met him?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: I'm sure I met him, but I didn't know we were not formal, we never told the second name.</span> <span id="s589">Maybe I met him as Elie who was sleeping above me, no, I don't know.</span> <span id="s590">When I I just have seen him last Sunday, he spoke in the temple where my daughter lives, and I spent quite a few minutes with him to talking about different things it's not the first time I talk to him, but you know who knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: So generally when survivors spoke in the camps they did not give their last names?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Well, if I met you, let's say you were inmate with me</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: No.</span> <span id="s594">I meant during the time of the war, I meant during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Yes, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: You just said your first names?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s598">People didn't know each other by second name.</span> <span id="s599">I mean, if you looked for somebody then something else but it's just casual</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: A new person?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Casually if you sleep next to somebody, I don't know the second name.</span> <span id="s602">It wasn't important, I mean, besides in Auschwitz that was completely different.</span> <span id="s603">The names didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s604">The numbers.</span> <span id="s605">We were called by the numbers and we did not the same thing in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s606">I had my there were numbers printed here.</span> <span id="s607">There were numbers.</span> <span id="s608">The Germans communicate to us by the name if they want by the number, not by the names.</span> <span id="s609">The names were registered there but the numbers were the important thing.</span> <span id="s610">So if you did not remember your number, you were dead.</span> <span id="s611">If they called your number and you did not respond immediately, you got punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Do you remember your number?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Auschwitz was 1740609.</span> <span id="s614">As a matter of fact, I mean, I don't know how important it is, but it's just curious because now we hear about this that these young men gonna get flagging when I marched to the camp, to Auschwitz from my work, one day somebody gave me two eggs because we carried those canteens with soup.</span> <span id="s615">So I had two eggs.</span> <span id="s616">Eggs were very valuable in camp.</span> <span id="s617">I would have gotten something in camp for that.</span> <span id="s618">So the guard randomly looked, he said, "open it."</span> <span id="s619">He looked in my canteen and started stirring with his stick and he found the eggs so I was selected on a side.</span> <span id="s620">My number was taken and I would have gotten 25 lashes.</span> <span id="s621">But fortunately for me the camp was liquidated and they didn't have enough time to do this.</span> <span id="s622">So you know it's very hard to condense everything.</span> <span id="s623">You know, I'm just going with at the moment what comes to my head I find important.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: You were then taken to Switzerland, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s626">Well, we were sent to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Because of Rabbi Schacter?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Rabbi Schacter organized a transport, yes.</span> <span id="s629">Rabbi Schacter I met a few times here, he spoke to us many times.</span> <span id="s630">He lives in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: What's his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Herschel Schacter.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: And what were you thoughts when you were on your way to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Well, finally we were liberated.</span> <span id="s635">I lived only in Germany for, I think, in June, by the end of June, so that's only two, three months.</span> <span id="s636">But before I gonna go to the thoughts of the German the American Army after have seen what happened to us there they went to next town, that's Weimar and they confiscated first they brought wagons with water, because we didn't have no more water.</span> <span id="s637">We didn't take no showers, we didn't take no baths, so they gave us baths.</span> <span id="s638">We walked for, I think, two days without clothes, naked, everything, because that was more sanitary than wearing those old, lousy clothes.</span> <span id="s639">They burnt everything what we were wearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: This is while you were in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: After liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Liberation, yes.</span> <span id="s644">They went outside to Weimar and they brought some food, the American Army.</span> <span id="s645">They confiscated pigs and chicken and everything else and they came and they start cooking and they gave us -- and that was not very good thing because we didn't eat for so many weeks and now we got the food and many of us got really sick, diarrhea and type of illness from overeating.</span> <span id="s646">So then they got the rations of soldiers that also donated chocolate, the chocolate helped us.</span> <span id="s647">But, see, those soldiers did not expect the condition what occurred there, and they were just trying to help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: What language did you speak then?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: What language?</span> <span id="s650">German.</span> <span id="s651">To Rabbi Schacter we spoke Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Growing up what did you speak in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Polish.</span> <span id="s654">So that was also a good thing that I knew a little Yiddish.</span> <span id="s655">And Yiddish was -- and I went to school to Gymnasium that was a little (inaudible) learn a little German, because the guards at the commandant gave orders in German, and if you did not respond to the order that was not in favor either.</span> <span id="s656">So you had to quickly you had to learn the German.</span> <span id="s657">That's why the transport that came to Auschwitz from Greece, those Jews suffered greatly because at least the European Jews understand a little bit Yiddish and they could respond after a while to the orders.</span> <span id="s658">But the Greek had a very hard time to understand the language and they were very quickly killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: So you were on your way to Switzerland after the</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: After the transport organized, Rabbi Schacter came with us to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s661">We arrived at some Red Cross quarters in Bern and then the Jewish community of Switzerland were helping us.</span> <span id="s662">Some Jewish organization, the Zionist organization, because originally we went to Switzerland just for a little health and then go to Israel, because that's the only place we could go.</span> <span id="s663">We did not want to go back home to Poland, because we heard about the seven who escaped, escaped the Germans.</span> <span id="s664">They came home and they didn't live long because there is one who survived who is in Israel told us because I met him there to the trial he was the one who escaped, six, the poles came with hatchet and killed them.</span> <span id="s665">So we did not want to go back to Poland and there was no other place to go, so we decided to go to Switzerland and then go to Israel.</span> <span id="s666">But unfortunately England had a blockade to Israel and Switzerland did not permit we could have gone on our own through the borders of Italy, but that's whole thing was illegally and we felt at least the whole group who was in Switzerland from Buchenwald, we decided that we had enough smuggled then, whatever will be when there will be permitted to go here or there we will go.</span> <span id="s667">So friends of my parents my name our names were published in Jewish papers in I suppose, through the whole world but here we speak about in United States.</span> <span id="s668">And one day I received a letter from friends of my parents who came here much earlier to United States, if I am willing to come to United States they will send me papers.</span> <span id="s669">I decided I grabbed the opportunity and I came to the United States in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: 1947?</span> <span id="s671">So you were in Switzerland up to that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Two years, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Two years in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s674">Then where did you come when you got to the Unites States?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: I came to Irvington, New Jersey?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: And when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: And you stayed in New Jersey ever since?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: All ever since in New Jersey, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Is your wife a survivor also?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: No.</span> <span id="s682">My wife's born here, she was born in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Can we talk about some general questions now about your thoughts and your feelings and your experiences?</span> <span id="s684">How do you think the war influenced you?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: The war influenced me very, very negatively.</span> <span id="s686">My I'm still looking for answers to the questions.</span> <span id="s687">Where was the world?</span> <span id="s688">Where was the Jewish community of the United States where we were there?</span> <span id="s689">Today we know that was well known in 1942 that what Hitler was doing with the Jews.</span> <span id="s690">It is known also that when Eichmann came to Hungary, because Hungary was the last bastion of Jews, the Jewish community in Hungary saved about 10,000 Jews for money.</span> <span id="s691">And they were paid and when they were asked United States government or United States Jewish community were asked to donate more money for some reason, somehow, it was not forthcoming.</span> <span id="s692">So sure the blame lies directly on those people who helped Hitler or Germany, but the numbness of the world, of the demographic committee in United States, I still cannot understand.</span> <span id="s693">A ship of German refugee came here to this shores and was turned around and sent back.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: When we were in Auschwitz, it's only a very short distance where there are Buna workers -- that was industrial area for a military purpose where (inaudible).</span> <span id="s696">It was bombed.</span> <span id="s697">Why they never threw at least one or two bombs at the trains which were coming to Auschwitz with the people who died?</span> <span id="s698">We were realized the people would have been killed, but they were killed anyway.</span> <span id="s699">But the crematoriums or the trains would be wrecked for a couple of days or weeks and at least the destruction would not have occurred as occurred.</span> <span id="s700">So Hitler did not hear really any opposition from no one.</span> <span id="s701">So he continued to do what his goal was.</span> <span id="s702">I get many questions, why the Jew resisted.</span> <span id="s703">My answer to them is I resisted for every day, because his aim was to kill me and I am still alive.</span> <span id="s704">So what resistant would it be, I mean I am speaking about my personal thing, would it have been better if I would escaped and hide someplace and be killed later by a Pole and I knew from right from the beginning we were told in Rabka, that you are responsible for your neighbor, for your person who you are living or who you are working, if he escapes you be killed.</span> <span id="s705">I never, never through the whole my living in camps had any time, notion, of taking a life of somebody else on my conscience.</span> <span id="s706">There are different types of people.</span> <span id="s707">I'm just speaking for myself.</span> <span id="s708">And I cannot, and I'm not sorry that I did not know, that I did not do.</span> <span id="s709">The next thing what happened in Buchenwald after the liberation, the young army soldiers grabbed few of us who were near, and they immediately, after the marching they took the commandant, previous commandant from the camp, the Germans, with the guards, and put them there closed in the bunk.</span> <span id="s710">They came to us and said, come with us, we show you something.</span> <span id="s711">They took us to the bunker there and showed us SS lying there on the floor and said, “you want a gun, you want a stick, do whatever you want.”</span> <span id="s712">Yeah, very true, there were many of my inmates there who took their advantage, but I felt, and that bothers me today, sometimes, did I act the right I couldn't make myself to happen.</span> <span id="s713">Because I felt if I would do this to him, I would lower myself to this position of what he did to me.</span> <span id="s714">So I don't know.</span> <span id="s715">And sometimes I'm ashamed to tell this, that I was a coward.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: How do you feel about being Jewish, did it change because of your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: No.</span> <span id="s718">It didn't change much.</span> <span id="s719">As I previously said I was never very religious and I am not today.</span> <span id="s720">There were questions when I was much younger, where was G d, where this happened.</span> <span id="s721">But I cannot blame this on G d or religion or whatever.</span> <span id="s722">I accepted what had happened and I feel that maybe it always of suffering of some something different comes.</span> <span id="s723">I strongly feel that if the Holocaust did not exist, Israel would not exist either.</span> <span id="s724">So I feel that maybe the world to do something, that it did not do during the Holocaust, so gave us a country of our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: How do you feel about getting war reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Despite what some people feel, I feel whatever they they cannot pay me enough for what I went through and I will get anything they are willing to pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Have you communicated to your children about your experiences in the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Well, that is also just a few days before I spoke with my son who is now 42, he does not want too much to hear to my story.</span> <span id="s731">He reads.</span> <span id="s732">He looks for all the information, but he does not listen to me about the story.</span> <span id="s733">He never I sometimes volunteer in the beginning, I did not want to speak myself, but later, a few years pass, I decide that I whoever wants to listen I'll speak.</span> <span id="s734">And I speak with schools, I speak with Hebrew schools, and congregations, I go to public schools, and whatever.</span> <span id="s735">But my daughter, yes she I have one son who is 42 and one son who is 25.</span> <span id="s736">The boys, for some reason don’t want it when I start talking about some Holocaust, when we have company they walked out.</span> <span id="s737">So the son told me that he cannot stand to listen what I went through, cause it hurts him, so that's why.</span> <span id="s738">But the daughter for somehow, I can communicate with her, I can talk to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Does the war still affect you any way besides for what you already said?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Well, yes it affects me I mean for so many years I would like to go back to Poland, to time where I was born and maybe next year I go because I also going to go to Buchenwald because 50 years when I was liberated.</span> <span id="s741">I feel that I have to complete the circle, the cycle has to be closed.</span> <span id="s742">I resisted to go to Poland just purely that I will spend my good money to give to the Poles.</span> <span id="s743">But there is something more to it.</span> <span id="s744">I have to see the place where I was born, how it is, and then put a lilt salt in their face that I survived.</span> <span id="s745">So I'm going with my brother in law and my sister in law.</span> <span id="s746">I asked my younger son to go, he doesn't want to go.</span> <span id="s747">He belongs to the Hashomer Hatzair, Jewish organizations which go every year the young children go he never wanted to go, but</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: When did you hear about the members of your family, about what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: In Rabka.</span> <span id="s750">Right in the beginning.</span> <span id="s751">Right in the beginning, I knew, I knew.</span> <span id="s752">I heard.</span> <span id="s753">I did not have any factual evidence.</span> <span id="s754">And many, many people don't have no factual evidence.</span> <span id="s755">That's where they were burned, that's where the ashes are.</span> <span id="s756">I mean, after all I knew that after I was liberated in 1945 and five, ten years pass, and my names were published all over.</span> <span id="s757">I never heard anybody, who from my family, who knew something.</span> <span id="s758">So I had to face facts, and it's already 50 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Is there anything else you wanted to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: No, no, it's ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Well, thank you very much for this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: This concludes the interview of Henry Kolber.</span> <span id="s764">It was conducted on April 20, 1994, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">End of File Two</span></p>
