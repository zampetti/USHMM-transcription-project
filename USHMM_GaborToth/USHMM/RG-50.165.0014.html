1989</span></p> <p><span id="s12">WH: You were from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">FC: Eastern Czechoslovakia…in Bilke, in 1920…our family was a Zionist family, we were a family of 7 children, I was the 6th of the 7…I’m the only survivor of the family…in 1946 I was married in Prague...during the war I was in labor camps, and in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s14">First we were...in 1941...October 13th I was taken to a labor camp under Hungarian jurisdiction...then transported (to many different towns to work)...the treatment was harsh and the discipline was severe...</span></p> <p><span id="s15">WH: Do you consider it only by luck that you survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">FC: By luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">WH: You don’t think it was anything that you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">FC: No, there was nothing that I did.</span> <span id="s19">I needed less food than someone else, the bigger guys, because I’m a short fellow, and I could survive on very little.</span> <span id="s20">In 1944 the Russians were approaching, the Germans decided to evacuate the whole area and they took us with them...sometime in the end of September, taking groups of 3,000 a night and I was in one of those groups...and they marched us all the way from the southern Europe to Hungary.</span> <span id="s21">Many, many people perished on the way...</span></p> <p><span id="s22">WH: You marched for months, it’s remarkable that you made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">FC: We made it...we arrived in November in ’44 in the southern part of Hungary...we were then about 8,900 that survived, and we were then taken by train to (?</span> <span id="s24">Flusenberg?)</span> <span id="s25">which is a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s26">From there, I was taken to 2,3 different places to work.</span> <span id="s27">And I just don’t even know the names of these places.</span> <span id="s28">Because I was in no condition at that time to know anything, or to remember anything.</span> <span id="s29">And I was affected with typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s30">And somehow I survived...and then we were on the final march to Theresienstadt...and suddenly we heard various voices coming from loud speakers, and various languages, Hungarian, and Czech and German, and French, ‘You’re free!’</span> <span id="s31">and (inaudible) so on.</span> <span id="s32">And that ‘you are now under the jurisdiction of the Red Cross.’</span> <span id="s33">Well, anyway, we were marched into Theresienstadt, the Germans were still there, took over again under their -but a few days later, they left.</span> <span id="s34">Must have been May 1st because May 10th we were liberated in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s35">From Theresienstadt the Russians came they kicked in the gates, and let us go.</span> <span id="s36">They took no interest in us as such, so everybody, whoever was able started crawling, walking, in whatever direction...and I went into a hospital, where I recuperated and recovered, from which hospital I escaped.</span> <span id="s37">I felt that I’m a -as if I was in prison there and I thought that I was well enough, and I just walked out of the hospital...</span></p> <p><span id="s38">WH: Would you say that you had a strong will to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">FC: No, I don’t ever remember thinking about that kind of determination.</span> <span id="s40">That kind of a decision to give it everything in order to survive.</span> <span id="s41">It was just an instinct, a desire to survive from day to day...</span></p> <p><span id="s42">WH: When did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">FC: ...in ’45 we met in Prague...</span></p> <p><span id="s44">WH: Where were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">MC: I was liberated at ?</span> <span id="s46">Reichenboch?</span> <span id="s47">...during the war I was in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">WH: Were you sent to a labor -?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">MC: No, what was very lucky, is that I was selected the day I got to Auschwitz, so I don’t even have a number, so...they send out representatives to find people very agile with their hands, and I am...they gave us tweezers...to assemble parts for tubes for telephones, and for airplanes...and I was so good that they let my sister come with me, who was not as good, as agile...when I told them that I will not go without my sister, they let her come along.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">WH: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">MC: In (?)</span> <span id="s52">Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s53">In November, 1921...we were eight.</span> <span id="s54">We were two sisters and eight brothers.</span> <span id="s55">Two brothers made it, and my sister and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">WH: After the war, what year did you come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">MC: In ’46.</span> <span id="s58">In June 7th, ’46 we were in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">WH: You went by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">MC: No, they send us by plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">FC: I have two uncles in Cleveland, by accident...I found their addresses, and I wrote to them, they quickly responded, they sent us papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">MC: We were among the first three (in Prague) who applied for visas to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">FC: We were the first immigrants to arrive in Cleveland...(inaudible) so these two uncles sent us plane tickets.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">MC: We paid, we paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">WH: You flew from Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">FC: From Paris to New York...these uncles were my mother’s brothers...</span></p> <p><span id="s67">WH: What did you feel like when you got off the plane?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">MC: We were so scared, that for the 17 hours that the plane took...we didn’t even talk to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">WH: You were just sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">MC: Yes.</span> <span id="s71">We didn’t know what was waiting for us...there were G.I.s on the plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">WH: Did your uncle promise to get you a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">MC: No, no.</span> <span id="s74">They didn’t make any plans.</span> <span id="s75">They didn’t even say that we should come to Cleveland.</span> <span id="s76">Just tickets.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">WH: Do you know what the ticket cost?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">FC: $500 a piece...(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s79">WH: I’m looking around at this house and I’m thinking, you live here, in Ramat Poleg.</span> <span id="s80">You have a beautiful pool down the block, you live facing the Mediterranean Sea...and that you have a beautiful house...a private house, furnished like in American style...</span></p> <p><span id="s81">MC: We brought everything from our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">WH: Well it is SO beautiful.</span> <span id="s83">Beautiful couches, carpets.</span> <span id="s84">There are four bedrooms...and you have a gorgeous shul across the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">MC: It is a perfect place...if we go outside, we have the youngsters, and they all ask you, ‘How are you feeling?’</span></p> <p><span id="s86">WH: You didn’t have that in America did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">MC: No.</span> <span id="s88">At the hospital, each neighbor came twice.</span> <span id="s89">I was there 10 days.</span> <span id="s90">We would never have had that in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s91">Not with the Jewish community...</span></p> <p><span id="s92">FC: They are so wonderful, warm, we have become so integrated into the community, it’s just lovely.</span> <span id="s93">We are part of every simcha, we are part of every helela, and (inaudible) whatever it is, happens, we are part of the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">MC: We were accepted by the Orthodox community...let me tell you a story.</span> <span id="s95">The neighbor across the street, the first thing we moved in, he said, ‘If we do something that offends you on Shabat, please let us know and we will stop.’</span> <span id="s96">An Israeli.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">FC: A young couple of thirty.</span> <span id="s98">And so I told him, ‘Listen, -each one of us is responsible to our maker, in our own way, for our own being.’</span> <span id="s99">...they have been wonderful here, we have had wonderful relations with each and every one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">WH: Is your family a Zionist family?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">MC: Yes, my father wanted to come to Israel with his six boys.</span> <span id="s102">He said, ‘With his six boys, and my two girls, the way they work, I would make a living anyplace,’ he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">WH: What stopped you from coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">MC: The riots.</span> <span id="s105">The Arab riots in ’38.</span> <span id="s106">He was very worried.</span> <span id="s107">‘Cause a rabbi talked him out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">FC: And he himself came!</span> <span id="s109">He came in ’42.</span> <span id="s110">A plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">WH: You were brought up religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">MC: Yes...my father was not hasid, but he did have a beard.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">WH: Was your father Zionistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">MC: Yes...and then when we got to the United States, I became involved in Zionist affairs and I was president of the Zionist Organization in America in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s115">We always wanted to make this move.</span> <span id="s116">That’s why our son then came over here 15 years ago.</span> <span id="s117">Brought him here for his bar mitzvah and from then on he came every year...</span></p> <p><span id="s118">WH: ...immediately after the war, why didn’t you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">FC: First of all I was not in a mental condition to really have grasped all that was going on.</span> <span id="s120">I wasn’t informed...</span></p> <p><span id="s121">WH: When did you come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">FC: In 1985.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">WH: What kind of work did you do in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">FC: I was a CPA lawyer...at (age) 45.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">WH: You were born in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">FC: 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">WH: How did you manage to start your life over when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">FC: ...I got a job as a shipping clerk in a dress factory, worked so hard but I felt I needed to eat a loaf of bread at every meal...(inaudible) the Jewish community got me the job.</span> <span id="s129">And then I saw there was no future, and the N.C.J.W. had volunteer teachers, and they assigned us...Mrs. Shulman who took us under her wing...and she taught us language...and saw to it that we learned, and she used to come and read with me Shakespeare, and eventually I went to college...at night, all at night...I was making .65 cents an hour, alright this is 45 years ago, but even then, it was $26 a week, out of which $15 went for a third floor attic apartment...and then Mr. Shulman ...found a job for me...in a bank as a clerk...at the rate of $125 a month, -out of which $45 went for rent.</span> <span id="s130">And $45 was a bargain.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">MC: Every week, from the check, $5 and we put in the bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">FC: Well, anyway, it was a hard life, so I realized that I had no trade, and I had no profession.</span> <span id="s133">Unless I will get some education, I’ll be poor the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s134">So I started to go to a school, first to finish high school, then I went to college, and eventually passed the CPA exam...so we struggled, very, very, very hard for very long.</span> <span id="s135">And what happened, the older uncle was not a rich man...the other one was a little better off, but he died six months after our arrival...He would have helped us but...so we were completely on our own, without any help whatsoever.</span> <span id="s136">But she (my aunt, the widow) insisted that we repay the $500 that she contributed towards our fare.</span> <span id="s137">And we paid this out at installments of $5 a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">MC: But we paid it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">FC: She made a mistake, listen, you make mistakes.</span> <span id="s140">But that’s not the thing -.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">WH: You’re a forgiving soul –</span></p> <p><span id="s142">FC: Well, listen, people make mistakes, what can you do.</span> <span id="s143">Then I became already a CPA, aha, things were looking up for us, and we became independent economically...</span></p> <p><span id="s144">WH: You’re a person who survived the Death March, you survived the camps, you’re the only one from your family who survived and when you came, how did you still have the energy...tell me why you think you had the energy.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">MC: I hope I was some help.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">FC: I was making $6 a week, and she was able to sew.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">MC: And made $17 for a suit because I’m a professional.</span> <span id="s148">I learned cutting and design, you know, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">FC: (inaudible) we had two children right away, in ’47 our first one, our daughter who is still in the United States.</span> <span id="s150">And our son in ’48.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">MC: One thing that helped him, he liked to travel, go places, see things, he is one of those – you can see we have four dictionaries right here in the living room.</span> <span id="s152">And he has some upstairs in his office.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">WH: Do you also have an optimistic view on life?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">MC: I do.</span> <span id="s155">I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">WH: You didn’t feel depressed after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">FC: No, the objective was, once we got to America the objective was, to try to rebuild our lives, to establish ourselves economically, to be part of the Jewish community, and of the American community.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">MC: And our happiness, of course, and devotion to each other, helped an awful lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">WH: Were you observant all those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">FC: Yes.</span> <span id="s161">At first, when we got to the United States, we had sort of thrown off everything, because we were so (inaudible-absorbed?)</span> <span id="s162">, I worked on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s163">And just, nothing there.</span> <span id="s164">Nothing to hold on to.</span> <span id="s165">But the Shabbat at home was there, Shabbat.</span> <span id="s166">We start lighting candles, and there was no cooking, no washing on Shabbat, but I worked on Shabbat, but she maintained the spirit.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">MC: I held on.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">WH: What about the doubts, questions, that you must have had after the war, questions that people asked, like, ‘How could God do this to my family?</span> <span id="s169">If there really is a God, how did he allow our people to suffer so much,’ and your own personal losses.</span> <span id="s170">Didn’t those doubts sort of bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">MC: Oh, sure they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">FC: They did, and they do to this day.</span> <span id="s173">I think about it and I break down.</span> <span id="s174">(inaudible-he breaks down).</span> <span id="s175">A constant problem all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">WH: Do you keep faith in a sense because it’s a carry on of tradition, a sense of community?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">FC: Yes, there is a great deal to that.</span> <span id="s178">A great deal to that.</span> <span id="s179">Our parents (inaudible) were devoted, knowledgeable, my father (inaudible) and my brothers studied in the best yeshivot, the Harvards of the yeshivot in Europe (inaudible)...</span></p> <p><span id="s180">MC: There were certain things that we did because of the kids.</span> <span id="s181">We realized when we bought our first house, in 1950, my sister lend us some money, and we had already $3,000 saved up, from this meager saving, then we bought our first house.</span> <span id="s182">The first Rosh Hashonah, I remember, we had moved in just a couple of days before, we had no (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s183">direction).</span></p> <p><span id="s184">FC: We didn’t know where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">MC: We were sitting at home, and we cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">WH: You were crying because you didn’t have a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">MC: No, because we didn’t belong to anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">FC: Didn’t belong to anyone, to anywhere, we are strangers again, you know, strangers and neighbors...but...they went to Hebrew School and they are knowledgeable, both of them outstanding, and our son married as an adult...he is a graduate of Harvard Law School...he went to University of Pennsylvania, majored in physics...and our daughter, summa cum laude from Brown, and our son magna cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">MC: We have two, -very proud!</span></p> <p><span id="s190">WH: ...you went to law school at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">MC: Yes...and one year he took six courses and worked during the day...one day I thought he’s going to have a nervous breakdown...</span></p> <p><span id="s192">WH: Why did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">FC: It always had to be the decision, that if I don’t do it, I’ll be poor.</span> <span id="s194">Everybody has, all the immigrants who came immediately after, a year or two later and so on, they were either tradesman and immediately made good money, a hundred dollars a week, a hundred and fifty a week...but we were the poor ones, and it’s not pleasant to be poor, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s195">I remember when our children were born, they brought gifts for us, to poor people you give little piddly things.</span> <span id="s196">And at the bar mitzvah already, you should have seen what gifts we got.</span> <span id="s197">And we were already better off...it’s not fun to be poor...the reason I went to law school...they didn’t give me a chance to do accounting...you needed experience...and I couldn’t get a job...I did some small jobs...and went back to school...and I wanted law all along...so ten years later I passed the bar...</span></p> <p><span id="s198">End of Tape Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Tape Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s200">WH: Do you have any regrets that you didn’t send your kids to day school in Cleveland?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">FC: ...we thought we made a mistake...with our daughter we had difficulties.</span> <span id="s202">Not our son...he now has four children...</span></p> <p><span id="s203">WH: What does he do here?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">FC: He’s a patent lawyer...he’s doing so well.</span> <span id="s205">He has a large office, he has a dozen lawyers working for him, forty secretaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">WH: Is he observant ?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">FC: Yes.</span> <span id="s208">He brought us back to being observant...through college...at college he met up with an orthodox group...once we decided to join a synagogue, we joined the Conservative movement and we were in that for 20 years.</span> <span id="s209">And then our son brought us back to Orthodoxy.</span> <span id="s210">He came home from college one day...and one day he said, ‘You know, Dad, if you don’t mind I’ll walk to Young Israel, you can ride to (inaudible).’</span> <span id="s211">I said, ‘If you can walk, I can walk.’</span> <span id="s212">And that’s when we moved over to (Orthodoxy)...so we were with Young Israel for 15 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">WH: ...what happened with your daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">FC: She is a very bright young woman, and we had some problems with her when we send her off to college, because she was a Viet Nam protestor and she married right after college, a young man, of the Einstein family, who is a Harvard graduate in physics, summa cum laude.</span> <span id="s215">(needs translation-shidach) if you know the expression- lucky match.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">WH: Do you mean the Albert Einstein family?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">MC: Albert Einstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">MC: ...but they divorced.</span> <span id="s219">She threw this marriage away.</span> <span id="s220">Because of his –Viet Nam ideology.</span> <span id="s221">He wasn’t that determined.</span> <span id="s222">He, too, was in favor of the protest, but not in the same (?</span> <span id="s223">way) that our daughter was.</span> <span id="s224">And, we don’t really know the full stories as to what happened between them.</span> <span id="s225">Those things will probably remain a secret forever.</span> <span id="s226">We don’t pry, we don’t care.</span> <span id="s227">But then she remarried, and thank God she is doing well, -and she’s a lawyer, too...she went to Princeton for graduate work...in Sociology...(FC comments on the Viet Nam war:) Unfortunately, the two leaders (inaudible) were communist, two Jewish men.</span> <span id="s228">One is a professor Peck (inaudible) and Goodman, a lawyer, they were both Communist, card carrying Communists for years.</span> <span id="s229">And they were initiators of every move, and every counter-move, so they took advantage of these youngsters because they were impressionable.</span> <span id="s230">I’m not debating the question, as to whether this was a worthwhile protest or a needed protest, or a justified protest.</span> <span id="s231">That’s not the thing.</span> <span id="s232">What I object to, is that people who had ulterior motives, were behind it, and manipulated this.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">WH: How did you feel about the war in Viet Nam during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">FC: We were not happy about it.</span> <span id="s235">We thought this is a more far away.</span> <span id="s236">We’re bound to get into trouble with it.</span> <span id="s237">Not because we were not justified to support –all big powers have (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s238">MC: I was really afraid from it.</span> <span id="s239">That we lose all the generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">FC: Yah, we were afraid...</span></p> <p><span id="s241">WH: Were you Liberal, or Moderate, or (inaudible)?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">FC: We were Liberal...but within reason.</span> <span id="s243">We are not a radical.</span> <span id="s244">We realized, and I remember discussing with our daughter in particular about the Blacks, and I told her, halevi.</span> <span id="s245">Our Jewish people here in America would be as safe and secure as the Blacks are.</span> <span id="s246">They have a future, it’s their America, but it’s not our America in the same sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">WH: Would you explain it?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">FC: Yes, because the real power, the political power, ...(inaudible)...we put powers in the hands of the Blacks.</span> <span id="s249">The Black –regardless whether it’s a Black man or not, but the (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s250">constant)was, true the Jews were the businessman, the Jews were the lawyers and the doctors and stuff.</span> <span id="s251">But it’s the political power that decides eventually whether you will be the businessman or whether you will be the lawyer, or the doctor or whatever.</span> <span id="s252">So I don’t begrudge them the power, that’s fine, but it wasn’t my responsibility to go out all the way for their rights, and to ignore my own.</span> <span id="s253">I say, first I want to feed my own children.</span> <span id="s254">I do care about the others, too, but to ignore my own –mine should starve, and the others should be well-fed?</span> <span id="s255">I don’t think that’s a natural reaction.</span> <span id="s256">Gloria felt, our daughter, Gloria, she felt that the Jews are doing okay for themselves, so my concern should be with the Blacks.</span> <span id="s257">Well she is now learning what she is getting from the Blacks, she’s in Georgia, in a small town, Lake Crosse...they are moving to Jacksonville because they have a five year old boy, and they are concerned about his Jewish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">WH: She married a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">FC: Yes...he’s a paralegal, associated with a law office, he deals only with social security (inaudible) and he’s doing fabulously well.</span> <span id="s260">She’s happy with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">WH: When you say that she’s learning what she’s getting from the Blacks, what has happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">FC: Well, she deals mostly with Blacks, and now we see how the Blacks have turned against us.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">WH: Does she feel that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">FC: I think she feels that way...she’s beginning to realize that all the effort that went into assisting the Blacks politically, and economically too, and in Cleveland, that we know, I don’t know how it was in New York, or in Chicago, but in Cleveland, you know, it was the Jewish community that allowed them to go into the neighborhoods.</span> <span id="s265">The Italians wouldn’t allow them, they would axe them.</span> <span id="s266">And the Slovaks wouldn’t do it, and the (?</span> <span id="s267">Serbians?)</span> <span id="s268">wouldn’t do it (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s269">WH: Did she ever come to you and say, ‘You know, Dad, you were right.’</span> <span id="s270">FC : No...but she is a wonderful daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">MC: She bakes the challah Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">FC: They are observant, and watch Shabbat.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">WH: Did your son rebel?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">FC: No.</span> <span id="s275">Never...</span></p> <p><span id="s276">MC: …we really never, the minute we had an argument, five minutes later he was on my chair and hugging me and saying, ‘I’m sorry, mother.’</span></p> <p><span id="s277">WH: Is he right wing orthodox or modern?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">MC: Modern.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">WH: How many children do they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">FC: Four...</span></p> <p><span id="s281">WH: Do you regret not coming sooner?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">MC: No, because we couldn’t...in 1965 I passed the bar, from the day that we came, it was 20 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">WH: ...but you knew that you were going to come to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">FC: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">MC: Even if our son wouldn’t have come.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">FC: That was our goal.</span> <span id="s287">We were Zionist.</span> <span id="s288">And let me tell you, all the Zionist leaders in Cleveland have come too.</span> <span id="s289">All the presidents and all the Vice –presidents...(inaudible)...</span></p> <p><span id="s290">WH: Certain communities are able to encourage aliyah, and others are not...why?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">FC: ...there are here in Netanya, hundreds.</span> <span id="s292">And in Israel, thousands of people from Manchester, England.</span> <span id="s293">And I asked a few Manchesterians...they said, ‘The influence of Chaim Weitzman.’</span></p> <p><span id="s294">WH: He was from Manchester?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">FC: He lived in England...but Chaim Weitzman made that kind of impression on the community.</span> <span id="s296">Now, why am I telling you this about Manchester?</span> <span id="s297">Cleveland was (inaudible...) and that, too, made an impression.</span> <span id="s298">And Rabbi Spira also a dedicated Zionist.</span> <span id="s299">You see, some leaders do have an influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">WH: What do you like best about this country?</span> <span id="s301">(Israel)?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">FC: I like my people.</span> <span id="s303">I love to see, to walk out of our door and see those kids with our kids...</span></p> <p><span id="s304">WH: Basically, you retired in ’85 and that was your motivation, to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">FC: Yes, that’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">WH: When you think back on your life, and everything that you did here, what achievement, would you say that you are the most proud of?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">FC: ...well, what we are most proud of is our decision to come here, now, and of course we are very proud of our children.</span> <span id="s308">Thank God that they turned out okay and that they are contributors to society to Israel in particular, to society in general.</span> <span id="s309">We are happy (inaudible).</span> <span id="s310">We have no –arguments...(inaudible)...it was out of love, it was out of love that we came here...</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Interview Notes: I just wanted to say that you can really see that these people here are the beautiful people in the sense that they really have values that transcend their Holocaust experience; it transcends the idea of material possessions.</span> <span id="s312">That’s what I got from all the survivors here.</span> <span id="s313">That they came out of a love for Israel, out of an appreciation of things here, and that it isn’t just money that they are after.</span> <span id="s314">Whether they retired, or whether they came here to work, it isn’t easy, and it wasn’t easy for anyone to pick themselves up after W.W. II and come here, but these people really have a sense of principle.</span> <span id="s315">Not just an accumulation of goods.</span> <span id="s316">And it’s expressed, and you can see how they relate to each other and how they look at each other.</span> <span id="s317">I think of three couples that I interviewed today, all really love each other, or really care about each other.</span> <span id="s318">I picture, a beautiful picture of Mr. and Mrs. Colb walking, holding hands, each of them about 70 years old, walking, holding hands, he knows his wife is sick from cancer.</span> <span id="s319">He takes care of her.</span> <span id="s320">He’s a very genuine gentle individual.</span> <span id="s321">Notice his voice broke when he thought of his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">End of Tape Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s324">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0014 PAGE 12</span></p> <p><span id="s325">PAGE</span></p></body></html>
