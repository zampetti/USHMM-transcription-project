------?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Oh sure, sure, they knew it right away.</span> <span id="s139">"Watch out, they took 20 people, 30 people, they arrested."</span> <span id="s140">They used to go to a synagog, arrest everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: OK, so you had to move into the ghetto in Slovodko (ph).</span> <span id="s142">Was the process for getting over there --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: -- organized, or was it chaotic?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Organized for the Germans, for us was chaotic.</span> <span id="s146">But,

buggy.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: So you ordered them to take some of your furniture --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Some, yes, but then my mother was by herself in Slovodko, find the

Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: There wasn't a Jewish community that helped you with the change --</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No, at that time was nothing.</span> <span id="s155">The ghetto wasn't established, was not a Jewish committee, and soon the ghetto was founded, no?</span> <span id="s156">The Germans told to make a Jewish committee and a rabbi should be also present in the committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: I want to ask you about the committee in the next ------.</span> <span id="s158">Now, tell me a little bit about the conditions you were living in in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: The ghetto was like a jail, a family jail.</span> <span id="s160">--- a families in the jail.</span> <span id="s161">You couldn't go out by yourself, surrounded by wire if you need to go to work to town.</span> <span id="s162">Then became a Jewish working agency, you know?</span> <span id="s163">The Germans used to come, they need 200 people for airport, -- --- no.</span> <span id="s164">Came another one, they need 1000 people to work on the unload potatoes.</span> <span id="s165">Then after a while, everybody has his place where to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: What was your house like?</span> <span id="s167">How many rooms did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: We had one big room at first, almost like that: four people.</span> <span id="s169">Everybody sleep in one room.</span> <span id="s170">Because when we moved, later on that became "the little ghetto," that was like a trap and was an action in the ------ maybe.</span> <span id="s171">Three or four thousand people and took them right away to the -----------------.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: When was this, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Sure I remember, in 1941, August or September.</span> <span id="s174">I think it was a cry of others to work.</span> <span id="s175">They came out and making a little ------.</span> <span id="s176">And before the action they came in the houses, used to check on --------- as they would for shoes, suits they take away from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: They came to your house?</span> <span id="s178">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: So, these work groups: how ----------- what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: At first everybody worked on the airport, to clean snow and make trenches.</span> <span id="s181">But was not used to work orders, could have nothing what to eat and he could not go out and buy .</span> <span id="s182">At first I was very strong, in the kitchen you stood by yourself, you arrested, that's it.</span> <span id="s183">And little by little the Germans got used to us because most of us knew us a little spoke German.</span> <span id="s184">Then they worked the out for a long time in ------ Truck Park.</span> <span id="s185">The army trucks that had also not much to eat, I couldn't take towards them.</span> <span id="s186">A lot of people used to barter, they shift for a loaf of bread, a watch for something else; that was the real way of life.</span> <span id="s187">Until "the little ghetto" was liquidated, complete, and they went over to the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s188">And had no place where to live.</span> <span id="s189">Then my father found a man, he knew him maybe from six years ago, I don't know, ----- --------------.</span> <span id="s190">And met this man and he gave us a little room, maybe part of the kitchen, but --- intention, no?</span> <span id="s191">------ cause any problem, we had nothing what to barter or to sell what.</span> <span id="s192">My father told us "We can't go on like that."</span> <span id="s193">My sister worked, and I worked, my father worked all that time, and the mother was home preparing the cooking.</span> <span id="s194">Horse meat!</span> <span id="s195">(he laughs) Then for some reason my father knew a man before the War he did him a big favor, he was one the head for the work agency, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s198">And I don't know how he pushed me in to work like public.</span> <span id="s199">First for the light or potatoes, everything, and they used to manage to take home -- a loaf of bread, old bread, new --- something what's left over in the boxes, everything what's left over.</span> <span id="s200">And then sometimes some people used to get vodka, and vodka is a big item in wartime.</span> <span id="s201">A I used to get from gentiles used to bring us bread, potatoes, beets.</span> <span id="s202">For long time ------ the main dish was potatoes.</span> <span id="s203">And used to make from bread, soup, no?</span> <span id="s204">From the bread: used to cook it and cook it until become like a soup.</span> <span id="s205">Then later on they gave us the horsemeat.</span> <span id="s206">And later on my sister became a mate to a German family what came from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Were they inside or outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s209">They give her a sign that she can go by herself.</span> <span id="s210">This was a big deal that time.</span> <span id="s211">And she worked over there and the ghetto came in a man with a lot of leather, and they start to make ladies' pocketbooks.</span> <span id="s212">Then she used to go out every day with the pocketbooks which ----------- and sell it, and my father told not to carry too much.</span> <span id="s213">And she used to bring bread, a little butter, and some money, because in the ghetto everything suddenly became some little source, (he laughs) even butter -- potatoes for beets, potatoes for butter, potatoes for meat.</span> <span id="s214">No pets.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: In Poland you were descibing how you got food.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: And then we used to go in the countryside to load potatoes for the ----- and the ghetto to enter the main involving the park, no?</span> <span id="s217">I used always to go the sack with me in case they had something, always.</span> <span id="s218">I used to go to a town about 50 miles from Kovno, on the farm, and then I used to get everything -- apples from them -- for nothing because I used to speak well Lithuanian and that and that.</span> <span id="s219">Then I used to put in, too, three or four people used to put in three or four sacks of potatoes, big ones, and I used to try to talk to the driver to bring it at night after nine o'clock to the other side.</span> <span id="s220">Then used to start the clock I used to bring in one sack of potatoes and on the ground they gave me another one.</span> <span id="s221">Then my father used to wait for me sometimes and used to take it when he go'd home.</span> <span id="s222">And that was a couple at least for -</span></p> <p><span id="s223">-------.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Was there a risk in doing this --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Always, everything is a risk.</span> <span id="s226">As long as you step out from the ghetto is a risk; even ghetto a risk -- a policeman pass by, any time German pass by you must take a risk.</span> <span id="s227">And if you don't do it, they can shot you.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Did you see them do that?</span> <span id="s229">(no reply but he laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: How many people went out on these work groups with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Oh, thousands of those.</span> <span id="s232">At first, the ghetto starts at 20,000 people.</span> <span id="s233">Then after the big Aktion, no?</span> <span

with thousands of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s238">Was early in the morning, used to go out to the airport, publics, -------, everybody, and each group had a
