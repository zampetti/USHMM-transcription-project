Do you recall what your hometown was like at that age?</span> <span id="s49">The type</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A. Yes, with nine years I was already in school I came in school by six years, but I rememberedI remember still the problem that the people had at that time.</span> <span id="s51">Because there were no work, in Germany.</span> <span id="s52">Many, many millions of jobless people.</span> <span id="s53">They had no food, and so next to our school was a city hall, and very often as a young boy, I saw the workers outside in the street, marching in the street, protesting; and then the police came and waswe were fighting against the police, and so this was really the open door for Hitler to change the situation.</span> <span id="s54">He used the very big problem in Germany a bunch the people had: No work, no job and little bit money.</span> <span id="s55">And so people were suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q.</span> <span id="s57">In '33 when Hitler came to power with the Nazi party, what did you noticeor if you noticed any changein the school curriculum or school activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A. No.</span> <span id="s59">This Hitler had one minister, he was a minister of propaganda, Goebbels (or Gerbitz?)</span> <span id="s60">, Joseph Goebbels, and he started immediately the propaganda, and to tell all the people that the solution is with his party.</span> <span id="s61">And then it came over to the school.</span> <span id="s62">The teacher, they had to teach a new style, a new way of life, and little bit by little bit, from the school we heard then always the movement, what is better.</span> <span id="s63">And the people, they got a job.</span> <span id="s64">The people, they were not in the street, so everything started under control, and all the people were organized more and more by the Hitler Party.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q.</span> <span id="s66">What was the persuasion of your parents when it came to their, their religious and political background?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A. But, my father, he wasthey had fivemy grandparents they had five children, and my father was the oldest.</span> <span id="s68">And he was also in the line of the political way, more socialistic, and also my uncle he was in the same way, but later on my father he saw that the socialistic way is not the way out of the problem.</span> <span id="s69">And thenthen the, the National Socialist Party came in power.</span> <span id="s70">And my father was not convinced that they would make it because they had only another name for all this problem, what they offered to the people.</span> <span id="s71">Then they started marching on the street.</span> <span id="s72">The Party put everything, young people, old people in uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q.</span> <span id="s74">The Nazi party?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A.</span> <span id="s76">The Nazi party.</span> <span id="s77">My father, he was thinking something, maybe, it's not working because he had now his money for each day of his working, but my father was not a man to see here in this propaganda the solution of the problem.</span> <span id="s78">And so in school, we had more and more information, and like young people, it was easy to convince us that Hitler is a solution for all the problems in the world.</span> <span id="s79">And then we came home like children, and sometimes we say to our parents what Hitler really is, from the school we heard it, you know, and so then we asked our parents tonow we have to go in the Hitlerjugend, before it was Jungvolk, the younger one.</span> <span id="s80">Then the next step is Hitlerjugend.</span> <span id="s81">And all the young people in school, they had really all the information, and the invitation not in the way that you can think say yes or no, but in the way you go, we have to go.</span> <span id="s82">And so the classes of the school reallythe girls were Bundesdeutsche Madchen and the boys were Hitlerjugend or Jungvolkand then also the uniform.</span> <span id="s83">So I remember my parents, because they didn't have the money, the first we had to march into the thing and I hadn't uniform, I had only maybe a shirt, but they took everything.</span> <span id="s84">You know, later on by little bit by little bit they had the shirt and the trousers, so you can see on the street.</span> <span id="s85">And then they took me for the music with the trumpets, you know, this was really the best thing what Hitler did in his days.</span> <span id="s86">He used all the music on the street and, you know, if the music is on the street, you can catch the people.</span> <span id="s87">It's very easy.</span> <span id="s88">All the days, music on the street.</span> <span id="s89">And young people, old people and everything with music, and then the slogans.</span> <span id="s90">And by all this propaganda people were more and more thinking it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s91">And then they offered for the workers to have vacation.</span> <span id="s92">They build big boats.</span> <span id="s93">And they started to make Volkswagen.</span> <span id="s94">The name Volkswagen is the car for every one of the people, Volkswagen.</span> <span id="s95">And so all the families, they started already to save some money and for 990 mark you could have a Volkswagen.</span> <span id="s96">But Hitler used this money, then prepared really other thingswhat we later on found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q.</span> <span id="s98">So the people would order a car, but they didn't receive it?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A.Order the car, but then after the war, no one had a Volkswagen because the factory was working really preparing cars for the war, and in the war we had this Volkswagen already in all the parts of the world.</span> <span id="s100">But if the German soldiers were fighting in Africa or in Russia, in France, overall they had already the Volkswagen; so this factory was for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q.</span> <span id="s102">Now at this time, of course, you weren't one of the Jehovah Witnesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q.</span> <span id="s105">Now every day when you started off your classroom, how did they start off when the Nazi party came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A.</span> <span id="s107">You know the singing was in the school too.</span> <span id="s108">Heil Hitler was in the morning, and the teacher stepped in and we had to dress up and say Heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s109">So it was in the morning, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s110">And then it gave all the information in school, some lesson, what the party means, what is the National Socialistic Party.</span> <span id="s111">And then the music again, so we had to sing national songs like (holse veselead‑phon) and people they are all fallen on the street in the fightbecause Hitler was in the beginning in Munich the fighting.</span> <span id="s112">Some people were against him but he won.</span> <span id="s113">And so they made songs about this, and then the radio, the Germany then came up with the Volksempfanger.</span> <span id="s114">Volks again, like Volkswagen, a radio for every one of the people, Volksempfanger, receiver for the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q.</span> <span id="s116">So the people, people all received the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A.</span> <span id="s118">This Volksempfanger, this radio sort of like Volkswagen, Volksempfanger.</span> <span id="s119">Then another organization, under Hitler organization the National organization was (Kauf de freud cardaeff‑phon).</span> <span id="s120">It means power through joy because Hitler was telling the people you like to have joy because if you were working you're working hard, craft, working hard, but you can have this, this power, this craft through joy.</span> <span id="s121">So if you have more joy, you have more power.</span> <span id="s122">So this was another organization.</span> <span id="s123">There was the worker union like we have in the whole world we have the union, but he made his party, worker union party, was all the work group.</span> <span id="s124">All the workers were organized.</span> <span id="s125">So in all they were in different groups.</span> <span id="s126">And then they made small, small groups of houses, and each group of houses they had also Zellwart, was one man in charge.</span> <span id="s127">He was maybe over twenty, thirty families.</span> <span id="s128">So everything was organized.</span> <span id="s129">If one man or one woman they had another idea immediately he could take note and give the information to the men in charge over him.</span> <span id="s130">So there was no hole to slip through.</span> <span id="s131">Everything, everything was organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q.</span> <span id="s133">Now with your father's business was that also organized and under supervision?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s135">All the workers, all the workers they were organized and specially to find out who is going and who is for Hitler.</span> <span id="s136">It was first of May, like this date, the day in the whole world up to now they remember always the worker day first of May each year.</span> <span id="s137">And he used this day too.</span> <span id="s138">So now they could see who was coming and who was not coming.</span> <span id="s139">So they found out on these special days what is going on with the individual.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q.</span> <span id="s141">So who was supporting?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A. Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q.</span> <span id="s144">Now 1933 turned to 1934,'35.</span> <span id="s145">Did you notice as a young person people beginning to be picked up like the Jews, the gypsies</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A. No.</span> <span id="s147">But it was not known.</span> <span id="s148">People they started joking.</span> <span id="s149">Joking because something waswas already through, some information.</span> <span id="s150">Some people they had idea, but the generalmainly all the people didn't know that this had happened.</span> <span id="s151">But they say for example they made a joke about the (tunvay‑phon), the (tunvay).</span> <span id="s152">The (tunvay) is a conductor, and who is not behind the conductor is in the (custom?)</span> <span id="s153">(tunvay) it means prison.</span> <span id="s154">So who is not behind the Fuhrer, behind the conductor, behind Hitler, he is in prison.</span> <span id="s155">So they made already some jokes that if one person is not behind Hitler, behind this conductor, he is sitting in prison like in the (tunvay), you know.</span> <span id="s156">So they were joking, and then they came, the word already through the concentration camp, but the name, they were only known the name because they said, konzertlager, the camp for to make music.</span> <span id="s157">You know, concert, in a different way.</span> <span id="s158">So this was also known, but the people never had an idea what it means because they said we have some camps that we have people in.</span> <span id="s159">We will bring people in.</span> <span id="s160">They are in corruption against the community.</span> <span id="s161">Maybe one person is not working or will not work.</span> <span id="s162">Then they said we bring this to this camp, and in the camp we show him to work, we train him.</span> <span id="s163">And this was the idea, train him.</span> <span id="s164">And this was the idea, not in the way of prison immediately.</span> <span id="s165">So in general it was little bit known, but almost up to 1945 after the war was finishing, in all the years the men on the street really had no idea what it means the concentration camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s166">But the people, they were surprised when they call it (Christenaught), that was the night where all the stores, the Jewish stores, the windows were broken.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q.</span> <span id="s168">That was'38 right?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A. '38, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q.</span> <span id="s171">How old were you then when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A. I was 14 already.</span> <span id="s173">So I saw this with my eyes.</span> <span id="s174">And the morning I went to work because when I was 14 I started to work in the office where my father was.</span> <span id="s175">And I had my bicycle and all the money about passing the Jewish synagogue.</span> <span id="s176">This very, very famous and big synagogue of the Jewish people in Essen.</span> <span id="s177">And I saw fire came out, and the firemen they were waiting.</span> <span id="s178">They had the big cars, the red cars, and they had ready the water, but didn't use it.</span> <span id="s179">They were only protecting, waiting until the fire was not going over to another place.</span> <span id="s180">They left it and the flames.</span> <span id="s181">And I saw Jewish people, responsible men of the synagogue, taking some material out in the smoke, running around.</span> <span id="s182">Then our office was in the center of Essen, and Essen is a big, big city like, like (Cope?)</span> <span id="s183">Cope is well-known in the world.</span> <span id="s184">And this, all the streets, all the streets, we had many Jews, Jewish businessmen and stores and all the windows were open, broken.</span> <span id="s185">So the police were watching that no one stepped in and were stealing, especially Jewish people had stores clothing stores, and very good stores you could buy really good from the stores.</span> <span id="s186">But they made a big, very big fight against the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s187">So thenbefore it starts they made really the propaganda to in school, school and all the places how bad are the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s188">Because then they prepared the people.</span> <span id="s189">And then finally they did it.</span> <span id="s190">They burned down the (Christenaut‑phon), and they burned down all the Jewish synagogues they burned down everything that they had.</span> <span id="s191">And this was now the, the biggest problem at the moment that the German people were prepared that had something is coming up.</span> <span id="s192">And then they saw thewhat is going on and then they said finally, the propaganda said it's all right because if they take our energy, the Jewish people, they take our money, they take our blood, they say the propaganda, then they have to do something against these people.</span> <span id="s193">And then SS, this formation of Hitler, they werethey did it and they made it in one night, whole Germany, the same hour they started this big, big fight against the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q.</span> <span id="s195">Did you have any friend information school who were Jewish?</span> <span id="s196">Did you deal with them about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A. Not in our class we didn't have it.</span> <span id="s198">But I remember a few of these people by greeting in the neighborhood and like that.</span> <span id="s199">But the Jewish people were really suffering.</span> <span id="s200">And then it started, came a new law that all the Jewish people they had to take the starthey call it David star.</span> <span id="s201">Nothing to do with Davidbut they had to wear this and soon there came the winter, and then the Jewish people they took all these people all the day to clean the streets, to take the snow away.</span> <span id="s202">They started already to punish these people with hard work.</span> <span id="s203">And in all the stores was a sign now, with: Don't buy in Jewish stores, you know, like that because they couldn't close all the stores at the moment, but they made a propaganda that one man is really a good man for Hitler if he never buy from Jewish people so the Jewish people they could not sell.</span> <span id="s204">So everybody had to close like that too.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q.</span> <span id="s206">How did people like your father who was in business and other business associates</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A. Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q.feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s210">But it start already I say to you.</span> <span id="s211">It started already that people they were quiet, you know, because telling something against or make comments not in favor, you could think,, yes that they will take you.</span> <span id="s212">Because the people in the neighborhood they had already information that some people were missing, they didn't return.</span> <span id="s213">So by this there was already something under way.</span> <span id="s214">And then this name, because people came to the concentration camp they could hide maybe one small note, but the name was officially, but they didn't know what it means.</span> <span id="s215">So the people were quiet, and then it was not possible because it couldyou, the police could come immediately if you would try to listen to BBC, to London, to news.</span> <span id="s216">Because BBC, German calling, BBC was all non power and gave all the information and telling the people what is going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s217">So secretly many people are listening to BBC, but if they found out, they could hear that you are listening the BBC station, the radio station, then they would tell this Zellwart, this man in charge over the 30 families, they would tell him, look there is something wrong with this man.</span> <span id="s218">Listen toand then they had two witness or three and then they took him away.</span> <span id="s219">And this was already a crime in Germany, listening to a radio station, BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q.</span> <span id="s221">So they had total control?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A. Sure, sure.</span> <span id="s223">Then, you know, in the program of the radio, the entertainment, everything was in favor of the Party.</span> <span id="s224">You know, they made the music and the theater, and they use famous men too they're known people you know, sometimes they love this man in the theater or this musician, and then they tookand then they started to cut like Mendelssohn, all the composer, like Jews with Jewish names the music they cut everything.</span> <span id="s225">So they didn't like to listen.</span> <span id="s226">Like Wagner was fine.</span> <span id="s227">Wagner was for Hitler the best man because he was in his (Vallehalla‑phon) he did not have the religion in the way of Catholics or (inaudible) he had this Germanic (Vallehalla‑phon) or Roudin the German gods.</span> <span id="s228">And this was Wagner.</span> <span id="s229">And Hitler was a man, he was happy with this music of Wagner, and so he took this kind of music and all the days and all the nights, all the programs they were on.</span> <span id="s230">So they were watching you step by step.</span> <span id="s231">Everything was under control.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q.</span> <span id="s233">Now did you know any of Jehovah's Witnesses at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A. No.</span> <span id="s235">No.</span> <span id="s236">But I know what I know like a young fellow that my parents, they received sometimes visitors, especially my mother, she had like she was, she went sometimes to vacation because she was always sick.</span> <span id="s237">And one of Jehovah's Witnesses in the vacation time was speaking to my mother, and by this Jehovah's Witnesses had the direction of my mother and my father and then they received sometimes a little bit of literature, but they couldn't come through.</span> <span id="s238">Then after the war was over, this group of Jehovah's Witnesses they remembered we had some readers of the Watchtower like you have today, subscription, and it's very contented and immediately my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s239">And so they gave a study, they started to study with them and after few months they were ready for baptism because they know something already but they didn't know exactly what is a procedure and what is to do.</span> <span id="s240">And then they explained, they came out of the camp Jehovah's Witnesses and they said now we have to preach and what should we do.</span> <span id="s241">They started then with the people they had in mind.</span> <span id="s242">They were already contacted before the war or in the war time.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q.</span> <span id="s244">But at the time, of course, they just came in contact with them occasionally?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s246">By then they started, and then my father, my mother, and my brother came after one year home from like a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s247">He was in (Shaborg‑phon) in France, and then he became a Jehovah's Witnesses too.</span> <span id="s248">And I came home then after one year from like a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s249">I escapedit was because I was without information about my parents.</span> <span id="s250">It was because I was wounded in the Russia front.</span> <span id="s251">I was in Russia then we came to hold back.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s253">Maybe we should go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s254">Let's go back to the timeframe then when you firstlet's go back to the time exactly when Germany attacked Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A. Um‑hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q.</span> <span id="s257">What was your reaction?</span> <span id="s258">By then you were 16, 17?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q.</span> <span id="s261">What happened in your home?</span> <span id="s262">How did they feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A.</span> <span id="s264">It started with musicwith music.</span> <span id="s265">Then it was special news, they made announcement on the radio, before, one hour before any music, music, music.</span> <span id="s266">And you could sometimes hear the voice of Hitler, special occasion Hitler talked.</span> <span id="s267">And if it was something from Hitler, all of people had to gather.</span> <span id="s268">In the school, the workers, to listen to the loud speaker.</span> <span id="s269">And also before then they had to come together.</span> <span id="s270">And then they announced that the [inaudible], the German troops were attacking Poland because they prepared it days before it was already some problem.</span> <span id="s271">They produced problems.</span> <span id="s272">They produce it, you could see it.</span> <span id="s273">You know, people were fighting and they were not nice and they took people away and captured people something like that.</span> <span id="s274">And so Hitler was finally he said we are tired, we have enough, and we need to our right, our German right because in these places like Poland, all these cities belong now to Poland but they're under Germany.</span> <span id="s275">All these big towns up to Duncy what Poland is today, Duncy, where Walesa is.</span> <span id="s276">All these were German, but if you had to trouble from the German side to the east side to…we called it…corridor the trainbut hit her says this was taken away this is non…we have to take all this because the germ…the German…nation and then he started and said we have to clean up so it was then the Polish people were not prepared really for that it was a matter of attacking and then but later on the people found out in the Spanish Civil War from…could, Germany was helping…could he but what they did, this was a night field for Hitler to try all his new bombs, all this…arrest, this…young…came was come…then it came down from the top came…like bombs the whole airplane came down with a sound terrible sound and this he was, he was trying, then Italy…</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q.</span> <span id="s278">Did he do this, this Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A. Yes but he was trying before this, this Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q.</span> <span id="s281">So he was trying out his weapon…?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A. Sure pain span was really for Hitler a good field for testing the weapon.</span> <span id="s283">But so German soldiers take him to Spain and owl one of the Jehovah’s Witnesses in, in Hamburg is in Hamburg he was in Spain too and he was a soldier at that time he wasn't a Witness but he was already here in Spain and so he had alreadythishe had experienced this for that.</span> <span id="s284">This you see it sometimes you knows it's not the first time but some nation do the same before they start a war they do it to another nation to find out how it worked…so Hitler did this and he was very organized with his army and it was hard at all.</span> <span id="s285">We go in and to take it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q. Do you remember what your father said when Hitler went to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A. No my father didn't make many comments because it was also a problem in the families.</span> <span id="s288">Because the young people the children, they were really supporting mostly hundred percent Hitler.</span> <span id="s289">So we had…wed cases that the father said something and his own son was telling to the Nazi party my father is…so this was splitting also some families and there's not one family in…families it's the same problem by this, so all the apparent it's didn't talk to their own…because it is not only one case there are many, many cases and</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q.</span> <span id="s291">So the children being at school eight hours a daysure the children they were already…in favor of his letter this is for sure and…peace of music you can get easy you can change and hit letter had his minister of propaganda</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q.</span> <span id="s293">He was like a Pied Piper?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A. Yes…said once it's with very good propaganda you can make Mr. The hell fire paradise and you can make from the paper…a hell fire it…only on the propaganda how you make the propaganda.</span> <span id="s295">So he had this style and then he send all those into school the speakers of the army especially if they started with the SS because SS was before the party but later on he formed also the mitt tear SS, in black, and then by this SS, you could see really that they came to the school and they taught, taught us in school already that how nice it is later on to be a…sole injury and then they made everything they said we are different this is higher than the other soldiers there are spiritual higher their blood is better, the…is better.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q. You're saying now that the SS were higher spiritual…?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A. Yes…?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A. And he show already some pictures in the school and how nice it is and the companion ship.</span> <span id="s299">You can trust was one special thing I remember still they didn't lock the war up, they didn't lock the doors, everything was open.</span> <span id="s300">So stealing was not known in this…of SS.</span> <span id="s301">Then looking for people really you could trust they made is very high standard so interesting is everything was open not locked.</span> <span id="s302">There was a difference already because like the general soldiers they could lock they close the things but here was different.</span> <span id="s303">So by that only they show differences young people they were happy.</span> <span id="s304">And so many to sign already like young people they are thinking a few years then ready for the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q.</span> <span id="s306">So they were going to sign up?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A. Yes they made list already in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q. Examine how did you feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A.</span> <span id="s310">In this case I was thinking I like to ask my father.</span> <span id="s311">What he…</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A.</span> <span id="s313">In case I was thinking I like to ask my father.</span> <span id="s314">What he thinks.</span> <span id="s315">And then I talked to…and he said be careful that you make step too early watch everything body's coming up like that he said to me and he said if you later on you'll be a sole injury or something like that it's still all right to not go in this higher class you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q.</span> <span id="s317">But you were saying also that parents were a little concerned about saying too much…tow their…because children had to report</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A. Yes because in the school and in the hit letter young, we had wed meetings, not only…on the street there were special meetings information, talks, and then in that meeting which we had wed there was also information that we should help the parent it's because they made reports about parents not supporting hit letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q.</span> <span id="s320">So children would tall tee make a little…hair another or father?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A. Sure but before he gave talk…he said if something is wrong the hit letter…the people more in charge the higher ones they should listen to you and they can help you so they like already that the family is united.</span> <span id="s322">The family should believe in the same sort of spirit not the parents should have another idea and so the young people they had the assignment to help their own parents so then they started also the sports, everything was made up to be the winner to make a better and then in this festival of the sport they invited their parents and again the music and the parents they were happy to see their own children how they can…how they can spring how they can dance how they can sing everything, so more and more, the fathers when…say oh, it's not too bad that's all right.</span> <span id="s323">It took a little bit of time but not too much this was very, very quick in few years they had control over everything.</span> <span id="s324">And always we have to remember if we like today, I have the Bible truth I know what Jehovah is asking to his people what is his law, but at that time, we didn't have any information.</span> <span id="s325">God they spoke about God, but mat way of hit letter.</span> <span id="s326">Hit letterhe also said always he talked always the…nation or predestination.</span> <span id="s327">Predestination.</span> <span id="s328">He was always talking about his life is protected by God.</span> <span id="s329">So then by this way, also religious people they said oh, this is a man he is not against God.</span> <span id="s330">He started some sometime things again to churches so the churches the…they split it.</span> <span id="s331">They made…Protestant for his letter.</span> <span id="s332">They called them doubt much Christian…much Christian…German Christian it was…church…very strong it was heart of hit letter and one…from…supported his letter and one…from…from immune sister…hat letter once he said his letter is a gift from heaven.</span> <span id="s333">So if the…is tells this to his people then the people they say oh, look our religious leaders also support hit letter and show they got if from the young people they got it from the church and supports all, all things and only few people maybe they were different later on you ask for these people the people said we don't know but he is not lives here and feign leap later on we found out about what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q. Were your parents going to church at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A. No, no…father my father I told you will in the beginning, he had the idea social…way is the best thing because…father, the parents…lick people, they were and the grandparents very strong in the Catholic church but they had no knowledge they only were performing the morning and maybe twice they were always asking go to church but only the care moan and Christmas time and…this but without basis without knowledge.</span> <span id="s336">I remember as a young boy I observed very often…in the door calling out you have a small deck…and a small vessel, then northerly there should be water in and then you go out from our house and you take your finger and take the water but as a young boy I always looked in it was always dry I did it but there was no water in it so I saw also the…the grandparents my father he was observing the parents they were happy to have my father like a priest because my father was studying Latin and he later on as a boy I found many…of middle father in his preparation to be a priest but he didn't like it.</span> <span id="s337">He went to the political side but later on in the political way he found all these problem that is people have and he said that is not the way.</span> <span id="s338">That made my father easier for him very easy after the war to under the Bible truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q.</span> <span id="s340">Now in connection with your family how many brothers and sisters did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A. I had one brother east three years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q. Younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A. Hum-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q.</span> <span id="s345">So what was the year that you…the military and what was the year that he entered the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A.</span> <span id="s347">It was 1942, 1942.</span> <span id="s348">They called me.</span> <span id="s349">First they called me to obvious…it was a service the young people before they enter the mail tear it was organization also to work they had like a minithe training was the same like we have it in the military.</span> <span id="s350">It's only preparation for the military.</span> <span id="s351">And.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q. And that was called what now?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A. Obvious he is…The service to work…and everything was organized.</span> <span id="s354">The uniforms…and you had no notyou wear…in the same system because to step over from the…it was automatically…military.</span> <span id="s355">I remember they took us already to Russia from the…but if you finish these month it's maybe…six months or eight months…it took us immediately over to the military there was no change you only changed uniform.</span> <span id="s356">So from the…and, and the military, hit letter was already in rush ewe and so I went up to the cocaine…we had…wedI was first in the transportation which was by trucks to send all the materialso you were a driver?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A. Drive.</span> <span id="s358">I was first then later on in the mill…I receive training for anti-aircraft.</span> <span id="s359">I was trained by that.</span> <span id="s360">Everything.</span> <span id="s361">With two-centimeters we three.</span> <span id="s362">Seven-centimeters with eight.</span> <span id="s363">Eight-centimeters I received training for all this anti-aircraft and then they took us for that too you know, so the war was worse and worse each day and then I was once in Denmark because in Denmark they had the airports for the German fighters the bottom-bomber, and they went to England.</span> <span id="s364">And were…land I came home in the night and then behind were always English speed fire the air…called speed fire for…name they had tune…bulb and…came and then if they came down the German air…then…behind because they need some light on the ground and then they bump them and so our position was over there to protect the airplane comes down and shooting against this English airplane it was one…and hen later on in Russia again and they moved you around all the time and then so I saw many, many, many things but I always thought it was my feelingI had a very, very bad feeling in the war.</span> <span id="s365">Because I remember I was sitting in my canon and the English pilot he came down to me.</span> <span id="s366">I saw him coming against me, I saw already I saw him already coming very close and…he was start and I will, will start then I follow my sit on the canon I fall out I don't know how I fall out and he was have there was a who will to protect us mostly against the bombs and he did nothing and I did the same I did nothing too -- or many, many owe…but one day we came back from Russia…in Germany in east part of Germany today, and the rub an were there and here and they bombed us down and then I was wounded from one bottom-bomb of the rush an airplane…took me…hospital later on.</span> <span id="s367">There were everything over…and I came on the train with thousand soldiers wounded and…tree…and then they cured me and then almost the war came to the end.</span> <span id="s368">And then the French soldiers came and took us in…hospital like prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q.</span> <span id="s370">How did they treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A.</span> <span id="s372">The French were with all bread.</span> <span id="s373">The people can don't have bread so what can you expect?</span> <span id="s374">So we were really suffering.</span> <span id="s375">And then I was working little bit outside for some French soldiers</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q.</span> <span id="s377">You mean from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A.</span> <span id="s379">In the camp in the…they took us out from the camp</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q.</span> <span id="s381">So you were a prisoner of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A. Prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s383">So then they took us out after in January ‘46 it was in ought tree…we had wed some people with me and some others also prisoner…we said what should we do.</span> <span id="s384">We have to idea with our parents our family.</span> <span id="s385">We are leaving or not they are dead or what is going on so one day we said we have to escape so we prepared our escape were the camp and we did it one evening we are outside working they took us to work…and then six o'clock that evening, we made a…We go and escape we jump out of window and next to the house was a forest and so we started our way home but it was terrible because it was wintertime to…high snow, the whole night we were walking…we didn't know what was going on we were think I we are going the right way.</span> <span id="s386">We are walks around in a circle.</span> <span id="s387">And the next morning the light we saw in the border from Switzerland we are complete plea in another direction so then we cross-walked day…up to we came…ordered food and then we heard there was an American camp and they camp they will take us.</span> <span id="s388">And then they made some paper…came home four months.</span> <span id="s389">In four month it's time my parents gave me the information about the truth.</span> <span id="s390">This was…basically my good step.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q. Okay maybe we'll finish this later?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A. Okay now and then after that four months later, the British one British captain came and he said you are George…you escaped prisoner of war from the French side I said yes.</span> <span id="s393">We have to come and then they took me again…principal…prison they give me back to the French and so I was suffering two years more and I went back to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q.</span> <span id="s395">So you were a prisoner of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A. Two years more.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q. …</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A.</span> <span id="s399">That two engineers but I had already the whole truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q. And so you became acquainted with…?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A. And then I already contact in France the lit…from Paris from Switzerland and by this I could prepare I could read the whole Bible in like a prisoner of war because before I was working already but now I had time I didn't like to but I should work so by that time I could prepare myself and then I came home and made immediately my baptism.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q.</span> <span id="s403">How did the treat you in the prisoner of war camp in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A.</span> <span id="s405">It was because we escaped as I mentioned in the camp they made another camp because they called us very dangerous people because we escaped that was the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q.</span> <span id="s407">So yours was a little…harsh treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A. Harsh treatment, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q. Perhaps we can go back to this question how did they treat you in the prisoner of war camp now that they caught you after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A. Yes you know, I escaped and then after four months, they took us back as a prisoner of war to France and they put us in the camp but in the camp there was another camp so because they said we are dangerous people, they must protect us more and each day…we had…we’d only maybe eight or nine business kits, a little bit of food and super.</span> <span id="s411">You could not see the food only water sometimes you would see auto little vegetable inside.</span> <span id="s412">That was all so after almost one year again, on the second war of my imprisonment.</span> <span id="s413">We’d only all the…we were only bones.</span> <span id="s414">We had no weight.</span> <span id="s415">Suffering…food, we didn't have food.</span> <span id="s416">So by this suffering, sometimes I was thinking why…all?</span> <span id="s417">And then by my Bible understanding what he had already, I could answer easier this yes because some prisoners they were trying to go…escape again, but they didn't have access…it's French from the high tower they got them easy or they shooted them so I saw this was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s418">So I was thinking “I will, will stay.”</span> <span id="s419">“I will, will not escape again.”</span> <span id="s420">After time is coming to give us it's paper to be free.</span> <span id="s421">And this was not easy then I came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q.</span> <span id="s423">Now what was the date of your release?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A. 1948, three years after its war.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q. Okay now what was the name of the camp that were in where was it located?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A. I was in different camps I was in Strasbourg, you know that famous city now, the European…Strasbourg this was a town.</span> <span id="s427">Then I was in…then I was in…written…down in the Mediterranean in France so they took us to different places.</span> <span id="s428">And the last year…the last year there was one prisoner, he was…our home town and he took me a little bit out to work and by that I got a little bit more food so I could build up my body, so I didn't die because many, many died.</span> <span id="s429">Thousands, thousands of prisoners died after the war.</span> <span id="s430">Because the French nation the French people they didn't have food and most of what we received came from the states and all the clothing everything what we need, it came from the states.</span> <span id="s431">As you remember Germany was over France and the time of vessel war Germany took everything from France away and by this the French people…not polite any way they had…but they were really after the war the…knees and so the suffering was also.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q.</span> <span id="s433">So in…sense they are try to get even?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A. Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s435">So we always were thinking if it is possible and never come into captain…under the rush an or under the French people because he heard already some prisoners they were in the catch from the states or…land they were not suffering because they had a nicer treatment…France the French people they had the First World War in the mind and the…World War in the…and the nation was suffers because of what hit letter did then French had all the mean use people and many came…camp and were dying and all this was well known after the war.</span> <span id="s436">They showed immediately the pictures from the troops American the British traps came in the camp…Germany and really they show the people the whole word show all this papers, and the pictures and then they showed how the people suffered so there was only one word always against us.</span> <span id="s437">But I was thinking the Bible showed this that the time of the end is the time of problems and I found a solution always looking in the Bible again by God's kingdom because I learned from the Bible that in the time of the end, we have difficult time, difficult time and the people they will not show enough love they will treat not heart flee, they will be…knees and all this I studied from the Bible…so we are really hurting in the time of the, the end and I could under the situation better without knowledge because the people without knowledge they were suffering more.</span> <span id="s438">They know the way out is easier if you were like a prisoner you know, to see it's…to see it was nice and I was in France in the camp and from one on one occasion I go to the book from brother route forth in Germany, we call it the…fry it's…ford he wrote these different books the president of the watch tower society and this book was taught was…so I saw this book, book and I was a prisoner and now I think with you…later on I under more and more…is something different not only…from machine or materialism…really from more things…human kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q. I'd like to go back a little bit to the time you were a young man just before you went into the military or maybe even after when you first went into…group…preceded the actual military did you ever…he wills speak or hit letter speak himself to encourage national…there was one leader, it was balance do…cheer…it was the leader for the young people and he came and we had all to go to, to place and all the young people, the young girls, the young boys all in uniforms had to sing and the music and then he gave his talk.</span> <span id="s440">And all the young people we had is slow began this was all the something that they put why our mind blood and honor, blood and honor…it was one…blood and honor, blood and honor.</span> <span id="s441">There was one…And then they put in our mind the…is mere as…the flag is more than the death.</span> <span id="s442">So they filled our mind already what it means nationalism.</span> <span id="s443">To be this later on superior.</span> <span id="s444">They put in our mind like the Jew itch people this the contrast between races and so by this to make our feeling superior, later on by doing by speaking all the time and like they make is big assembly with this ball…or they gathered us to…hit letter from…each week the new… USHMM Archives RG-50.028*0050 PAGE 15</span></p></body></html>
