Well, I came into a house with four grown up people and to do the-- I had to clean the complete house, it was expected to do all the cooking, all the washing and that was rather difficult because I had never done anything like that, being used to an office job and coming from home where I did some cooking of course, German style, but not the English style which they expected me to do.</span> <span id="s4">The thoughts which crept into my mind, the adjustment which I had to do can’t even be described in words because it was the feeling you had—perhaps it should be expected to say “thank you for letting me come to England to be alive.”</span> <span id="s5">That is one thought but then also, I had my mother and my sister still in Germany and that was also on my mind knowing that the war was imminent to break out—and also when you did the laundry in the cold garage and in the winter time, you had to hang out the wash in the garden and do the blankets which we didn’t have to do in Germany and then a couple of things which are outstanding in my mind—I was expected to sleep with the lady of the house in the same room, which I refused.</span> <span id="s6">and then I had my own room: small but it was mine.</span> <span id="s7">And one thing more was, that I call him an old man, but he was kind of handicapped and they expected me to give him a bath, which I, of course, also refused.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Was it easy to refuse?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A. No, it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s10">I just pretended I don’t understand so much English, that I refused him, not in so many words, but I made myself understood that it was no and they understood it.</span> <span id="s11">They had to keep me for a year because they were kind of obliged to keep me.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q.</span> <span id="s13">That was what I meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A.</span> <span id="s15">They had to keep me for a year because we had to report to the police ever so often, especially after September 3rd, and finally it became so that, just before the year was out, before Christmas, I got a job offered also as a domestic near where my sister worked and that job was even worse.</span> <span id="s16">That was a house I would say, it was a large villa with 20 rooms which I was expected to keep clean.</span> <span id="s17">The lady of the house went with white gloves about the fireplace to see that I had dusted that morning and there were two children which I had to keep: a baby and a boy.</span> <span id="s18">Of course, the cooking had to be done and everything and I, from about two months, I lost about 50 pounds in weight because I was on the go from 6 a.m. until 12 at night because I had no where else to go.</span> <span id="s19">Finally, I had to let go because my health didn’t hold up so the lady where my sister was then working took me kindly in and found a job for me which was more suitable as a domestic.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">What would happen if you didn’t have a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A. I suppose you could have applied to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s22">I happened to be in Yorkshire.</span> <span id="s23">In Leeds they would have taken care of you and found a job for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q.</span> <span id="s25">It must have been terribly difficult coming from an office job to essentially a job as a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A.</span> <span id="s27">In retrospect, thinking about it now, there was one thing uppermost in my mind.</span> <span id="s28">You don’t care what you do so long as you have a chance to try to bring out your sister and your mother and being I would say a more sensible person, I had to swallow my pride in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q.</span> <span id="s30">You mentioned learning how to cook English-style.</span> <span id="s31">Did anyone try to help you, the other employees?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A. Oh, there were no other employees in the house.</span> <span id="s33">I was the only one and I remember leeks, the green vegetable, well, I have never known to put the meat in the oven with it.</span> <span id="s34">That I didn’t mind, cook potatoes and vegetables in water.</span> <span id="s35">What she told me, I did it.</span> <span id="s36">But when she told me we are having company tonight, cook leeks and I had never seen that thing.</span> <span id="s37">And when she came home she said, “Where are the leeks?”</span> <span id="s38">I said I don’t know what you are talking about.</span> <span id="s39">So she said, “Well, haven’t you cleaned them?”</span> <span id="s40">I didn’t know there was sand inside or anything.</span> <span id="s41">So once she showed, then it was alright but without being shown, then you can’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q. Were they kind to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A.</span> <span id="s44">In their fashion I think so.</span> <span id="s45">They thought that they were doing something for the Jews; they themselves were Jews, and helping the German Jews—that was on their mind—showing me off as a refugee.</span> <span id="s46">I don’t think it was kindness.</span> <span id="s47">It was more like here; I’m doing something for the poor refugee from Germany.</span> <span id="s48">That, God forbid, had the war gone in a different direction, they might have been in the same shoes we were, that didn’t even occur to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q.</span> <span id="s50">That must have been quite difficult to cope with—that attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A. I can only say one thing: when they weren’t in that house and I had to do the housework, I would say that most nights that is true but also during the day time, I was continuously in tears.</span> <span id="s52">And of course, when they came home and then they said, “What, have you been crying again?”</span> <span id="s53">I had to kind of wash my eyes and contain myself, steel myself that is a better word, not to let them see how you feel inside because they felt: look what we’ve done for her, she should be eternally grateful.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q.</span> <span id="s55">A lot must have to do with homesickness.</span> <span id="s56">It was a totally different environment.</span> <span id="s57">You came from Berlin and you were now in a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A. I had never been away from home.</span> <span id="s59">I had never been separated from my sister; I had never been separated from my mother.</span> <span id="s60">It was—I had no other thoughts in mind but homesickness.</span> <span id="s61">And then, of course, you couldn’t show it to them.</span> <span id="s62">And I said to myself quite often, don’t be so silly; if you aren’t here…you have to do the things for my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s63">That sometimes steeled me for the setbacks which I had.</span> <span id="s64">But when Lilo came over, I came in January and she came in August 1939, she didn’t recognize me; I had lost so much weight.</span> <span id="s65">I mean good for me, I’m not complaining, I was overweight anyhow but I lost so much weight that she hardly recognized me.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q.</span> <span id="s67">Did your feelings change when Lilo came?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A. Well at least I had somebody from home and she was new so it was still up to me to try to get my mother out.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q.</span> <span id="s70">There must have been a lot of other girls, English girls not necessarily in the same position, but did they befriend you?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A. Funny you should ask that.</span> <span id="s72">It was such a small place—there was absolutely nobody.</span> <span id="s73">I had nobody to talk to with the exception of the policeman who asked me into his house—didn’t give me anything to eat or anything like that but that wasn’t necessary but just to talk to somebody other than being told aren’t you this, aren’t you that, why haven’t you done this and why haven’t you done that?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q.</span> <span id="s75">So the relationship within the house was strictly an employer-employee…</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A. No doubt about that.</span> <span id="s77">And also that you should be grateful that you are getting paid 50 shillings a week, which I dutifully saved.</span> <span id="s78">I had half a day free a week and that half a day consisted—I was allowed to leave the house by 12 or 1 o’clock but I had to be back by 6 o’clock to cook the supper.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q.</span> <span id="s80">What did you do with your time off?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A. Well, I went to—there was nothing else to do but go to the pictures and I went invariably every week to see another film and I had—there was a place where I went for tea and I had a cup of tea and something to eat because the food which they left me—the lady said you can have baked beans for lunch.</span> <span id="s82">I never had baked beans in my life.</span> <span id="s83">I mean our idea was a sandwich or something like this and the things she offered me to eat for lunch were so—the baked beans stand out in my mind.</span> <span id="s84">I can’t remember what else she left for me but it was so distasteful to me that I often went out and bought some sausage or some cheese that I could have something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q.</span> <span id="s86">Did you eat other meals with the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A. Oh certainly not.</span> <span id="s88">I mean the maid is supposed to eat in the kitchen, strictly in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q. And since there was no other help, you ate by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A. Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q. And when you went to the movies or this little restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A. All by myself.</span> <span id="s93">Never anybody.</span> <span id="s94">There was nobody there, only the policeman.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q. Everybody needs somebody just to talk to.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A. Yes, but there was nobody.</span> <span id="s97">There was one good thing for me because in the eight months that I was strictly by myself I had no opportunity to speak one word of German.</span> <span id="s98">I spoke English all the time or I had to speak English so that in about 10 months, I was almost fluent.</span> <span id="s99">I spoke some English before and I had private lessons in Germany but I spoke fluent English because of this—even my sister was surprised when she came over.</span></p></body></html>
