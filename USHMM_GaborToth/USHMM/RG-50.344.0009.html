Law.</span> <span id="s5">Today is July 15th, 1995.</span> <span id="s6">We’re in West Park, New York.</span> <span id="s7">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s8">Please tell me, if you would, when were you born and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Answer: I was born July fifth, 1922, in Lakewin, Pennsylvania, which is now a ghost town.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s11">Nobody lives there any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s14">Little tiny place?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Used to be a big place, but it’s gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s19">And did you go to school there and through high school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s21">I went to school in Leroy, Pennsylvania and Troy, Pennsylvania and Grandville Summit, Pennsylvania and Newburg, New York for my training.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Nurse’s training?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Where did you graduate from high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Saint Luke’s -- oh, high school?</span> <span id="s26">In Troy, Pennsylvania and then I came down here and graduated from Saint Luke’s Hospital Nursing School.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Why did you decide to become a nurse?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Well, that’s a long story.</span> <span id="s29">When I was a kid, I wanted to be a librarian, but I did a whole lot of nursing all my life, with six siblings and I was the oldest.</span> <span id="s30">After I got out of high school, I was too young to go to nurse’s training, so I did practical nursing in our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s31">So my aunt decided -- who was a nurse, decided that I need that I need to be a nurse.</span> <span id="s32">And I had no funds to g -- be a librarian, so I went into nursing.</span> <span id="s33">And I enjoyed it, yeah.</span> <span id="s34">So that’s why I’m in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: And after I graduated from Saint Luke’s down here, then I took a job at Saint Luke’s, until I went in the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s38">Wh-When did you graduate from nursing -- nurse’s training?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: And how did you decide to go in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, I was working nights with a friend and I didn’t like the work.</span> <span id="s44">And I wanted to get in the service, so I had to keep fighting with my director and the Red Cross to get in.</span> <span id="s45">That was it, I wanted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Did your family want you to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Oh, they -- they wouldn’t -- I was independent [inaudible] family [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Didn’t matter?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I’d been working since I was 12 years old, away from home, so it didn’t matter, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Worked my way through school and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s53">Did -- what -- what -- what were you saying about the Red Cross and --</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Well, at that time our director of nursing was involved with the Red Cross recruitment.</span> <span id="s55">She wouldn’t let me go from the hospital for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: She wouldn’t let you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: No, wouldn’t let me leave the hospital job that I had.</span> <span id="s58">It was essential, they called it essential at that time.</span> <span id="s59">And after asking her two or three different times, she finally consented to let -- release me.</span> <span id="s60">So I entered in, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s62">And where did you do your basic training?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: I did my basic training in Atlantic City.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s65">With a lot of these other women here?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Yes, with Claire Fikes was here, yeah.</span> <span id="s67">She was in my class.</span> <span id="s68">And [indecipherable] was in a class before me or after me.</span> <span id="s69">All Atlantic City.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: How was that?</span> <span id="s71">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Well, it was rough, because it wasn’t nursing.</span> <span id="s73">We marched, you know, 20 miles and with a pack on your back, in the sand down there, in the hot sun in June and July.</span> <span id="s74">And we all had shots for all different kinds of diseases and after they gave us the shots they told us we could have a weekend home and nobody -- everybody was too sick to go home.</span> <span id="s75">So we just stayed in the hotels down there, where they billeted us until we were si -- reassigned.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: That was what, six weeks or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Six weeks we had there and then we were reassigned to different hospitals.</span> <span id="s78">And I was reassigned to Tilton, which is in Fort -- Fort Dix, New Jersey, near Trenton.</span> <span id="s79">And then when they got the 131st unit together, we were picked out to go down to South Carolina, to train again.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And what kind of training was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: And down there it was learning how to dig a foxhole and how to set up a tent.</span> <span id="s82">More walking, more training.</span> <span id="s83">That’s about all I remember of that down there.</span> <span id="s84">Hot.</span> <span id="s85">Yeah, barracks living and -- when you’re young it doesn’t, you know, you take it as it comes.</span> <span id="s86">I came off the farm with no -- we had no facilities at the farm, so you know, camping was second nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Didn’t bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s90">Yeah, I enjoyed the girls, you know, we all had a good time, yeah.</span> <span id="s91">We’d go into town, you know, after we were all finished and then we were -- had blisters on our feet and whatnot and we were tired, but we’d still go in and have a good time and those that drank, course, had a better time, I guess.</span> <span id="s92">I just went arane -- along for the ride because I never drank and -- and had to -- I had the -- what do you say, moniker of being the orange juice girl all the way through.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Because you just drank orange juice when you went [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Then when did you go over?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Then we -- let’s see, was December, before Christmas.</span> <span id="s96">We boarded the boat.</span> <span id="s97">We came up by train of course to Camp Kilmer and then onto New York, where we boarded the Queen Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s98">That plancake -- that gangplank looked pretty bad.</span> <span id="s99">We didn’t want to go, when we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: How did it loo -- how did it look?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Was a long way up and we knew we were leaving, you know and --</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Feeling sad?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: The -- th-the final, the -- yeah, the final thing you know.</span> <span id="s104">Before that it was adventure, but at this point we were leaving the USA you know, and family.</span> <span id="s105">That made a difference, especially at Christmastime.</span> <span id="s106">Course we landed over there before Christmas, but -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: What was the crossing like?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Crossing wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s109">We were only three or four days going over, you know, three -- nights.</span> <span id="s110">I had a harmonica that one of my neighbors had given me, so I entertained myself with that.</span> <span id="s111">Sat in the porthole, we had 17 in the stateroom.</span> <span id="s112">I took the top bunk and I was up under a ventilator pipe of some sort, you know, of the ship, but at least I was on top.</span> <span id="s113">The rest of them that were sick were on the bottom.</span> <span id="s114">And we went over fully clothed.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Sleeping, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: In case there was an evacuation?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: And a -- yeah, with your life jacket on, yeah, because the submarines were chasing the -- there was always a sub pack chasing the Queen Elizabeth and she was a zigzagger and she went about 30 what do they call it?</span> <span id="s118">Hm.</span> <span id="s119">Not miles, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Kilometers?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Or knot -- 30 knot [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Knots.</span> <span id="s124">30 knots, they call it.</span> <span id="s125">And she zigzagged all the time, so of course you’re -- you’re all like this all the time, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yeah, we didn’t have any -- other than the zigzagging, we didn’t have any problems, that I know of, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: The ship was crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: 15,000 troops.</span> <span id="s129">Now they put 1500 on, you know, one of those ships, for entertainment, whatnot.</span> <span id="s130">So we were crowded.</span> <span id="s131">The boys slept on the deck, they swung from hammocks and slept along the railings and whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s132">We --we girls had the bunks, of course, but we were stacked -- I think it was four high and two sets going that way and two sets coming across this way, so you just had an aisle down the middle to the john over here and we all shared one little stateroom john.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: 17 of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: The salt water in one -- yeah.</span> <span id="s135">And then we had to spend twice a day going up three or four decks to a meal.</span> <span id="s136">And by the time they got back down, was time to turn around and go back up for the other meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Hurry up and wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: To keep the dishes from falling off the table?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Yeah, off on your lap, sure, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s140">And it was -- it was good food, it just was different, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: And do you remember landing, when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yeah, we landed in Scotland.</span> <span id="s145">Greenock, Scotland.</span> <span id="s146">And took a train down to England and they -- was beautiful country, but it was awful cold.</span> <span id="s147">And they landed us down in a -- below Manchester in a place called Alteringham, where we were assigned a -- a big house.</span> <span id="s148">All they had was little fireplaces in each room, very cold and the fire didn’t keep the room warm.</span> <span id="s149">And in order to keep the fires going, we had to throw straw out of our mattresses that they had given us, to keep it going.</span> <span id="s150">And then eventually the house we were in got burned down and we had to move to another house.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Fireplace burned through.</span> <span id="s152">Got too big a fire in the fireplaces.</span> <span id="s153">And we had to move to another house.</span> <span id="s154">And then we were on quarantine all that time.</span> <span id="s155">I’ve forgotten just how many hours, but anyway it was over Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: What does that mean, on quarantine?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: We couldn’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s158">We had to stay either -- in the perimeter of the house, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Or -- well, we weren’t allowed out around anybody.</span> <span id="s161">That’s -- quarantine is one of the things they do when you land in an area from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Why -- why?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: I suppose so we don’t give diseases to anybody or pass anything along or -- to the enemy or whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s164">And -- so as -- we were billeted and had to stay there, except to go to our meals, which we -- we would walk to a certain place to get our meals, then walk back.</span> <span id="s165">I don’t know -- was part of a mile.</span> <span id="s166">And so it came Christmas eve and we were still quarantined and the captain said, anybody that’s Catholic can go to midnight mass, they allowed that.</span> <span id="s167">So everybody was Catholic, we all went to midnight mass.</span> <span id="s168">Snow all around, you know, up like this, and a beautiful, beautiful church.</span> <span id="s169">We couldn’t all get in the church, so we were outside, but we went to midnight mass and we got away from the house.</span> <span id="s170">Protestants, Jewish, Catholic, whatever you were, you know.</span> <span id="s171">We were all the same the night.</span> <span id="s172">It didn’t matter, it was Christmas eve, you know.</span> <span id="s173">And that’s all I remember of there.</span> <span id="s174">All I can remember is the girls do with their helmets, they put their helmets on the bunks and filled them full of lipstick and incidentals and then when the sirens went off, they had to have their helmet on their head, everything got dumped on their heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: They have drills fo -- is that what the sirens were?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: No, just the sirens in the -- in the English area at the time, because there were -- be bombs and planes and so forth going over, so when the warning came, the sirens went off and you were supposed to protect yourself.</span> <span id="s177">That was the way we did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Not that I know of, no, no.</span> <span id="s179">The only place I ever saw any bombs was in London.</span> <span id="s180">And -- while we were on leave once, that’s all.</span> <span id="s181">But no, we were never bombed there.</span> <span id="s182">And eventually, the people in the town, around Christmastime, there, took us in for dinner.</span> <span id="s183">And we had -- I had a real good experience on one of those, because they invited three of us to dinner that didn’t drink.</span> <span id="s184">And so we went to tea.</span> <span id="s185">And they didn’t have much to eat, but before they did, they had what they call gin and tonics.</span> <span id="s186">We had no idea what they were, but we didn’t dare refuse.</span> <span id="s187">So three of us ate gin and -- drank gin and tonics, promptly fell asleep.</span> <span id="s188">I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s189">And boy were they mortified to find out we didn’t drink, but they’d given us drinks, you know.</span> <span id="s190">But they thought all Americans drank, so.</span> <span id="s191">But anyway, we had a nice dinner and they were very good to us, you know.</span> <span id="s192">And we went to an English dance while we were there -- doing the hokey-pokey.</span> <span id="s193">I suppose you’ve heard of that?</span> <span id="s194">That’s all you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Were you nursing -- doing any nursing</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Let’s see -- yes, well after -- see, af-after that, when they took us out of the quarantine time, we were all sent to detached service, different hospitals.</span> <span id="s197">And I was sent to one near Chester.</span> <span id="s198">And was assigned to a hospital, established hospital there and all of their wards went around a circle where the nurses were.</span> <span id="s199">There was ward -- like a spider, all the way around.</span> <span id="s200">And my job at the time, was this ward full of -- all these wards were filled with venereal diseases.</span> <span id="s201">All the boys that were, you know, [indecipherable] had parties.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: GIs?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s204">And so, I was assigned to give them penicillin.</span> <span id="s205">At the time, penicillin was just coming out.</span> <span id="s206">So I would take my little tray, about so big and a great big syringe, I’ll never forget it, about that long and a -- a bunch of needles and that was full of penicillin, you go along and you’d just -- as you -- as you came out, the boys would just roll over.</span> <span id="s207">They knew they were getting it, so just roll over and be ready for you, you know?</span> <span id="s208">And that was my job, all the way around the spider, just to pass out penicillin.</span> <span id="s209">Supposed to be a cure, you know, until next time.</span> <span id="s210">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Did it work?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Across the channel?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Across the channel on the Sobiesky.</span> <span id="s214">Yeah, we were overnight on the ship, which I heard later was bombed, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: With troops that were going over also?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Well, I don’t remember any troops going, it might have been -- our hospital unit might have [indecipherable] I don’t know, but we were all sent over the channel and we were on it overnight, cause we slept on the ship and landed in France.</span> <span id="s217">And from then on we just kept traveling, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: You were the -- you went east and you went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: We went to Paris and we stopped in Paris and got something to eat at lunchtime and all our gear.</span> <span id="s220">We went into a nice, beautiful restaurant, with waitresses with little -- little frilly aprons on and caps on, you know, and here we are with mud caked and -- and all of our outfit on, you know, as we were traveling.</span> <span id="s221">[indecipherable] bag on your back and all these heavy clothes.</span> <span id="s222">And we had dinner there and then they put us on trucks to go on to a -- well, we went to Sedan and Sedan is where we -- we did some drilling as far as our hospital unit goes and made -- made gauze packages and things for a hospital unit and got ready to have a set up.</span> <span id="s223">And trained from there on.</span> <span id="s224">And we -- then we -- let’s see, where did we go from the Sedan?</span> <span id="s225">We stopped at a boy’s school overnight somewhere.</span> <span id="s226">That was a big French school.</span> <span id="s227">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Sedan, uh-huh</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Do you know where that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: It’s around Reims, Versailles, it’s -- it’s -- it was near your well known during the World War One.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Not too far from Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: So when you got to Germany, then [indecipherable] the first place they set up [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: In Germany is where we first set up the hospital to use, yeah.</span> <span id="s236">And took care of our wounded GIs.</span> <span id="s237">And I had a post-op ward, so as they came out of surgery, they came into my tent.</span> <span id="s238">They were given all medications that they needed and bandage care and we did their -- we did their baths as we could, out of their helmets.</span> <span id="s239">They had to bring their own helmets and we did baths out of the helmets and I had one little German boy that had been throwing grenades and he had an arm taken off and course all these GIs didn’t like him because he was a enemy.</span> <span id="s240">So I had to watch him carefully.</span> <span id="s241">And -- but I had a nice ward boy and he [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Because you were afraid that they’d --</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: -- do something?</span> <span id="s245">But did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: They never did, no, no, they were -- they were kind enough.</span> <span id="s247">But that was what we were always scared of, because you know, all of us hated them, really, you know, from seeing what they did to the boys.</span> <span id="s248">And whatever happened to him, I don’t know, but they shipped him out from my ward.</span> <span id="s249">And our boys were shipped out as they -- as soon as we got them taken care of and they were ready to travel, why they went on out too, by plane, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Well, it depended on how bad they were.</span> <span id="s251">You know, some of them could go within a week and some could -- had to stay.</span> <span id="s252">But we were only set up for a short time anyway, you know, so I only saw a turnover a couple of times, really.</span> <span id="s253">And then they were transferred on to some other hospital, if they couldn’t make the trip all the way across, you know.</span> <span id="s254">And th -- we picked up behind General Patton, and so, like we always said, we were the fastest moving hospital --</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Moving fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: -- in the CTO, you know?</span> <span id="s257">Because we just kept on going until we hit the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s259">When you were caring for those men in that post-operative ward, y-y-you must have had a chance to talk with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Some, yeah, some.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: What did they want to talk about or --Q: Would it be just one person on duty there in that ward at a time?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, well, it’d be one nurse.</span> <span id="s263">They’d have a night nurse and a day nurse, I was a day nurse and I had a -- a corpsman that was very apt.</span> <span id="s264">He was a pre-med student.</span> <span id="s265">So he could give plasma or transfusions, so forth.</span> <span id="s266">So all I had to do was give medications and whatever care -- the bandages and so forth, that they needed.</span> <span id="s267">He went around and gave all the -- all the IVs and the plasma stuff, yeah.</span> <span id="s268">And -- but I did have control of the medicines, he would -- he couldn’t give those.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Did you like that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s271">That’s hospital work, that’s nurses work, you know, yeah.</span> <span id="s272">If you can ease their pain, you know, and make them feel -- but you know, when you’re young, you can’t be their mother, even though you’re a nurse, you know, but you have to take their place, you know, and do the best you can.</span> <span id="s273">Big sister, whatever, you know and since I’d had a lot of it at home, why, you know, just comes second nature, yeah.</span> <span id="s274">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: And then you packed up and --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: They packed us up in the middle of the night and shipped us off to a place near the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s277">I think it was Bamburg, I’m not sure, but I think it was there, where we were assigned to a -- a hospital that was already there, in the field and the colonel wouldn’t let us go on with the boys.</span> <span id="s278">The boys all went ahead of us to take care of the camp before the nurses were taken in.</span> <span id="s279">And probably was at least a week before we were allowed in to the camp.</span> <span id="s280">And it was quite a shock, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Did they prepare you for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: The colonel just told us we’re -- that we’re going and that we didn’t have to go if we didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s283">And that it was pretty bad.</span> <span id="s284">But we all -- we were there for a purpose, so we -- we went, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Did you discuss it among yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No.</span> <span id="s287">Was no problem, no problem.</span> <span id="s288">We were all waiting to go, you know?</span> <span id="s289">Sitting around there in the sun in Germany, we were just waiting to go.</span> <span id="s290">And we hadn’t had that much activity, that one -- one set up, you know, was all we really had had of activity.</span> <span id="s291">It was a busy one at the time, but so short -- so short a time.</span> <span id="s292">But that’s what an evacuation hospital is, you just keep on going.</span> <span id="s293">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: You can put that however you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Well, it just fell off there, I didn’t want to pull anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: But -- so like I say, we moved and when they climbed out of the back of the truck, why it was -- was too much of a jump for me, I guess and too much weight on my foot, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: You broke your foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: So I had what they call a march fracture.</span> <span id="s300">And since I’d never heard of a march fracture, none of the girls had, why he presented me to the medical staff.</span> <span id="s301">So I was the first guinea pig over there for that.</span> <span id="s302">And then I ran around -- as I say, I ran around with a ga -- pair of galoshes on and of course it was muddy and that rubber just pulled, you know, on that foot.</span> <span id="s303">It was no fun.</span> <span id="s304">But I -- I worked for about three days and --</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: So, first three days of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: So the first three days of -- that we were there --</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: You were --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: I was assigned to this ward C and we were all corralled in -- in a office and pumped full of DDT and --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: They would spray it in your clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Oh, in your hair -- we had turbans -- in your hair and down your clothes and down the waistband and into your legs and so forth, so you were covered, because these patients had typhus and all sorts of diseases.</span> <span id="s311">And then you were assigned a stack of medicine, which was sulfa at the time, the only thing they had was sulfadiazene.</span> <span id="s312">And a great big pitcher of water, there’d be two of you.</span> <span id="s313">One take a bigger -- big pitcher of water and the other all these pills and the guard, because a guard always had to be with us, we weren’t to touch anybody.</span> <span id="s314">And the first -- my first [indecipherable] recollection of seeing them, was a great rack of three or four tier wooden bunks and as far back as that -- toward the wall, you could see was probably five or six patients at least, some on top of the other, all skin and bones and the fellas had given some of them IV’s and transfusions and -- and plasma.</span> <span id="s315">And some of them were dead, with these things still running, you know and so anybody that looked like they were half alive, you’d ask them if they had diarrhea.</span> <span id="s316">If they did, you gave them a handful of pills to swallow with a glass of water, if they could get it down and how many others in that same tier and then you go on to the next one, you know.</span> <span id="s317">And they were just naked on -- on these things and of course naive little nurses, you know, I -- we’d had hospital nursing, but to see all these naked men and you know and all bones, couldn’t speak, some of them.</span> <span id="s318">Of course, none of them could speak English.</span> <span id="s319">And -- real sad, real sad.</span> <span id="s320">Cause you knew you wouldn’t see them -- next time, next round around, you wouldn’t see those same people, they’d be dead, you know.</span> <span id="s321">Very few of them that came out.</span> <span id="s322">And -- was real rough.</span> <span id="s323">But like I say, I spent about three days in and then we had this accident so, I didn’t get back down to the camp, except to eat, you know.</span> <span id="s324">Three of us were laid up in the same room.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Tell me about the accident.</span> <span id="s326">Well, General Gavin, 15th army had a -- was having a big party over in Linz, which was about 10 miles away and ever -- al-all the party girls of course wanted to go and they went and a lot of them had dates and whatnot.</span> <span id="s327">And the general sent -- was going to send transportation for us.</span> <span id="s328">And our group didn’t want to go, we were going to stay --</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: You weren’t party girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: We weren’t party girls, we didn’t drink, we didn’t party.</span> <span id="s331">One of them was married -- two of them were married.</span> <span id="s332">And, you know, we just didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s333">And the captain, our chief -- our chief nurse, ordered us to go.</span> <span id="s334">So we had to get dressed -- all dressed up in our finery and our class A uniform and wait for the transportation and when it came, course we had to get in the Jeep we were assigned and the one that we got into, the fellow was drunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Did you know that right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: We didn’t know it right away, til we got started.</span> <span id="s337">He had -- we found out that he had put water in the gas tank.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: To -- well, I don’t know the reason.</span> <span id="s340">I don’t really know the reason, but anyway, since he put this water -- probably -- maybe cause he was drunk, he had put this in and he knew he had to keep up with the others, because he didn’t know for sure whether he was going to make it or not.</span> <span id="s341">So he was driving a very fast pace.</span> <span id="s342">I wouldn’t know how fast, I would say 80 miles an hour, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s343">But in this mud and slick stuff.</span> <span id="s344">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: It was raining and it was dark?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Raining and was black as ace of spades and we didn’t even know where we were.</span> <span id="s347">And we were -- I don’t -- I think maybe we were last -- last bunch out and as we went down the road, the one girl was Catholic, she was saying her rosary.</span> <span id="s348">The other two were ser -- praying in the back seat and the girl in the front seat was hanging on and all of a sudden we went right off -- it was an -- a big apple tree in this curve and we went right over -- sailed right over that apple tree and landed right down in -- a -- over a bank, I don’t remember how deep it was.</span> <span id="s349">The girl in the front seat -- well, the driver was flopped out and he was all right, he was drunk.</span> <span id="s350">The girl in the front seat hit the windshield, she had a concussion.</span> <span id="s351">One of the girls in the back seat had a long gash in her leg and she was tied up under the Jeep.</span> <span id="s352">The other girl -- I don’t know -- I don’t remember what damage she had, but she and the other were under the back seats.</span> <span id="s353">I was thrown out, half my clothes off and I was the only one able to get up the bank and wait for somebody to come back and find us, when we didn’t show up.</span> <span id="s354">Lady Feldhusen was one of the group that came back and found us.</span> <span id="s355">And to this day, they never put anything in the records.</span> <span id="s356">This makes us very unhappy.</span> <span id="s357">But, like I say, we were laid up then, taken back to the clinic and fixed up and taken up to our quarters, where we laid, side by side on cots in one room.</span> <span id="s358">Were taken down to meals, they came and sent a truck up and we were taken down to meals at the camp and then brought back home again and that’s where we were until we came home.</span> <span id="s359">And then they told me -- I was on crutches and they told me that if I didn’t throw the crutches away, I had to stay over there.</span> <span id="s360">Well, the rest of the group were coming home and one of the girls husband was over there, so she was going to stay.</span> <span id="s361">That was all right with her, but I wanted to come home.</span> <span id="s362">So I threw the crutches away and hobbled onto the ship when they finally got there.</span> <span id="s363">They were assigned to come home.</span> <span id="s364">They thought they were going to fly us home, but then something happened to the plane, so they brought us home by train, across the continent, in wooden -- wooden bench trains with no windows.</span> <span id="s365">And we slept on th-those overnight, you know, on the trips.</span> <span id="s366">And we stopped along the way and got our meals at a -- a tent camp, where they had food set up.</span> <span id="s367">Raining, pitchforks and hammer handles and your tray was full of peaches and mashed potatoes and whatever, all mixed up together and hailstorms and the tents were full of holes.</span> <span id="s368">I’ll never forget it.</span> <span id="s369">And I’ve forgotten how many days we were coming across.</span> <span id="s370">Then they camped us on the banks of the Seine and that wasn’t very -- very nice camp, but it was just a holding camp.</span> <span id="s371">And some of the boys from another outfit felt sorry for the nurses, so they invited us that -- to come over to Deauville, which was a resort, you know, originally and probably still is -- and spend some time over there in a hotel, so we had -- we spent some time in the hotel in the swimming areas and so forth, so we had a good time there -- until we were -- actually til we were aboard ships -- and aboard ship and we were sent a Navy ship, US Navy, Bliss and we had ice cream and everything we wanted coming home, nice clean sheets and everything, til we landed in Boston.</span> <span id="s372">And that was a good -- we had a good crossing, we had no problems with that either, you know.</span> <span id="s373">Til we landed in Boston and all the fire whistles and whatnot.</span> <span id="s374">Put us on a train and headed us for Trenton again.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: At Gusen, did you have -- did you have any impression at the time about who those people were in the camp?</span> <span id="s376">Did you know, or did any --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Oh, they were all foreign -- there weren’t any -- if there were any that spoke English, it was probably broken English, so I had never heard any speak English.</span> <span id="s378">I know there were some there, because there were a lot of professionals there.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: But I never spoke to them, so I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: But at the time, did you have -- did you know who they were and why they were there?</span> <span id="s382">Did anybody tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Mm, not at the time we went in.</span> <span id="s384">Well, we learned this while we were there, you know.</span> <span id="s385">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: You knew that it was a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s388">We were told that before we went there.</span> <span id="s389">And that it was so gruesome that we shouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s390">And we knew this, because they’d sent the boys on ahead, you know.</span> <span id="s391">And it must have been bad.</span> <span id="s392">But you don’t really comprehend until you actually are in it, you know?</span> <span id="s393">You see all these walking skeletons, no clothes and then, you know, they had some women there.</span> <span id="s394">Not too many around where we were.</span> <span id="s395">And then, of course we were taken on a brief tour of the crematorium and the -- and the gas chambers and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s396">And you gradually understood what was going on, you know.</span> <span id="s397">But I’ve learned a lot more since, you know, since leaving there -- since the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Did you know at the time, that this was going on in other places as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: No.</span> <span id="s400">No, I don’t believe I did.</span> <span id="s401">In fact I don’t believe I’d knew about this until we actually got down there in Germany.</span> <span id="s402">Because we were following Patton and we were trying to take your own boys, you know, so you really didn’t understand that these other things were going on until you actually got in there.</span> <span id="s403">I don’t believe I ever did, no.</span> <span id="s404">And y-you just can’t believe such things can happen, you know.</span> <span id="s405">Just can’t.</span> <span id="s406">And that people on the outside never knew about it.</span> <span id="s407">Just -- it -- just impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Mean -- what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: People -- farmers that lived, you know, right outside the wall.</span> <span id="s410">They were farming fields and everything right where we lived and everything and they didn’t even know anything about it.</span> <span id="s411">You know, denial.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: They said that?</span> <span id="s413">Did you talk to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: No, no, I didn’t, no.</span> <span id="s415">But this was what was going on, you know.</span> <span id="s416">Some of the -- the fellas with the, you know, the armor division and stuff like that, they had linguists and stuff with them that could understand.</span> <span id="s417">But the farming went on just as normal as could be, around them and -- til the boys went out and rounded everybody up to come in and help at the camp and then I’m sure they knew, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: They brought in people from Linz to work --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s420">All around the area, they we -- just went out and whoever was loose, they brought them in and put them to work.</span> <span id="s421">This is before us girls came, help get the bodies in the graves and whatnot, and the -- so the chaplain could have his services and you saw the pictures of the big cemeteries of course, that we had, you know -- but he did a great job, but -- just weren’t enough of our boys to do it all, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s423">I want to ask you one more question.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s425">What is -- having witnessed people who were victims of the Holocaust, what a -- what do you think about that now, 50 years later?</span> <span id="s426">What -- how did it -- how did it change you?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: How did it change me?</span> <span id="s428">Well, just going over there, I -- just a little bit more about Europe and seeing the pay -- the people with all their, you know, languages that I didn’t understand, it was overwhelming, because you couldn’t communicate.</span> <span id="s429">I don’t know, I was just happy to see those that could leave and very sad about those that couldn’t, you know?</span> <span id="s430">And I just hoped it never happened again and now it’s happening again, you know, I just -- I couldn’t even watch Schindler’s List or any of those.</span> <span id="s431">I -- I watched this one they showed downstairs through once, I couldn’t do it again.</span> <span id="s432">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: I’m an old sentimentalist, I guess, you know.</span> <span id="s435">Very sad, very sad thing.</span> <span id="s436">I can’t even watch a funeral.</span> <span id="s437">I went to my aunt’s funeral, but I had to get out fast, you know, I just can’t -- I don’t know what there -- what there is --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: You get too -- you get emotional?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s440">Can’t do it.</span> <span id="s441">Didn’t even go to my own father’s funeral.</span> <span id="s442">But -- I got criticized for it, but I just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s443">Yes, it’s -- it -- like I say, when you’re young at that time, it makes an awful impression and it stays with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: It stays with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Oh yeah, it will stay with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: You don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Forget about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No way.</span> <span id="s450">No way.</span> <span id="s451">My grandmother denied it ever happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yeah, til the day she went to her grave, yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Did you try and discuss it?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: I showed her pictures, I talked to her and she was old, firm Baptist and nothing like that could happen because she just knew it couldn’t happen, you know?</span> <span id="s456">There weren’t people like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: There weren’t -- people weren’t that bad, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: There weren’t people like that wouldn’t do anything to another human being.</span> <span id="s459">My mother never had an opinion and she hasn’t to this day.</span> <span id="s460">She’s 94 now.</span> <span id="s461">But my brother went over and he saw.</span> <span id="s462">He went over when I came home and transported a lot of them back home, transported the POWs, the Germans, different places and put them to work and he couldn’t believe it either til he saw all these people walking around like skeletons, still you know, when he went over.</span> <span id="s463">All of them going back to their own homes.</span> <span id="s464">And so there are some, you know, that’ll deny if forever, probably.</span> <span id="s465">Yeah.</span> <span id="s466">But I’ll never forget it and I know the girls won’t forget it either.</span> <span id="s467">You can’t, anyway.</span> <span id="s468">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Yeah, the other nurses and you --</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Who were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I’m sure they won’t any of them forget it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s474">Good.</span> <span id="s475">Is there anything else you’d like to say or --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: That I -- perhaps something important that happened to you that I should ask you [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: You mean in that area, or everywhere?</span> <span id="s479">No, I didn’t have anything else.</span> <span id="s480">There were nice things happened and there were bad things happened in all.</span> <span id="s481">And you just take it in your stride.</span> <span id="s482">And like I say, the only thing that upset me was when it wa -- nothing was put into my record about the accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: How was that upsetting, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Because if you need this in the future, if you’re disabled and you need this help in the future, you can’t get it if you don’t have some documentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: And you think they were covering up for that GI because he was drunk, or because they made you go to the party?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: I don’t -- well, why would -- I don’t -- I don’t think they’d cover up for him because he was drunk, because he was from another outfit.</span> <span id="s487">Why didn’t our chief nurse put it in, or our -- our colonel?</span> <span id="s488">And that was one thing that hurt.</span> <span id="s489">They never even came to see you, you know.</span> <span id="s490">The three of us were up there.</span> <span id="s491">Course, we were able to talk and take care of each other, you know, up there.</span> <span id="s492">But at the same time, somebody should have visited us, you know, other than just sending a truck up and back.</span> <span id="s493">But that’s life.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s497">This is the end of the interview with Phyllis Law.</span> <span id="s498">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span
