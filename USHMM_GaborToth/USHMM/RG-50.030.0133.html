you tell me your full name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s18">My full name is Johanne Eva Liebmann.</span> <span id="s19">My maiden name was Hirsch.</span> <span id="s20">Q: How were you called?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Hanne.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I was born on November 28, 1924, in Karlsruhe, West Germany.</span> <span id="s24">Q: What did your parents do?</span> <span id="s25">What was your father's occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: My father was a photographer.</span> <span id="s27">He had his own studio.</span> <span id="s28">My father died in February of 1925; I was obviously just a few months old.</span> <span id="s29">And my mother continued the business until 1938, December of 1938, when all Jewish businesses had to be closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s31">What was it like for you, until 1938, growing up in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Well, I would say that we had a very nice family life, in spite of not having a father.</span> <span id="s33">My mother had three sisters.</span> <span id="s34">They were in business.</span> <span id="s35">They were in haute couture.</span> <span id="s36">And, it was really a very loving family.</span> <span id="s37">I had also my father's mother, my grandmother, who was a very elderly lady and our family life really was a very nice one.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What kind of school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Well, I entered public school like all children at age six, and I think I hated school from the first day I went there.</span> <span id="s40">It was made ever more difficult, because the teacher we had was even then a Nazi.</span> <span id="s41">And I was a child that couldn't sit still, and had my mouth open probably all the time.</span> <span id="s42">And was punished for it a great deal.</span> <span id="s43">Okay.</span> <span id="s44">It did not improve my love for school.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Did you have friends in school?</span> <span id="s46">Were they Jewish friends?</span> <span id="s47">Christian friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: I had a lot of friends in school.</span> <span id="s49">I think we were the only class, first grade class, at the time we were 24 children.</span> <span id="s50">Out of the 24, 12 were Jewish.</span> <span id="s51">Fifty percent!</span> <span id="s52">It was an extremely high percentage.</span> <span id="s53">I think that was the only class ever that had such a high percentage of Jewish students.</span> <span id="s54">I went to public school until 1936 when Jewish children were no longer allowed to go to public school unless their parent or their fathers were in the First World War and were in the front lines.</span> <span id="s55">These were the exceptions.</span> <span id="s56">So I had to go to Jewish school in 1936, and I went to this school until Easter of 1940.</span> <span id="s57">So I really didn't have a hell of a lot of school.</span> <span id="s58">And after, I would say 1938, after Kristallnachtdue to the fact that we had so many Jewish -- old Jewish teachers that were taken to the concentration camp for many weeks and months, school was every other day two hours for many months until everybody had come back and there was a semblance of a normal school day.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">01:03:30</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Would you tell me a little bit about after 1933, ‘34.</span> <span id="s61">How, besides school, how did life change for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Well, I would first like to go back before 1933.</span> <span id="s63">We lived and had our business next to a newspaper.</span> <span id="s64">This newspaper was a left-wing newspaper.</span> <span id="s65">And we had daily street fights, mob scenes, shooting, flag burning.</span> <span id="s66">These are the first of my memories as a child outside the home.</span> <span id="s67">It was a very violent street we lived on.</span> <span id="s68">These are really my first memories and my mother or someone from the household pulling me back from the balcony and as soon as they turned their backs, my brother and I were back out on the balcony watching what was going on.</span> <span id="s69">These are really my first memories.</span> <span id="s70">One of my other memories is the boycott of April 1933 where our show windows were plastered with "Jew!"</span> <span id="s71">"Don’t go to the Jew!"</span> <span id="s72">And so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s73">These are really some of my childhood memories.</span> <span id="s74">Family life was great.</span> <span id="s75">Outside the family, it was not so good.</span> <span id="s76">You were insulted in the street many times.</span> <span id="s77">You were called “dirty Jew,” things like that.</span> <span id="s78">For several years, I did have Gentile girlfriends and, of course, under the pressure of the Nazi time they could no longer associate with me, and I would not dare associate with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Were you taunted by your school mates?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: By some of them.</span> <span id="s81">And like my husband, I beat up one.</span> <span id="s82">And not only did I beat her, I actually tore her sweater to pieces.</span> <span id="s83">I was not standing, you know, not letting it happen to me all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: As the Nazi regime went on, what else happened to you and your family?</span> <span id="s85">A: Well, as time when on, of course, there was Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">[01:06:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">1 The interviewee later corrected this date to 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">2 Crystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Kristallnacht, I went to school in the morning, Jewish school obviously, and something seemed wrong, yet I didn't know what.</span> <span id="s91">And when I came to school and I mentioned that I saw the fire engines standing in front of a building and in the back of this building was the Orthodox synagogue, I was told, "Don't you know what's going on?"</span> <span id="s92">And I said, "No, I don't."</span> <span id="s93">She said -- this one told me, "My father was arrested.</span> <span id="s94">His father was arrested, and it was just a terrible situation."</span> <span id="s95">The teachers, other than the female teachers, did not come in.</span> <span id="s96">They were arrested.</span> <span id="s97">And they sent us home, I think, after about two hours.</span> <span id="s98">And when I came home all our show windows had been smashed.</span> <span id="s99">My mother was sweeping up the street.</span> <span id="s100">Okay.</span> <span id="s101">To the taunts and harassment of the population or the people who were made to look like the population.</span> <span id="s102">Next to us was a store that dealt in oriental carpets.</span> <span id="s103">The show window is gone.</span> <span id="s104">Ink thrown over the carpets.</span> <span id="s105">It was, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s106">The only reason our apartment and business was not touched at the time was that they simply knew there was not a man to be arrested, so our apartment and our business upstairs remained in tact.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: What did your family do after Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s108">How did you mother manage?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, we managed first of all to take care of a lot of customers at the time because every Jew needed an identification paper.</span> <span id="s110">To these purpose, you had to have a picture.</span> <span id="s111">The picture had to show your left ear.</span> <span id="s112">Okay.</span> <span id="s113">So that every person had to be taken -- the picture had to be taken from this side.</span> <span id="s114">Your ear was supposedly an additional identification mark.</span> <span id="s115">Another harassment.</span> <span id="s116">And so we were really very busy in the business until the very end, until we absolutely closed on the 31st of December.</span> <span id="s117">And, since I did not go to school because there was no school, I helped in the business as people drifted back or came back from concentration camps, many times their first stop was really with us because they were so afraid they had to get the identification paper, the photos and everything else.</span> <span id="s118">I saw many men with their ears frozen, their hands frozen.</span> <span id="s119">My mother would run pots of soup to feed these people first before they would go wherever they needed, you know, went.</span> <span id="s120">It was a very hard, very busy time.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">01:08:09</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: What happened after that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Nineteen thirty-nine, the three sisters of my mother who also had to close their business moved in with us because we had a very large apartment.</span> <span id="s124">Obviously, we shared the apartment.</span> <span id="s125">Half was an apartment, half was business.</span> <span id="s126">So there were all these empty rooms, so my aunts moved in with us because there was no more income so you had to reduce your living expenses.</span> <span id="s127">My grandmother had moved in with us after my brother left in 1937 because she was very old.</span> <span id="s128">She could no longer keep a household of her own.</span> <span id="s129">And so here were six women in one household.</span> <span id="s130">Not necessarily an ideal situation, but it functioned somehow.</span> <span id="s131">When the war broke out Karlsruhe was on the list of evacuation.</span> <span id="s132">In other words, most of the population, meaning people with small children and very old people, were evacuated.</span> <span id="s133">And so we evacuated my grandmother, of all places, to Mannheim.</span> <span id="s134">And many people went to Stuttgart, other places where they could go; my mother decided she was not going to leave.</span> <span id="s135">And my mother's three sisters decided they were not going to go anywhere.</span> <span id="s136">We were going - - just going to stay where we were.</span> <span id="s137">My grandmother we sent to Mannheim because it was very hard to move her in any emergency.</span> <span id="s138">She was 90 years old, and so she was away from us for maybe four or five months, and then we took her back because there was actually no war.</span> <span id="s139">There was war, but there was no shooting.</span> <span id="s140">There was nothing going on.</span> <span id="s141">So what then was called "Drôle de Guerre,"and, and so we took her back home.</span> <span id="s142">This went, of course, until the day we were deported on the 22nd of October 1940.</span> <span id="s143">I would like to interject that in the spring of 1940 I was for four months in the area of Hannover, where my mother had sent me, there was a school -- boarding school if you wish.</span> <span id="s144">It taught agriculture and horticulture and all sorts of things and my mother sent me up there because she didn't know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s145">I was hanging around the house.</span> <span id="s146">There was nothing to do.</span> <span id="s147">I could not do any apprenticeship of any kind and so I was up there for four months and, I think it was four months, maybe five, and then I came back, I think, in August of 1940 because she was not feeling well.</span> <span id="s148">And so I came back.</span> <span id="s149">And then we, of course, were deported in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Would you describe the process of that deportation?</span> <span id="s151">How were you notified and what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">01:12:00</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: My mother went out shopping early in the morning, as a matter of fact, and she came home in a hurry and said, "I met someone in the street who told me that we would be deported.</span> <span id="s154">Said everybody would be arrested and deported."</span> <span id="s155">She did not believe it and she went to the Jewish community, which was only two blocks away from us.</span> <span id="s156">And sure enough the offices were closed, and then it dawned on her that there was something to this story.</span> <span id="s157">And she came home and she told me, "Well, I guess we better start packing."</span> <span id="s158">And before she had finished the sentence, the police was there and told us that we are arrested.</span> <span id="s159">No, the first thing she did was, "If we really have to go I have very good friends and I promised them certain items from our household.</span> <span id="s160">Take them over there.</span> <span id="s161">Go over there.</span> <span id="s162">Take it, take it over there.</span> <span id="s163">Give it to them."</span> <span id="s164">And I went and it turned out that this lady's husband was really German underground.</span> <span id="s165">He was a lawyer, but he must have been busy in the German underground because he knew exactly where we were going to be taken.</span> <span id="s166">Okay.</span> <span id="s167">The man was later on the mayor of Karlsruhe right after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: What's his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: So he was, he was very clean.</span> <span id="s170">Was Mr. Veit.</span> <span id="s171">His name was Veit.</span> <span id="s172">They were very good friends of my mother.</span> <span id="s173">And so I took the items, and by the time I came back the police was in the apartment telling us to pack and, and so my mother started.</span> <span id="s174">And the policeman knew my mother very well.</span> <span id="s175">He was from the precinct.</span> <span id="s176">And he said to my mother, "I will see if I can get your mother-in-law to stay in a hospital and you cannot be moved out of your apartment 3 Funny war (French); The Phony War.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">until I come back."</span> <span id="s178">Now he knew very well that no Jewish people were accepted at this particular day in the hospital.</span> <span id="s179">So he gave us two hours to pack.</span> <span id="s180">So I packed everything for my grandmother.</span> <span id="s181">My mother packed for me and for herself and my aunts, of course, packed for themselves.</span> <span id="s182">And so six women were eventually guarded by 12 Gestapo and policemen.</span> <span id="s183">Six helpless women.</span> <span id="s184">Right!</span> <span id="s185">I was 16 and my grandmother was 91 and a half.</span> <span id="s186">Totally not comprehending what was happening.</span> <span id="s187">Not that she was senile.</span> <span id="s188">It was simply, it was something that was incomprehensible.</span> <span id="s189">And so we had to sign papers stating how much the apartment was worth.</span> <span id="s190">My aunt first refused and she was threatened that she would be sent to Dachau, and so she signed.</span> <span id="s191">And we had to leave and we were loaded on a truck and taken to the railroad station where everybody slowly was assembled.</span> <span id="s192">And I believe Karlsruhe had some 930 or 950 Jews that were deported together.</span> <span id="s193">All together from Baden and the Palatinate and the Saar.</span> <span id="s194">There were some Jews from the Saar that were also deported with us, only a few.</span> <span id="s195">It was 6,500 people, I believe, that were deported to Gurs at the same time.</span> <span id="s196">The ride to Gurs was horror.</span> <span id="s197">It was absolute horror.</span> <span id="s198">My husband has explained to you, each car had a person in charge for each car and then someone was put in charge of the train.</span> <span id="s199">They really had nothing to say until the Germans turned us over to the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Why was the train ride a horror?</span> <span id="s201">01:16:00</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: It was a horror insofar as we had no food or barely any food was given to us.</span> <span id="s203">I think the train stopped in Mulhouse.</span> <span id="s204">For the first time we were given some sort of soup and maybe some bread.</span> <span id="s205">Two of the old people, my grandmother being one of them, lost their minds.</span> <span id="s206">Most probably due to hunger and the strain and stress and eventually, there was a doctor on the train, the last doctor that I knew in Karlsruhe and he gave me a handful of sleeping pills to give to my grandmother and I did.</span> <span id="s207">And it really meant, “Put her to sleep, let her go.”</span> <span id="s208">She didn't.</span> <span id="s209">And at the end of the ride, when we came to Oloron-Sainte-Marie; because she was totally confused.</span> <span id="s210">So was the other man, a Mr. Weil.</span> <span id="s211">She was taken out of the train and disappeared for at least a week.</span> <span id="s212">We did not know where she was.</span> <span id="s213">My mother offered to go, asked if she could go with this old woman and was refused.</span> <span id="s214">And for at least a week or two we did not know where she was.</span> <span id="s215">We never knew where she was.</span> <span id="s216">All of a sudden we were told that she was in the next block in the camp.</span> <span id="s217">She must have been in a hospital or someplace because when she came back, she was okay.</span> <span id="s218">She knew us.</span> <span id="s219">She could not understand her surroundings.</span> <span id="s220">Obviously, who could?</span> <span id="s221">But she was okay.</span> <span id="s222">She was no longer confused.</span> <span id="s223">So you can understand that the train ride, aside from everything else, was horror.</span> <span id="s224">My mother's sisters were -- the oldest was very ill and had diabetes, was in her 70s so the ages were great and having two people in the same car, not in the same train, but in the same car going -- losing their minds the same way was a little tough.</span> <span id="s225">When we arrived in Oloron- Sainte-Marie, as my husband mentioned to you before, it rained buckets.</span> <span id="s226">It rained.</span> <span id="s227">It was incredible.</span> <span id="s228">We were loaded mostly on open trucks and taken to the camp.</span> <span id="s229">And in the camp when we arrived, it was evening and, of course, total bedlam and confusion.</span> <span id="s230">And the adults, and we were teenagers at the time, were totally traumatized and in shock and functioned barely.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">01:19:23 And so it was on us, the young, to get some semblance of -- you can't say order -- but there was a barracks where they were giving out straw.</span> <span id="s232">So we ran to get straw so the people at least could sleep on straw.</span> <span id="s233">My husband was lucky.</span> <span id="s234">He had even a straw mattress or whatever he called it.</span> <span id="s235">Later on, we were given stuff to put the straw in to make a mattress.</span> <span id="s236">But the first few nights we had straw and not even enough of that because some people really did sleep on the bare floor.</span> <span id="s237">And for the very old people it was just awful.</span> <span id="s238">A young person can always shift, but very old people, it is very hard.</span> <span id="s239">So it was the young people who had to function first and did function first.</span> <span id="s240">And slowly, you know, things started to fall into a pattern.</span> <span id="s241">Gurs was a camp full of mud.</span> <span id="s242">It was clay.</span> <span id="s243">When it rained, you sank into the clay up to your knees.</span> <span id="s244">The first persons we lost, or one woman we lost really choked to death in the mud.</span> <span id="s245">She went at night to the latrine.</span> <span id="s246">She fell.</span> <span id="s247">She could not extricate herself and she died.</span> <span id="s248">So our experiences were horrendous.</span> <span id="s249">It is not -- I would not say Gurs was Auschwitz, but it was what they called “the Little Hell before the Big One,” meaning Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s250">Our food was minimal.</span> <span id="s251">France was short on food, it is true.</span> <span id="s252">The French felt called upon to steal much of the money that was allocated to feed us so instead of the little, there was even less.</span> <span id="s253">There were people in the camp who stole -- were in a position to steal and did of this little food.</span> <span id="s254">So it was really a very difficult, difficult survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I was in Gurs from, as I mentioned, October 25th, 1940 until the beginning of September 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: What happened--?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: My grandmother -- excuse me -- died in January of 1941.</span> <span id="s259">My mother's oldest sister died in February of 1941.</span> <span id="s260">These are the two people that are buried in Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: You answered my question.</span> <span id="s262">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: You answered my question.</span> <span id="s264">A: I answered your question.</span> <span id="s265">Q: What about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">01:22:40</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: My mother remained in Gurs.</span> <span id="s268">Her two sisters were able to leave Gurs and were lucky enough to make their way via Marseille, North Africa to Cuba, and later on to the United States in 1948.</span> <span id="s269">My mother was not this lucky.</span> <span id="s270">And she was deported in August of 1942 to -- I suppose, first Drancy, and then Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s271">She was the very first transport, or with the first transport, to leave Gurs.</span> <span id="s272">End of July, I went down to Gurs from Le Chambon see my mother who had been very ill and the camp had given me permission that I could enter for a week to visit my sick mother and they would let me out again.</span> <span id="s273">And when I came to the camp, the camp was closed to all visitors.</span> <span id="s274">I saw my mother twice across the barbed wire, an empty field and then, of course, wire again so it was a good distance of maybe 150 feet.</span> <span id="s275">I saw my mother twice like that.</span> <span id="s276">And then I was told that the deportations are starting.</span> <span id="s277">I was told this by the Red Cross, the Red Cross that was active there, and by the Quakers.</span> <span id="s278">And that they made arrangements for me to be able to see my mother on the railroad station, the freight station at Oloron-Sainte-Marie in the train.</span> <span id="s279">And so I went down there from Gurs.</span> <span id="s280">It's about 12 kilometers, I think, 15 kilometers.</span> <span id="s281">I went down there.</span> <span id="s282">I spent the night in the street between two houses on a little -- on a low wall until very early, maybe five o'clock in the morning at which time I was allowed to enter the railroad station or the freight yards really, and I did see my mother and that's the last time I saw her.</span> <span id="s283">And this transport, I think, left, if I remember it right, on August 6, 1942.</span> <span id="s284">I went back from there to Le Chambon, first seeing my then boyfriend, now husband at Talluyers, and he told you that we discussed then if there's any danger -- because there was talk about roundups and arrests and deportations even of the people who were living outside the camps -- that he should come up to Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s285">I met my husband in Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Let us back up indeed and let us go back into Gurs.</span> <span id="s287">Would you describe -- you are now still in Gurs, how did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">01:26:00</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: I met my husband -- Well, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s290">I worked in the so-called office.</span> <span id="s291">Each block had, as it was called, îlotits own barrack for administration purposes.</span> <span id="s292">And his mother was working in this office and I worked in the office, worked in the office, I ran the errands.</span> <span id="s293">I was the messenger.</span> <span id="s294">I distributed mail.</span> <span id="s295">I did messenger service.</span> <span id="s296">They needed young people to walk through the mud.</span> <span id="s297">Okay.</span> <span id="s298">And I did that and this is where I got to know his mother, and when he came to visit his mother, I came to know my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Did you did you get a chance -- were there any kinds of activities, anything going on in Gurs where you and he had a chance to go out and just be together?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Go off and be together?</span> <span id="s301">Well, he could come pretty often because he was involved in making music.</span> <span id="s302">There was a cultural life in Gurs, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s303">In fact, a very excellent one.</span> <span id="s304">We had a lot of artists, a lot of performers in Gurs.</span> <span id="s305">We had some very outstanding people with us and since he always made music and was involved in a quartet, he had a pass that let him -- and he worked in the office in his block -- he had a pass which allowed him to 4 Block of buildings (French) circulate more than other people.</span> <span id="s306">And so he could come to see his mother more often than other people would have been able to.</span> <span id="s307">And, yes, we would go in the mornings, the Swiss Red Cross fed us breakfast or supplementary food and he would come up the camp and would wait for me until I would come out of the block and then we would walk up there together and have breakfast together and walk back together.</span> <span id="s308">That was that was the dating camp style.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: What were the circumstances under which you left Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: The circumstances under which I left, I left Gurs was that a social worker from the OSE came to see my mother and explained that there was a village Le Chambon, who was looking to help young people to take them out of the camp and would she agree to let me go.</span> <span id="s311">And my mother asked me whether I would want to go, and I said, "Of course."</span> <span id="s312">And she never said, "But I will miss you.</span> <span id="s313">I don't want you to go," or anything like that.</span> <span id="s314">She let me go.</span> <span id="s315">She loved me enough to let me go.</span> <span id="s316">Because there were parents who did not.</span> <span id="s317">You're looking at me.</span> <span id="s318">Yes.</span> <span id="s319">There were parents who did not let their children go.</span> <span id="s320">As incredible as it sounds, they held on.</span> <span id="s321">My mother let me go and together with six other young people, teenagers, we set off beginning of September 1941 to go to Le Chambon.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">01:29:30 And Le Chambon was, of course, heaven.</span> <span id="s323">We were free.</span> <span id="s324">We lived in a home, primitive as it was, it still was a house.</span> <span id="s325">The food, of course, was much better.</span> <span id="s326">In fact, in the beginning we couldn't eat all the bread that we got.</span> <span id="s327">Not that it was such tremendous amount of bread, but it was more than we could eat.</span> <span id="s328">And so we would toast it very, very hard and make little packages and sent it back to camp because our constant worry was what was going on in camp.</span> <span id="s329">So we would make, all of us, little packages and sent them.</span> <span id="s330">We would also go and steal maybe a couple of potatoes from the farmers in the field and sent them because they had no potatoes in the camp.</span> <span id="s331">It was an unknown luxury.</span> <span id="s332">So, we would do that.</span> <span id="s333">Right.</span> <span id="s334">And I would say we were content to be where we were, but the constant worry about the family left behind was always there.</span> <span id="s335">You saw the documentary by Pierre Sauvage.</span> <span id="s336">You saw some pictures of very happy looking youngsters.</span> <span id="s337">Yes, we were happy maybe and joking and fooling around at times, yes, but always underlying this was the situation we are in.</span> <span id="s338">The situation of the parent or the other relatives.</span> <span id="s339">It was never hurray, hurray.</span> <span id="s340">Nothing bothered us.</span> <span id="s341">Now we come to 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Excuse me my dear before we get to 1942, would you tell about the family with whom you stayed?</span> <span id="s343">You said you stayed in a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Oh, this was a home which was under the hospices of Swiss Red Cross, to be precise, Secours Suisse.</span> <span id="s345">Okay.</span> <span id="s346">We were there not just the seven of us who came out of the camp, but many French children.</span> <span id="s347">There was with us also Elizabeth, Elizabeth Koenig, née 5 Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants [Children’s Aid Society] (French) 6 Swiss Aid (French) Kaufmann.</span> <span id="s348">She was with us for some time, before she was lucky enough to leave for America.</span> <span id="s349">I think it was February or March of 1942.</span> <span id="s350">And we were a nice group of youngsters.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: What was your role in the house?</span> <span id="s352">01:32:40</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Well, I was one of those who didn't go to school.</span> <span id="s354">Madame Trocméto this day, cannot understand how it happened that I did not go to school.</span> <span id="s355">How her husband let this pass.</span> <span id="s356">So I didn't.</span> <span id="s357">I felt -- I did not speak French at the time, and I felt well, here I am, 17 years old -- almost 17, and they're going to put me in the second graders in order to learn the language.</span> <span id="s358">This was my concept of the time, at the time, and so I did not go.</span> <span id="s359">I had some French lessons by a Mademoiselle Hoefertwho was a refugee herself and taught at the Collège Cévenol.</span> <span id="s360">I believe she taught Latin, if I am not mistaken.</span> <span id="s361">And I had some French lessons from her, and eventually I did pick up the language.</span> <span id="s362">Mostly so because in spring of 42, I was hell-bent on making some money.</span> <span id="s363">And first Pastor Trocmétalked me in -- or whoever was in charge of that, thought I might be able to work in a photo store, being that I came out of this line of business.</span> <span id="s364">And then this was rejected.</span> <span id="s365">Maybe they felt I would be too exposed in an open store.</span> <span id="s366">And I took a job as a maid in a preventorium that was just outside of Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s367">We had there children with TBand children who were in danger of getting TB and I worked there for several months until, in fact, I went down to Gurs to see my mother.</span> <span id="s368">The object was to make a little money.</span> <span id="s369">In the bargain, I learned French.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: While you were still back in the, in the, in the children's home .</span> <span id="s371">A: Yeah, with my friends.</span> <span id="s372">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: With your friends.</span> <span id="s374">You helped the other children.</span> <span id="s375">Did you help take care of them?</span> <span id="s376">You had another special role, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Well, I sort of helped taking care of them, yes.</span> <span id="s378">In La Guespy, yes.</span> <span id="s379">I did help with the cooking.</span> <span id="s380">I did errands.</span> <span id="s381">I felt maybe being the oldest one, I felt a little bit responsible for them sometimes being the spokesman for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: What did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: And being the one who would say no.</span> <span id="s384">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did you were you an intermediary with the Trocmés?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">7 Magda Trocmé</span></p> <p><span id="s387">8 Hilde Hoefert 9 Pastor André Trocmé</span></p> <p><span id="s388">10 tuberculosis</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: No.</span> <span id="s390">Not at all.</span> <span id="s391">Not at all.</span> <span id="s392">Rather many times with the woman who was in charge of the home, who was herself a Spanish refugee.</span> <span id="s393">It's really hard to define, especially so many years later what you did at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s395">Tell me about the Trocmés.</span> <span id="s396">What were they like?</span> <span id="s397">01:35:50</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: We had very little contact with the Trocmés.</span> <span id="s399">We had some contact with Madame Trocmé, because in the beginning she would take us on picnics, to get to know us .</span> <span id="s400">We did not have daily contact with them.</span> <span id="s401">Not at all.</span> <span id="s402">They had their hands full with other things.</span> <span id="s403">We were taken care of in the home; there was no need for them to be in daily contact with us.</span> <span id="s404">They might have been in contact, I am sure they were, with the people who ran the homes because there was more than one eventually.</span> <span id="s405">But not with us, individually.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Can you describe the daily life in the home?</span> <span id="s407">What did you all do?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: The daily life is that most of the youngsters went to school, obviously.</span> <span id="s409">It was a very routine life in a children's home if you wish.</span> <span id="s410">It was a very primitive set up.</span> <span id="s411">In winter, we had barely any heat because there was nothing.</span> <span id="s412">Food was more plentiful than it was somewhere else maybe, but it's still not -- was not very much for teenagers who can eat all day long, incessantly.</span> <span id="s413">And we somehow fell into a routine.</span> <span id="s414">The winter was very hard.</span> <span id="s415">Again, because we had no heat.</span> <span id="s416">Water had to be pumped by hand.</span> <span id="s417">The pump froze in.</span> <span id="s418">It meant we had no toilet.</span> <span id="s419">We had to go out into the woods, which was not very pleasant, especially at night.</span> <span id="s420">Right.</span> <span id="s421">The boys had it easier.</span> <span id="s422">They opened the window.</span> <span id="s423">Not so lucky for the girls.</span> <span id="s424">But we all survived it.</span> <span id="s425">We all made the best of it.</span> <span id="s426">We were a nice group of youngsters who got along.</span> <span id="s427">Whether it was the French children or it was us, it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s428">We got along.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Talk a little more about that.</span> <span id="s430">How did you feel received by Les Chambonnais?</span> <span id="s431">01:38:00</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Les Chambonnais.</span> <span id="s433">Very Well.</span> <span id="s434">Extremely well.</span> <span id="s435">We felt very much at ease or at least I did, feel very much at ease in the village.</span> <span id="s436">I eventually met some other people, French people, and there was never a problem.</span> <span id="s437">I met once a farmer who said to me, "Even if we had less to eat, we would want more of you people."</span> <span id="s438">Now this was an absolute reversal of what we had experienced all our lives from the outside world that someone would say even if we have less we want more of you.</span> <span id="s439">So does this explain to you the attitude of the village?</span> <span id="s440">Okay?</span> <span id="s441">In 1942 when the roundup started of the people outside the camps when I came back we were hidden by the farmers.</span> <span id="s442">We first had a confrontation with the Germans at which the Director of the homes, Mr. Bohnywas extremely clever and diplomatic because we were caught, not in the house where we lived, but in another house where we went during the night in the</span></p> <p><span id="s443">11 Auguste Bohny-Reiter hope of not being caught at the place where we stayed, but we were.</span> <span id="s444">And, of course, they were ready to take us along and Mr. Bohny explained to them that we were under the protection of the Swiss Red Cross, that he was responsible for us.</span> <span id="s445">And he talked to this man and talked and talked and talked until he finally said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s446">You're responsible for them.</span> <span id="s447">We will clear that with our authorities whether this is correct and you make sure that they are not going anywhere."</span> <span id="s448">After they had cleared out and daybreak came, we left in a hurry and went into the woods and were all day long in the woods and were picked up in the early evening and were dispersed to various homes.</span> <span id="s449">And I stayed actually on two different farms for a total of about four weeks.</span> <span id="s450">The farms -- each one had an encounter with the French police in one farm, we were hidden behind a wood pile which was very cleverly put up in that it shaped was U-shaped up against the wall and you could pull out one bundle of wood and we would crawl in there and sit in there.</span> <span id="s451">There was just enough room for the other girl and myself to sit in there.</span> <span id="s452">It was totally covered up top.</span> <span id="s453">You could not look in from the top.</span> <span id="s454">And we were sitting in this wood pile and then you, of course, put this one bundle of wood back in so there was no opening.</span> <span id="s455">We were sitting in there until they left.</span> <span id="s456">And your heart beats very fast and very hard and you're scared until they leave.</span> <span id="s457">In the second farm, again there was the police coming around and there we were hidden in a closet behind old clothes with a row of shoes in front of us and we were standing in there totally quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">01:41:28 Now, we were on the upper floor of this farm.</span> <span id="s459">The police was downstairs in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s460">And we could hear them ask the farmers, "Do you have any Jews here?"</span> <span id="s461">And the farmer answering, "What are Jews?</span> <span id="s462">We don't know what that is, but would you rather have a glass of wine."</span> <span id="s463">And we in the closet hoped they would say no, because it was a little bit tight in this armoire and so eventually they left and we could come out.</span> <span id="s464">So we were very, very lucky.</span> <span id="s465">And four weeks later, we came back to the village.</span> <span id="s466">The razzias had stopped for the moment and it also helped me to make up my mind.</span> <span id="s467">Even before that actually, when I came back from Gurs after I saw my mother that as safe as Le Chambon is, we need to get out.</span> <span id="s468">We need to get out of the country.</span> <span id="s469">And I told my friends and I told the young people in the student home Les RochesThere were some friends of my husband there; there was a map on the wall and I said, "You see where we are here and this is where we have to go," pointing to Switzerland, and they looked at me like I had lost my mind.</span> <span id="s470">And I said, "No.</span> <span id="s471">We cannot stay.</span> <span id="s472">No matter what, we cannot stay."</span> <span id="s473">And so eventually, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s475">Before we go on that trip with you-- A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Would you tell us please.</span> <span id="s477">You had a visit, I believe, in Le Chambon by the head of the Protestant Church in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">12 La Maison des Roches</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: You refer to Pastor Boegner?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s481">Please, would you tell me about that visit and your part in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s483">Okay.</span> <span id="s484">When I came back from Gurs and the short stop I made to see my then boyfriend obviously having seen my mother deported and the last thing I saw of her was a white handkerchief fluttering out of the cattle car.</span> <span id="s485">I don't know whether you can.</span> <span id="s486">… No, you cannot understand what emotions you are going through, and I came back to Le Chambon and I had to bring a horrible message to my friends because most of their parents had been deported at the same time.</span> <span id="s487">And within -- I don't know whether it -- I do not remember whether it was the same day or several days later but it doesn't really matter.</span> <span id="s488">There was a get together and I believe -- I cannot be sure anymore -- it might have been in the Côteau Fleuri where Pastor Boegner addressed the people who were there and I went there.</span> <span id="s489">I don't remember who went with me.</span> <span id="s490">It is sort of a blank.</span> <span id="s491">He was telling us we should be calm and confident and nothing is going to happen and so on and so forth and after having had the experience that I just had, I just became very angry and I confronted the man and said, "Instead of telling us these things, why don't you do something?</span> <span id="s492">Rather than talking, do something."</span> <span id="s493">I did not know at the time who Pastor Boegner was.</span> <span id="s494">He was just another man.</span> <span id="s495">A man who was giving a speech that to me was totally ridiculous.</span> <span id="s496">And so I confronted him with that.</span> <span id="s497">And I don't think if I had known who Pastor Boegner was, I think I would still have done the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">01:45:08</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: What did he say?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: There was no answer as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s501">What's there to answer.</span> <span id="s502">There was no answer to, to, you know, be calm.</span> <span id="s503">Remain confident.</span> <span id="s504">How can you remain calm in the face of what was going on?</span> <span id="s505">Or what I had just experienced?</span> <span id="s506">So that was my confrontation with the head of the Protestant Church.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: What did you do next?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Next?</span> <span id="s509">Well, then we went into hiding.</span> <span id="s510">That was after my confrontation.</span> <span id="s511">Pastor Trocmé was very upset that day with me when I came back that I did not first report to him what had happened and it was really not on my mind to go to him and to tell him.</span> <span id="s512">I did not realize they had really worried if I ever even would come back and not get caught on the way.</span> <span id="s513">The thought never entered my mind.</span> <span id="s514">And I didn't go there.</span> <span id="s515">I just didn't see any reason actually.</span> <span id="s516">Now I know what he wanted to know from me.</span> <span id="s517">But at that time all I knew is that I had to tell my friends what happened.</span> <span id="s518">That was the overwhelming feeling and terrible duty I had to do.</span> <span id="s519">And everything else was wiped off the slate.</span> <span id="s520">So, he was angry with me.</span> <span id="s521">I learned that afterwards.</span> <span id="s522">And it really didn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">13 Pastor Marc Boegner</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: You have come back and told your friends?</span> <span id="s525">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: And you'd pointed to them happened and said, this is what we have to do?"</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Well, this was a couple of days later when I told them this is what we will have to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Pick up with that story, please.</span> <span id="s529">What did you do next?</span> <span id="s530">What did you do about that or did it take awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Well on my way back, as I mentioned, I saw my boyfriend.</span> <span id="s532">I told him to come up to Le Chambon if things become difficult where he is because I was sure that there would be help, that he would be safe.</span> <span id="s533">And he did come.</span> <span id="s534">And he told you how he found me on the way walking from one house to the other.</span> <span id="s535">And wait a minute.</span> <span id="s536">Now I have to think a moment.</span> <span id="s537">I lost my thought.</span> <span id="s538">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s539">What did we do?</span> <span id="s540">Oh.</span> <span id="s541">Yeah.</span> <span id="s542">When I came back out of hiding, I was moved to another home, also of the Swiss Red Cross where there were smaller children.</span> <span id="s543">And I helped for several months to take care of these children.</span> <span id="s544">We had an outbreak in this house of lice, head lice.</span> <span id="s545">Nothing unusual!</span> <span id="s546">My wonderful job was to clean them up in the evening.</span> <span id="s547">Have them all nice and clean.</span> <span id="s548">Send them off to school the next morning, only for them to come back with a new batch, which they picked up in school.</span> <span id="s549">So, it was an evening exercise to clean the children up.</span> <span id="s550">And I did that for several months helped with the children, helped with whatever had to be done in the home.</span> <span id="s551">In the meantime, I was in touch with my family in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">01:49:00 My mother's sister was married in Switzerland since the beginning of the century.</span> <span id="s553">I made it clear to them in letters; I said I wanted to leave and said I wanted to come and stay with them.</span> <span id="s554">And they, in turn, found a woman who arranged for crossings into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s555">What they first did, however, was to apply for a visa for me to enter Switzerland legally.</span> <span id="s556">Now I could never use this visa to enter Switzerland legally as a immigrant because I could not get an exit visa out of France.</span> <span id="s557">Mr. Bohny had at the time tried to get an exit visa for me.</span> <span id="s558">I made the application which, of course, was turned down.</span> <span id="s559">And so I could never physically take possession of this precious visa to go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s560">And so in February of 43, through this woman my family had found, a man was found very close to the Swiss border who would literally take me across the border.</span> <span id="s561">I made my way alone from Le Chambon to Annemasse.</span> <span id="s562">I met this guide in Annemasse.</span> <span id="s563">There were three or four, five other people which he crossed at the same time, so we were a group of six that he crossed over into Switzerland that night.</span> <span id="s564">His crossing over consisted of carrying us across the little stream physically so we would not be wet, depositing us on the other side and saying, "Now you have to walk in such and such a direction and you will then meet the street car that will take you into Geneva, and you get off at a certain station in Geneva and there will be a contact person who will take you to a small hotel for the night."</span> <span id="s565">And this is how I entered Switzerland.</span> <span id="s566">Once I was on Swiss soil, I was perfectly legal, not like my husband who entered as a refugee.</span> <span id="s567">So it was a long while my husband had a guide all the way with his friends.</span> <span id="s568">I had no one.</span> <span id="s569">Mr. Bohny happened to be on the train when I left the next village.</span> <span id="s570">I did not board the train in Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s571">I boarded the train in Tence which is the little town below.</span> <span id="s572">And he was on the train; and he went with me as far as, I believe, Saint-Étienne.</span> <span id="s573">And then of course from Saint-Étienne to Lyon.</span> <span id="s574">From there on, I was on my own.</span> <span id="s575">And the railroad station in Lyon was full of German soldiers because all of France was already occupied at this time.</span> <span id="s576">This was February of 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">01:52:21</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Were you accosted in any way on the course of this journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: I was accosted?</span> <span id="s580">No.</span> <span id="s581">Not really.</span> <span id="s582">Once when I got out of the train, I believe, in Annecy I had to show my false identification papers.</span> <span id="s583">I mean to them -- to me I knew they were false.</span> <span id="s584">To them, they were supposed to be real.</span> <span id="s585">There was a guard there, asked everybody for his identification papers, and I showed him and I walked on.</span> <span id="s586">And then when I walked to Annemasse on the road, there was a little customs building and I figured well, it's war time.</span> <span id="s587">This is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s588">What customs?</span> <span id="s589">What traffic can there be between France and Switzerland and I walked on.</span> <span id="s590">And he called me back.</span> <span id="s591">And I had to show him my papers.</span> <span id="s592">And I did.</span> <span id="s593">And then he said, "Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s594">And I don't know where the answer came from, but it came as, "I have nothing to do with that dirty race."</span> <span id="s595">And I really don't know where this answer came from, but it came.</span> <span id="s596">And he sort of smiled and let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s598">What happened now once you have gotten into Geneva?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: In Geneva I was this one night in this little hotel and I told this contact person to immediately call my family.</span> <span id="s600">It was around 11:30 at night.</span> <span id="s601">She said, "But it's 11:30 at night."</span> <span id="s602">I said, "Never mind the time.</span> <span id="s603">Please call."</span> <span id="s604">And she did.</span> <span id="s605">And my aunt came the next morning to pick me up.</span> <span id="s606">And I lived with my family for a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Would you describe the conditions in Switzerland at that time, living in that house?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Living in this house with my aunt and uncle was extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s609">They had absolutely no understanding of what I had lived through, what I had experienced.</span> <span id="s610">They were very nice, solid, extremely well-to-do Swiss citizens.</span> <span id="s611">People cannot understand really and truly what you went through, and my history is easy compared to what people went through in Auschwitz or Dachau or Majdanek or any of the other camps.</span> <span id="s612">So yet, here I was, 18 years old, or a little older, with all of these experiences: having experienced death many times over to some of my -- the people around me, and their life has always been a very bourgeois life.</span> <span id="s613">So how can they understand?</span> <span id="s614">I was 18, and my uncle was in his 70s so -- and very Victorian.</span> <span id="s615">So right here was a tremendous clash.</span> <span id="s616">And now I was supposed to live the life of the very nice bourgeois girl.</span> <span id="s617">Impossible!</span> <span id="s618">And so there were many clashes and whenever I did something that was not quite the way it was supposed to be my aunt would say, "What would your mother say?"</span> <span id="s619">Well, one day I had enough of what would my mother say and I said, "Why don't you leave her alone.</span> <span id="s620">She's dead."</span> <span id="s621">And this was the one thing really that my aunt could not admit and confront because rightfully she had to feel guilty for the loss of my mother.</span> <span id="s622">Simply because they had not done enough to get her out of the camp.</span> <span id="s623">The problem always was money.</span> <span id="s624">Okay.</span> <span id="s625">So even my life would not have been saved if not my cousin, her daughter-in-law, would not have put them to shame by saying, "How long will you wait or do you wait before you do something and will she have to be lost also before you move?"</span> <span id="s626">But I didn't know that when I was in France that my cousin at the same time was working on the family.</span> <span id="s627">But my life with my relatives was very difficult.</span> <span id="s628">It was extremely difficult, and eventually I left without permission to leave the city of Bern and took a job as a maid with a Bulgarian family, also refugees, in Geneva.</span> <span id="s629">And at the same time I was in Geneva and I got the job through the offices Mademoiselle de Montmollin, who was running the social -- the course where my husband took social services -- that social services course my husband took.</span> <span id="s630">So here we were in Geneva.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Let's hold it a minute.</span> <span id="s632">Let us change tapes.</span> <span id="s633">A: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">01:57:00 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s635">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s636">02:00:00</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Guilt in your mother's death.</span> <span id="s638">Could you describe that a little more?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: I don't know that my uncle felt guilt.</span> <span id="s640">I do think my aunt did.</span> <span id="s641">I really do.</span> <span id="s642">Why he did not really help more than the little amounts of money that he would send us into the camp, I cannot understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Who else was lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Other than my mother?</span> <span id="s645">My mother's brother and his wife, his daughter and son-in-law.</span> <span id="s646">That was the immediate family.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: And your uncle had enough money that he could help?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: He could have helped.</span> <span id="s649">He could have done a lot more.</span> <span id="s650">A lot more.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: You told me when the camera was off what your uncle would say.</span> <span id="s652">Could you repeat that?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Well, my uncle, having a number of houses, two for his private use, one his business house, which he shared with his brother.</span> <span id="s654">Whenever the question of money came around and financial help he would say, "Well, I can't eat the bricks of my houses."</span> <span id="s655">Okay.</span> <span id="s656">So this ended any argument.</span> <span id="s657">I mean what can you say to that.</span> <span id="s658">How can you argue with someone like that.</span> <span id="s659">You weren't supposed to argue with someone that age when you were young.</span> <span id="s660">Right.</span> <span id="s661">In any case, I took a job finally as a maid with Bulgarian people in Geneva.</span> <span id="s662">This situation with my family really drove me to the brink of a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s663">It really did.</span> <span id="s664">In Geneva, I was quite happy with these people.</span> <span id="s665">They were very nice people.</span> <span id="s666">The man had been formally a diplomat, quit his position because he was anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s667">He was very much involved in the Bulgarian underground; they were really very nice people.</span> <span id="s668">They lived on a shoe string, mostly selling jewelry from his mother to make ends meet.</span> <span id="s669">They were very nice, and they were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s670">My husband and I got married in Geneva in April of 1945, and at this time we asked permission that I could join him in the internment home, and this request was granted.</span> <span id="s671">And in 1946, our daughter was born in March -- 4th of March, 1946, our daughter was born in Vevey.</span> <span id="s672">She was one good point.</span> <span id="s673">Look, we met a lot of very nice Swiss people.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">02:03:55 Very helpful people.</span> <span id="s675">Lovely people we are still friends with.</span> <span id="s676">And while the Swiss did take us in, reluctantly, our life in Switzerland was extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s677">We were always considered the dirty refugees.</span> <span id="s678">Okay.</span> <span id="s679">My husband was once handed in Geneva a whole list of restaurants where he was not allowed to go because there was dancing in these restaurants, and you were not allowed to fraternize with the Swiss, quote, unquote.</span> <span id="s680">There was a whole -- a lot of harassment, if you wish.</span> <span id="s681">The Swiss government knew very well that there was no place for us to go until the end of the war, yet I, as an immigrant, had to have my visa or permit to stay in Switzerland renewed every six months and every six months, "Why aren't you leaving?</span> <span id="s682">Can't you go any other place?"</span> <span id="s683">The government knew we could not go any other place.</span> <span id="s684">There was always this under current of resentment.</span> <span id="s685">Always!</span> <span id="s686">And it was a very difficult time.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: At the war's end?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">02:05:28</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: At the war's end!</span> <span id="s690">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: And by 1946, what did you do and where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Well, in -- well, I had my daughter in 1946.</span> <span id="s693">We were in the home in Montreux, to be precise, in Territet.</span> <span id="s694">I was busy with the baby and again, I came down with a case of pleurisy and I did not do very much.</span> <span id="s695">My husband was in the office of the home.</span> <span id="s696">I did a little bit of office work, but nothing to talk about.</span> <span id="s697">Everybody had to do something.</span> <span id="s698">Then came the moment where the Swiss government decided that any immigrant living in the home has to leave.</span> <span id="s699">Now this, of course, applied to me.</span> <span id="s700">Now what do you do?</span> <span id="s701">You have an infant that can stay in the home.</span> <span id="s702">My husband is in the home, but I have to leave.</span> <span id="s703">So we rented a room in Montreux.</span> <span id="s704">It's -- Okay?</span> <span id="s705">I had to take my meals outside.</span> <span id="s706">Okay.</span> <span id="s707">After some length of time, the government decided that I could come back into the home because after all the child was there, and I had to take care of the little one but I would have to pay room and board.</span> <span id="s708">I had to pay room and board at the same rate as the Swiss employees who were running the home -- the Swiss administration.</span> <span id="s709">So, it wasn't much, but it was a lot for us.</span> <span id="s710">At the same time, the Swiss government had a very great dilemma.</span> <span id="s711">Namely that our daughter had a refugee father and an immigrant mother.</span> <span id="s712">What should the child be?</span> <span id="s713">Refugee or immigrant?</span> <span id="s714">Now children born in Switzerland are not automatically citizens like they are in the United States.</span> <span id="s715">That does not happen.</span> <span id="s716">So after lengthy discussion, the Swiss decided she should be a refugee.</span> <span id="s717">Otherwise, we would have had to pay for her as well.</span> <span id="s718">Okay.</span> <span id="s719">So they made her a refugee.</span> <span id="s720">Does that tell you how people were harassed?</span> <span id="s721">Okay.</span> <span id="s722">Little things.</span> <span id="s723">Unimportant things.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: How long did you stay there?</span> <span id="s725">02:08:30</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: We could not immigrate before February of 1948.</span> <span id="s727">It was a matter of not having an affidavit and my relatives here had to find them.</span> <span id="s728">They themselves did not have enough funds to give an affidavit, so they had to find someone to give us an affidavit.</span> <span id="s729">And eventually they did; the man gave us an affidavit with the understanding that we would never become a charge to him because you guarantees it if something happens, they take care of you, that the family would.</span> <span id="s730">And under these -- with this agreement, he gave the affidavit and eventually we came here on the 3rd of March 1948.</span> <span id="s731">So we were eight years on the road so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Will you tell me a little about settling here, the first years in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: The first years were extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s734">First of all, our total assets when we came were exactly $90 for the three of us.</span> <span id="s735">The first week we were in New York relatives of ours paid for our room and board at the Stephen Wise home, on the West Side 70s in Manhattan, but after that it was be on your own.</span> <span id="s736">And luckily enough, my husband found a job within ten days after coming here, so we had a little bit of money.</span> <span id="s737">My husband told you that he went to the HIASto get some help the first few days -- which, of course, was no help.</span> <span id="s738">And, but one of the things they first said before they would help, you have to move out of the Stephen Wise home and you have to move into one of our hotels which was the Hotel Marseille on Broadway and, I think, on 100th Street, I believe it was.</span> <span id="s739">It was a terrible place to be.</span> <span id="s740">So as soon as we could and my husband was making a few dollars, we moved out of there into another one-room hotel situation.</span> <span id="s741">And during that summer, my husband got sick and I was sick.</span> <span id="s742">And our daughter was first with my relatives upstate for about six weeks.</span> <span id="s743">And when this episode was over, he found another job and eventually things started to move along a little bit.</span> <span id="s744">In September of -- no, not in September.</span> <span id="s745">In November of 1950, I started to hemorrhage during the night.</span> <span id="s746">I coughed and I started to hemorrhage and went to the hospital the next morning.</span> <span id="s747">They took an X-ray and here I had a wonderful case of TB, The next step in this situation is, of course, that the family has to be X-rayed, and look here, who also had TB was my husband.</span> <span id="s748">So now we are both sick.</span> <span id="s749">And here's the little child.</span> <span id="s750">So the hospital social services was very good to us.</span> <span id="s751">They referred us to the Jewish Child Carewho placed our daughter into a foster home, and at our request she did not stay in the City of New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">02:12:09 I was scared to death to leave her in the City of New York.</span> <span id="s753">I was afraid that she would be playing in the street and no one would properly supervise her and she would get hurt.</span> <span id="s754">So I requested that she be placed outside of the city.</span> <span id="s755">And so she was placed out on the island with a very, very lovely woman who had taken in foster children for many years, and she just knew how to handle these children and she did a terrific job.</span> <span id="s756">So that was, so that was really two years.</span> <span id="s757">We were almost away for two years in the sanatorium.</span> <span id="s758">The child was away two and a half years, and when we came back from the sanatorium, my husband was enrolled in a school, which came under the rehabilitation program of the State of New York, and he became an accountant and he completed a program in nine months which really takes two years.</span> <span id="s759">So he worked very hard and studied very hard to do it so quickly so that he could go back to work and earn a living.</span> <span id="s760">Well, that was our beginning this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Quite a beginning!</span> <span id="s762">Is there anything you would like to add?</span> <span id="s763">A: No.</span> <span id="s764">I don't think so unless you have some question to ask me.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">14 United Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society 15 Jewish Child Care Association</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: I want to thank you very much for coming.</span> <span id="s767">It's quite a story.</span> <span id="s768">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Ah, yes.</span> <span id="s770">Now we shall show some passports and papers and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: I want you to know that my brother got his visa to come to this country in 1937 by the same Mr. Teller that gave us the visa in 1948 in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s772">Is this wild?</span> <span id="s773">And I have his passport still.</span> <span id="s774">And I met Mr. Teller once before, because my brother was killed in action in 1945 in Luxembourg in the Battle of the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: That's good.</span> <span id="s776">I wanted to mention that on tape.</span> <span id="s777">A: And, well, he joined the Army here.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Would you go back a little and tell me about your brother please?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: My brother, like my husband, made public school.</span> <span id="s780">He then went to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s781">Q: Not the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: But I would like to know what happened to your brother.</span> <span id="s784">How did he get to this country?</span> <span id="s785">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: But I would like to know what happened to your brother.</span> <span id="s787">How did he get to this country?</span> <span id="s788">02:15:10</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: To this country?</span> <span id="s790">Okay.</span> <span id="s791">My brother came here in 1937.</span> <span id="s792">My father had a half-brother here in the United States who was willing to help him to get out of Germany and gave him an affidavit to come here.</span> <span id="s793">So he was 16 years old when he came to this country.</span> <span id="s794">He first stayed with his uncle and his aunt and that was not a good experience either.</span> <span id="s795">And then was more or less on his own.</span> <span id="s796">He was lucky to get a scholarship to a university down in Atlanta and later on came back to New York and worked for Pilotthe radio -- they made radios and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s797">He had taken this up down at the university and eventually, of course, when the war broke out, he volunteered.</span> <span id="s798">The first two times they did not take him.</span> <span id="s799">And the third time, my uncle, who had come in 1939 from Germany, said he was his guardian, which he was not, and signed the papers that it would be alright for him to join the army.</span> <span id="s800">So he joined the army, and eventually was shipped over to Europe, was with Patton's Third Army, and was in the Battle of the Bulge, and was killed on a mission for which he volunteered.</span> <span id="s801">Just never came back.</span> <span id="s802">His buddy, who was also his friend from Germany.</span> <span id="s803">They were buddies in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">16 Pilot Radio and Tube Corporation They were buddies in Germany.</span> <span id="s805">Went on one mission.</span> <span id="s806">My brother went on the other mission.</span> <span id="s807">My brother didn't come back.</span> <span id="s808">The other one did.</span> <span id="s809">That's fate.</span> <span id="s810">So my brother left me his GI insurance, life insurance, and this is what pulled us through.</span> <span id="s811">It sounds horrible in many ways, but when this first came through we were still in Switzerland and so I had to go to the consulate in Zurich to get the papers straightened out and at that time I met Mr. Teller, the consul in Zurich, formerly in Stuttgart, and he signed the papers and made the snide remark, "What are you going to do with all of that money?"</span> <span id="s812">All of this money was $10,000, which was paid, as you know, in monthly installments of $50.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: You encountered Mr. Teller again, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: I encountered Mr. Teller again when he gave us the visa to come to this country.</span> <span id="s815">He's the same man who signed the visa for my husband -- excuse me, for my brother, in 1937 in Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">[Displaying documents] 02:18:00</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Okay, go.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: This paper here is my false identification card
