-CONTENTS- I was born Dec. 15, 1917. I am a Japanese American, My parents are
Japanese.
On Dec 7, 1941 I was in Mawui. I lived in the country and did not hear about it until I went to the city to go shopping. I consider myself American. We speak Japanese at home. I did not experience prejudice. I heard people say Japs when I went to the city. In my part of the Island I did not hear anything like that. We lived as
before.
As Japanese we did the manual work. After the war white people did manual jobs and some educated Japanese Americans had big jobs. The younger ones of course want more, they think they are just as good.
We were more accepting. When Japanese Americans came home from the war they had better opportunities for education than before the war. Times were changing. Many of our better educated citizens got
top jobs.
With regard to relocation camps, priests, reverends of Buddhist faith, principals of schools were taken away by the FBI to relocation camps because they were people of Japanese background, educated in Japan and I presume they were taken because they had some connection with Japan. In the country, we lived as before. My sister had a friend in Santa Barbara who wrote us she was in a relocation camp. After the war she came to Hawaii. She visited me and then these things came out. Her father had a drycleaning business. They had to practically give it away or leave it there.
I do not remember what the reaction of my familuy was to this news.
They had worked so hard to get what they had and she had planned to go to college. I do not remember what happened after that.
I do not think it could happen in Hawaii. Where would they take us.
There were too many of us. It never occurred to me.
From the seventh grade on my daughter Phyllis wanted to study archeology. The principal told me I have to work very hard because she will have to go to school for ten years to be an archeologust.
I worked in the school cafeteria.
Archeology meant Israel to her. She studied Hebrew in Hawaii University and when she graduated went to Hebrew University.
I do not remember anything about the Holocaust until my daughter started to work with the Jewish Federation. Phyllis is going from one Kibbutz to another. While at Hebrew University she worked part time for the Jewish Federation. They offered her a full time job as a receptionist after she finished college. She was a fine art major. She left Israel in 1979 and came back in the summer of 1980.
She went to Dachau. I forgot a lot of what she said. She had a roommate in Israel from Skokie, Ill. whose parents were in the Holocaust and through her she wanted to visit a concentration camp on the way from from Israel. She went to Dachau. My husband was interested in what the people suffered and Phyllis was very
sympathetic to that.
When the children got bigger they asked my husband questions about his war experiences, and he told them and they were very
interested.
Did he tell them about the relocation camps?
I am not sure.
My second son went to visit one of the relocation camps. He said it was bleak, cold, desert.
I never saw those camps. My husband did talk about it when they
asked questions.
When Phyllis worked for the Jewish Federation, she attended the Anniversary of the Holocaust and we went with her for the past 5 years. We try to make it each year to remember the Holocaust survivors and at the service, the speaker talks about what had been done and what we should do that that people will not forget. My daughter was also asked to help out with the Independence Day of Israel Celebration. She makes posters and helps them. We have gone with her to Israeli Independence Day Celebrations. My daughter is in Israel now and we go every year whether she is here or not. I think it is important for the Jewish people otherwise people will not understand what happened.
With regard to the extermination of the Jewish it is hard to believe that such a thing happened. Maybe that is why people do not believe it. If we do not keep it up I guess in the next generation or one following that there will be no one who can remember these things. I believe that because Phyllis had friends whose parents were survivors, we came to understand what happened. My son was living is Skokie, Ill, he met survivors.
. END.
