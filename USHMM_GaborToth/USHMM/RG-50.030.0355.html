Not so early.</span> <span id="s118">First me, brother, everybody, we were there and the village but maybe after two weeks after we heard that in Torran are the German soldiers, my mother asked me and my older brother has to go to this house and try to prove that everything is okay because during the absence could happen everything.</span> <span id="s119">We had returned.</span> <span id="s120">We seen soldiers, some soldiers in the beginning were very kind.</span> <span id="s121">They tried to give soups and breads because in the soups we had nothing.</span> <span id="s122">I took some breads even and I went by foot with my brother to the village and I told mother, "Come on.</span> <span id="s123">There is no reason to sit here.</span> <span id="s124">We must go home.</span> <span id="s125">The soldiers are not so bad.</span> <span id="s126">Maybe the war will be not so long."</span> <span id="s127">And we returned to the same place to the nice house where we lived before.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q.</span> <span id="s129">Did you stay in this house during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A. Oh, only maybe two months we were living there in the same house, but then once they came there, the soldiers, by some patrol, I couldn't recall because I was very young, and said you must leave this house.</span> <span id="s131">Oh my mother began to cry but where are we to go.</span> <span id="s132">We are living so long here.</span> <span id="s133">Don't make a ________.</span> <span id="s134">You must leave.</span> <span id="s135">We are giving you a few hours time but first she would like to know where.</span> <span id="s136">You will receive a good flat.</span> <span id="s137">We went with my brother.</span> <span id="s138">We had seen this replacement for us.</span> <span id="s139">It was terrible, but it was what we had to do.</span> <span id="s140">It was an order.</span> <span id="s141">So, we tried to take as much as was possible and we went to this new house.</span> <span id="s142">It wasn't a house, maybe it should be called shed maybe because it wa only -- we had three rooms and now my mother said it is more easier to move from a worse place to better than to on the contrary, from the better to the worse.</span> <span id="s143">Here it was only one room house, with small kitchen, a dark kitchen.</span> <span id="s144">There was no water inside.</span> <span id="s145">There was no water, toilet outside, no cellar, nothing, but what we had to do was to leave and to stay and thank God we had received this because some people they were put on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q.</span> <span id="s147">Why had you to leave the house and how many other people had to leave the houses in Torran?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A.</span> <span id="s149">The only reason was that we are Polish.</span> <span id="s150">This was the reason.</span> <span id="s151">It was too nice to us.</span> <span id="s152">They put it immediately German families from Germany.</span> <span id="s153">Sometime, because we were living in -- across sometimes we look out the window.</span> <span id="s154">It was very difficult to just living here and the people from Germany took our flat.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q.</span> <span id="s156">How did you support yourself and how did the family support themselves in the following months?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A. Usually all young people were sent to the force camp to Germany.</span> <span id="s158">My brother -- before the war was one or two years he learned not as baker for some sweet things, but baker and so he worked by this baker and once he came to me he said you see, it's better you take the job by ____________.</span> <span id="s159">It is also baker and I have some friends there.</span> <span id="s160">It will be very good job and maybe it you will not go to Germany to the force camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">And I went to this bakery.</span> <span id="s162">I remember he was very nice tall man.</span> <span id="s163">I didn't speak so good German.</span> <span id="s164">I tried to speak German but this German he was living in Poland so he could speak Polish too.</span> <span id="s165">First, he refused to speak Polish but when he seen that I try but I couldn't he started with me speak Polish.</span> <span id="s166">I told him that we have very difficult situation.</span> <span id="s167">My father is not here.</span> <span id="s168">I have younger sisters and brother.</span> <span id="s169">We have to help mother.</span> <span id="s170">I would like to work because I heard that there is wanted a boy his bakery.</span> <span id="s171">He called his wife.</span> <span id="s172">She looked at me probably I was good for -- I looked well.</span> <span id="s173">She agreed and soon I was employed there as a delivery boy.</span> <span id="s174">This kind of job I had to go by bicycle.</span> <span id="s175">I had on my back a basket with bread and every morning very early I brought this bread to some German hospitals, to German shops and to some private houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q. Were you disappointed that you were not allowed to go to school?</span> <span id="s177">How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A. I heard this immediately.</span> <span id="s179">It was written, we had many times some special how you call this on the streets, there was written, at the first in the beginning it was written in German and in Polish_____________.</span> <span id="s180">I don't know in English how it was.</span> <span id="s181">I went to the school but the door was closed and it was only for German children.</span> <span id="s182">I knew immediately I couldn't go.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q. Were you disappointed?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A. Of course because I was so glad I started to study.</span> <span id="s185">I wanted to be as we called in Poland, even in Torran, one mensch.</span> <span id="s186">My mother, my father said I will take from a month and put to him for his schooling, one of our family must be a mensch.</span> <span id="s187">I think in comparing with other people, it was maybe in the beginning not so bad for us because as I told you I was working as a delivery boy for a baker.</span> <span id="s188">So, I could receive even for my payment, my salary was not so high.</span> <span id="s189">I remember it was only five marks per week, but I received some bread and it was very important because the food was rationed especially for Polish people.</span> <span id="s190">We had received -- what I remember, there was one pound of meat per month including bones.</span> <span id="s191">You can understand it was nothing.</span> <span id="s192">It was with some soldiers also.</span> <span id="s193">Sometimes we wondered she prepared some dishes, of course meat was maybe two or once per month, but she prepared this or that so things that my mama, she was very practical and we were not hungry.</span> <span id="s194">In the beginning I thought and my brother bought so that our family didn't be hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q.</span> <span id="s196">You said there were Polish people from Torran sent from Germany.</span> <span id="s197">Do you remember stories, do you know people who were sent to Germany for forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A.

Not all time, but in the beginning I was working yes, I was working bakery and theater.</span> <span id="s287">The theater was very nice.</span> <span id="s288">I like this climate, this atmosphere.</span> <span id="s289">There were dancers, singers, nice people.</span> <span id="s290">In the theater you could forget, you see, the war, and especially for me, I had no chance, nothing, no cafes, just no -- it was war time boring.</span> <span id="s291">During the evening it was dark, closed house, no gas lamps nothing.</span> <span id="s292">War.</span> <span id="s293">Exactly war.</span> <span id="s294">So, when I was working in the theater it was everything good, but in my job happened something very wrong.</span> <span id="s295">Because as they told you you remember when I was employed by the baker the woman, his wife, came to me.</span> <span id="s296">She looked at me and then later I knew what for.</span> <span id="s297">The age of her husband and the woman was very big difference.</span> <span id="s298">She was younger and probably she was bigger and more demand in the month for love.</span> <span id="s299">She used me as a boy not only for delivery of bread but also of the delivery love letters to her lovers.</span> <span id="s300">In the beginning it was everything good but something happened very, very wrong.</span> <span id="s301">When I went with this letter, open it, a woman.</span> <span id="s302">She said, "What are you doing.</span> <span id="s303">You're trying to make -- break my marriage."</span> <span id="s304">And I ran away.</span> <span id="s305">I told -- I said in German "Meister, and she said "Yes did you --" No, I have this.</span> <span id="s306">Good that you haven't given this but maybe she can recognize you because Torran was very small.</span> <span id="s307">Everybody knew us.</span> <span id="s308">And then in this moment she tried to do everything that will go out from this job.</span> <span id="s309">My mother, the meister, everybody was wondering why.</span> <span id="s310">It was always so good, but I knew later that the reason was that she was afraid that maybe there will some blackmail.</span> <span id="s311">The man will be know about her and okay.</span> <span id="s312">I was looking for a new job.</span> <span id="s313">It was very, very difficult to find a very easy job.</span> <span id="s314">But I found it as an ordinary worker.</span> <span id="s315">It is in German a ________________.</span> <span id="s316">You can translate this into English.</span> <span id="s317">I remember the name it was Hanz Kruger.</span> <span id="s318">I agree and I was working there.</span> <span id="s319">I said immediately that I cannot stay very long only until 3:00 because then I have to exercises in the theater.</span> <span id="s320">They appreciated very much.</span> <span id="s321">At first they were very anxious, curious that Polish people and I said "No, I'm just a chorus singer, nothing more."</span> <span id="s322">And so I worked there and I worked in the theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q.</span> <span id="s324">But Polish people were not allowed to be on the street after 8:00?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q.</span> <span id="s327">But you had to work in the theater sometimes in the evening?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A. Yes, you are right.</span> <span id="s329">Before I accepted the theater because they told me you will work here nights, performances until 10:00 and you will receive a special pass for the night.</span> <span id="s330">I received a pass from 8:00 until 12:00.</span> <span id="s331">I was very funny and very proud, but it was not for other people not good.</span> <span id="s332">Other people you can imagine.</span> <span id="s333">They are sitting.</span> <span id="s334">They are waiting and I'm coming at ten or eleven o'clock home.</span> <span id="s335">They are wondering what's happened.</span> <span id="s336">Maybe he is a German now.</span> <span id="s337">I couldn't explain to everybody that I have this permission.</span> <span id="s338">At home my mother knew.</span> <span id="s339">My brother was not satisfied with this, and he wasn't also satisfied that I was working in the theater.</span> <span id="s340">Maybe some friends, because he had many friends, and maybe they thought I was collaborating with Germans.</span> <span id="s341">It was not a pleasant time for me, especially when I came home or when I passed a street when somebody -- it happened also that my friends from the school sometimes when I passed they took the hat so on this side they thought that maybe I'm collaborating.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q.</span> <span id="s343">Did your German also improve when you were working in theater?</span> <span id="s344">Did you start to speak better German?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A. Yes, of course I had to because we had the exercises.</span> <span id="s346">We received a note and it was German.</span> <span id="s347">I tried to learn the German better.</span> <span id="s348">I asked my mother, my father, the grammar.</span> <span id="s349">My mother could speak but she couldn't explain me how it was grammatically good.</span> <span id="s350">Then I asked sometimes Mr. Veber and he was very glad that I am so keen for this language.</span> <span id="s351">He said, "Oh, you are a very clever boy.</span> <span id="s352">In a short time you will speak fluently German."</span> <span id="s353">It was not fluently but it was better and better, always better.</span> <span id="s354">So, that's and even when I was working with this baker, we went together and we made shopping with the women, with the meister and I tried also to speak German or Polish.</span> <span id="s355">She said we are going now to the German shop, try to speak German only.</span> <span id="s356">And sometimes if I needed something, _____________, then because we couldn't buy, except a small ration of food in the cart, nothing, no ______________.</span> <span id="s357">The Germans had some ____________, it is permission for buying clothes, dresses or shoes.</span> <span id="s358">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s359">Once I remember she also went to a German shop and you see the boy this winter it's cold maybe you have something, and they put it to give because I talk to her German, maybe they took me as a German too.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Anyhow, I improve my German so much as possible sometimes the Germans couldn't recognize me that I was German, because I used this night pass control for some shopping.</span> <span id="s361">For Germans there was everything, but at night, evening.</span> <span id="s362">And I went to those shops, I bought I remember it was marmalade, there was some not -- a kind of zwieback, sometimes there was some fruit some oranges, but there was only two or three.</span> <span id="s363">They wouldn't like to sell more so that I had use of this privilege of my pass and I could buy a little to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q.</span> <span id="s365">Then when you worked for the theater you met at one point someone who became very special?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s367">It was once when I left the theater I crossed usually the same place to make some shopping and I feel that somebody watched me.</span> <span id="s368">At the moment I thought maybe some policeman because it was dark.</span> <span id="s369">I didn't see.</span> <span id="s370">I went and he followed me and they see there is some uniform, some soldier.</span> <span id="s371">I didn't know what he wanted from me.</span> <span id="s372">He watched, but his watching was completely differently than usual.</span> <span id="s373">He smiled to me.</span> <span id="s374">It never happened before and he started to ask something of me and he said _________________, which means "this is a nice place" and then hello, how are you?</span> <span id="s375">What are you doing?</span> <span id="s376">"I'm going home.</span> <span id="s377">Shall we go home to drink some coffee?"</span> <span id="s378">I'm looking.</span> <span id="s379">A German invited me for coffee.</span> <span id="s380">My hat was trembling I was so excited.</span> <span id="s381">I didn't know maybe if I refuse him maybe something happen wrong.</span> <span id="s382">I agree.</span> <span id="s383">I went and then when we're inside, so, and you're out shopping.</span> <span id="s384">"Your parents are living here, family?"</span> <span id="s385">"Yes, my parents are living here.</span> <span id="s386">My father is not here.</span> <span id="s387">My father is I don't know, maybe in Germany and I was born also here."</span> <span id="s388">You were born here?</span> <span id="s389">You're not German?</span> <span id="s390">No, I'm Polish.</span> <span id="s391">Oh, God, what are you doing now."</span> <span id="s392">I said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s393">I have the passport.</span> <span id="s394">I am working theater.</span> <span id="s395">I have the passport until 12:00" "Oh, God, that's good, but maybe we go out," because I think he was afraid my characteristic, German speaking that somebody here that he speaks with me, there were not so many people but anyhow I knew that in the beginning when I spoke only a few words it was correct.</span> <span id="s396">But I started to speak more he felt that my accent was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">And we went out.</span> <span id="s398">He asked me in which direction I'm going home.</span> <span id="s399">I showed him because I was living not in the center of city, we were in suburb, very, very poor district.</span> <span id="s400">Then when the evening he asked me, "May I see you again?"</span> <span id="s401">For the first time, I would like to meet you.</span> <span id="s402">But he look always in eyes.</span> <span id="s403">It was something completely different than usual with all the German men.</span> <span id="s404">I asked why not, we can do this.</span> <span id="s405">"But where?"</span> <span id="s406">I asked.</span> <span id="s407">You see, here, this station.</span> <span id="s408">It was in the railroad station in the middle of the city.</span> <span id="s409">It was a very good place.</span> <span id="s410">Okay, but when?</span> <span id="s411">You see I don't know when I'll receive the permission for going out because he was a soldier.</span> <span id="s412">And I also, I don't know because there were differently plays, operetta, gypsy, a little longer, sometimes ____________ it is an operetta it was a little shorter.</span> <span id="s413">We fixed exactly I remember it was after two days at the same place, and he came after my performance, he came.</span> <span id="s414">And then, I have to tell you we went -- I took him because I knew places.</span> <span id="s415">He asked me whether I knew some places because he is not so good to walk for him and for him, especially for him maybe more because Polish people were not on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">And I found some places we were standing there in the theater and he -- maybe I so exactly there is some item but he pressed on and he said, "You look very nice.</span> <span id="s417">You are a very boy."</span> <span id="s418">Then he told me, "I'm not German."</span> <span id="s419">"You are not German?</span> <span id="s420">Who are you then?"</span> <span id="s421">"I'm Austrian.</span> <span id="s422">"Austria, Vienna?</span> <span id="s423">Yes, Vienna."</span> <span id="s424">Then I feel a little better.</span> <span id="s425">It is completely different to like a German.</span> <span id="s426">Have you met in these places as a child.</span> <span id="s427">As a child I played in some places.</span> <span id="s428">I knew some.</span> <span id="s429">It was destroyed in the war in the field there was somebody watching as a guard.</span> <span id="s430">Let's go because it was cold.</span> <span id="s431">I met him it was on exactly the fourth of November 1941.</span> <span id="s432">It would snow.</span> <span id="s433">It was cold.</span> <span id="s434">I liked to wear shoes -- only small shoes and trousers with pump, here.</span> <span id="s435">So, the snow -- the winter was so strong.</span> <span id="s436">He took me to places for the first time like father and I was a child and it was very pleasant and then we went to the shed.</span> <span id="s437">We played.</span> <span id="s438">It was romantic.</span> <span id="s439">It was not so suffocating like now maybe, completely different.</span> <span id="s440">Then when I went home, I couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s441">I dreamed because it happened something with me completely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q.</span> <span id="s443">What happened?</span> <span id="s444">What was different for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A. Different for me, it changed my life.</span> <span id="s446">I feel something, like love.</span> <span id="s447">It was like love but don't think that there was real sex.</span> <span id="s448">No.</span> <span id="s449">There was playing, kissing, maybe the sex comes also, of course, I was young, I feel it.</span> <span id="s450">But and we had no possibilities but it was a very, very pleasurable time.</span> <span id="s451">We couldn't see each day as I told you because he could not receive every day the permission but so long he could he came and he brought me always something, some sweet, some special ration card.</span> <span id="s452">With this card I could buy some pastry because for Polish people it was absolutely forbidden to receive pastry but for his card especially evening when I went, I could receive it.</span> <span id="s453">I received once even shoes because he had seen that my shoes for the winter time was no good.</span> <span id="s454">Home was big scandal, especially my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">My brother felt that there is something wrong because I brought shoes.</span> <span id="s456">I brought once shirt, inside shirt and he knew that this shirt was from soldier.</span> <span id="s457">He asked me something, "What's happened?</span> <span id="s458">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s459">What I am doing is my business."</span> <span id="s460">Sometimes he was very angry.</span> <span id="s461">He said I am older than you.</span> <span id="s462">I promise Father to take care of you so I must know.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q.</span> <span id="s464">Did you tell him?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A. Not early.</span> <span id="s466">Later.</span> <span id="s467">When that was so big that even my mother feel something happened with me, something, because I ask very often, "Mother I need white shirt."</span> <span id="s468">My mother complained, "I have no soap.</span> <span id="s469">You change every day.</span> <span id="s470">I cannot wash.</span> <span id="s471">Mother I must look very nice", but it was not for theater.</span> <span id="s472">It was for my friend.</span> <span id="s473">His name was Willie Goetz.</span> <span id="s474">I will never forget his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Because he was so sweet to me, I wanted also to be sweet and once they of course, when my brother drank a little, schnapps, that's a kind of illegal vodka, we couldn't buy it but he had some contacts.</span> <span id="s476">Maybe later I will tell you.</span> <span id="s477">I knew he had to work.</span> <span id="s478">He worked with some underground.</span> <span id="s479">I never knew exactly, but he brought also sometimes schnapps probably from these places.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">I said to him, his name was Casimir, I said, "Cashic, you must understand me.</span> <span id="s481">I fall in love with soldier.</span> <span id="s482">Oh my God, why?</span> <span id="s483">You don't like women?</span> <span id="s484">No, I like men like you like women.</span> <span id="s485">I like men.</span> <span id="s486">You must understand me.</span> <span id="s487">No, this is only for the moment.</span> <span id="s488">You'll find a girl probably, especially with Germany.</span> <span id="s489">You know what's happened.</span> <span id="s490">It's very dangerous.</span> <span id="s491">No, it's not dangerous, it's so good.</span> <span id="s492">No, you can be sure.</span> <span id="s493">You must stop this.</span> <span id="s494">I'll tell mother.</span> <span id="s495">Don't tell this mother, I ask you very much.</span> <span id="s496">Don't do this."</span> <span id="s497">He didn't say this, but from this time he changed his behavior towards me.</span> <span id="s498">And our relation was not so open.</span> <span id="s499">I knew that sometimes he went to somebody but not night only during the day.</span> <span id="s500">He had no permission so that his time working and doing this was not so easy for him.</span> <span id="s501">Anyhow, our relation was not so good as before.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q.</span> <span id="s503">You said that your brother worked in the underground, did you ever get into difficulties with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A. I feel it.</span> <span id="s505">He never said this at home but there are too many friends and they came to our room, with no loud speaking.</span> <span id="s506">Even my mother, "What are you doing?</span> <span id="s507">This is our business."</span> <span id="s508">SO, that I feel there was something there.</span> <span id="s509">They had some news about the war, about the front, from where?</span> <span id="s510">We had no radio.</span> <span id="s511">I forgot to tell you that when we were living in this nice house we had very nice radio, Phillips Radio.</span> <span id="s512">We didn't even pay.</span> <span id="s513">There was two years of payment and the Germans in the beginning immediately took this radio so that the Polish people never listened to no radio.</span> <span id="s514">For my brother I had some news because from BBC they heard something.</span> <span id="s515">It was only my feeling, but I suppose he was afraid that I was working in the theater with German people.</span> <span id="s516">And then I said to him I have this friend, this soldier, I'm sure that he didn't want to tell me about his underground work.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q.</span> <span id="s518">Did you -- how was your feeling that Willie was Austrian, I mean he was part of the German army and the German army was responsible that you couldn't go to school, that you had to work.</span> <span id="s519">How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A. Usually my feeling to German soldiers was very bad because in the school we were educated against Germany and Russia.</span> <span id="s521">Even my mother sometimes when I wouldn't go to the church, she called me a Bolshevik.</span> <span id="s522">That was the worst thing.</span> <span id="s523">When I met Willie and he said to me he is Austrian, my feeling was completely different because I felt he's not German and his behavior was so good.</span> <span id="s524">I thought maybe when I said to my brother that he will understand me, but he didn't because he said for me German uniform is German uniform.</span> <span id="s525">It's Austria or it's not Austria but it is for me German.</span> <span id="s526">And he knew that I couldn't go to the school.</span> <span id="s527">Very often he made me plans, you see the world, it will not be war time.</span> <span id="s528">The war will finish.</span> <span id="s529">Maybe you'll come to my country.</span> <span id="s530">You will study there, you will be a real mensch.</span> <span id="s531">Be a waiting person, do like just now.</span> <span id="s532">Be in this way as you are because I was very honest.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">In our family and my mother was very strong, strong for the education.</span> <span id="s534">I never forget once before the war I went not to the school I went -- instead to school with boys to some play and because I was always going to the school, the teacher sent somebody to ask what happened to me why I didn't come to the school.</span> <span id="s535">My mother knew this.</span> <span id="s536">I came home as usual.</span> <span id="s537">It was greetings.</span> <span id="s538">I said _____________.</span> <span id="s539">My mother said I give you forever and I received -- I was punished so strong and she punished because who lies also steals.</span> <span id="s540">So, I was very honest so everything what I've done was correct and therefore I believed Willie.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">We talked about his future plans.</span> <span id="s542">We talked about is life and before for me it was for me a pleasure to hear it.</span> <span id="s543">I agree that I was very lucky especially as I told you during the war time.</span> <span id="s544">It was so boring for young people.</span> <span id="s545">I was 17 years old at this time.</span> <span id="s546">I had no friends because I had to work morning from one work to another work.</span> <span id="s547">I even had not enough for sleeping, only when I had no appointments with him I could sleep a little longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q.</span> <span id="s549">How old was Willie?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A.</span> <span id="s551">He was maybe five or six years older than me, but he looks very handsome, very strong.</span> <span id="s552">I never seen his picture and he told me -- I asked once for his picture but he said it's better you will not have it.</span> <span id="s553">It will be very dangerous for you and for me.</span> <span id="s554">He told me also.</span> <span id="s555">He said something, you must be very careful because Hitler, what you receive for this kind of love is very dangerous.</span> <span id="s556">You must be very careful.</span> <span id="s557">I said what for we are doing nothing.</span> <span id="s558">Don't tell anybody that we meet or that we are coming here.</span> <span id="s559">It would be very dangerous.</span> <span id="s560">He told me one day he said "You know Hitler is also for men.</span> <span id="s561">He likes only this kind of love.</span> <span id="s562">Really?</span> <span id="s563">Yes, he's not married.</span> <span id="s564">He is single and he likes this kind of love.</span> <span id="s565">The Fuhrer then why are you so anxious?</span> <span id="s566">Please believe me, I am older I know better."</span> <span id="s567">He told me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q.</span> <span id="s569">Did he tell anything about the persecution of homosexual men?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A. No, it was only the attention given to me in this way, but it was in a real 1941 when we met, let's go to a place here, I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s571">He brought me something new and he was very nervous.</span> <span id="s572">What's happen?</span> <span id="s573">At first I thought maybe someone has seen us.</span> <span id="s574">I asked him, no, nobody seen you know.</span> <span id="s575">I'm sent to the eastern front of war.</span> <span id="s576">Oh my to Russia.</span> <span id="s577">I heard that this was the worst front in the war because it was warmer it was snow.</span> <span id="s578">You must wait for me.</span> <span id="s579">I promise you.</span> <span id="s580">The war will not be longer.</span> <span id="s581">When the war is end the war you will come to Vienna.</span> <span id="s582">I will try to live with you together.</span> <span id="s583">Wait for me.</span> <span id="s584">But how will I contact.</span> <span id="s585">I'll write you.</span> <span id="s586">I gave him my address and I was waiting for his letter but I hadn't received it.</span> <span id="s587">I was very sorry, very sad.</span> <span id="s588">Even my mother, my brother.</span> <span id="s589">I said to my brother that my friend went -- he accepted, he agreed.</span> <span id="s590">He was a little satisfied with this.</span> <span id="s591">He was more calmly that something happened wrong to me.</span> <span id="s592">I was waiting for this letter.</span> <span id="s593">Once I couldn't remember -- I have to state to you also that in my theater there was working like me.</span> <span id="s594">He was a little older.</span> <span id="s595">He knew exactly, he learned me this way, he explained me this kind of love and he asked me -- first I didn't want to tell him but I wanted to see the place, what's happened.</span> <span id="s596">Where is this shed and then come on let's go.</span> <span id="s597">We shall go maybe there and once we went there it was after the performance and when we went there, voices.</span> <span id="s598">Some people -- I wanted to run away.</span> <span id="s599">He too, and especially one fellow took us here very quickly, halted the mouths.</span> <span id="s600">We couldn't cry, nothing and then in broken German he said to me that he's from the concentration camp Studthoff.</span> <span id="s601">He was a very young Jew.</span> <span id="s602">Bascal I remember this name.</span> <span id="s603">We give our story to him to the other people.</span> <span id="s604">We talk to them also.</span> <span id="s605">One spoke very good Polish.</span> <span id="s606">He was Polish.</span> <span id="s607">That Sigmund, the other boy took the Jew -- I couldn't take where we were living.</span> <span id="s608">He took him home probably for some feeding even some dressing.</span> <span id="s609">What's happened there I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s610">I was only with my things about my friend.</span> <span id="s611">Even Sigmund if I wanted to know, he told me only it was very nice time.</span> <span id="s612">I can imagine.</span> <span id="s613">Maybe he used him for some sex or something like this because he said it was so nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q.</span> <span id="s615">How many men were in this shed?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A. Three men.</span> <span id="s617">Some of them they had stripes, some trousers.</span> <span id="s618">Maybe they found them, but they had stripes.</span> <span id="s619">They couldn't go on the street.</span> <span id="s620">They would be immediately arrested.</span> <span id="s621">Everybody could recognize them.</span> <span id="s622">They had this cap also with this thread.</span> <span id="s623">Now I know that they had some _____ but I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s624">I knew only the faces very --- Bascal was small, but the eyes were very large, very big.</span> <span id="s625">This is all.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q. Bascal, where did he come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A.</span> <span id="s628">He said to me from France and he spoke -- I couldn't speak French.</span> <span id="s629">He spoke only a little German, a few words.</span> <span id="s630">Enough only to understand me.</span> <span id="s631">Then when I was in the theater one day I had seen a German newspaper and this German newspaper on the table and there was written, there was the address for the soldiers who are on the east front.</span> <span id="s632">I wrote secretly this and then I was fighting with myself.</span> <span id="s633">It was so long time, four months.</span> <span id="s634">I haven't received a letter.</span> <span id="s635">Have I to write or not to write the letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q.</span> <span id="s639">When you went to this shed and you heard voices, what exactly happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A.</span> <span id="s641">You see, when we went there there was change.</span> <span id="s642">Usually I remember it that it was completely different.</span> <span id="s643">We heard some voices, some human voices and when I said to my friend, Sigmund, let's go, we go, at this moment somebody stood up and closed our mouths, nothing to say.</span> <span id="s644">Probably this man thought we are from Poland or maybe some spies.</span> <span id="s645">Then he started to ask me Polish.</span> <span id="s646">He spoke very good Polish.</span> <span id="s647">"What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s648">he asked me.</span> <span id="s649">We came only here because our paths crossed.</span> <span id="s650">We are not from -- no we are Polish.</span> <span id="s651">He tested me many times.</span> <span id="s652">He feels that I speak perfect Polish.</span> <span id="s653">My friend also, and then we have seen two other faces.</span> <span id="s654">They were laying the sheets and the youngest was trembling, was very cold even the outside was not so cold.</span> <span id="s655">And the youngest tried to speak something.</span> <span id="s656">I asked in Polish first, but he couldn't reply me Polish and he said to me in German.</span> <span id="s657">I asked "Are you German?</span> <span id="s658">No, in a completely different way, in French.</span> <span id="s659">I'm French and Jew."</span> <span id="s660">He said Bascal's his name.</span> <span id="s661">My friend Sigmund took care of him immediately.</span> <span id="s662">I gave him shirt because he had only his striped jacket.</span> <span id="s663">This from the Studtkoff.</span> <span id="s664">It is warm outside I can go home in my white underwear shirt.</span> <span id="s665">And so I did.</span> <span id="s666">Then he said to this Bascal that he will take him home but only in this dressing.</span> <span id="s667">Then to the two, he promised to wait here so long as they will come.</span> <span id="s668">The French with the Bascal probably he wanted also to bring some food, maybe some dressing.</span> <span id="s669">I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s670">I had enough problems with my Willie and I couldn't help nothing more.</span> <span id="s671">I give only my shirt and that is all.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Only the next day or after maybe two days I asked Sigmund what happened.</span> <span id="s673">He said everything is okay.</span> <span id="s674">Bascal was at his house, slept there, and he didn't want me to say more.</span> <span id="s675">I can imagine he helped them.</span> <span id="s676">He gave maybe food some dressing and they escaped from this place to maybe another place.</span> <span id="s677">I never went more.</span> <span id="s678">I was also afraid that if I go there and there are some prisoners because they said they are from Studtkoff.</span> <span id="s679">It was for me also very dangerous to go there.</span> <span id="s680">So, that I didn't go anymore there.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Only this I knew from Sigmund can be sure everything is okay.</span> <span id="s682">You can be sure don't ask more.</span> <span id="s683">I was wondering a little.</span> <span id="s684">Usually he was a little crazy, not crazy, but so funny and at this moment he was very, very serious and I proceeded very much.</span> <span id="s685">Unfortunately he is also not alive.</span> <span id="s686">I have met him maybe even ten years ago when I was in Torran but no more.</span> <span id="s687">He's also dead.</span> <span id="s688">He's no more alive.</span> <span id="s689">If he were we could go -- I would like to ask him even for this address of my friend as I told you Titlebaum.</span> <span id="s690">I tried to find his address.</span> <span id="s691">I wrote to my friend to ____________ in the South of Poland but for Sigmund I have no chance because he is no more alive.</span> <span id="s692">I'm sure that he helped for them maybe they are still alive, these three prisoners, maybe not.</span> <span id="s693">Maybe when we ask sometimes in the radio, who was hidden in the shed near Torran, maybe we'll find them.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q.</span> <span id="s695">Did you know then what Studtkoff was?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A. Yes, I heard that it was the concentration camp for Jews and Poles.</span> <span id="s697">If something happened in Torran, they were sent immediately to Studtkoff.</span> <span id="s698">I had -- there was very, very bad, very slow time.</span> <span id="s699">Usually the family received the letter, this and this is dead, but we never believed.</span> <span id="s700">It was not dead, probably shot more.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q. Were the Jews of Torran sent to Studtkoff?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A. No, I don't know.</span> <span id="s703">Maybe not all.</span> <span id="s704">In Torran there were not so many, but near of Torran there was Alexandrov and there were many Jews.</span> <span id="s705">Even immediately in the beginning of the war when I didn't work by baker, it was not so far so I went by foot to Alexandrov to buy some bread.</span> <span id="s706">I remember that the Jews had to wear their David stars and they had to go on the street, and probably from Alexandrov they were sent to Studtkoff.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q. And Polish people from Torran, do you know any Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A.</span> <span id="s709">Who were sent?</span> <span id="s710">No.</span> <span id="s711">At the moment I don't know.</span> <span id="s712">I cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q.</span> <span id="s714">But there was talk in Torran what happened in Studtkoff?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A. Oh, yes, yes, you know among the people there was talking of course that the situation was very bad.</span> <span id="s716">The food and the hell, --as all the concentration camps, but exactly as you know, maybe you remember about my life, later then I was arrested and my knowledge about the situation of Polish people, Polish Jews in Torran was broken.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q.</span> <span id="s718">Why were you arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A.</span> <span id="s720">As I told you when I found the address in the __________ in the German newspaper, I wrote secretly the address and then I was fighting with myself whether to write to Willie or not to write.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q. Which address did you find?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A. I find it ___________________.</span> <span id="s723">It was for the soldiers who were sent to the eastern front in Russia, ______________.</span> <span id="s724">A very important address, probably for most all soldiers in the front.</span> <span id="s725">And I wrote a letter in my young German language.</span> <span id="s726">Probably it was you see, my mind it is very difficult to say the whole letter.</span> <span id="s727">It was that I love him.</span> <span id="s728">I'm waiting for him.</span> <span id="s729">I pray for him that he comes back and I never go to the same places.</span> <span id="s730">I didn't mention the shed.</span> <span id="s731">I never go to the same place.</span> <span id="s732">I wait, I hope you will come back as soon and I will be very grateful.</span> <span id="s733">Please give me some news because I am so anxious about you.</span> <span id="s734">I cannot sleep.</span> <span id="s735">I cannot work and at the end, with may kisses your friend Teo.</span> <span id="s736">I wrote.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">And it was a little naive to write especially I put my sender.</span> <span id="s738">Usually I couldn't do that but I was fighting if I send without sender what will happen.</span> <span id="s739">Maybe the letter will not come back.</span> <span id="s740">And if come back I will know that he is not there.</span> <span id="s741">So, I send the letter with my sender.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">(section in bold has been copychecked; get most updated version from Joan.</span> <span id="s743">9/10/96)</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q. And what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A.</span> <span id="s746">After sending I was still waiting.</span> <span id="s747">I was waiting for a reply, but the reply didn't come, never.</span> <span id="s748">Once it was September 19, 1942, I was working morning at this manufacture and the boss called me and told me that I'm invited to the gestapo.</span> <span id="s749">I have to go to the gestapo.</span> <span id="s750">I asked him, me to the gestapo?</span> <span id="s751">What for?</span> <span id="s752">I was so honest.</span> <span id="s753">I do nothing, what for do I have to go.</span> <span id="s754">He said please go there.</span> <span id="s755">We have received the order that you will go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Usually I took a bag with some sandwiches to the work.</span> <span id="s757">My mother prepared me the sandwiches and I left this bag with sandwiches at this manufactory but he said take this with you.</span> <span id="s758">Maybe you don't come back.</span> <span id="s759">Oh, why not?</span> <span id="s760">If I come back I will have nothing.</span> <span id="s761">No, I didn't take, and when I went to the gestapo I remember this uniform, this black uniform with red here on the arm.</span> <span id="s762">He asked me first for the name.</span> <span id="s763">I told him that and then he took a typewrite.</span> <span id="s764">He started to write.</span> <span id="s765">He write I sitting also in front of him when the paper came down.</span> <span id="s766">I read from other side and I never forget the words it was written "_______________" In English it is "Order for prisoner."</span> <span id="s767">The first moment I thought I would fall down, and then he said you will stay now.</span> <span id="s768">What for?</span> <span id="s769">I began to cry.</span> <span id="s770">Don't play _________.</span> <span id="s771">And then he called somebody.</span> <span id="s772">They took me to the cell it was downstairs in the cellar.</span> <span id="s773">To the cell and there was the furnace was only a wooden bed and a toilet and that's all.</span> <span id="s774">Even the door was scraped with wooden so I could put the handle like this.</span> <span id="s775">And I had to wait.</span> <span id="s776">The whole time I was sitting the night and I think what happened.</span> <span id="s777">What for, and the next day when I was called again to him, he showed me the letter.</span> <span id="s778">This letter which I wrote to Willie.</span> <span id="s779">Is this your letter?</span> <span id="s780">I was very honest.</span> <span id="s781">I said of course.</span> <span id="s782">This is my letter.</span> <span id="s783">I wrote this to him.</span> <span id="s784">You, you wrote this letter to a German.</span> <span id="s785">You loved him.</span> <span id="s786">I wrote him it was very good, yes.</span> <span id="s787">Then he said where did you meet him.</span> <span id="s788">He wanted to know exactly where we met at, what we had done, in which way.</span> <span id="s789">We seen only once or twice.</span> <span id="s790">I lied, I tried to lie but you say me and he showed me some pictures, other pictures of soldiers, not only soldiers, civilians.</span> <span id="s791">He wanted to know you cannot remember.</span> <span id="s792">You will remember.</span> <span id="s793">_______________ with trousers to beat especially with the ____________.</span> <span id="s794">It was terrible and I cried.</span> <span id="s795">They put it in my trousers and they beat me when I couldn't breath, I couldn't speak they brought water and poured water on me and began once more again and again.</span> <span id="s796">All over, and always I heard only them, "You pig, you ______________" So many bad words I cannot translate it into English especially in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q.

nothing.</span> <span id="s803">I wanted to drink only water.</span> <span id="s804">Sleep I couldn't also because I was so beaten swollen under my back -- when I was laying only on my stomach.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">And so happened I don't know when, I lost even the dates, maybe about two weeks, everyday the same question.</span> <span id="s806">The last one they gave me something to sign.</span> <span id="s807">I don't know what.</span> <span id="s808">I was so tortured.</span> <span id="s809">For me it was everything I signed only to be free.</span> <span id="s810">_______________, when you tell us the truth you'll be free.</span> <span id="s811">I was so stupid.</span> <span id="s812">I told them also about Hitler, what Willie said, that Hitler is also homosexual.</span> <span id="s813">He wrote this.</span> <span id="s814">Yes, and you the Fuhrer.</span> <span id="s815">It was very, -- now I'm smiling but it was not for smiling.</span> <span id="s816">It was for crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">It happened so after two weeks as I told you I signed this what they wrote.</span> <span id="s818">I don't know.</span> <span id="s819">Then they took me by special closed car.</span> <span id="s820">It was a kind, we call this like a ___________, which means you don't see nothing there, like in prison.</span> <span id="s821">When they brought me I had seen the round prison.</span> <span id="s822">I know because my brother immediately after the war, he was by the Germans also arrested by Germans but for very short time.</span> <span id="s823">Only reason was that he as a boy when he was going to the school -- it was not high school it was for the baker school, when he was going there, he has to train as a soldier, a Polish soldier.</span> <span id="s824">For this reason he was in the same prison.</span> <span id="s825">I never forget how my mother suffered.</span> <span id="s826">Sometimes she give me bread to give him and then I had seen she cried and she said "Oh my dear God it's better you take him."</span> <span id="s827">I had seen how the mother suffered if the son is arrested.</span> <span id="s828">Later when I was arrested I thought also that maybe she suffered also.</span> <span id="s829">He was only one month and she suffered and when I was so long time, but maybe we should go with my story further.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">I was brought to this round prison.</span> <span id="s831">I was put in the cell with six or seven crime prisoners usually.</span> <span id="s832">When they heard because each prisoner had received a special card.</span> <span id="s833">I had received card.</span> <span id="s834">It was written paragraph 175.</span> <span id="s835">I didn't know what this mean paragraph and I showed it to everybody, but there was somebody oh _______________it is for the gays, for the homosexuals.</span> <span id="s836">And since this time I was very bad behaved in this cell.</span> <span id="s837">I was not human.</span> <span id="s838">I couldn't sit at the table when the meal began.</span> <span id="s839">They treated me very, very bad.</span> <span id="s840">And I was sitting there until fifth of December 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">On the fifth of December 1942 somebody opened the door.</span> <span id="s842">The block meister took me to the Judge.</span> <span id="s843">I remember there was only my mother, no people and me and maybe five or six in black dresses.</span> <span id="s844">They were the judges.</span> <span id="s845">There was shouting and cried, I have to be isolated.</span> <span id="s846">I have demoralized the German military, me Pollock and how could I do that.</span> <span id="s847">I must be punished.</span> <span id="s848">I must be punished for long time and I was 17 years old.</span> <span id="s849">They punished me for five years exactly ___________.</span> <span id="s850">I don't know exactly how it's called in German but _____________ is a very hard prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Immediately then I met my mother.</span> <span id="s852">I couldn't speak.</span> <span id="s853">You can imagine how was the feeling my mother and me.</span> <span id="s854">When I came to the cell first I cried.</span> <span id="s855">But later I had to go -- I was sent to Koronovo.</span> <span id="s856">was not far from ______________ maybe 50 or 60 kilometers.</span> <span id="s857">It was the worst prison in Poland before the war and during the war.</span> <span id="s858">Only for Polish and Jewish prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">I will never forget they cut my hair because in Torran I still had my own hair.</span> <span id="s860">They gave me with some maybe yellow -- I don't know, it was here on the arm, and I was sent to the cellar with about 40 prisoners.</span> <span id="s861">There were maybe about five or six Jews together with me and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s862">My memories, especially in this cellar because the oldest of this cell it was a prisoner for a long life, murder and there was a clan.</span> <span id="s863">Around him he had a few prisoners.</span> <span id="s864">They made everything for him what he liked.</span> <span id="s865">We had nothing to say.</span> <span id="s866">We had to be polite what he -- even with the toilet.</span> <span id="s867">The toilet was only morning and then the food, when they delivered the food it was very small, but even if we received one spoon of marmalade, he took from us.</span> <span id="s868">We were given a little margarine, once or twice per week, he took also.</span> <span id="s869">So, that this time this is my worst time in my life.</span> <span id="s870">And then my leg began to be I have received a kind of ________________.</span> <span id="s871">I cannot explain in English.</span> <span id="s872">Due to the reason I had no vitamins.</span> <span id="s873">It was like it was spoiled this leg.</span> <span id="s874">It started from a small wound.</span> <span id="s875">This was this leg.</span> <span id="s876">From this to this here, this place.</span> <span id="s877">Nothing, in those terrible times but of course everywhere is bad times and after bad will come a little better.</span> <span id="s878">Even there, there was so that because our work we were living, we were working in the same cell.</span> <span id="s879">There was very stupid work but very dangerous, very dusty.</span> <span id="s880">We had to the ropes, we could resolve the ropes then we had to make the leather for the new shoes for the front they were sent.</span> <span id="s881">This was the job and once they looked they wanted one ___________.</span> <span id="s882">Oh, I have to explain also here that here we could write the letters once every two or three months home in German language.</span> <span id="s883">Everybody doesn't write German.</span> <span id="s884">Me and especially my good friend, it was the Applebaum, exactly I remember, he wrote also German.</span> <span id="s885">Some of them gave us one potato or two potatoes for the writing.</span> <span id="s886">At the first moment I didn't want to take but Applebaum said yes take it.</span> <span id="s887">It is for them also very helpful when they have the contact with the parents or with family your letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">And so we cooperated very good in this way and once happen that block meister came to our cell and asked the oldest men for somebody who can write and speak German.</span> <span id="s889">First he send someone from his clan but after a few minutes he came back and he said no.</span> <span id="s890">Exactly he said _______________.</span> <span id="s891">Then when he came one more, "You have nobody here?</span> <span id="s892">Among 40 men you have nobody.</span> <span id="s893">I need a writer.</span> <span id="s894">I was standing and I said -- usually I couldn't do that and I think maybe I will be able for him.</span> <span id="s895">I said "Her block meister, I can speak German and I write German too."</span> <span id="s896">He was wondering I was so slim and young, where I could speak English.</span> <span id="s897">And he took me to his room.</span> <span id="s898">He gave me paper pencil and dictated.</span> <span id="s899">He dictated in German.</span> <span id="s900">I remember it was an office, exactly as you like I can do this in German, __________________________.</span> <span id="s901">He looked at this, yes, good.</span> <span id="s902">Go there.</span> <span id="s903">Take your clothes and you'll come here.</span> <span id="s904">I went to the cell and I remember everybody especially those of the clan but my friends, they said, really, he agree.</span> <span id="s905">You are able to take -- he takes you?</span> <span id="s906">Oh that's very good.</span> <span id="s907">Go boy, with his hand and with this you are also good that God helps you.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">When I went there it was a three men cell, much better, near the kitchen.</span> <span id="s909">Sometimes when I had a little more -- I received sometimes cigarettes.</span> <span id="s910">Cigarettes were very good like money for exchange.</span> <span id="s911">Because I didn't smoke -- I never smoked, I could make the exchange for the prisoners in the kitchen for cigarette I received some bread.</span> <span id="s912">Then I had the permit to go to other places.</span> <span id="s913">I belonged to the high society of this prison.</span> <span id="s914">I received better uniform, prison uniform, better warmer.</span> <span id="s915">Even the hair was a little longer than usual.</span> <span id="s916">As the flour sometime one had no water and me I was -- but I never forget about my friend Applebaum.</span> <span id="s917">I went and took with me some bread some food and I went to the cell and I wanted to give him this.</span> <span id="s918">Then I remember, I don't know exactly the name of him, he said since few days there's no more Applebaum.</span> <span id="s919">He patted -- he was in so high depression.</span> <span id="s920">He was ill.</span> <span id="s921">He had diarrhea and it was very, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s922">You know if somebody had this they couldn't stop and suffered.</span> <span id="s923">I suppose he thought that this is the end and he made this.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Of course I left his bread there.</span> <span id="s925">I came -- and that was not all because every week from Koronovo where the transport station to Sauxenhausen.</span> <span id="s926">So always thinking about it was one day I will also be sent there.</span> <span id="s927">Because that was the end of their life.</span> <span id="s928">Who was sent to Sauxenhausen never returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q. Tell us a little bit more about --?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A.</span> <span id="s931">He was older than me.</span> <span id="s932">He was maybe forty, maybe, older than me.</span> <span id="s933">He was black, black hair.</span> <span id="s934">He spoke very good Polish.</span> <span id="s935">He told me that he lived in Lodz, this German city for _____________.</span> <span id="s936">He had family, but he never didn't want to say me what the reason was that he was in Koronovo.</span> <span id="s937">I thought maybe he was arrested before the war.</span> <span id="s938">I don't know, maybe political, I never knew.</span> <span id="s939">Usually later you received a card what was the reason of the prison.</span> <span id="s940">But this we haven't therefore I never knew.</span> <span id="s941">I never heard about this.</span> <span id="s942">His behavior, he said to me, boy don't be worried.</span> <span id="s943">You are very young.</span> <span id="s944">You will succeed.</span> <span id="s945">The war will be not long.</span> <span id="s946">You can be sure.</span> <span id="s947">He should be older because he told me also about first war.</span> <span id="s948">Maybe he knew this before.</span> <span id="s949">He was so sure that -- because I lost my hope.</span> <span id="s950">I thought maybe that Germany -- because always the Germans said Poland is forever forgotten, forever.</span> <span id="s951">And I lost my hope, but he gave me this trust in the prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q. Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A. Of course.</span> <span id="s954">You see I have to state, even in this prison, you knew immediately who was Polish who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s955">The David's star, they had this, this Applebaum.</span> <span id="s956">Therefore we knew, we Polish had only a number or maybe yellow on here, this stripe around.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q.</span> <span id="s958">What was this yellow mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A. I don't know what this yellow means.</span> <span id="s960">It was prisoners, not like pink or no -- the differences of color when I was sent as a writer I received green.</span> <span id="s961">Before I don't know exactly the differences of color.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q.</span> <span id="s963">Did people in the prison know that you were sentenced because of 175?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A. Yes, Applebaum knew.</span> <span id="s965">I told him, before I never hear this word homosexuality.</span> <span id="s966">I told him only that I had something with a man.</span> <span id="s967">I told him also with a German soldier.</span> <span id="s968">He wasn't astonished, only he smile, oh you are a young boy.</span> <span id="s969">It was stupid.</span> <span id="s970">You are still healthy.</span> <span id="s971">But my leg, you see, the war will not be so long.</span> <span id="s972">He told me always in this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q. Were there other prisoners who were imprisoned because they were homosexual?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A.</span> <span id="s975">You see there were of course many, but some of them like the doctor for instance.</span> <span id="s976">He was working as a doctor because we had lazaret.</span> <span id="s977">It was for the very ill people, but there was no medicine, nothing.</span> <span id="s978">But there were some.</span> <span id="s979">When I was in the high position I met also another writer.</span> <span id="s980">I met also someone from theater, not from Torran, from other places.</span> <span id="s981">He was also for the homosexual.</span> <span id="s982">Then because we receive, everybody has a card and there was written for me for instance was written at this time not paragraph 75, only ____________.</span> <span id="s983">I don't know how to translate this into English.</span> <span id="s984">I don't know.</span> <span id="s985">It is like because I have just now this year I received a document thanks to the red cross and I have even with me this document and there was written _________________.</span> <span id="s986">I looked at a dictionary.</span> <span id="s987">It's terrible.</span> <span id="s988">It is in the Polish language, prostitution.</span> <span id="s989">I was not prostitution.</span> <span id="s990">Stupid.</span> <span id="s991">I cannot show this document to anybody.</span> <span id="s992">It was 16 or 17 years prostitution during the war, stupid.</span> <span id="s993">I was so angry for this document I couldn't sleep three days.</span> <span id="s994">I wanted first to write to ______________ because ____________ is a gay national in Berlin.</span> <span id="s995">I wrote them.</span> <span id="s996">I have also the copy and I explained them everything that this documentary is wrong.</span> <span id="s997">Only one is exactly the date that I escaped from the prison in _____________ in the island.</span> <span id="s998">It was the 15th of May 1945.</span> <span id="s999">This is correct, but even there was a question nation, there was written unknown.</span> <span id="s1000">They arrested as a Polish.</span> <span id="s1001">They cried, "You Polish sow."</span> <span id="s1002">And then put "Nation, unknown."</span> <span id="s1003">I was so angry when I received this documentation.</span> <span id="s1004">If you wish I can show you later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q.</span> <span id="s1006">If you go back to the prison, did you have contact with other homosexual prisoners.</span> <span id="s1007">Did you talk about your situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A.</span> <span id="s1009">You mean in the prison?</span> <span id="s1010">No, because I had no experience.</span> <span id="s1011">This was maybe no homosexual.</span> <span id="s1012">I was also as we called this -- I didn't know exactly.</span> <span id="s1013">Later after the war, I knew what it means, homosexual, gay etc. but me I was really very shy boy and I didn't know this.</span> <span id="s1014">I didn't talk about this and nobody asked, so that I never talked about homosexuals in the prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q.</span> <span id="s1016">Did you understand when during the interrogation, in the prison when the guard showed you the pictures of the other men, did you understand why -- what were you supposed to do with those pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A.</span> <span id="s1018">You mean after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q. No, you said in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A.</span> <span id="s1021">In the beginning when I met Willie --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q. No, no when you were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A. I think maybe they wanted to know that I had maybe more soldiers, not only one.</span> <span id="s1024">This was the reason.</span> <span id="s1025">Before they showed me some soldiers and civilians but I hadn't.</span> <span id="s1026">I had only Willie.</span> <span id="s1027">It was true, but they beat me.</span> <span id="s1028">They wanted to know and maybe they should kill me because they didn't believe me.</span> <span id="s1029">But maybe after two weeks they couldn't receive nothing more and they believed and I signed something.</span> <span id="s1030">What, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1031">After the war, especially later when I was a tailor then I tried to find the documents so I wrote to Red Cross, everywhere.</span> <span id="s1032">I wanted to receive my documents.</span> <span id="s1033">See, maybe I will tell you something.</span> <span id="s1034">When I was a tailor and then when I was ill I didn't receive any indemnification for my time for prison.</span> <span id="s1035">Then I think I have to do something, I must write to anybody and to fight for my rights.</span> <span id="s1036">I spent as a boy for nothing so I suffered and my leg was -- my body was burned, and I want to call.</span> <span id="s1037">First I wrote to ask for the indemnification.</span> <span id="s1038">I explained that I was so long time the whole time in the prison for this reason and I would like to receive something, some compensation especially because I had to go early as a tailor.</span> <span id="s1039">I couldn't work.</span> <span id="s1040">I was ill for this reason and I had skin cancer and different illnesses, but I have received a reply very kindly that the money has been sent to Polish government.</span> <span id="s1041">I have to go to them and ask and they have to give me.</span> <span id="s1042">But it was the communist government.</span> <span id="s1043">They will never give money.</span> <span id="s1044">Then I wrote once more that maybe some symbolic one mark only that I will have this satisfaction that he agree with me and I ask you for forgiveness.</span> <span id="s1045">No, I received letter if I try more to write all letters will go to the paperbasket.</span> <span id="s1046">I was so angry.</span> <span id="s1047">Then I write once more.</span> <span id="s1048">I will fight so long I will write to New York to the United Nations.</span> <span id="s1049">I will fight for my rights.</span> <span id="s1050">I black mailed a little because I knew I couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s1051">Then what I have to do, then I find an address in Germany in the parliament there was homosexual bond organization.</span> <span id="s1052">I wrote to them.</span> <span id="s1053">I explained that I was so young.</span> <span id="s1054">I suffered.</span> <span id="s1055">I have paid with my life.</span> <span id="s1056">My mother suffered and my family, and they explained we agree with you.</span> <span id="s1057">We are very sorry, but really what we can do, we can only collect money for you for your research medicine.</span> <span id="s1058">And I said no, I don't think you -- I don't need money.</span> <span id="s1059">I want to receive indemnification.</span> <span id="s1060">You must do something for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Then in Poland there was martial law, you remember and I said oh no, I cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s1062">I must do something, and one day I received a very nice letter from Germany.</span> <span id="s1063">A young writer wrote me a letter and he put this letter in a book about young Jews in Israel.</span> <span id="s1064">He wanted to give me with this book a sample of his writing, how he writes, his style of the book.</span> <span id="s1065">And it was written in this letter that he found it by this organization a homosexual by Mr. _____________, he found my story.</span> <span id="s1066">This story is very good for writing a book, and he asked me whether I agree for this book.</span> <span id="s1067">If yes, he'll help me.</span> <span id="s1068">He put inside 20 marks for the stamps and this was the first money that I receive as indemnification from my stay in the prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Then when I wrote him I agree, I bought used old typewriter and every day because I was not working any more.</span> <span id="s1070">I was retired now according to my illness and I wrote him every day about my beginning from the prison everything that he needed for this book.</span> <span id="s1071">I sent to him, he sent me again, so about six months we wrote.</span> <span id="s1072">He wanted some pictures.</span> <span id="s1073">He wanted to know some details and when this project of this book was finished he came to me, to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1074">I gave him the signature and the book was printed in Germany.</span> <span id="s1075">The reaction of this book was fantastic.</span> <span id="s1076">I never believed, especially the young people.</span> <span id="s1077">They wrote letters and they asked me, maybe I need something.</span> <span id="s1078">They wanted to help me and they were saying -- I suffered only the reason was I love somebody, that I loved a man.</span> <span id="s1079">It was very touching for me.</span> <span id="s1080">Even until now I have contact with some of them, especially one doctor who delivers me always there the medicine and they contact -- they visit me.</span> <span id="s1081">They come to me.</span> <span id="s1082">I stay up to now with very good many friends and the name of this book is "Damned Strong Love" and in German _______________.</span> <span id="s1083">I paid really with my illness and with the memories especially.</span> <span id="s1084">When I was sitting in Torran and I had seen my mother was watching and I couldn't say to her it was sometimes, it was -- for me it is very heavy to remember.</span> <span id="s1085">Sometimes I say I can forgive German, but never forget.</span> <span id="s1086">It is too difficult to forget.</span> <span id="s1087">And thanks also many American soldiers because you see when I escaped in the British zone, I went to Munich because I thought I will go to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1088">I will find Willie.</span> <span id="s1089">I wanted to know what happened with him.</span> <span id="s1090">I wanted to meet him.</span> <span id="s1091">In the beginning it was too difficult.</span> <span id="s1092">My leg was worse and worse.</span> <span id="s1093">I received the displaced, the card, the displaced person card in Munich from the Americans and I was sent immediately to the American hospital.</span> <span id="s1094">I was about two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s1095">I don't know exactly now, but I know that after three weeks I was fit.</span> <span id="s1096">I was so healthy and I was so happy that I was again alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Now, I want to go to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1098">In Vienna there were Russians.</span> <span id="s1099">I couldn't I wanted to go to Poland.</span> <span id="s1100">I couldn't, because everywhere I heard that in Poland there are communists and their situation is not clear.</span> <span id="s1101">What I have to do is sit and wait?</span> <span id="s1102">No, I started to work and I worked by Americans.</span> <span id="s1103">By Americans I learned a little English.</span> <span id="s1104">By American I learned how is their life.</span> <span id="s1105">By American I learned how it is good because I was working in the canteen, I'm asking an officer.</span> <span id="s1106">I'll never forget the nice apples, red, the conflicts and even I remember some words I learned, very
