that I'd like you to tell me about is the experience in liberating a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">IRVING HEYMONT: Actually, I personally had very little to do with liberating camps.</span> <span id="s5">Now first let me say, I don't know of anybody who liberated a camp.</span> <span id="s6">We overran camps.</span> <span id="s7">My regiment overran a sub-camp of Mauthausen called Gunskierken, in Austria.</span> <span id="s8">We overran it because the adjacent regiment failed to keep abreast, and we were ordered to extend our area.</span> <span id="s9">And it was K company, the fifth infantry regiment, that overran Gunskierken.</span> <span id="s10">I visited Gunskierken within a few hours after we had overran and got the report.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">I spend 15 minutes there at the most, and then had to go on with the rest of my duties.</span> <span id="s12">I recall seeing the emaciated people, and about, later I learned that we figured it was about 2000 dead, and above all you can never forget the odor.</span> <span id="s13">I had nothing with me, but I did offer someone some cigarettes, which was all I had.</span> <span id="s14">I was told later, I didn't see it myself, that some of the people who were given cigarettes, tended to start to eat them.</span> <span id="s15">At that time, I was a regimental operations officer and had to continue on.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">SWB: Did the people react to you at all there?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">IRVING HEYMONT: I'm really no judge.</span> <span id="s18">I was under so qu- so short a time, that I'm- anything I say would really be any witness at all.</span> <span id="s19">My reg- my division did put out a pamphlet describing in greater detail what was found and had</span></p> <p><span id="s20">photographs in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">SWB: You gave someone a pack of cigarettes, do you remember Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span id="s23">2/9/95 Int.</span> <span id="s24">IRVING HEYMONT Page 2 anything about his reaction to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">IRVING HEYMONT: Not really.</span> <span id="s26">I remember he was severely emaciated.</span> <span id="s27">He wore what looked like the striped uniform, and incidentally, may I add a note about that.</span> <span id="s28">A few days earlier, we ran into, about two or three, no it was two men, in striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s29">Dazed, glazed look in their eyes, wandering down the road.</span> <span id="s30">My regimental commander turned to me and said, Hey Irv, we better round up these prisoners and slap them back into jail.</span> <span id="s31">We had no idea what they represented at the time.</span> <span id="s32">At no time was, were we ever told, out yonder there's a concentration camp, try to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Prisoner of war camps, yes.</span> <span id="s34">Uh, I conducted a very unscientific, completely statistically poor survey, and I have yet to find an American soldier, who was at division level or lower who wo- could claim that, they knew where a concentration camp was and they were told to get it.</span> <span id="s35">We stumbled on them.</span> <span id="s36">I'm sorry to say it, but that's the best as I recollect, and I haven't forgotten much about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">SWB: Now can you describe when and how it was you came to be sent to Landsberg and what Landsberg was.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">IRVING HEYMONT: My regimental commander and I were ordered to Paris to testify at a board proceeding, and then authorized to take leave.</span> <span id="s39">This was early September 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">At this time I was, I had been uh, had a new assignment, I was commanding the second battalion of the fifth infantry regiment, 71st division.</span> <span id="s41">When I arrived back, to make a long story short, I found that in my absence, my battalion had been moved to Landsberg, and I arrived there in the middle of the night, or I should say early hours of the morning.</span> <span id="s42">The next morning, my first attempt was to find out Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span id="s44">2/9/95 Int.</span> <span id="s45">IRVING HEYMONT Page 3 where all the elements of the battalion were and what had happened.</span> <span id="s46">When I left, the battalion was in Augsberg, and now we're in Landsberg.</span> <span id="s47">And uh, shortly after breakfast, uh, General Ralph, Anslau Ralph, the assistant division commander arrived, and told me about this DP camp.</span> <span id="s48">And uh, he said let's go look.</span> <span id="s49">And off we went.</span> <span id="s50">And there I first found out what it was like.</span> <span id="s51">What, what it was.</span> <span id="s52">And it was a shock.</span> <span id="s53">Shall I continue?</span> <span id="s54">The camp was in the German Kacerne.</span> <span id="s55">The kacerne is a German military post, a peacetime station.</span> <span id="s56">It was called the Sauerboer kacerne, last occupied by some German artillery unit.</span> <span id="s57">The camp, I was told, was about 80 percent, the other 20 percent a mixture of primarily people from Baltic countries, and a small number of Poles.</span> <span id="s58">The camp, I was told, we took over exactly as it had been, with a unit of the 80th division that we had relieved.</span> <span id="s59">To my utter consternation, I found there were American soldiers on guard at the entrance, the purpose to keep people in the camp from going out.</span> <span id="s60">Unless they had a pass.</span> <span id="s61">The camp walls were surrounded, was topped with barbed wire.</span> <span id="s62">People are milling around, seemingly aimless, the streets were littered with the debris of the German artillery units, the camp itself was filthy beyond description.</span> <span id="s63">The room, the halls, the buildings, and these were all pretty modern barrack buildings, reeked of the odor of urine, you could see where people had defecated behind stairwells.</span> <span id="s64">It was one unholy mess.</span> <span id="s65">Shall I continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">People were living in what in the American army terminology, would be squadrons, designed for 20, 30 men.</span> <span id="s67">Uh, they had started, obvious to me, tried to make inhabitable family quarters.</span> <span id="s68">They did that my hanging blankets, using cardboards from large packing cases, some wooden closets to wall off little cubicles.</span> <span id="s69">And also it was quite obvious that they were all trying to cook, have meals there, they Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for

id="s73">As I soon found out, the uh, everything compounded problems.</span> <span id="s74">The uh, cooking over the, in the rooms, and then having to wash dishes in the sinks, clogged up the toilet, the plumbing system, and a lack of toilet paper, the use of newspaper clogged that up and it was not designed to hold the number of people who were there.</span> <span id="s75">Uh, initially we estimated there were about 4000 people in the camp.</span> <span id="s76">At no time did we ever really know the population.</span> <span id="s77">Except it was always overcrowded.</span> <span id="s78">And there was always a struggle to get the numbers down so we would not have to, as we later on, to force people to move to other camps.</span> <span id="s79">Uh forcing people to move, a transport, had terrific connotations.</span> <span id="s80">Yet at the same time, they didn't want to lower it because that determined how many rations they had.</span> <span id="s81">At the end I came to the conclusion that during the period I was there, till the end of 1945, the population varied from four to seven thousand.</span> <span id="s82">Uh, I was shocked at the first sight.</span> <span id="s83">It was incredible.</span> <span id="s84">Should I continue or am I boring you.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">SWB: IRVING HEYMONT: What was even more incredible were the orders I got from General Rolf.</span> <span id="s86">Uh, he took me to his side and said, look.</span> <span id="s87">You will not take orders from your regimental commander about the camp.</span> <span id="s88">You will take orders direct from division through me, which is a rather untenable position.</span> <span id="s89">And he said don't worry about your battalion, let them take care of themselves.</span> <span id="s90">You worry about this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Your job is to get this camp cleaned up, without incurring any adverse publicity.</span> <span id="s92">If you get any adverse pub-publicity for the U.S. Army career goodbye.</span> <span id="s93">I was a regular army officer.</span> <span id="s94">Uh, needless to say, I was not particularly Working transcript: not spell

orders.</span> <span id="s98">I recognized a number of things right off.</span> <span id="s99">First, of all the problems of the camp, one of the things would, would be simplified if we only had one kind of person in the camp.</span> <span id="s100">So I requested that all non-Jews be moved elsewhere, and make the camp an all-Jewish DP camp.</span> <span id="s101">To my great surprise, that was very quickly done.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">It wasn't until months later that I learned that General Eisenhower had issued orders that all the Jews should be in all-Jewish DP camps.</span> <span id="s103">I was rather surprised when I heard that, I, my ego was shattered, I thought I'd had a lot of influence.</span> <span id="s104">The uh, but I was also surprised that no one had ever told me that.</span> <span id="s105">Another thing I did, uh, after I, forgive me if I ramble...</span></p> <p><span id="s106">SWB: Let's just go back to one thing.</span> <span id="s107">Why was it a problem to have Jews and non-Jews together, explain this to me, I</span></p> <p><span id="s108">don't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">IRVING HEYMONT: The, for one thing there was a matter of Kosher food for some of the Jews.</span> <span id="s110">Secondly, there was enmity within the group, within the population.</span> <span id="s111">The Jews considered the Baltics, peo- uh the, not really victims of the Holocaust, that many of them had come to Germany volun tarily to work.</span> <span id="s112">And uh, that they had not suffered the way the Jews had.</span> <span id="s113">The Poles were very few.</span> <span id="s114">Also, the motivation of the two groups were totally different.</span> <span id="s115">And uh, I- particularly if the orders were, my orders were not to get any adverse, incur any adverse publicity.</span> <span id="s116">I felt it would be simpler if I dealt with only one kind of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">The uh, I soon realized that the camp, the Jews had an internal camp organization.</span> <span id="s118">Despite their despair, I-I-I'm rambling now, I find it hard to put it all cohesively.</span> <span id="s119">They had done some remarkable things which didn't appear on the Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span

fairly popularly accepted by the others.</span> <span id="s125">And these were a remarkable group of men.</span> <span id="s126">They had organized a sort of a camp structure.</span> <span id="s127">They had set up a</span></p> <p><span id="s128">camp hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">SWB: Let's stop, we have to reload...</span></p> <p><span id="s130">[CAMERA RELOAD]</span></p> <p><span id="s131">[CR#2] IRVING HEYMONT: It's interesting, for a moment, to tell you the origin of the camp.</span> <span id="s132">It was started as an emergency means to care, to house and care for the survivors of the eleven little sub-camps of Dachau that were centered around Landsberg Khelfring.</span> <span id="s133">These camps had a total population of about 30,000, 99 percent Jews, most of them from Hungary, some brought in from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s134">It was a crash project to build two underground factories, to assemble the German jets that had been bombed out of the original plan Augsborg.</span> <span id="s135">On that note, it was a work to death camp.</span> <span id="s136">Not an extermination camp, but a work to death camp.</span> <span id="s137">About half of the thirty thousand died, and are buried in a number of cemeteries around there.</span> <span id="s138">So they used this Kacerne, this German army post in town, to house them.</span> <span id="s139">And they, population was increased by survivors who drifted in from all over the countryside and other camps.</span> <span id="s140">The Jews who formed about 80 percent of the camp when I arrived, had organized themselves into a city within a city.</span> <span id="s141">There was a self-designated camp committee consisting of some of the most brilliant men I've ever met.</span> <span id="s142">Most of them were Jews from Baltic countries, from Latvia-Lithuania.</span> <span id="s143">And they had Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span id="s145">2/9/95 Int.</span> <span id="s146">IRVING HEYMONT Page 7 organized a structure, they had a police department of their own, internally.</span> <span id="s147">And above all, they organized a school system.</span> <span id="s148">They set up a hospital where they were training nurses.</span> <span id="s149">The school system was really, the driving force was a fantastic individual, Dr. Jake Wallaisky, a trained agronomist who had worked for ORT, the Jewish Organization for Rehabilitation and for Training, in Europe.</span> <span id="s150">And he had practically set up a people's university.</span> <span id="s151">His driving thing was you had to learn how to work to survive when freedom came.</span> <span id="s152">The leadership strongly resented being wards of the</span></p> <p><span id="s153">U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s154">And uh, they kept after me, wanting to have what they called, uh, responsibility for the camp.</span> <span id="s155">And I kept telling them, when they showed me that they couldn't[?]</span> <span id="s156">have the camp cleaned up, take care of it, they can have their authority.</span> <span id="s157">I wonder what they often thought, here are these men, after what they had been through, many of them had responsible jobs, listening to a 27-year old army officer telling them they can't have responsibility for themselves until they maintained certain degrees of sanitation.</span> <span id="s158">And uh, every problem that we had in regard to sanitation, they always came back with a stock answer.</span> <span id="s159">If it's that important to you, move us out of Germany, and that will solve your sanitation problem.</span> <span id="s160">Of course, nothing I could do.</span> <span id="s161">But, in dealing with them, with the camp committee, I was also under a different pressure.</span> <span id="s162">General Rolf told me that at the first possible opportunity, I should hold a democratic election for a new camp committee.</span> <span id="s163">The reason for it became obvious to me.</span> <span id="s164">The army did not want to be accused of setting up people to run the camp and not giving the people of the camp their own choice.</span> <span id="s165">Compounded with that, I-I might say r- at this point, I was not the only one there.</span> <span id="s166">There was an UNRHA team, and an American joint distribution committee, American joint Jewish distribution Working transcript: not spell checked or

arrived about a month before I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">And they were very helpful.</span> <span id="s171">They really did the pick and shovel work.</span> <span id="s172">And uh, I asked General Rolf, and he send my request, they rounded up all the Jewish soldiers in the division who could speak Yiddish or German, to report to be attached to my battalion to work in the camp to assist the uh, UNRHA and the AJDC team.</span> <span id="s173">The head of the UNRHA team was a very nice chap, but unfortunately he spoke, did not sp-, was not Jewish, did not speak German, and couldn't communicate with the people of the camp.</span> <span id="s174">I asked that he be replaced by somebody who could speak German or Yiddish and preferably who can commune with the people.</span> <span id="s175">They sent a Dr.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Abraham Glassgold, who was Jewish and had experience, and who was an incredibly wonderful man.</span> <span id="s177">He was the right man for the right job.</span> <span id="s178">Well anyway, the uh, I figured that I had to get some way to get to the camp people other than through the camp committee, because I didn't know what they were saying.</span> <span id="s179">So I thought, one way to do it, I had to establish myself.</span> <span id="s180">So I asked them to assemble a meeting of everyone in the camp, at which I spoke.</span> <span id="s181">And uh, I remember the AJDC team, Rabbi Rosenberg translated for me.</span> <span id="s182">And my pitch was very simple.</span> <span id="s183">That you were, who suffered all this, were liberated.</span> <span id="s184">You can't die of disease now, a real stirring speech.</span> <span id="s185">And I ended up by saying, I'm going to abolish the American army guards at the gate, they will be there, but not to keep you in, but to keep unauthorized Germans out.</span> <span id="s186">You're free to go out anytime you want.</span> <span id="s187">The pass system is abolished, and I want you, yourselves, to take down the barbed wire around the camp, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, great joy.</span> <span id="s188">What I did not know, until many months later, that General Eisenhower had issued orders that the pass system, the restriction on Jews, DP's, leaving the camp would cease immediately.</span> <span id="s189">No one had ever told me of that.</span></p> <p><span

that been done.</span> <span id="s197">I cannot answer that question definitively.</span> <span id="s198">I can only guess, and I can only repeat things that were told to me, and I don't think it's germane right now.</span> <span id="s199">The uh, I felt one way to reach the camp population was for the camp to have a newspaper.</span> <span id="s200">But at that time, all newspapers were illegal.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">And I knew, I was smart enough not to ask whether I can have the people publish a camp newspaper.</span> <span id="s202">If I did that, they might say no.</span> <span id="s203">So I spoke to Dr. Glassgold, and I said, why don't you sponsor the newspaper, allegedly.</span> <span id="s204">It will be under your auspices.</span> <span id="s205">And I told the camp committee they can start a newspaper, I would not censor it, Mr. Craddock would not censor it, but I'm sure they would not give us any grounds to regret that.</span> <span id="s206">And they didn't.</span> <span id="s207">And they started the Landsberg Zeitung.</span> <span id="s208">And immediately they requested of me, could I find some Hebrew print for them.</span> <span id="s209">Well my battalion supply officer was a very wonderful young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Very full of initiative, meaning he could steal anything in sight that he thought we would use.</span> <span id="s211">Well he scoured the countryside and found only one set of Hebrew print in Munich, and that had been pre-empted by an organization of the uh, organization of the Jewish liberated political prisoners.</span> <span id="s212">So they published their newspaper in Yiddish, but using Roman characters.</span> <span id="s213">So Zeitung came out</span></p> <p><span id="s214">C-A-J-T-U-N-G.</span> <span id="s215">How they got it printed, I don't know, I didn't ask, there are a thousand and one things that went on in the camp I had no knowledge and didn't have the

schools.</span> <span id="s224">And I, one of them, several of them, took me out to the site of one of the underground factories that they built.</span> <span id="s225">And it was a fantastic thing.</span> <span id="s226">We went in underground and you could look up and see the undercarriage of railroad cars.</span> <span id="s227">Tremendous presses and power equipment, and there we were scrounging for screwdrivers, files, hammers, little vices.</span> <span id="s228">I don't know, it just struck me as weird.</span> <span id="s229">I visited that site again, in 1991.</span> <span

id="s270">What the DP's wanted, and what the army wanted.</span> <span id="s271">Ah, simply, the army wanted, would be very happy, if the Jewish DP's were content to live in camps, like soldiers in garrison at peacetime, and would be clean, neat, and orderly, and not cause any difficulties.</span> <span id="s272">The DP's had tremendous differences among themselves.</span> <span id="s273">Uh, there even were some Jewish DP's who couldn't talk to the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">These were the Greeks and Greek Jews, who didn't even speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s275">But they had a different set of motivations.</span> <span id="s276">The first and primary motivation was to find survivors, members of the family.</span> <span id="s277">And the ends they went to were incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">They traveled all over the face of Europe, looking for survivors.</span> <span id="s279">I was told that the post office was a cemetery in their home town, that people would leave notes on tombstones.</span> <span id="s280">The other great motivation was to try to restore, wherever possible, some semblance of family life.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">That's why they cooked together.</span> <span id="s282">That's why they try to break these barracks, rooms, into somewhat private rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">And above all, despite their internal differences, they were all united on one thing, to get out of Germany, at the first and quickest possible time.</span> <span id="s284">The army saw these, I'm speaking in broad general terms.</span> <span id="s285">Uh, here were people who were not neat, clean, orderly, and docile.</span> <span id="s286">And above all, were suspected of being prime movers in a black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">That was a terrible bugaboo, the black market.</span> <span id="s288">The black market was any transaction that wasn't according to the unreasonable regulations.</span> <span id="s289">The standing joke was, among the Americans, if everybody in Germany, at least in the American zone, who was black marketing was put into jail, there'd be nobody left to guard them.</span> <span id="s290">There was no question that the Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span id="s292">2/9/95 Int.</span> <span id="s293">IRVING HEYMONT Page 13 DP's, just like the native, the local Germans, were also black-marketing.</span> <span id="s294">Swapping to get cigarettes, in turn, swapped for something else.</span> <span id="s295">There were a few really big black marketers.</span> <span id="s296">I met some of them.</span> <span id="s297">Their goal was to amass something and, diamonds, jewelry were the goal, that are easily transportable, easily hidden, and equ- of equal value, and of value no matter where you are.</span> <span id="s298">And that way they would have a stake to start all over.</span> <span id="s299">The head of the local military government, a Major Ryan, now deceased, of German descent, was, thought that all the black marketers had their origin in the Landsberg DP camp.</span> <span id="s300">And they would take off, looking for survivors, carrying army blankets with them.</span> <span id="s301">The only kind they had.</span> <span id="s302">Ah, it was getting cold.</span> <span id="s303">He felt they were taking the army blankets were going to sell them, so he slapped them into jail for black marketers and I would have to fight with him and try to get them out.</span> <span id="s304">It reached a point finally where the feud between the two of us got to be so great that it was resolved by my battalion being moved, wholesale, in exchange for another battalion in the regiment, and he got transferred to another town.</span> <span id="s305">They couldn't remove me, they didn't want to remove me individ ually cause that would have caused problems which we won't go into.</span> <span id="s306">So those different perceptions, the problem of sanitation, which was a bugaboo to all our visiting generals, and the army we're always big on, everything has to be neat and clean and orderly.</span> <span id="s307">All the debris strewn around on the streets, left over by the Germans, uh, the people at camp told me when I spoke to them about cleaning it up, they said, why should we, we didn't leave it.</span> <span id="s308">If you don't like it, get the Germans to clean it up.</span> <span id="s309">They absolutely refused to.</span> <span id="s310">I finally got it cleaned up by slightly illegal, I struck a deal with some friend of mine who was running a POW cage at Dachau.</span>

coming, and it was a problem of how do you heat the camp.</span> <span id="s316">And I was told that they had made wonderful arrangements.</span> <span id="s317">They had arranged with the local German government for the forrestmeister, the forestry man, to set aside German woods where the camp people would cut the wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">And they made arrangements for a local agricultural inst- equipment factory in Landsberg, still there, still operating, would manufacture pot-bellied stoves.</span> <span id="s319">When I asked how do I get the wood cut, with what, and then how do I transport it from the woods into the camp.</span> <span id="s320">I was only authorized two two two and a half ton trucks.</span> <span id="s321">I was told, use local initiative.</span> <span id="s322">Meaning, we don't know the answer but you go solve it.</span> <span id="s323">Well we solved it.</span> <span id="s324">By a number of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Then after a while, the people of the camp, we got them to go out to cut wood, the young people by telling them all sorts of lies about how they were going to learn how to use power saws, which they'll use in Palestine, God knows if they had trees there or not, and uh we promised them an extra reward of cigarettes, which we got out of the Red Cross packages for prisoners of war, which we had quite a bit.</span> <span id="s326">And it worked for a while, and then they started to complain.</span> <span id="s327">It was wet out there, they didn't have adequate clothing, and they made a very unusual statement.</span> <span id="s328">They said, you know, considering what the Germans did, burning us, the least we can expect the Germans to do is to supply things for us to burn to keep warm.</span> <span id="s329">Is that unreasonable?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">I couldn't answer.</span> <span id="s331">Finally, given the uh, time limit, I arranged for to get SS prisoners, we had an SS cage.</span> <span id="s332">By this time all the Verrmachter had been discharged, up near Bubliegen, run by F company I think it was.</span> <span id="s333">But, I can only have access to them on a

<span id="s339">And in turn, we had to feed them a noon meal.</span> <span id="s340">And uh, to feed them the noon meal, we brought them into the camp.</span> <span id="s341">And they claimed the people of the camp were insulting them.</span> <span id="s342">And we told them, that's too bad.</span> <span id="s343">If you don't want to put up with it, you stay out in the woods, we can't bring the food to you, but you can stay out in the woods without food.</span> <span id="s344">Solved that problem.</span> <span id="s345">We were always faced with all these, each one of them nothing earth-shaking, but very meddlesome[?]</span> <span id="s346">and bothersome.</span> <span id="s347">The other problem was the housing situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">The camp was getting to be intolerably crowded.</span> <span id="s349">We got access to a new camp called Wolfhartshausen, which had been in a big German munitions factory and had a lot of small houses, suitable, wonderful, for families.</span> <span id="s350">And uh, we wanted to move them there to relieve the crowding.</span> <span id="s351">I ran trucks down, with the people of the camp, go see for yourself that we're not fooling them.</span> <span id="s352">Took all the camp leaders down.</span> <span id="s353">Nobody wanted to move, very few.</span> <span id="s354">The idea of a transport had memories for them they couldn't shake.</span> <span id="s355">And besides, they claimed, Lansdberg was now a city, a community, they had schools, they formed friendships, associations, they didn't want to move.</span> <span id="s356">Meanwhile, more and more Jewish Jews were coming in from East Europe, and uh, again it was a problem.</span> <span id="s357">The overcrowding and yet you can't, where you didn't want to force people to go we knew that would lead to very undesirable circumstances.</span> <span id="s358">Finally I was told, practically with no notice, that an engineering brigade would be moved out of Landsberg and the village turned over to the camp and I could requisition a certain number of German houses.</span> <span id="s359">And there I made a horrible mistake.</span> <span id="s360">Instead of getting the Germans to move the Germans out of the houses, we did it ourselves.</span> <span id="s361">And the people of Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for

Germans being moved out, they way they had been moved out.</span> <span id="s365">And uh, we had told the Germans they can take anything that could be moved.</span> <span id="s366">And they started to take their furniture and some of the people of the camp said no, that's not right, they're taking more than we were allowed to take and they started to stop, fights broke out, and it was a near riot.</span> <span id="s367">Well, I called out the troops, separated them, closed the camp, moved all the Jews back into the camp, and I realized that was a mistake the way I handled it.</span> <span id="s368">Fortunately I've never had another occasion to redo it again so I could do it properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">The, that housing problem, was really very, in many respects very touching.</span> <span id="s370">I remember one woman came to me once, with her little son, she stopped me in the camp.</span> <span id="s371">I was always being stopped and asked things.</span> <span

told me that she had lost her husband, and I forget how many, fantastic number of family members, and she and her little son were the only survivors.</span> <span id="s376">And she doesn't want to punish any Germans, all she wanted was a little apartment where she and her son could live and not in one of the rooms in the barracks.</span> <span id="s377">And would I please take care of it and have it made available to her, and was she asking too much, in consideration of what the Germans had to done to her.</span> <span id="s378">It was one of the things that I had to let go.</span></p>

id="s382">IRVING HEYMONT Page 17 The uh, another thing that was very interesting, was my relation with the Germans.</span> <span id="s383">Everybody in Landsberg and vicinity knew me, who I was.</span> <span id="s384">And I don't think anybody loved me.</span> <span id="s385">Every time I'd drive through the town, I can see people silently stare at me.</span> <span id="s386">And uh, I would used to go to one barber shop to get my hair cut.</span> <span id="s387">My driver, who was a very loyal soul, would come in and he would sit watching the barber cut my hair, with his carbine in his lap.</span> <span id="s388">One time, we were driving through Landsberg and some kid threw a rock at me, in the Jeep.</span> <span id="s389">We could go faster in the Jeep than he could run.</span> <span id="s390">And I caught him, and a lot of people saw me.</span> <span id="s391">I grabbed him, and put him right in the back of the Jeep and held on to him, took him into the camp, and I called the local military government, turned him over to them, the police came and got him.</span> <span id="s392">Uh, I was told later that he was turned back to his parents and told, if anything like that happened again, it was a young kid, I'd say he must have been about ten or eleven, I'm guessing.</span> <span id="s393">They would be punished.</span> <span id="s394">I was subsequently told, of course I can't prove it, that the police had to return to the house later to keep the parents from beating so severely.</span> <span id="s395">The uh, I mentioned about the riot, I should add, the next day I got calls from all the army units in the area, what was going on.</span> <span id="s396">All those German civilian employees were staying home.</span> <span id="s397">The rumor was that the uh, I had set one day aside for all the Jewish DP's to pillage and loot, and they had all gone home to protect their selves.</span> <span id="s398">We were also, another thing that contributed to my infamy, is that we were ordered for a knock-down, house-to-house, room-by-room search for hidden weapons, from high headquarters.</span> <span id="s399">I thought it was the most ridiculous thing.</span> <span id="s400">We did do it, I think we collected up some spears from the time when the Germans were in Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">But, I had a note made, in

possible.</span> <span id="s408">Finally, we figured it was time to hold the election.</span> <span id="s409">And it involved extensive negotiations with the camp committee on how to conduct the election.</span> <span id="s410">Uh, their idea was that they run, we decided on what the structure of the camp administration would be, what would be elected, that there would be slates.</span> <span id="s411">And uh the percentage of the number of officers would be apportioned as to the way, how many, how well the slate did, same as the European system, the system that's used in Israel now.</span> <span id="s412">And of couse, I violently objected.</span> <span id="s413">I said absolutely not, we're going to do it American style.</span> <span id="s414">You vote for a candidate, and the one who gets the most votes wins.</span> <span id="s415">And the men of the battalion really thought that was a wonderful thing to do, and they all pitched in as best as they remember how you construct a ballot, ballot boxes, polling booths, ballots, watchers, and so forth.</span> <span id="s416">What amazed me was, they very, there were three principal parties formed.</span></p> <p><span

contributed was a lack of toilet paper.</span> <span id="s434">The uh, well really, let me cover that briefly, then I'd like to go back into the mess hall deal.</span> <span id="s435">And uh, the local burgermeister, and the local military government told me that toilet paper in Germany was at a premium.</span> <span id="s436">But I figure somewhere in this great American U.S. army, if you look around, somewhere, you'll find whatever it is you need.</span> <span id="s437">And the big supply depot was up in the Antwerp area.</span> <span id="s438">So I told my supply officer, you take a truck, a two-and-a half ton truck, ten and a half trailer, and you get up there and somewhere there's a warehouse full of toilet paper, I'm sure of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">And you come back with a truck and trailer load full.</span> <span id="s440">And if anybody catches you in the act, you tell them I sent you, you know from nothing, you're merely doing what I, you were told.</span> <span id="s441">He came back.</span> <span id="s442">Sure enough, he found a warehouse full of toilet paper, I don't know how he did it, but he came back with a full load.</span> <span id="s443">And I

the camp themselves.</span> <span id="s499">And they started all this before the UNRHA team, before the AJDC team.</span> <span id="s500">An interesting things was, uh, we were always plagued by all our German employees.</span> <span id="s501">Can we spare some condoms.</span> <span id="s502">And God we had lots and lots of condoms.</span> <span id="s503">Got to the point during the actual fighting that you wouldn't send a patrol out unless they had a condoms and a pro kit with them.</span> <span id="s504">But anyway, nobody in the camp ever asked me for condoms.</span> <span

to do something about it.</span> <span id="s507">Nobody wants a condom, we want children, we have to make up for the six million.</span> <span id="s508">We had visitors all the time.</span> <span id="s509">I'm not talking about all the generals.</span> <span id="s510">And they always arranged to come when it was time to have a noon meal.</span> <span id="s511">Because we had an excellent mess, and I suspected they sometimes came to get a real good meal, and to find ways to tell me things I should do, and didn't have time to do or didn't want to do.</span> <span id="s512">But anyway we got

well.</span> <span id="s521">Another visitor that I had was Rabbi Abraham Klausner.</span> <span id="s522">Now there is a most unusual man.</span> <span id="s523">Uh, in my opinion, never has one man done so much good yet managed to irritate so many people as well.</span> <span id="s524">He visited me twice.</span> <span id="s525">Once he came when Mr. Ben Gurion came and I had nothing to do with him.</span> <span id="s526">He came another time and I admit, I must admit looking back now, that I was, that my view was based on a regular army officer, who was very conscious, of a Jew being in the regular army, and anything that reflected on one Jew, reflected on all.</span> <span id="s527">And he came in the most outlandish uniform.</span> <span id="s528">Completely out of uniform.</span> <span id="s529">I found out later on that in my opinion, in effect, he had gone absent without leave from his unit.</span> <span id="s530">I'm not denying in any manner all the wonderful fantastic things that that man did to help the DP's.</span> <span id="s531">But he made a request of me that was illegal, and got me very enraged, and I said if you, if that's the best way you could look, and that's all you can ask me for, don't ever show up here again or I'm gonna punch you in the nose.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Uh, I wrote this in a letter to my wife, which was published in the uh, reproduced in the book put out by the American Jewish archives, and uh, Rabbi Klausner read it, and he and I carried on a very short correspondence, and what he said I think is worthy is repeating.</span> <span id="s533">After this business about punching him in the nose, all that, he said obviously, what he was trying to do was to save the Jews of Europe by bringing them out into the American zone of Germany, from behind the East Europe.</span> <span id="s534">And my goal, apparently, was to try to make him more comfortable.</span> <span id="s535">Looking back, he was

group that caused us a lot of trouble were the truck drivers.</span> <span id="s571">To be able to drive a truck was a uh very valuable skill, and uh, many of them were able to survive in the concentration camps because of skills.</span> <span id="s572">And uh some of the more enterprising souls managed to survive, and they knew how to maneuver.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">They caused us quite a bit of trouble.</span> <span id="s574">They caused uh, once or twice there was a near strike.</span> <span id="s575">The uh, there was that incident, I'll never forget, the illegal restaurant.</span> <span id="s576">I was told they found a restaurant up in the attic of one of the barracks run by one of the men of the camp, they even hired some German waitresses.</span> <span id="s577">And of course the camp police broke it up, and the man was in the camp jail.</span> <span id="s578">I suppose I should have inquired how do they do it, how do they manage to get away with it, but I just didn't.</span> <span id="s579">And I remember the next day I asked, what happened to the man you put in jail.</span> <span id="s580">They said, oh he died of a heart attack.</span>

<span id="s622">The camp organization was stronger because it was a self, a democratically elected camp committee, no differences.</span> <span id="s623">And the people of the camp had developed their schools, their institutions, a cultural and social program, whether that, whether I was the c-, contributing to it or not, I don't know.</span> <span id="s624">They may well have done that even if I had never been there.</span> <span id="s625">But in retrospect, I know it was better than when I arrived.</span> <span id="s626">It may have been passage of time, it may have been some of my
