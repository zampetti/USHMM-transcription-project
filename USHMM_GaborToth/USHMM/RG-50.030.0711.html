[MUMBLES] ...a lot of skilled labour, I got drafted into the 50th div.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">[DL] And where were they deployed?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">[BB] Well, as far as I was concerned, I, at Darlington, we moved, so, about 16 miles I think it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">[DL] And from Darlington, where, where were you sent from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">[00:05:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s60">[BB] Well, well, from Darlington, we moved down to erm, Oxfordshire, where we did er war training, and when in, in the case of myself, was driving and that, cause er, the 50th div was going, were going to be the division that, when er, when all the other troops were in the trenches, the 50th div was in the background, if there was a gap anywhere, we’d rush round with our cars and fill it in, which of course didn’t happen, but erm, that’s where, I learnt to drive, and then in er, January, erm, January 40, we’d been there, two, two or three months I suppose, and we went to erm, we went to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">[DL] And what happened in, in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">[BB] Well we was, we was stationed in the, one of the local town halls for a while, and then they started erm, moving some of us up the (mumbles), then we gradually crept up the country, wise, stage by stage, until we reached um, a suburb of Lyon.</span> <span id="s63">Then, er, I mean, nothing, er, nothing much happened then, I can’t remember actually, we actually moved up into Belgium and er, we weren’t up there long, we came back, and we spend most of our time in blooming Greece.</span> <span id="s64">And then, er, they moved us back again, and er, May the 26th I think it was in 1940, the, erm, the order came beyond, that all surplus personnel to head for the, to head for Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s65">And er that’s what they did, all the electricians and things like that, but er anyway... I stayed and from there I moved up into a place called Abbey Kirk, into Belgium for a few days, and then they said, erm, about six days I suppose it was, and er, they told me erm I could go home as well.</span> <span id="s66">So we had to walk down to the er, the beach, and er there wasn’t a soul anywhere, then, and all we got when we got the was some blokes living in the, in the sand dunes waiting for a boat to come in, and they erm, and after that all we got was stratling from the Germans, going all the way up and down the beach – stratling.</span> <span id="s67">And er, I had um, er, erm, er, a left-hand quarter master, and he said er there’s no good staying here he said, there’s no boats they don’t look like they’re coming, and they just walked down into Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s68">So I said right, there was about eight of us, trundling after him and er, [MUMBLES] I never noticed anyone got injured or anything, but by the time we got down to the road, the road just outside Dunkirk, there was only me and another fella I didn’t know left, and I don’t know why, but I had blood all over my shirt as well, but where I got that from I don’t know but it wasn’t mine.</span> <span id="s69">And then, so we walked down into Dunkirk, initially towards the mall, the mall, er you know stretching out to the sea, and there was I think about three breaks in the mall, and we thought of course that’s been hit, it, and as we got nearer there was not boats along there either, and so, er, the chap with me said let’s walk on further past the, there, and we’ll see if we can erm, get a boat, somewhere in the fishing area, or something like that.</span> <span id="s70">So I said “okay”, but as we got near to the bottom of the...a big boy shouted out “Ay, you two, come here”, and we walked down to some naval officer, wanted us, and when we walked over where he was, was all got stretchers, with wounded on them, and he said “pick up one and take it up to the boat.”</span> <span id="s71">And I said right, so, I couldn’t very well argue with him so I thought don’t know where the boat is, unless they, it’s going to come in later, so we’d, we went up there and of course we had to lift it over these gaps, they’d put gangplanks across the gaps in the mall, and of course we were tired by then, and we had a hell of a job to the lift the bloke up and carry him along, and he was unconscious, and we got over the other side and I’d had enough by then and told him, the other chap that needed to erm, have a rest, so we, about six of them at the side of the malls, so we sat there and, a little while, some of them come down the mall then, another Naval officer, must have been a doctor or something, and he said, wanted to know what we were doing, having a rest, and he said right, went to look at the fellow and said well you can’t take him with you, he’s dead.</span> <span id="s72">And he said, “just tip him out on the sea, and go back to get another one.”</span></p> <p><span id="s73">[00:10:30]</span></p> <p><span id="s74">[BB] So that’s what we did, went back, got another one, and, and we ended up carrying him all the way up the mall, and we were getting near to the top of the mall, and we could hear voices.</span> <span id="s75">And er, we wondered, where, this is all in the book by the way, what I’m telling you...</span></p> <p><span id="s76">[DL] I know, it is all in the book, but I think it’s important for, for the archives, that you explain the background as to, as to how you ended up at E715 Auschwitz, so what you’re doing is explaining a bit about Dunkirk, and from Dunkirk, where you go from there...</span></p> <p><span id="s77">[BB] Well we got further up, and we could hear these voices, and we got up then, and we could then see the boat, and the boat wasn’t on our side of the mall, it was hidden in all the rubbish on the other side of the mall, and it was erm, a paddle steamer.</span> <span id="s78">The erm, O God, the, I’ve gone and forgotten its name, I’ve been on it after the war as well, and er, so we... [COUGH].</span> <span id="s79">Er, a naval bloke came over to there and said ‘give me one hand’, and we lifted him on board.</span> <span id="s80">And that’s what we did, and first in, the other bloke standing there, I turned around, I was going to leave and said ‘hey where you two going?’</span> <span id="s81">– ‘going back to get another one’, and he said, ‘no’ he said, ‘we’re leaving shortly and we’re not coming back’.</span> <span id="s82">And he said come aboard, and he made us come aboard, so that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s83">Certainly it was getting dusk, the paddle started going, we pulled off and er, apart from the fact we nearly tried to turn the boat over on the way, that thunderstorm, and we ended up in Dover the following morning, just about dawn.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">[DL] So you were one of the last, the last members to be evacuated from Dunkirk...</span></p> <p><span id="s85">[BB] [MUMBLES] ...small boat so can find any that come out.</span> <span id="s86">My [MUMBLES] didn’t come out for another week after me, but [MUMBLES] he was further down the coast</span></p> <p><span id="s87">[DL] And then, when you came back to this country, how long was it before you were redeployed to er, to Africa?</span> <span id="s88">When you went to Africa, when did you go to North Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">[BB] Er, well, we got that, that was erm, June, I was, some, June the first was the day I left Dunkirk, so it was then June the second that I arrived in Dover, and then er, we erm, we, we were loaded onto trains which take, took us through, I forget the name of the place, to big fields outside Aldershot, and er I was there about three days and I was in Aldershot, and that picture there, I had that taken, and er, then er, I, they sorted us all out there, and they sent me out to, up to erm Cheshire, Tatton Park in Cheshire.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">[DL] And from Cheshire, how long was it before you were sent to North Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">[BB] Oh, what day, we moved in on, moved down to Somerset [MUMBLES], and [PAUSES], we worked down in Somerset with the erm, I got the job going out and visiting planes that had crashed and that, but that’s another story, and er, in the end we went down to Swansea with our cars and everything, and dumped everything in Swansea, and came back by train, and a couple days after we moved up to Gourock in Scotland, and erm got on a boat called the [PAUSES]...</span></p> <p><span id="s92">[00:15:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s93">[BB] ...oh I’ve thought of the name of the, erm... The Medway Queen was the erm, what I came out of France in, oh the Costa Rica is what it was called, the SS Costa Rica.</span> <span id="s94">And we got on there, and we er, didn’t know where we were going, and we thought after a few days travelling, we were erm travelling to Canada.</span> <span id="s95">But we went, but halfway to Canada, then we turned South, went South and went into erm, Freetown at Sierra Leone, exactly the same as er, er, Dennis Avey did.</span> <span id="s96">Only difference between him and me, er, he left there and went round and restocked at...</span></p> <p><span id="s97">[DL] When would you say you arrived at Sierra Leone, when would you say you arrived into Freetown, what date?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">[BB] Erm, three weeks after we left Scotland, so must be about the second week in the New Year.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">[DL] Of 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">[BB] Yep</span></p> <p><span id="s101">[DL] And, you then started to fight against Rommel, and you were captured.</span> <span id="s102">Can you explain how that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">[BB] No, no... The... 41...I got, we went up to Suez, and I spent some time erm, course we had no, that’s right, we had no erm, no transport.</span> <span id="s104">All the transport we left at home at Swansea, and we thought well the transport be there waiting for us, but as it goes they hadn’t even left England, they had nine weeks to erm Egypt, and they er, so we hung about there, and they said it was er place called, er, pardon me, before we started this conversation I could remember them all.</span> <span id="s105">And erm, [PAUSES], and most of us had dysentery and things like that, and they said we were there in the acclimatization period to get used to the er, the climate in Egypt.</span> <span id="s106">And then we got moved up to Mersa Matruh, where we stayed for some time, just getting out on recces and things like that, and I think I spent most of my time in the sea, I think I spent most of my time in the Mediterranean swimming, and then they moved us up there to the, the border with erm, Libya.</span> <span id="s107">And then moved into Libya, and went round Libya, and came back again and erm, then they erm, said that erm, [COUGH] Tobruk was occupied then and we were going down, we went in the, for the relief of Tobruk, which I think was November the 12th, 41, and we went from then down to, chasing the Germans all the way down past Durno, and down to Bengasi, and erm, and [MUMBLES], O God, I can’t forget the name again, and er... Anyway, the er, the Germans had got a bit organised by the time we got there, and we got pushed all the way back to er, more or less back to Tobruk, and er, a place called Beryl’s Sevli, and we got surrounded by the erm, the Germans, and eventually we ran out of ammunition, and of course got captured.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">[DL] So you were captured by Rommel, and, very briefly describe what happened when you were captured.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">[BB] I was still with my truck but when we saw the truck, erm, when there was too much ammunition flying about, I rushed down and got in a trench, and there was a couple of blokes in there with machine guns, and the one at the far end got hit, dropped some grenades or something in the trench.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">[00:20:00] So the fella, who I didn’t know of course, said ‘I’ll go up and use that, cause it’s got a Lewis gun’, he said ‘you use this as a Brent gun, you’ve used a Brent gun before?’</span> <span id="s111">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s112">So I used the Brent gun, and I can’t even remember the Brent gun emptying, but something knocked me over.</span> <span id="s113">Anyway the next thing I saw was a boy shouting ‘Rells, Rells’, and I looked up and I, standing on the edge of the trench was a blooming great big German, from my height he looked about ten feet tall, and with a hand grenade, with one of those hand grenades in his hand, waving it at me.</span> <span id="s114">So I crawled out there, and over the other side, about a hundred yards away you can see where all the, the infantry blokes were, so I went up there and joined them.</span> <span id="s115">We stayed there for some hours, and the, er [COUGH, MUMBLES], the German interpreter came along and er, and shouted out in very broad Yorkshire, ‘anybody here from Yorkshire?’</span> <span id="s116">, and I looked behind the bloke, and most of the chaps were East Yorks.</span> <span id="s117">And they all looked [MUMBLES], he says ‘he can’t be a German, he speaks broad Yorkshire’, and he really was, and he came there, but nobody would answer.</span> <span id="s118">And, but somebody further down obviously did, and we eventually found out in the end that he, he’d been brought up in England and erm, when, his mother had married a German soon after the First World War, and moved to Germany with him, and after, when he was still a baby anyway, she left her husband and brought him back to England, and of course he was brought up in England.</span> <span id="s119">And just before the war started, the erm, his father died, his father left him everything in his will, so he had to go to Germany to erm, deal with that, and once he’d finished he went to get a visa to get back to England, and they wouldn’t give him one.</span> <span id="s120">They said ‘no, you’re German, you’ll go in the German Army’, and of course all he wanted to do was get cash rich and come back home [LAUGHS]</span></p> <p><span id="s121">[DL] And at this point, did you see Rommel at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">[BB] Only in the distance...</span></p> <p><span id="s123">[DL] ...only in the distance</span></p> <p><span id="s124">[BB] He took, he pulled up in his car, stood up in the car and that’s all we knew, and then this interpreter came down and told me what he was saying, and he was apologising for us, cause he said the Italians morale is very low cause they’ve got no prisoners, so he’s handing over all the prisoners he had there to the Italians.</span> <span id="s125">So that, and so that’s what happened – they put us in lorries and carted us all down to the coast, and dumped them on the Italians</span></p> <p><span id="s126">[DL] And you were then sent to an Italian Prisoner of War camp, er briefly what were conditions like for you at the Italian Prisoner of War camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">[BB] Well, er, despite what everyone’s been saying they weren’t bad, the main thing that was bad about them was the lice [MUMBLES, COUGHS].</span> <span id="s128">I mean you go through your trousers and you could kill four or five hundred lice eggs in one go.</span> <span id="s129">And what we used to get, I don’t know where we got them from but we got some Italian cigarettes and that’s all we used them for, for lighting them, and going all the way down the seam and killing all the eggs.</span> <span id="s130">You had to do it every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">[DL] And what...</span></p> <p><span id="s132">[BB] The only trouble with that, our camp, in sections, I was in the top section and we had an RSM there who thought he was still in the blooming Army and tried to make us do [MUMBLES], and things like that, bloody nuisance actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">[DL] And sanitary conditions – what were the sanitary conditions like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">[BB] O they were alright, by account yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s135">[DL] And then you were moved to a separate Italian camp, or did you stay in...</span></p> <p><span id="s136">[BB] No, I was always in trouble in one way or another, and I presume the only reason I got it... And they moved quite a lot, I was up to another camp PG52, which is up north in, north of Italy, and I stayed there, and that was a good camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">[00:25:02] And very little lice in there too, because they had, er they used some of the senior soldiers to go round and search people’s clothing to see if you got any lice.</span> <span id="s138">And if you had lice you got moved into a separate barrack until you got cleared of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">[DL] And in terms of the sanitary conditions, was there a camp you were in whereby there was literally a bar over a trench, and that was effectively your toilet facility?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">[BB] Yes when we, when I first moved to Auschwitz</span></p> <p><span id="s141">[DL] Okay, so you then moved to a German...</span></p> <p><span id="s142">[BB] I don’t even think it was a bar at first, I think it was a rope</span></p> <p><span id="s143">[DL] So you moved to...from Italy, to a German POW camp, and er you heard about the working party.</span> <span id="s144">So what made you want to join a working party and what then happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">[BB] Well, got moved up to, we all got dumped in the main er, British Camp, God gone and forgotten that as well</span></p> <p><span id="s146">[DL] Stalag VIIIB?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">[BB] No, anyway, and only been there a little while, and they all had separate compounds, and the only ones we saw were the Canadians – the Canadians were in a big compound on top end, and there was a road they could travel up and down, and they had a lot of freedom, and er, I don’t know where most of the blokes on my camp was, I would say I was there more or less on my own, everybody seemed to have disappeared, got somewhere, and a bloke come along and started talking to him who’s been in the camp for some time and erm, I was on about being hungry and that which I was, and he said ‘why don’t you get on the working party?’</span> <span id="s148">.</span> <span id="s149">He said ‘you get better fed on a working party’, and er yeah, how do I do that, and he said ‘well, they come round every so often asking for volunteers for working party.’</span> <span id="s150">I said ‘okay’, so he said ‘what you want to do is promote, promote yourself before you go’.</span> <span id="s151">I said ‘I can’t do that, I got no stripes’, well I don’t know how he got about it but he got stripes and everything for me, and I promote myself to a corporal.</span> <span id="s152">And er, he came about soon after and said there’s a bloke at the gate taking names for working party, so I went down there and he said, the bloke said ‘can you speak in, er, German’, I said ‘no’, he said ‘okay I’ll put you down as an interpreter then’, I thought that’s a bit daft, so I went back, collected my things, and we all got paraded in there, put on cattle trucks and of course carted off – we didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s153">I thought we was – he told me about people who’d gone and worked on farms and things like that, and how well fed they were and I thought I’ll have a bit of that, and also, a better chance of getting away too</span></p> <p><span id="s154">[DL] So these were the cattle trucks to er, to Auschwitz that you were on?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">[BB] Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s156">[DL] What were conditions like on the cattle trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">[BB] We were cramped in there, but no worse, not as bad as the ones that we travelled in, that we travelled up from Italy to erm, Austria.</span> <span id="s158">They were worse because the erm, the guards on the cattle trucks – of course there’s no toilets or anything – they’d give us one of these old tin baths, to use as a toilet for everything, and of course after at least twenty in my truck, that was in the middle of the floor, and by the time we’d er got up to the Brenner Pass, it was full, and of course it used to splash over, all over the place.</span> <span id="s159">We were all a stinking mess, and you couldn’t get rid of it so... First time we got, they stopped, come to complain, they opened the door and you couldn’t even lift it to take it push out the door, had to tip it out the side.</span> <span id="s160">Anyway, that was er, that was bad enough...and er</span></p> <p><span id="s161">[DL] And how much water, how much food, and how long did this journey actually last for?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">[BB] Oh blimey...</span></p> <p><span id="s163">[00:30:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s164">[BB] ...can hardly remember now it was er, couple of days I suppose, didn’t take any longer, and we ended up in a camp, er, just outside Munich [COUGH], which was only a transit camp, the camp there that was all British Officers , there was our camp, and the camp on the other side of us that was all erm, all Russians, and they were, and trying to talk to them was fun, but...

[COUGH]</span></p> <p><span id="s199">[00:35:06]</span></p> <p><span id="s200">[BB] ...and that, you very rarely saw any German soldiers, it was mainly the erm Jewish Capos who were causing most of the trouble</span></p> <p><span id="s201">[DL] And what, what did you see when they were causing the trouble?</span> <span id="s202">What did you witness?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">[BB] I, if one of them come over and spoke to me or something there, and the Capo saw him, he’d come rushing over with a club or something and give them a good old clubbing.</span> <span id="s204">And I, I couldn’t speak whatever language they were speaking, so he was obviously telling the bloke that he wanted to speak to the British soldiers.</span> <span id="s205">And it was some time later when we actually managed to get into odd buildings I looked up that had been put empty, that what they do, that one or two of the Jews might get in there.</span> <span id="s206">Or in one case, I went to go in a place where there, a couple of Greek Jews, who were carpenters, who were building things for the Germans.</span> <span id="s207">And I managed to get into where they were, and talking to them, but again, you couldn’t say much, most of it by sign language, but even after I’d been there a long time, most of the languages we spoke what they called plat-Deutch, again [MUMBLES]</span></p> <p><span id="s208">[DL] And what were the state of the Jews you saw in the factory?</span> <span id="s209">When you first walked around the factory, what did you see, what were they wearing, their condition, their complexion, their health?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">[BB] They looked, they didn’t look too bad cause all the bad ones, obviously all the bad ones had gone to the crematorium, but I always remember when [COUGH], a new lot arrived, and there was a Jew there, must have been six foot six, and he weighed thirty stone at least, and everybody said at the time ‘cor, ain’t he lucky, how being so fat’.</span> <span id="s211">We saw him again six, could be six months time after that, and he was there, he was still there fit as a fiddle, gone down to eighteen stone or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">[DL] In terms of the general condition of, of people who were slave labourers in the factory, what was their general condition, their demeanour, er the way in which they walked, erm...</span></p> <p><span id="s213">[BB] Most of them weren’t too bad, cause as I said they wouldn’t have them down there, but any time they didn’t want them there of course, shoved them off [MUMBLES] or got clunked.</span> <span id="s214">One time when, I don’t know what happened but, I don’t know where the Germans were, but there was quite a lot of them went berserk, tried to climb the wire, and the Germans just shot them down, that was up the other end of the camp, about half a mile away I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">[DL] Did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">[BB] No, I heard the gunshots; I didn’t know what it was for</span></p> <p><span id="s217">[DL] And what atrocities did you witness when you were at E715 Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">[BB] [MUMBLES] None really, it was all treatment of the Jews.</span> <span id="s219">The worst part as far as I was concerned was when the crematoriums were working cause of the wind was in that direction, the smell of the crematoriums, that was erm, sickly and unbelievable [COUGHS]</span></p> <p><span id="s220">[DL] You talk about the ill treatment of the Jews, what sort of ill treatment did you see when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">[BB] Mainly that...the...er...Capos, the Germans never needed to bother them much.</span> <span id="s222">Everything was left to the Capos, most of the Capos were...</span></p> <p><span id="s223">[00:40:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s224">[BB] ...very unpleasant, and er wouldn’t talk to us, and er, and the only times, once when – and this story is about in three different books, told by three different people [MUMBLES, LAUGHS], I got to know, very slightly, er, two French Jews, who came from, both of them lawyers, they came from Toulouse.</span> <span id="s225">One could speak just a little bit of English maybe understand, but it was difficult, and erm, I think the second, the second day I actually spoke to them, he came in and he had, under his uniform, his jacket he had a, an old, torn jersey, and all this bits missing in the front of here, and I remember at the barracks, I had a piece of knitted material about that size, and I thought that would do then fine, it’ll fit nicely over there.</span> <span id="s226">I tried to explain to him when I saw him the next day, what it was for, and they were pleased to have it, and I said ‘if you know anyone who can knit, you can strip it all down and knit it all up’.</span> <span id="s227">But anyway, the following morning, his brother came in on his own, and er, I asked him where his brother was, he said – I don’t know what he said but I found out afterwards – he was telling me he was in a box about two foot square, about two foot high, and they had to spend the day in there.</span> <span id="s228">The Capo, he’d put it through the Germans when they got back that they’d got this bit of material, [MUMBLES], and er, I thought well I’ll see him the following day when I come back, but unfortunately that day I’d got moved onto another job and I never saw them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">[DL] And in terms of the gas chambers themselves, how did you know when people were sent to the gas chambers?</span> <span id="s230">Did the Jews tell you – and if so how did they let you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">[BB] The main gas chambers were of course about two miles away, and the main crematorium part, cause I’d never seen it, never known it had existed, it wasn’t till the BBC took me there years later that I went actually round it, but we weren’t allowed to go that part there, but er...</span></p> <p><span id="s232">[DL] I think what I’m asking you, in the book you recalled you would sometimes ask where so-and-so was, and there would be a response that the Jews would then give you to explain that the individuals had been sent to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">[BB] That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">[DL] What, how did they actually tell you if...</span></p> <p><span id="s235">[BB] [MUMBLES], ask where they were, and we used to say without a soap and towel, and they used to nod their heads, course when they went to the gas chamber, they thought they were going for a shower, which they were but it wasn’t the right kind of shower.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">[DL] And in terms of conditions for yourself at E715 Auschwitz, what were conditions like for yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">[BB] Fairly good, I was, and we had our own sick bay, and er, and I, I only spent once in the sick bay, I had er, something, something wrong with my stomach, I can’t remember what it was all, now, and er, that was when we got bombed and er, erm, thirty eight people got killed.</span> <span id="s238">Course the doctor came round, asked me if I was fit to do something, he said, “good,” he said “we got to open up the other part of the sick bay, which wasn’t in use, find some beds and that, for the wounded [MUMBLES], and I spent the day at, sorting the wounded out.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">[DL] And that was the bombing raid of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">[BB] August 44 yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s241">[DL] August 1944, and what was the reaction of the British POWs after the bombing raid had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">[00:45:01]</span></p> <p><span id="s243">[BB] [MUMBLES], well if there was any reaction, I think there was a bit of argument about whether it was the Americans or the British had bombed us, but I think it was the Americans, but er.</span> <span id="s244">Cause they, I don’t know, we was, we always knew when our factory was going to be bombed, cause of the limits that the planes could fly, they couldn’t go any, there was nowhere to go, erm, and they erm, used to come over and bomb, bomb, bomb the factory, and very rarely hit the factory, they hit the woods round the factory.</span> <span id="s245">The first time we got erm, we got bombed, erm, I was erm I bloody well can’t remember what I was doing, there was a big pipe there, around about six foot, really big pipe, you could just about stand up in it and erm, I thought I’d be safer in there so I went into the pipe when they were bombing and the pipe moved once or twice as it vibrated so to speak and er when I came out couldn’t find any bombing, they had bombed all the factory, all the woods and had missed the factory completely.</span> <span id="s246">So after that, if there was any bombing then I would just stay in the factory, by then they built some shelters in the factory for the Germans to go in but we used to sneak in as well but we got turned back once or twice by the Germans who said it was for them and not for us (laughs).</span></p> <p><span id="s247">[DL] And how close was E715 Auschwitz and how close were you to the actual concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">[BB] About three miles.</span> <span id="s249">There was a local work camp which was about two to three hundred yards on the other side of the field next to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">[DL] And the work camp, did you ever witness any abuses happening there, in terms of…</span></p> <p><span id="s251">[BB] I never heard anything, the only noise we ever got there was when they marched off to work in the morning, they used to have a band playing.</span> <span id="s252">So, when they left to come to work and they used to be at work by the time we had got out of our camp and gone but they had to come past the entrance to our camp to get into the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">[DL] So, what time would that be, normally in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">[BB] Dawn</span></p> <p><span id="s255">[DL] Dawn.</span> <span id="s256">And on one occasion, you did mention to me about makeshift gallows which you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">[BB] Oh, yes, in the field, between the erm, there was one with about four (pauses) yeah, one was empty I think, there were four blokes hanging there and er I don’t know who they were, they look like civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">[DL] So, were they Jews or were they…</span></p> <p><span id="s259">[BB] I don’t know.</span> <span id="s260">They didn’t have any, they didn’t have their name on to tell you what they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">[DL] How many hours did, in your estimation, did the concentration camp victims actually work for in IG Farben?</span> <span id="s262">Did they receive any breaks, what was their treatment like in your estimation?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">[BB] What, the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">[DL] Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">[BB] Well, again, they used to disappear around about lunchtime and, of course, when we started there we got er big erm canisters full of soup and the first one I opened, it stank so much that I just couldn’t err drink or eat it.</span> <span id="s266">You see like erm brown cabbage leaf and things like that floating about in it.</span> <span id="s267">And er the first lot we got we just tipped out and sent the cans back and, of course, we found it very, talking to, somebody was talking to the Jews and they said the Jews would drink it.</span> <span id="s268">From then on we got our cans and we didn’t take it to the Jews we just left it so that the Jews could find them, they could come and take a look and the Jews had them.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">[00:49:57]</span></p> <p><span id="s270">[DL] Brian, I’m just going to check.</span> <span id="s271">Was there any sound issues with that, Chris?</span> <span id="s272">(Camera: Yes, he was just covering up the mic).</span> <span id="s273">Okay, if you could just repeat the story you just told me with the cans with the soup because there may have been a sound issue with that.</span> <span id="s274">So, what did you do with the cans with the soup?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">[BB] Well, we opened them and we just couldn’t, well, we couldn’t, they just absolutely stank (coughs) and erm so somebody said they had given theirs to the Jews so that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s276">We left them in a place where the Jews could find them and we would go back later and get the empty ones so we knew they had them and we used to do that every day then because we weren’t going to do it.</span> <span id="s277">We were told once that somebody had been up near the cookhouse where they made it and they’d seen erm one of the Jew girls who worked up the cookhouse had opened up one of the cans and had peed in it and er, and er, I said to the bloke who had told me, do you know which can it was because it would taste better than ones we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">[DL] Did you believe that as a story?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">[BB] No (laughs) I don’t know if he saw it or not but I thought it would be funny if he had.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">[DL] Because that strikes me as being a very black sense of humour, was there a black sense of humour, if you can describe it as humour?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">[BB] Well, I don’t think any of us had senses of humour actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">[DL] Why, why do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">[BB] I don’t know.</span> <span id="s284">There wasn’t much you could be funny about, could you?</span> <span id="s285">You’d say a lot of things that were stupid rather than laughable.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">[DL] And would that, the story which you’ve just chosen there, would you class that as one of those stupid stories which…</span></p> <p><span id="s287">[BB] I don’t know, it was just what the bloke said to me and that’s what my answer was so I never gave any thought then, or since, whether it was stupid or funny because I don’t think it’s stupid and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">[DL] How did the British try to help the Jews, I appreciate you’ve just spoken about the soup you would leave for them but were there other areas where you tried to help the Jews by providing cigarettes or any other sort of support.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">[BB] Well, the cigarettes, we needed them ourselves and of course we had only got them in our parcels and erm we always wanted them for trading so I have no idea where Avey said he had got all of the cigarettes from to give to that Jewish Capo, well, I just don’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">[DL] And the Red Cross parcels which you would receive, how frequently would you receive them and what difference did they make?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">[BB] Well, that varied a lot.</span> <span id="s292">Sometimes we got one a week and sometimes we got one between two and, in Italy, it was worse.</span> <span id="s293">I think one time we got one between eight but the idea of one between eight with only about ten items in the box (laughs).</span></p> <p><span id="s294">[DL] And did you use the Red Cross parcels to then barter for additional food in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">[BB] Mainly in the factory, yeah.</span> <span id="s296">Things I used to trade in was like in chocolate so I’d say to people there, tins of something for a bar of chocolate and then I’d take the chocolate down the factory and barter that.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">[DL] That would be bartering with civilian employees.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">[BB] With civilians, yeah, Germans and Poles.</span> <span id="s299">Mainly Poles (coughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s300">[DL] And civilians, they were from nearby villages?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">[BB] I presume they were, I don’t know where they come from but they could be very helpful in some ways and I bought things off them and traded with them when I could.</span> <span id="s302">Language troubles were always the trouble cause er most of them when they spoke to you spoke….</span></p> <p><span id="s303">[00:55:01]</span></p> <p><span id="s304">[BB] in a mixture of plat-Deutch, which was a mixture of German and Polish.</span> <span id="s305">I suppose they got used to it over the years of using it and we couldn’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">[DL] How many civilians were employed in the actual factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">[BB] Cor, blimey, I’ve got no idea.</span> <span id="s308">Couple of hundred, perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">[DL] And the food which you obtained at IG Farben, how did you smuggle that back into your camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">[BB] With difficulty.</span> <span id="s311">Well, the main things I used to bring back were either bread or eggs.</span> <span id="s312">Eggs, I managed to get elastic bands from somewhere, and I used to put the eggs down in my socks, near my ankles, with elastic bands holding them in place around my ankles and I could get five or six eggs in each leg, assuming I could buy that many legs, I could only normally buy one or two and bread.</span> <span id="s313">Of course I was pretty slim and the loaves were long and tapered at the ends and I used to have one each side of my stomach and to get about I used to hold them tight as I had a flat stomach, not what I’ve got now, and the only thing that used to amuse me was I used to think what people would think of the bottom end – what it tasted like!</span> <span id="s314">But nobody complained so.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">[DL] In terms of the makeshift radio in the camp, were you aware of the British having made a makeshift radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">[BB] Well, I think, I don’t think there was one in our camp.</span> <span id="s317">I think there was one in the E715 camp and I know there was one in the top camp in Italy.</span> <span id="s318">There was one in there as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">[DL] Sorry, to clarify that, you’re saying that there wasn’t a radio at E715 or that there was?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">[BB] Well, I don’t know of one in my camp but in the other camp, down the road, somebody told me that there was one.</span> <span id="s321">(Coughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s322">[DL] Obviously you’re saying there was a difference between the camp you were in and the other camp in terms of the actual name.</span> <span id="s323">The naming of the camps.</span> <span id="s324">So, one being E715 and the other which…</span></p> <p><span id="s325">[BB] Well, they both had the same name because when I was in the other camp it was E715 because I’ve still got letters which I’ve got at home.</span> <span id="s326">Well, which I’ve got here which has got E715 on.</span> <span id="s327">Then when I moved up the other camp, they still come through as E715.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">[DL] The weather which you experienced when you were over in Poland, in Auschwitz, there was intense cold during the winter months.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">[BB] Yeah, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">[DL] How did you cope and how did the British try to help the Jews who were working in the factory in the intense cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">[BB] Well, nobody tried to help.</span> <span id="s332">What we did down in the factory is erm to get some of these old oil drums and we dug holes in the side and then scouted every bit of wood we could and then after a time, unfortunately, everybody’s trousers down here had gone rotten and of course they’d bend their knee and it’ll all split and of course we had a room in the camp where blokes were repairing trousers all day and then you’d take your trousers in there and get them repaired and then you’d walk around with patches on the knees of your trousers.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">[DL] We’ve already touched on the soup which the Nazis supplied.</span> <span id="s334">Did the Nazis supply any other type of food to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">[BB] Yeah.</span> <span id="s336">The erm, a cheese that was er was tasted awful and er what else did we used to get?</span> <span id="s337">You’d get some bread, oh no, that was when we were in Austria they came up with some loaves of bread only small, grey, and the date on them was 1938 with letters on the side and we’d be given one of them each and we’d cut them up…</span></p> <p><span id="s338">[01:00:00] …to make sandwiches or something and they were absolutely sodden and we’d toast the bread to dry it out and, no, what was the darn stuff, no, I’ve forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">[DL] You didn’t play football as some of the others did</span></p> <p><span id="s340">[BB] No, no football in our camp, no room in our camp, in camp 1 or what you call 711 because on the side of the field sloped up there and they played football up there and it wasn’t until I was talking to Doug Bond, years after the war, that I even knew that they had played football down there and that Charlie Coward had got English football jerseys to play in.</span> <span id="s341">That was all knew to me.</span> <span id="s342">You know, twenty to thirty years after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">[DL] You didn’t play football then.</span> <span id="s344">But you did go running.</span> <span id="s345">There was a running track there?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">[BB] Yes, that was the same place they went round the field.</span> <span id="s347">When I was first there, it must have been before Christmas and er somebody suggested we just run around and they reckon four times round the field was a mile and I reckon I ran around it twice or something and then packed up but one bloke went around 17 times (laughs).</span></p> <p><span id="s348">[DL] How else did you spend your time when you weren’t at IG Farben?</span> <span id="s349">So how else did you spend your time – what sort of things did you do at E715 Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">[BB] Well, we had er a bridge club in our hut.</span> <span id="s351">Well, it depends whose about and who’s there to play but if we had enough players to play then we’d play bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">[DL] You ended up in the POWs’ hospital during your imprisonment at E715 Auschwitz – why did you end up there and what were conditions like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">[BB] Very good.</span> <span id="s354">We had a doctor, I know his name, it’s on all my papers but I can’t remember what his name is now.</span> <span id="s355">But he was in the South African army but he was an Englishman.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">[DL] You say conditions were “very good,” the documents show that there were issues surrounding conditions within the hospital itself and certainly in terms of the Nazis coming round to ensure that those who they deemed fit to work would then go to the factory to work.</span> <span id="s357">Did you find that in your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">[BB] Well, what, we had a sick list every morning with how many he was allowed to have on his sick list.</span> <span id="s359">But if his sick list didn’t meet the quantity he was allowed then one or two blokes who weren’t sick used to join the list to make the number up.</span> <span id="s360">But, er, I never did that anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">[DL] What actually happened at the start of 1945 as the Russians approached?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">[BB] Well, we could hear the guns in the distance and someone said it was fifty miles away and what distance it was I don’t know but we were, all the Jews were being moved out and going by us and goodness knows where they were going and eventually we all got rounded up and made a big column and I, well, er, you got our route, I gave you the route of where our column was, I kept the places all there where we stopped at.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">[01:05:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s364">[DL] And the Jews when they walked past you.</span> <span id="s365">How continuous was this line?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">[BB] Oh goodness knows how many there was or where they were coming from.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">[DL] But was it a continuous column of people that were walking past you for hours or days?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">[BB] Oh, no, I think they were smaller groups than that.</span> <span id="s369">They went past us for 15 to 20 minutes I suppose and that’ll be it and then later another load would go past and they might be bigger or smaller.</span> <span id="s370">We never took much notice other than to wonder how the hell they were going to manage.</span> <span id="s371">And, of course, when we left, we went the same route as they did for a part and, of course, all along the sides there was bodies lying everywhere and obviously they had just died and been thrown up onto the bank or whatever.</span> <span id="s372">I mean we never stopped to look to see if they were dead, we just presumed they were dead.</span> <span id="s373">I’d be surprised if they weren’t anyway but we were so cold and we all ended up with frostbit (coughs) and I got frostbite in my feet and lost my toenails on my right foot and my right foot still isn’t right.</span> <span id="s374">The toenail doesn’t grow properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">[DL] And what was the feeling among your fellow POWs from E715 Auschwitz when you were sent on this march, what was the collective feeling at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">[BB] I think the collective feeling at that point was to get away from the Russians because we heard rumours that Russians had, some POWs had got down there to the Russians and all the Russians had done is shot them.</span> <span id="s377">Now whether that was true or not we didn’t know but from everything we heard about the Russians then it most likely was but I met some Russians once inside the camp and I don’t know what they were doing there and they obviously were (coughs) prisoners but they seemed to be able to wonder around where they liked, the same as a lot of the women Russians.</span> <span id="s378">They were able to wonder around wherever they like.</span> <span id="s379">In fact, I didn’t get to know to speak to but (mumbles) one of them was the strongest women I had ever seen.</span> <span id="s380">In fact, someone told me that in the Russian Army she was a gun loader on one of the big guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">[DL] What evidence did you see along the way that the Jews were taking the same route that you were taking?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">[BB] Only about the first couple of days and I don’t know where they went but we went off in a different direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">[DL] And how many bodies do you estimate in those first few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">[BB] Oh, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s385">It must have been in the hundreds anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">[DL] And were there any preparations made for this march at all?</span> <span id="s387">In terms of.</span> <span id="s388">.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">[BB] No, we just grabbed our stuff.</span> <span id="s390">Of course the trouble was, we had to move out as the Russians had bombed our camp and had dropped Molotov cocktails on it and my building that I lived in got burnt to the ground and even then you could smell the oil in our clothes where it had splattered all over the place and of course then they rounded us up the next morning and marched us off and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">[DL] How did you actually survive during the long march?</span> <span id="s392">You spoke about getting colic at one point.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">[BB] Oh, yes, well, that was my fault.</span> <span id="s394">Entirely my fault.</span> <span id="s395">Bloody stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">[DL] Could you explain what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">[BB] Well, we stopped at this sugar beet factory and we couldn’t find anything to eat and there was nothing there….</span></p> <p><span id="s398">[01:10:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s399">[BB] often you would get to these places and find bags of potatoes or something especially if you stopped at a farm but this place there was nothing but sugar beet so somebody reckoned you could cook sugar beet which was fairly common and so we found this big metal things (mumbles), what are they called?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">[DL] Pots?</span> <span id="s401">Large metal pots?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">[BB] Big round things, use them in cookers as well, big tub in the top, they’ve got a name but I can’t remember what they’re called.</span> <span id="s403">Anyway, we got one of these and used to use them with potatoes and boil them and somebody would, half the time, potatoes would have gone to mash and a bloke would be that cold that he would use two hands to plough in and put them into the tub that you’d feed out of.</span> <span id="s404">This time though we had the sugar beat and I was dishing it out and er everybody was happy and when we got down to the very bottom we only got some juice and that down the bottom and everybody had gone to sleep so I thought, we ain’t going to waste that, so I found something and drunk the lot.</span> <span id="s405">I felt alright.</span> <span id="s406">Then the following morning we all marched off and the more we marched the more pain I got and then I couldn’t stand it any longer and I was curled up as a ball in the grass when the doctor came along and I couldn’t straighten myself out so they forced me out straight and they got two of their biggest blokes to walk beside me and they couldn’t hold me up so they told my hands to the back of the horse and cart that the Germans used for and I was forced to walk that way for hours and I can’t really remember much about it I suppose and in the end I seemed to be walking normally and I was allowed to go.</span> <span id="s407">Everybody was passing me and I was lagging behind and I was ended up and everybody had gone and I ended up walking down the road on my own and ended up in some little village and the only thing I remember about the village was two roads around you and you’d got a green down the middle so you had two roads and I had to go to the lavvy and so I dropped my trousers in the middle of the road and I never done so much in my life, it was great big piles of the blinking sugar beat.</span> <span id="s408">And then the civilians came out and I could hear blokes chattering and I went down into a building and a bloke upstairs said, “Hey, I’ve saved a place for you!”</span> <span id="s409">So I climbed up to where he was and the following day I was alright.</span> <span id="s410">I don’t know what would have happened in the doctor hadn’t made me, I suppose I would have just laid there and died.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">[DL] What was the atmosphere with the guards like on this march?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">[BB] Oh, that was good.</span> <span id="s413">One time when I was walking along there and I was frozen, suddenly, this guy come along there and he had a big handful of snow.</span> <span id="s414">I didn’t know what he was going to do, I don’t think he noticed, he just smacked me in the face with it.</span> <span id="s415">I thought, “What the bloody hell did he do that for?”</span> <span id="s416">And one of the chaps said, “Your nose had gone white,” he said.</span> <span id="s417">So he was being helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">[DL] What happened to the horse with the horse and cart?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">[BB] That got into such a state of health they killed it.</span> <span id="s420">I’ve heard loads of different stories about it.</span> <span id="s421">I’m sure that a couple of chaps who used to work in the butchery went behind a barn and cut its throat….</span></p> <p><span id="s422">[01:15:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s423">[BB] but I read other stories that said it was shot but I never saw it happen and I never heard any shots so anyway when it came round the following day we got some soup which wasn’t that bad but I don’t know where all the heart, lungs and other bits went or who got them.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">[DL] How many miles a day did you roughly travel and did the weather conditions actually improve for yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">[BB] Weather changed day by day but it wasn’t so bad when it got a bit warmer.</span> <span id="s426">But it is difficult now to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">[DL] When were you finally freed by Allied soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">[BB] We got down into Bavaria and we were staying in a big barn (laughs) which was quite nice grand, but I and another chap managed to get up into the loft and it was full of clothing and we, I’ve still got the jacket somewhere, anyway, when we got back to England it was all taken away from us and we were there some day and we saw this small little tank coming across the field towards us and it was the Americans and all the chaps wanted to know was if they had some sweets on the tank so they gave us some sweets and cleared off again.</span> <span id="s429">Later the doctor told us to stay where we are and not to try to head for home as quite a few fellows I think did and quite a few said, oh, I’m not going to stay here and started to head for home but I stayed there and then of course the Americans come around with their Dakotas and flew us down to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">[DL] When was that?</span> <span id="s431">The month.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">[BB] After the war finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">[DL] So was that April or May 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">[BB] That would have been April 1945</span></p> <p><span id="s435">[DL] April 1945 and the march started in January.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">[BB] End of April as I got home on May the 12th</span></p> <p><span id="s437">[DL] When you arrived home how did people react towards you, did you ever tell people that you had been to E715 Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">[BB] No, the er, they knew I had been a POW there but I never bragged about that.</span> <span id="s439">I don’t think there was anything to be proud about at all and the following day after I got home we had a big bonfire in the road and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">[DL] Did you suffer from any psychiatric problems based on what you had seen whilst you were at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">[BB] Well, I must have done because I had my six weeks leave and I had to report back to a camp at Haywards Heath and there they had to bring us up to date on drillings and such and they had young lads there who had been in the army for six months telling us all how to fire a bren gun and how to dismantle a bren gun and, of course, we weren’t interested, we knew how to do it, we’d done it enough times before but we did it but we didn’t do it fast enough or at least that’s what the young NCOs said, mumbles, I remember one time when we had to through all hand grenades into a big net and I threw all mine in, six in, and okay the bloke after me, caught the edge and fell out.</span> <span id="s442">He got failed.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">[01:20:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s444">[DL] The psychiatric issues which you experienced after the war, what actually happened when you were discharged from the army?</span> <span id="s445">Were you medically discharged from the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">[BB] I was medically discharged.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">[DL] And why were you medically discharged?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">[BB] I can explain that to you when I was at this place and in days off we would go down to Brighton for the day and get a train back from Brighton was at half past nine at night and, of course, we had never been ready to come home by then so we’d find out the first train out in the morning, sleep on that, go back the following day.</span> <span id="s449">Anyway, someone reported me anyway and someone said the trickcyclist wanted to see me so anyway I thought what the bloody hell is a trickcyclist?</span> <span id="s450">I never bloody well heard of one.</span> <span id="s451">So, of course, I went along there because it was a psychiatrist I had to see and he was a big fat Jew he was.</span> <span id="s452">He must have weighed about twenty stone, sitting there, and he asked me how I felt and things like that, and I said, I feel fine and as far as I’m concerned there’s nothing wrong with me and he said I’m going to send you to hospital for a month to get yourself sorted out and I said alright and sent me then to Southern hospital in Dartford, Kent, the asylum was next door and anyone who didn’t get better went over the wall and into the asylum.</span> <span id="s453">There I did everything wrong that I should have done, of course I didn’t realise it, so I would go to see what a job was then wait until nobody was looking and clear off and then walk around the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">[DL] You describe your psychiatrist as a big fat Jew quote unquote – why do you say that?</span> <span id="s455">What makes you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">[BB] Well, I’m surprised to see him there he was so bulky.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">[DL] But, how did you know he was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">[BB] He had a Jewish face, he looked Jewish, he might not have been Jewish then.</span> <span id="s459">I thought he was.</span> <span id="s460">Sounded like a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">[DL] Did you ever actually go back to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">[BB] Yes, I went back to Auschwitz with the BBC didn’t I?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">[DL] When was that when you went back to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">[BB] Well, you know that better than I do.</span> <span id="s465">Six years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">[DL] It was round about six years ago.</span> <span id="s467">When you went back to Auschwitz with the BBC what was your feelings when you were there?</span> <span id="s468">How did you feel when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">[BB] I had no feelings when I was there.</span> <span id="s470">I had an enjoyable three days and visiting, of course, I went around all the parts of the crematorium and all part of the complex which I knew existed but I had never seen before, of course it would have been, weren’t there as public viewers so we got there at seven o’clock in the morning and of course we went round and saw everything – just the three of us and as the trippers were coming at nine o’clock, we cleared off.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">[DL] Do you feel that you have ever been haunted by what you saw when you were at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">[BB] No.</span> <span id="s473">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">[DL] Yet you would have witnessed atrocities in the factory itself you would have seen, as you said earlier about the people hanging from the gallows, you would have heard about the gas chambers, you would have smelt the crematoria, were you ever haunted by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">[BB] No.</span> <span id="s476">It was not as bad as seeing your mate lying in a field, shot up with all his guts falling out in his hands.</span> <span id="s477">To me, that is far worse than seeing some Jew who died through exhaustion or something.</span> <span id="s478">Now that does upset me, still does, but things like that never bothered me at all.</span> <span id="s479">I lost too many friends.</span> <span id="s480">That’s what annoys me with the modern things….</span></p> <p><span id="s481">[01:25:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s482">[BB] Everyone who dies abroad gets brought back to England in a coffin.</span> <span id="s483">All we did with them was dig a hole in the sand, say ‘Good luck, mate’ and fill them in again.</span> <span id="s484">Often as not, of course it being sand, couldn’t find a bit of stick to mark where they are, unless they’ve gone down there with a machine to mark the bodies then they’re still lying there now.</span> <span id="s485">Things like that really annoy me and when you read about the way people are treated, when we came home, no-one cared if you were alive or dead now they’re all made a fuss of.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">[DL] Did anyone care about your experiences at E715 Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">[BB] No.</span> <span id="s488">Nobody knew I had been there until something had cropped up and the only people I spoke to were the chaps I knew who I used to write to and in hospital they told me, I had been in hospital for two months, which I didn’t want as I wanted to do more time than my father did and when I left there I went to say goodbye to the staff nurse and she wished me good luck and said that when I went in there I was the most ill mannered pig she had ever met in her life and I looked at her in amazement and wondered in what way was I ill mannered?</span> <span id="s489">I didn’t ask her I was just so flabbergasted at what she said so I think there must have been something wrong with me and I didn’t know what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">[DL] Finally what did you go on to do for the rest of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">[BB] When I was discharged from the army they asked if I wanted to go on a course and I went to South West Essex Technical college for six months to learn about electronics and from there I did every job imaginable for electronics until I retired even up manager level, I was a manager when I retired at 65.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">[DL] When did you retire?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">[BB] 65</span></p> <p><span id="s494">[DL] What year, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">[BB] 1985</span></p> <p><span id="s496">[DL] Is there anything you want to add, Brian?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">[BB] No, I’ve said too much already.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">[01:25:00]</span></p> <p><span id="s499">ENDS</span></p></body></html>
