id="s3">It is August 13, 1984.</span> <span id="s4">We are in the family room of her home.</span> <span id="s5">Tell me your full name please.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: Renate Wasserman Harlan.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: In what city were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: I was born in Koln, Germany [located 50.56N, 6.57E].</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: What was the date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: March 7, 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Did you grow up in Koln?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s13">Yes I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: What kind of city was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: It is a very large metropolitan area, in the Western part of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Was it an industrial town?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I am sure that there was some industry [it is located on the Rhine River, very close to the Ruhr industrial area].</span> <span id="s18">I was rather young when I left so I really don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: How old were you when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I was ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: How long had your family lived in Koln?</span> <span id="s22">[Cologne, by its English name] Do you know when or how your family came to be in Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My family had always lived there (there were Jews in Cologne at the time of the Crusades) or a least for some number of generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Do you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I have one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Is she younger or older?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: She is two years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Were there any other family members other than y our parents who lived in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yes, my maternal grandparents lived with us, in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: What did your parents do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: My father was a physician and my mother helped him in the office.</span> <span id="s32">Other than that she was a housewife.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: He went to medical school then?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Do you know where he went (to which medical school)?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: You know, I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: What kind of education did your mother have?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: My mother went to the University in Bonn.</span> <span id="s39">[50.44N, 7.06E] She majored in History of Art.</span> <span id="s40">She did not get her degree because she married before she finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Was there kind of a family tradition like that about education?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: It was not customary to go to University back then (during the previous generations).</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What did your grandfather do?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: My paternal grandfather was in the lumber business.</span> <span id="s45">He owned a lumberyard.</span> <span id="s46">My maternal grandfather was a dealer in imported fabric, mainly yard goods for men’s suits.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: And their wives were pretty much housewives.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: My paternal family yes, but my maternal family not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Were our paternal grandparents Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: There was only Orthodox.</span> <span id="s53">[Reform Judaism was not prevalent in that part of Germany but Conservative Judaism, as is know [sic] in Dayton had more adherents than Orthodoxy.]</span> <span id="s54">In other words there was no Reform movement in Europe at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Had you been living in an area which was more or less a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: No.</span> <span id="s57">There was no more ghetto at that time, in Cologne, when I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: I thought that many of these neighborhoods were Jewish neighborhoods.</span> <span id="s59">I guess that I am wondering what the difference was between your grandparents.</span> <span id="s60">Were the ones assimilated?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s62">As a matter of fact, they [the maternal grandparents] were rather agnostic in their attitudes.</span> <span id="s63">The paternal grandparents would still go to synagogue occasionally.</span> <span id="s64">They observed the Holy Days, Passover [anniversary of the Exodus from Egypt] and that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Did they keep a kosher home?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Did your parents attend synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Not to my recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: On the High Holy Days (the Jewish New Year)?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: What was the principal language spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: German, until 1934.</span> <span id="s73">At that time my mother engaged an English-speaking nurse for the two children.</span> <span id="s74">She felt that the only way to learn a language is to speak it.</span> <span id="s75">From then on we spoke English at home all the time except when we addressed the grandparents, who lived in the house, and when we went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: So your parents had decided that they were going to go to the U.S. already.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Well, my father wasn’t ready, but my mother saw the handwriting on the wall.</span> <span id="s78">It was customary to have French-speaking personnel, [Koln is fairly close to France and Belgium] but she decided that there was no future in learning French and that the language which we would need would be English.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Did your parents speak any other languages other than German and English?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Not to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s81">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Did you think of yourself as amongst the rich or the poor?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: I would say upper middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: You had a nurse, but I guess that this was fairly common amongst the upper middle class?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No, not the middle class.</span> <span id="s86">I think that upper middle class families had someone for the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Socially, did your parents relate to Jews or did they have non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: They also had non-Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: So the family had all kinds of friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Were they closer to Jews than to non-Jews?</span> <span id="s92">Were most of their friends Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: I would say so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Was the synagogue the cultural center for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: They didn’t belong?</span> <span id="s97">Did they belong to any other kind of clubs?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Let me go back.</span> <span id="s99">Belong, in the sense that American Jews belong to a synagogue also was not known, because the synagogues didn’t operate on a dues structure.</span> <span id="s100">In Germany, all religious organizations, all churches, are subsidized by the state.</span> <span id="s101">So, either you went or you didn’t go.</span> <span id="s102">You see it is an entirely different structure than what we are accustomed to in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Did they belong to any social club?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: they might have; I don’t remember because I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Do you recall if they enjoyed the theatre or concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s107">They were very culturally oriented.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: I realize that you probably won’t remember this, but were you at all aware of their political beliefs?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Can you describe your childhood?</span> <span id="s111">What sort of a home did you have?</span> <span id="s112">Did you live in an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: When I was born, my parents lived in an apartment and by the time I was five or six, my father built a very large, elaborate home.</span> <span id="s114">It had five stories.</span> <span id="s115">His office was on the main floor.</span> <span id="s116">The second floor was living room, dining room, kitchen and quarters for my maternal grandparents who lived with us, because my mother was an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">The third floor contained the master bedroom, the children’s bedrooms and playroom as well as a room for the girl who was hired to take care of the children.</span> <span id="s118">The fourth floor was maids’ quarters and there was a large laundry area and a sun deck on which we could play.</span> <span id="s119">I guess that it was really only four floors if you don’t count the basement.</span> <span id="s120">That was a really large home.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Was it located outside of town?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yes, it was located in one of the suburban areas.</span> <span id="s123">On one of the main streets of the suburban area.</span> <span id="s124">That was because my father’s office was in there.</span> <span id="s125">[This means that this home was ready just about the time Hitler came to power.]</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Did you play with your sister mostly of did you have other friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: We had friends in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s128">You know, kids whose parents were friendly with my parents, relatives, whose children were playmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: In other ways, how would you describe your childhood; was it a happy one?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s131">Yes.</span> <span id="s132">A little more structured than we would structure our children’s lives now.</span> <span id="s133">That was my mother’s personality, mainly.</span> <span id="s134">Everything was very compartmented.</span> <span id="s135">We were very programmed, such as music lessons, dancing lessons, gymnastic lessons, and art lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Are there any special incidents which you recall from your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: I remember traveling with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: What sorts of places did you travel to?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: The first trip which we took was right after I had had the measles.</span> <span id="s140">It was thought at that time that fresh mountain air was good for recuperations.</span> <span id="s141">My parents were going on a trip to Switzerland and they decided that that was just what I needed, after having gotten over the measles.</span> <span id="s142">So they took me along.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q; What other kinds of places did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: We had relatives in Amsterdam [52.22N, 4.54E] so one summer we went to the seashore in Holland.</span> <span id="s145">I remember that trip.</span> <span id="s146">The English girl who was taking care of us, who lived with us, had her family near London.</span> <span id="s147">One summer her parents asked her to bring us children with her so we went to England for a couple of weeks to visit with her family.</span> <span id="s148">She had two younger sisters, so the sisters came back to Koln with us and visited with us.</span> <span id="s149">We have retained our relationship with all of them to this day.</span> <span id="s150">As a matter of fact, my husband and I were in London two years ago and we went to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Did you attend school in Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Was it a public school or a private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No.</span> <span id="s155">By the time I was in school, Jewish children were already restricted to having to go to Jewish schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: It must have been in 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: So you went to a school which had been set up by the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I don’t really know that, but it was a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s160">There were only Jewish teachers and Hebrew was taught.</span> <span id="s161">I learned to read and write Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: You also learned the usual academic subjects?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Yes, right!</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: You stayed in that school until you left Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: You were five when you went to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: So the school had only Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: What languages to you speak now?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: German and English.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: When you were not in school, to what extent did you associate with non-Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I do not recollect.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: At this time, were some of your parents’ non-Jewish friends beginning to reject you?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s176">I had heard my mother speak out.</span> <span id="s177">My mother had a teacher whom she was very, very close to.</span> <span id="s178">This was a friendship which lasted throughout their adult lives.</span> <span id="s179">This teacher married a clergyman.</span> <span id="s180">By 1937 or 1938, they had been very close.</span> <span id="s181">They traveled together – really a close friend.</span> <span id="s182">I remember hearing my mother say that she had run into this clergyman and he did not acknowledge her on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: So that friendship had collapsed?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Well, she felt that it was not the friendship which had collapsed, it was the political pressure which had been put on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Did you notice any anti-Semitism outside of school; in other words with all the Jewish kids going to one school, did your school become a target?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Oh, I can remember one incident.</span> <span id="s187">The school was downtown, so I had to take a streetcar to get there, and I remember one day, walking from school to the streetcar.</span> <span id="s188">That was a distance of several blocks.</span> <span id="s189">Children chased me yelling insults and throwing stones, and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Did that happen often?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Only once that I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: That is enough!</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s194">You know that is a lot for a six or seven year old to have to deal with.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q; But there was not a regular gathering, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: What year did you leave Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: We left Cologne right after Kristallnacht [the night of November 9th and 10th, 1938, when all the synagogues and Jewish owned stores in Germany were looted and torched; some residences desecrated and Jewish males arrested] which was in 1938.</span> <span id="s199">I think we left right then, but there is an entire story there.</span> <span id="s200">I don’t know if you want me to go into it?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: I would like to ask you a couple of things first.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A” All right!</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Do you recall your first awareness of Hitler and the NAZIS?</span> <span id="s204">[NAZI stands for National Socialist party which was the official name of the party led by Hitler.]</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: My first awareness was – and it is funny the kind of things which you remember – when the Rhineland, which after WWI was ceded to the French, or part of that area was, then it reverted back to Germany.</span> <span id="s206">[Actually the Treaty of Versailles which ended WWI determined that the French, the British and the Belgians would station troops, each in some area of the Rhineland.</span> <span id="s207">One of Hitler’s early and most popular successes was to ask these troops, who were to assure Germany’s disarmament, to leave German soil, and they left.]</span> <span id="s208">I can remember my father shaving early in the morning.</span> <span id="s209">He was standing in the bathroom and he had the radio on.</span> <span id="s210">I can remember that he was listening to the speeches when that reversal was made, but I really didn’t have any idea, you know.</span> <span id="s211">I was five, six or seven years old and then you don’t have any awareness of political activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Was your father someone to be afraid of?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: No, he was a very kind, gentle man.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: That is interesting.</span> <span id="s215">Where did you get that impression from that he was that kind of a person?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Just his manners.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: I never heard him described like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Oh, you were speaking of Hitler?</span> <span id="s219">Oh no!</span> <span id="s220">I thought that you were asking how I got the impression that my father was a gentle person.</span> <span id="s221">Oh no!</span> <span id="s222">I am sorry!</span> <span id="s223">We were talking about different men.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: I thought that you saw Hitler tapping children on the head and thought that that was your impression!</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Oh, no, no, no!</span> <span id="s226">He was just a name to me.</span> <span id="s227">I didn’t know who Hitler was.</span> <span id="s228">Until Kristallnacht there were no camps.</span> <span id="s229">[Actually that was not the case, however, before Kristallnach, Jews were arrested for personal or political reasons, generally not just religious.]</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: I believe that camps stated in 1933, some of them, maybe not in any widespread way.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Well, very surreptitiously maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: So you were in Germany then when the Nuremberg laws went into effect, some of the specific laws, having to carry on identification and having to adopt special names [Sarah for women and Moses for men.</span> <span id="s233">These were laws which were promulgated in 1935 at a NAZI party conclave legalizing anti-Jewish discriminations.]</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: I believe those laws came after we left.</span> <span id="s235">I remember that one day they said that my father can’t practice medicine any more.</span> <span id="s236">[That was a law promulgated in 1934.]</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Do you remember what year that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s239">I just know these things from hearing my mother talk about them.</span> <span id="s240">My recollections, such as they are, started with Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: What happened that night?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: My father was arrested and my mother called a surgeon friend of my father’s who had two young boys who were the same age as my sister and I in order to warn them.</span> <span id="s243">However, he had already been arrested, so my mother, who drove [a rather unusual capability for a woman at that time], she was one of the few women who, at that time drove an automobile, went to pick up these two boys and took us, four children, way out of the city to gentile friends of my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">I remember that these friends hid us up in an attic.</span> <span id="s245">The four kids spent the day after Kristallnacht up in the attic.</span> <span id="s246">Of course these people were laying their lives on the line, because, you know, if someone would know on their door and they would be found out, it was going to be their neck.</span> <span id="s247">While we were there, my mother was busy.</span> <span id="s248">My father had been the – maybe because he spoke English – house physician to both the U.S. and the British embassies.</span> <span id="s249">[She probably means consulates, since the embassies were in Berlin.]</span> <span id="s250">He knew the consuls at both consulates very well.</span> <span id="s251">As a matter of fact, the U.S. consul had a little boy our age who would come over and play, and we would go over to his house and play.</span> <span id="s252">When the arrest happened, my mother went over to the embassy [meaning consulate] and told them what had happened.</span> <span id="s253">She said: “You just have to get us papers to get out of Germany, so that I can get my husband released!”</span> <span id="s254">[In 1938, the Germans freed any Jew who was not held for specific charges, as soon as he obtained the necessary papers to emigrate to some other country.]</span> <span id="s255">They indeed did this.</span> <span id="s256">She went to the authorities with these emigration papers.</span> <span id="s257">Of course the U.S. had their quotas, so you couldn’t get any place with them.</span> <span id="s258">[These were numbers of allowable immigrants from each nationality set up to maintain the makeup of the U.S. population which existed first in 1921 and 1927, except for people from Japan or China as stipulated by law.]</span> <span id="s259">The British consulate [she still calls it the embassy] did give us entry papers to England, on a temporary basis, basically until we could move on to the U.S. My parents had already applied for immigration into the U.S. before Kristallnacht, but the waiting list was three or four years long at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">My mother was able to get him released.</span> <span id="s261">A few days later – I don’t remember the number of days; it may only have been the next day – but after he got home, I remember that we all go on the train and went across the border to Amsterdam [that is in Holland at 51.57N, 5.25E].</span> <span id="s262">I believe that Amsterdam was a five-hour ride by car from Cologne and we would occasionally go there for a weekend.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Whenever we went, my father took money across the border.</span> <span id="s264">[That was a highly dangerous process since it was illegal and searches both body search and disassembly of cars including such things as the spare tire were frequent and neighbors were bribed by the Nazis to spy on people hiding things and then report them.</span> <span id="s265">Attempts to export money – even your own – this way was a criminal offense and resulted in immediate, lengthy prison sentences.</span> <span id="s266">Otherwise, by 1938 individuals were allowed to take very minute sums, around $25.00 per person with them when they left Germany] and left it with some relatives in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s267">You know that was being saved toward the day when we would need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">I remember very distinctly -- I was talking about it with a friend recently – going to the railroad station with some friends who saw us off and with the grandparents.</span> <span id="s269">Everybody was weeping copiously because they knew that we would never see one another again – at least that was most likely.</span> <span id="s270">It was a very traumatic parting.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">We got on the train going to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s272">We spent maybe a couple of weeks in Amsterdam before we took the boat to England.</span> <span id="s273">There, there were also already friends and relatives.</span> <span id="s274">The two children lived with the family of the girl who had worked for us.</span> <span id="s275">This girl had been told several years before that she no longer could work for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s276">[That was part of the Nuremberg laws of 1935.]</span> <span id="s277">She had gotten a job in a boarding school in Italy and she was working in Italy at that point.</span> <span id="s278">However, her parents took us children in and my parents lived in a furnished room.</span> <span id="s279">You know that we had a little money, but not much.</span> <span id="s280">They just sat there and waited for about one year until our number came up to come to the U.S. [It was always most difficult to be allowed to work in a country not your own, since unemployment in Europe was still excessive, except in Germany where a lively armament industry as well as the paying by the state of the Nazi storm-troopers was distributing paper money.]</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Now the night on which your father was arrested, did they give a reason for the arrest?</span> <span id="s282">[The arrest came right after Kristallnacht when all Jewish males were rounded up.]</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: They just came to the house and arrested him?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s286">They said: “Come with us!”</span> <span id="s287">and that was that.</span> <span id="s288">Interestingly though, my father enjoyed such a fabulous reputation and he was so loved by his patients that the house was not touched on Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s289">You know that they went around smashing windows and destroying property.</span> <span id="s290">[All synagogues and stores owned by Jews were looted, etc.</span> <span id="s291">That was more than three years after he had been allowed to practice medicine legally in Germany, since in 1934 a law came out that all Jewish doctors were, from then on, downgraded to “Jewish healers” and that no Aryan could be treated by them.]</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: What happened to the house after you were gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Well it was purchased by somebody, however no money ever changed hands.</span> <span id="s294">[Actually Jewish business and properties were bought for whatever the buyer wanted to and the money was deposited in a bank and sequestered.</span> <span id="s295">By a law issued around 1948, all these forced sales were called back and legal disposition of properties was made.]</span> <span id="s296">Then there was no settlement made until long after the war when restitution payments were started.</span> <span id="s297">Then it was only a fraction of what it was worth, because it was a forced sale.</span> <span id="s298">The house is still standing.</span> <span id="s299">I have gone back and I saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Did you go to school right up to the time you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Even after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: This family that you hid out with, what do you remember about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: They were a childless couple who were near my parents’ age.</span> <span id="s306">How they became friendly with my parents, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s307">I know they had traveled together.</span> <span id="s308">I remember that he had lost an eye during World War I, and that he had a glass eye.</span> <span id="s309">When my husband and I took my children to Europe in 1961, I believe, we made a stop in Cologne.</span> <span id="s310">We looked these people up and we had lunch with them one day.</span> <span id="s311">We also had dinner at their house, but subsequently we really lost touch with them.</span> <span id="s312">My mother died a couple of years ago.</span> <span id="s313">She was sort of our link to them, so now I don’t know where they are and whether they are still living at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: When you spent those two weeks with them, would you say that that was the time period?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yes, about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Did you have the feeling of being on the run?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: No, we were kids; that was a lark!</span> <span id="s318">We had been there before.</span> <span id="s319">You know it was like another vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: You had no feelings of fear then?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: You were saying that when you were in England you and your sister were with the family of your English girl and your parents lived in a furnished room?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Did you live separately from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yes, we lived separately during that year.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Where did you go to school during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: You know, the English have a different school system than we do.</span> <span id="s328">“Public schools” are really private schools.</span> <span id="s329">What we would call public schools are “Downhick/Somwick” [It sounds like this but transcriber is not certain.]</span> <span id="s330">The family we were with were devoted Catholic people and their children attended private Catholic school.</span> <span id="s331">So they went to the administration at their school and talked to the sisters and explained the situation.</span> <span id="s332">So the sisters said yes, that we could come to school with their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">We did that.</span> <span id="s334">I remember that that was sort of a weird situation because we had to attend catechism in classes and I always sort of had a feeling that the sisters were proselytizing me.</span> <span id="s335">You know, they were trying to sway you toward their religion and their way of thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: You were not receptive?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No, you know, I sat and listened and that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q; You had a pretty sound sense of yourself as a Jewish person?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Not really!</span> <span id="s340">However, I didn’t consider myself a Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: So you went to school there for a year.</span> <span id="s342">How often did you see your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Oh, two or three times a week.</span> <span id="s344">You know that we would see them on weekends and maybe once during the week.</span> <span id="s345">They weren’t too far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: What city were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: The little suburban area where we lived was Harrowield -- [At least that is what it sounds like.]</span> <span id="s348">– which is maybe one hour subway ride outside of London.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: That is the London subway.</span> <span id="s350">They lived in the same area.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Yes, they were in the next little suburban area.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: When did your number come up for emigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: We came into the U.S. in December 1939.</span> <span id="s354">[The war between England and Germany had started in September 1939.]</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Were you pretty much aware when you were in England that this was just a stopping off point?</span> <span id="s356">That you were going to be leaving soon?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: What were your feelings about leaving Germany and going to to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: I really had no strong feelings.</span> <span id="s360">At that age, you take whatever comes!</span> <span id="s361">Children then were so much more sheltered.</span> <span id="s362">Children were raised to be seen and not heard.</span> <span id="s363">I know few adults talked to children.</span> <span id="s364">Nobody talked to children or explained to children.</span> <span id="s365">They were told: “This is it; this is the way it is going to be,” and that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Did you come to the U.S. on a boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s368">The war had already started.</span> <span id="s369">I can remember the blackouts in London.</span> <span id="s370">We did leave before the air raids started.</span> <span id="s371">When we left Southampton [50.55N, 1.25 W], the British waters had already been mined.</span> <span id="s372">I remember the first two nights out of Southampton my mother wouldn’t let us go out of bed.</span> <span id="s373">She was up late at night because if we were going to hit a mine, she was not going to be up on deck somewhere while we were down in the stateroom where she would have to come looking for us.</span> <span id="s374">So we got to stay up late the first couple of nights.</span> <span id="s375">That was a big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: So that seemed more like fun to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Right, right!</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Were you very much aware of your parent’s feelings during all of this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s380">As a matter of fact, as I mentioned to you, my mother died two years ago and I really didn’t have a whole lot of understanding until I went through baskets of correspondence which I found in her house.</span> <span id="s381">What we were going through was amazing.</span> <span id="s382">I found letters from after they got here.</span> <span id="s383">We arrived in December to the U.S. and we went to Cincinnati where my father had a cousin who was a physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">So my father decided to come to Ohio because that was one of the few states which still allowed foreigners to take medical boards.</span> <span id="s385">We lived in a very small apartment in Cincinnati and he studied with other immigrant friends whom he had made for the medical board exams.</span> <span id="s386">The exams were to take place in June.</span> <span id="s387">My sister and I went to school.</span> <span id="s388">All this time, things were getting worse and worse [in Germany].</span></p> <p><span id="s389">My mother, of course, corresponded with her parents and my father corresponded with his parents and with his brother.</span> <span id="s390">My father passed the medical boards in August and went into practice in the suburban area of Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s391">By September 1940, he was not feeling well.</span> <span id="s392">My mother took him to the doctor and the doctor said that he had leukemia and that there is nothing he can do.</span> <span id="s393">So my father was in the hospital for weeks and then they sent him home.</span> <span id="s394">They said that he was to check in as an outpatient every Friday, and that they would try to transfuse him.</span> <span id="s395">This went on until about March or April.</span> <span id="s396">Then he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: This was in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: No, in 1940, the year after we arrived.</span> <span id="s399">No, it was 1941, because in 1940 he went into practice.</span> <span id="s400">However, in this correspondence which I found when my mother died, they were trying to make arrangements to get my uncle to Cuba [at that time you could purchase visas for Cuba, Panama and China] anyplace where we could get him out to.</span> <span id="s401">Evidently things didn’t move along.</span> <span id="s402">They were terribly frustrated at every turn because there were no agencies in existence to facilitate things other than, maybe, the JDC [American Joint Distribution Committee which at times worked together with HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which attempted to assist people to emigrate from Germany and all Europe at the time] which was not very helpful at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Let me go back just a little bit.</span> <span id="s404">Where did you arrive in the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: In New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Did your family pick you up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yes, we had family in New York.</span> <span id="s408">We stayed there for a couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Do you recall your impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: It was December and it was cold.</span> <span id="s411">That is all I can remember.</span> <span id="s412">As a matter of fact, it was colder than that in Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s413">The Ohio River was frozen.</span> <span id="s414">My first impression of Cincinnati was that the people could walk across to the Kentucky side.</span> <span id="s415">I just can’t believe how bitterly cold it was.</span> <span id="s416">That was before pantyhose.</span> <span id="s417">We just had knee socks.</span> <span id="s418">I remember that our knees were so cold, we cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Did you stay with your relatives in Cincinnati at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Just for a few days, until we were able to find an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Is that where you lived during the rest of your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Only until my father knew that he had passed his boards.</span> <span id="s423">Then he bought a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: What was the apartment like?</span> <span id="s425">In what part of the city was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: It was on Rockdale Avenue in Cincinnati, Ohio.</span> <span id="s427">It was a one-bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s428">We, the children, had a bedroom and my parents slept on a convertible sofa bed in the living room.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: So they came without much money?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: I don’t really know.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: How long did it take before your father passed his medical boards?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: That was six or seven months and it is August before they get the results.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: During that time, did your parents do anything to make money?</span> <span id="s434">Did they have any income?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Do you have any idea how they made it?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: You know, the money which they had been able to get out of Germany over the years, wasn’t much.</span> <span id="s438">I think that they got some help from our relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: After he passed his boards, did he go into practice soon after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s441">The office was in his house, and he was able to start out.</span> <span id="s442">There was a need for a doctor in the area where he opened his practice and he soon had a nice practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Where did you go to school in Cincinnati?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Walnut Hills.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: So it was a big advantage knowing English.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Oh, absolutely!</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: You had no language problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: What did you find different about this country?</span> <span id="s450">Did you find anything difficult to get used to?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Oh, it was very different.</span> <span id="s452">As I said, we were used to a very structured existence.</span> <span id="s453">You know, everything was programmed for us.</span> <span id="s454">Children were never asked or nothing was discussed with them.</span> <span id="s455">They were told: “This is what you are going to do.</span> <span id="s456">This is the way it is!”</span> <span id="s457">and that was that.</span> <span id="s458">You know, we never thought to question it.</span> <span id="s459">Things here were much more relaxed.</span> <span id="s460">I don’t know whether my mother ever got used to it, at least she didn’t until very much later in her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Just the attitudes of other members of your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Right!</span> <span id="s463">Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Did you make friends very quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: I think so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Were there a lot of children in the neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s468">As a matter of fact, the house which my father bought was right across the street from the high school.</span> <span id="s469">Yes, we both made friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: It was pretty easy for you to fit in academically as far as subjects you already knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yes, as a matter of fact, we both ended up a year ahead of where we should have been age-wise, on the basis of their testing.</span> <span id="s472">This did not bother me, but it did bother my sister.</span> <span id="s473">Socially, she was not able to handle it.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: When did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Oh, when I was in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: What college did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: To the University of Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s478">I was able to get scholarship aid, scholarship loan.</span> <span id="s479">I met my husband during my second year at the University.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: How did your mother make a living after your father passed away?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: She got a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Factory work.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: So, that is a big change in life-style.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s486">My mother had been used to living with a silver spoon in her mouth.</span> <span id="s487">She had had a houseful of help so this was a real come-down for her; but she had to support two kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Did she cope well with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: I don’t know whether she coped well with it, but we coped.</span> <span id="s490">She was a very strong, very determined person.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Did you or your sister work at all to help out?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: We always worked summers, once we were old enough so that we could get work permits.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Did your sister also go to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yes, also to the University of Cincinnati.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: What was your major at the University?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: My major was Applied Arts.</span> <span id="s497">My sister is a Research Chemist.</span> <span id="s498">Chemistry was her major.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Is she married also?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Did you find that after this experience, that your parents’ attitude toward the Jewish people and their attitude towards religious practice changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yes, my father, of course, died within a year or so, so I can’t speak for him.</span> <span id="s503">He had always been a Zionist while in Europe.</span> <span id="s504">My mother, is she wasn’t Jewish herself, you would say that she was anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s505">She felt that the Jewish agencies, such as they were, were very unhelpful.</span> <span id="s506">She was very resentful about the fact that she became a widow almost as soon as she came here, and that when she wanted to send us to Sunday School, many congregations in Cincinnati wouldn’t accept us because we weren’t members.</span> <span id="s507">There was not way that she was in a position financially to become a member of a congregation.</span> <span id="s508">She held that grudge till the day she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: So you really kind of found yourselves not being in any way taken into the arms of the Jewish community in Cincinnati?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: They didn’t have any groups who reached out for refugees?</span> <span id="s512">[i.e. people who fled Hitler]</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: I think that it was a classic case of total misunderstanding.</span> <span id="s514">I remember hearing my mother talk about going to a meeting.</span> <span id="s515">I don’t know whether it was a JCC [Jewish Community Council] or a meeting which had been organized to help refugees, and she said that it was the most ridiculous thing.</span> <span id="s516">They were teaching these people to sing American songs like “Mother’s baby likes shortening, shortening,” and she said we are worried about how we are going to get our families out of Europe and they are singing songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">I can see both sides.</span> <span id="s518">I can see that the Americans were totally unaware about what was going to happen and what was happening and that, although they were well-intentioned, it missed the mark completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: What kind of efforts did your mother make in trying to get her family out of there?</span> <span id="s520">You said that both sets of grandparents were left in Germany, and an uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Yes, my father’s brother was still there and so were m y mother’s parents, and my paternal grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Any other close family members whom you know about?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: No!</span> <span id="s524">My father’s older brother had been killed during WWI.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Does your family have any idea what happened to these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: My maternal grandfather died at home.</span> <span id="s527">My paternal grandfather and my maternal grandmother and my uncle were all taken to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s528">The grandparents did not survive and we really don’t know any details.</span> <span id="s529">They just perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Miraculously my uncle survived.</span> <span id="s531">He got in touch with my mother after the war, when the Russians liberated him.</span> <span id="s532">I do believe that he was in the camp of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s533">[That, presumable was the concentration camp which the Nazis used to show to the Red Cross, etc. how humanely they treated inmates.]</span> <span id="s534">Even at that time my mother wanted him to come to this country.</span> <span id="s535">However, he was a bachelor and he felt that he had lived out his life.</span> <span id="s536">At that point he was already in his mid-fifties.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">He thought that it was just too late for him to start in a new country.</span> <span id="s538">He met a woman whom he had known as a young man in Cologne, who had also been in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s539">Together they made their way back to Cologne.</span> <span id="s540">Eventually he married her.</span> <span id="s541">He has been dead for some years now.</span> <span id="s542">She is still loving although she is in her nineties and totally senile.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Did you see him again when you were in Cologne?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s545">I saw him for the first time again in 1951.</span> <span id="s546">My husband was drafted during the Korean War, you know, in the draft of doctors.</span> <span id="s547">Fortunately my husband was sent to Germany rather than Korea.</span> <span id="s548">However, that did take a little manipulation on his part.</span> <span id="s549">He explained to the army that his wife had lived in Germany, that I had business to transact in Germany, and that he would like to be stationed there.</span> <span id="s550">They let him.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">My uncle and his wife came to the airport when I flew over with Margie, my daughter, who was about one year old at that time.</span> <span id="s552">They met us at the airport in Frankfurt [50.01N, 8.41E since this was undoubtedly Frankfurt-Main, the large U.S. base in West Germany].</span> <span id="s553">My husband had gone over, of course, when his orders were cut.</span> <span id="s554">That was about three months before I could go over.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">He had to have housing for us before we could go.</span> <span id="s556">He had already been in Cologne to see them before I got there, because he had gone to Bremerhafen [53.33N, 8.35E] to pick up his automobile.</span> <span id="s557">He drove the car back to where he was stationed, which was just south of Munich [48.09N, 8.35E].</span> <span id="s558">On the way he had detoured through Cologne.</span> <span id="s559">He had found them in some little walk-up apartment, on the third floor.</span> <span id="s560">They were living in very primitive conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Have your religious beliefs changed any or are they just as they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: I belong to a congregation and have done so as long as I have been married.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Were you married by a rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s565">Interestingly is the fact that disinterested as my mother was in anything religious, I remember that she always told us: “Girls, when you get married, I would prefer it if you would marry a Jewish man.”</span> <span id="s566">Yes, we did have a rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Was your husband religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s569">He came from a Conservative background.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Did his family keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: His mother did.</span> <span id="s572">Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Do you keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: No.</span> <span id="s575">I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Are you Reform?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Now I am.</span> <span id="s578">My husband died.</span> <span id="s579">I was a widow for four and one-half years before I remarried.</span> <span id="s580">By that time my children were both in college and away from home.</span> <span id="s581">My second husband is a member of Temple Israel, so I also became a temple member.</span> <span id="s582">There didn’t seem to be much point in having two affiliations.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Are they both girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: No.</span> <span id="s587">A boy and a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Your son was Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So you were Conservative until your second marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Was it just the fact that your husband was religious which made you join a temple or synagogue?</span> <span id="s593">Do you think that you would have been more like your parents – unaffiliated – otherwise?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s595">My husband’s family were always very careful to include my mother in all the Holy Days.</span> <span id="s596">She got up to enjoy the tradition, you know, the family getting together; although, from the religious standpoint, she had no involvement.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: I guess everyone whom I have interviewed so far had a family background which was very assimilated and are now members either at Beth Abraham [the Conservative synagogue in Dayton] or Temple Israel [the Reform synagogue in Dayton].</span> <span id="s598">I guess that it is a generational thing, but did you find that you needed some kind of affiliation which your parents didn’t need?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: No, I think that it is a matter of different customs and my husband, as I said, grew up in a Conservative synagogue in Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s600">He came from a kosher home, and all the holidays were observed.</span> <span id="s601">It was just a pattern which I fell into.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: So you think the religious customs are different in Amer5ica than they are in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Oh, I think so.</span> <span id="s604">My mother, as I said earlier, saw the handwriting on the wall back in 1933.</span> <span id="s605">My father, however, had been an officer in the German army during WWI, and thought that this was just another political phase which they were going to go through.</span> <span id="s606">He felt that once this phase ended, there would be another phase.</span> <span id="s607">He believed that nothing was going to happen.</span> <span id="s608">That changed in 1938 when – I would say before 1938 because they had already applied for immigration to the U.S. before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s609">[After all, father could not function as a doctor after 1935.</span> <span id="s610">Other anti-Jewish laws were progressively imposed all the time, including the Nuremberg Laws of 1935.]</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: So your mother never affiliated with a synagogue?</span> <span id="s612">She just got to enjoy the traditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: And your children are both married to Jewish partners?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Are they pretty much Conservative?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s618">My daughter’s husband belongs to the temple in Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s619">She is very unhappy with the temple services.</span> <span id="s620">She feels that she grew up in a Conservative synagogue and, with Sunday School there, she feels that their services are not adequate.</span> <span id="s621">Oh, she just isn’t happy with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Are you content with Temple Israel here in Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s624">I am very comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">END OF INTERVIEW Please note that interjections by interviewer are set off by brackets, i.e. [ ]</span></p></body></html>
