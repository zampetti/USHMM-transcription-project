brother dressed again in my clothing because for a boy it was not so good to go.</span> <span id="s560">He dressed like a girl and he stumbled on dead bodies and stones.</span> <span id="s561">There were many dead horses on the street and people were eating the horse meat on the street.</span> <span id="s562">And my brother went to the ghetto to visit my grandmother and my aunt and they were alive.</span> <span id="s563">They were very thin, they looked like two girls, they were so thin.</span> <span id="s564">But they were alive.</span> <span id="s565">But they couldn’t take us home because the house was bombardiered, the part of it of the apartment, and it was winter.</span> <span id="s566">It was very cold, so we had to stay in the orphanage longer time for a few other months.</span> <span id="s567">Then my two brothers went to the orphanage home and just me, I went home with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s568">But for a while I went also to the home.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q; Were you near the Danube?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Did you see any of the massacres along the river front?</span></p> <p><span

shore because they was very angry.</span> <span id="s579">They was wild in the last part.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: These were the Arrow Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Yes, yes, they was wild.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And then it’s only at the end of the war that you find out what had happened to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: We was waiting there years and years and we went to all the organizations; we did not know what happened with them for many years and we were always waiting.</span> <span id="s584">When I saw a lady sitting on the bench then I -- maybe this is my mother, maybe she forgets where she lives or something.</span> <span id="s585">But then I get a letter -- my mother gets a postcard from a hospital in Budapest and the lady was together with my mother.</span> <span id="s586">She saw her.</span> <span id="s587">And then a neighbor in my grandmother’s house, she saw her dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: And your grandmother, this is…?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Vilma Mahrer, and this lady, Mrs. Pollack, she was dying and when she was dying she said she was together -- she did not want to tell us.</span> <span id="s590">But then when she was dying she told us what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: This is which.</span> <span id="s592">.</span> <span id="s593">?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: My mother,</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Your mother, this woman told you what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Yes, my grandmother’s neighbor was with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: In Ravensbruck?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A; Yeah, Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: What about your family of your future husband?</span> <span id="s600">Do you remember anything about what your husband’s experience was like at the end of the war?</span> <span id="s601">You mentioned that he was sent to different camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yeah, different camps, yes.</span> <span id="s603">He was 28 kilo and was very sick, tuberculosis, diarrhea, etc. etc.</span> <span id="s604">They put him in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: And then he was sent to Sweden.</span> <span id="s606">Was he sent to Sweden from Hungary or from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: No, the English army liberated him in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s608">Their job was to carry the dead bodies to a big, big grave.</span> <span id="s609">That’s what they were supposed to do, by the wrist, you know.</span> <span id="s610">And then he was so weak he couldn’t do it anymore and he lay down among the dead bodies.</span> <span id="s611">Then when the English army came in, the soldiers take his pulse and he said in English because he knew a few words in English, don’t leave me here I am alive, he says in English for the soldier, don’t leave me here, take me in the barracks because I am alive, 6631 is my number and my brother’s number is 6630.</span> <span id="s612">Take a look where he is, find my brother and bring him to me.</span> <span id="s613">And accidentally my son was born in 1966 April the thirtieth, the same number what this Gyussi had and therefore he is named Gyussi.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Now your husband, he went to Sweden, was he sent to Sweden by the British or was it the Swedish Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: The king himself was very much moved when they saw the pictures.</span> <span id="s616">They gave a ship and I think the Red Cross, I don’t know, they took them to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: So your future husband went from Bergen-Belsen to Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Maybe first he was in the hospital but yes, he was very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: So he went to Sweden and then he came back to Hungary after…?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: He was there two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: And then they reopened their store and then sometime later you met him there.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yes, I was vacationing over there.</span> <span id="s623">I met him.</span> <span id="s624">He had nobody and I had nobody and we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: And then the family grew.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: When you think about all of these events in the Holocaust, what comes to mind above all else?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: I think it was a big injustice what happened because we were really ordinary innocent people who did not hurt anybody.</span> <span id="s629">We did not take nothing from anybody and we did not hurt anybody and really it was a big injustice.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: What do you say to those who claim that it never happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: We have to read them all the stories what people are telling them and if they listen to the stories they will believe it.</span> <span id="s632">One person can lie, two persons can lie, but so many people cannot lie.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Do you have any other reflections?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Yes, I say that not everybody is a bad person and you have to look in everybody, the nice and the good, and in myself, in my person, I don’t hate anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: How did people survive?</span> <span id="s636">What was the difference between surviving and not surviving?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: In my case, in Budapest, the only thing that I was lucky because I could die or from the bombardiering or from the hiding, every day I was in danger, and I get sick of it.</span> <span id="s638">I get thyroid problem and I’m on psychiatric care.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Your sense of this time, did you and family members, was there a determination to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A; Everybody wanted to survive, yes.</span> <span id="s641">That’s what it is -- determination.</span> <span id="s642">It doesn’t matter how and why and where but we have to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: And what were you thinking of the future?</span> <span id="s644">Was there any discussion about the future whether this would come to an end?</span> <span id="s645">Was there any feeling that perhaps the Nazis would lose?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: There was a feeling that they would lose, yes.</span> <span id="s647">.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: From the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: From the beginning, yes.</span> <span id="s650">We had a feeling that they would lose.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Did your parents, for example, did they think that this was a temporary disaster?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yes, that what they were thinking.</span> <span id="s653">Maybe they were wrong but they were thinking that we just…</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: A storm, a passing storm?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yes, and it will pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q; When did you realize, again you were a young girl, that the war was almost over and that the suffering might soon come to an end?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: I’ll tell you something, when my mother was still at home in November, we put our ears on the pillow, and we heard the guns and the fighting.</span> <span id="s658">It was not too far from Budapest, already, the Russians were very close.</span> <span id="s659">They were really close, we could hear them.</span> <span id="s660">Unfortunately they were not close enough and it took time then to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: The irony is that your parents who did survive so long were taken away just before the final liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Yes, almost to the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Well, on behalf of the Holocaust Museum I would like to thank you for your time and your help.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Okay, anytime.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s666">PAGE 1</span></p></body></html>
