id="s3">Mrs. Anderman is a survivor of the Holocaust and she has graciously consented to talk with us about some of her experiences during that very terrible time.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Mrs. Anderman, before we started the tape recording you told me that you had come originally from Poland.</span> <span id="s5">Would you tell me a little bit about your early life, did you come from a large family, a small town or a large town, what did your parents do for a living, and anything else you would like to tell me about that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I was born in Cracow.</span> <span id="s7">It was a very lovely town at that time and my father was a business man, and my mother worked right along with him.</span> <span id="s8">We used to be in the center of the town, his business was in the same building where we had our apartment.</span> <span id="s9">I was the oldest, I have two brothers, they are still here, in Sarasota, they survived the war.</span> <span id="s10">One brother lives in Sarasota and one brother lives in Detroit.</span> <span id="s11">I was the oldest, we were about seven and nine years apart because in between was the first World War and my father went to war.</span> <span id="s12">I lived there for some time until I got married in Cracow to my first husband.</span> <span id="s13">I have one daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Excuse me, I want to go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s15">What kind of business were your parents in.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: That was a dry-goods business.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And were you a very religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My father was on the religious side, my mother was not.</span> <span id="s19">She was very assimilated because she came from this kind of a home and we never spoke so much Jewish at home.</span> <span id="s20">I never knew the language but I understood.</span> <span id="s21">My mother said “you have to speak the language of the country”.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Did you have any religious training or education?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s24">I had to learn how to read Hebrew, I had a tutor coming to our home, but I forgot all about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: And your brothers, were they Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yes, both of them, they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Did you observe the Jewish holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Yes, very much so, I am very traditional, even right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: How much formal education did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Being the oldest I had some responsibility at home, in fact I had the choice of helping my mother in the house with the chores and the children, or to help my father in the store.</span> <span id="s31">So I chose to be in the store which I have enjoyed always very much.</span> <span id="s32">But it took too much of my time.</span> <span id="s33">I finished high school and I wanted to continue studying but I had a problem, I couldn’t win.</span> <span id="s34">I was studious, but I couldn’t win.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: I mean my parents were dead against it.</span> <span id="s37">My father especially used to say, a girl doesn’t need a formal education.</span> <span id="s38">That was the trend in those days.</span> <span id="s39">Maybe I wasn’t strong enough, I just gave up.</span> <span id="s40">But I achieved one thing.</span> <span id="s41">They let me go for two years to a business academy.</span> <span id="s42">If I would have finished four years, that was a four year study, I would have had quite a formal education.</span> <span id="s43">But they wanted me to just learn the business part and I just took Algebra and different things.</span> <span id="s44">I did very well, I was going for two years and after two years my parents said ‘ you have to stop’.</span> <span id="s45">They said they needed me.</span> <span id="s46">Not that they couldn’t afford it, they could afford it, they were not poor people.</span> <span id="s47">But my brothers -- my older brother, he was younger than I was, he went to the Gymnasium, I don’t know what grade it is here to compare with, but from Gymnasium he went straight to college.</span> <span id="s48">He finished the Gymnasium mostly by correspondence.</span> <span id="s49">My younger brother was too young to speak of, but he educated himself when he came to this country, he was young enough.</span> <span id="s50">He went to school and continued to study when he was already in business.</span> <span id="s51">He never gave up.</span> <span id="s52">When I came to this country I didn’t know how to speak English, but I started to go to evening classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">I finished high school here.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: So it’s never too late to learn.</span> <span id="s55">Let me go back again, I’m trying to keep this in as much sequence as possible.</span> <span id="s56">While you were growing up were you conscious of any anti-semitism occurring either in Crakow or in geeneral or to you and your family in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes, I say yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Do you remember any specific incidence?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: The people who came to deal with my father, they would say, ‘let’s go to the Jew, he is pretty honest’ because they couldn’t bargain in his store.</span> <span id="s60">My father never believed in bargaining.</span> <span id="s61">He set the price and that was it.</span> <span id="s62">Or I have friends that were in college boyfriends and they used to go with the canes to protect themselves because they used to be attacked going to school.</span> <span id="s63">There were terrible things going on.</span> <span id="s64">We knew that the situation wasn’t too good, but there wasn’t any immediate danger or anything like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: When did you begin to feel that there was immediate danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: It was starting in about 1938, 1937, when Hitler --- my husband had two sisters, one in Vienna and one in Berlin and there were letters coming what they were going through, so my husband predicted that we were going to have the same problem here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: But not until 1938?</span> <span id="s68">The reason I’m questioning this is that Hitler came to power in 1933 in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Before it didn’t happen to us but it did happen to some other people.</span> <span id="s70">They were breaking into the store demolishing some goods and it happened, it happened.</span> <span id="s71">There were certain holidays, I forgot already what they were, in November, not a Jewish holiday, a working class holiday.</span> <span id="s72">Those days were dangerous days, people were unhappy.</span> <span id="s73">They thought Jewish people take away something from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: So you saw the Jews as the scapegoats for their unhappiness?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: And what were the kind of things that were likely to occur when they became upset and unhappy?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: There was lots of drinking and breaking glasses and windows in stores and things like that.</span> <span id="s78">They didn’t attack women or anything like that, but mostly there were problems in schools and colleges.</span> <span id="s79">We had a very well known college in Cracow.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: You mentioned a few minutes ago that you got married in Cracow.</span> <span id="s81">How old were you when you got married and how did you meet your husband and what was your life like after marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: I was married in Cracow, right.</span> <span id="s83">When we got engaged I was 181/2 years old and when I got married I was about 19 years old.</span> <span id="s84">Very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: And what work did your husband do?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: He was a dentist.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: He was also Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Was it hard for a man, a Jewish man, to become a dentist, was there discrimination?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: No.</span> <span id="s91">He wasn’t a doctor, he was practicing dentistry and he had a laboratory where he made artificial teeth and things like that.</span> <span id="s92">We had a nice life.</span> <span id="s93">It lasted about seven years.</span> <span id="s94">My child was born in Cracow, one daughter.</span> <span id="s95">We had a nice social life, a nice place to live, and my parents were very happy having him for a son-in-law.</span> <span id="s96">I had to learn many things, he was about 12 years older than I was so I learned a lot about different things, how to behave, how to dress.</span> <span id="s97">I was a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: At that age, between 18 and 30 . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: He had a bunch of friends, they were about his age, too.</span> <span id="s100">In the beginning I felt a little bit funny but it worked out fine.</span> <span id="s101">Everything was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Where did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: In his office.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: So you say everything was fine for about seven years.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes, we got married in 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And then, what began to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Well, the war.</span> <span id="s108">We got married in 1931, we were married more than 7 years, about nine years when the war came, 1939, and there was a bit panic in Cracow.</span> <span id="s109">They said the Germans were coming and they were going to kill off all the men.</span> <span id="s110">All the Jewish men, of course.</span> <span id="s111">Later on they were killing anybody they could lay their hands on.</span> <span id="s112">My husband didn’t want to leave me, they said women were safe, but . . . that was the first very traumatic thing that happened to me.</span> <span id="s113">It was 1939 and the Germans were ready to invade.</span> <span id="s114">They were in Poland already but they were taking over our town.</span> <span id="s115">They were not in our town yet, but you could hear bombs and things like that.</span> <span id="s116">But they didn’t destroy the city because the city was too valuable to Polish people, so they gave the Germans the keys, the mayor of the town.</span> <span id="s117">But before all that happened --- he said, I am going to stay, I don’t care what is going to happen I am going to stay with you.</span> <span id="s118">So I didn’t want to give him advice.</span> <span id="s119">He asked me what to do , I couldn’t tell him.</span> <span id="s120">I know one thing, I couldn’t go with him.</span> <span id="s121">We had no car, no horses, no wagon, nothing.</span> <span id="s122">The child is small she was about 41/2 years old, she was a very fragile child.</span> <span id="s123">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s124">We would never make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Where would you want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: On the Russian side, to run away, to be safe.</span> <span id="s127">Well, my father left already.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Where did he go?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Also trying to get away my older brother.</span> <span id="s130">And they never made it, they came back.</span> <span id="s131">Nothing happened to him.</span> <span id="s132">And we made peace with ourselves, he is not going.</span> <span id="s133">All of a sudden somebody from the building came and said, ‘Are you staying here, are you crazy, they’ll kill you’.</span> <span id="s134">So he said, ‘ what should I do’.</span> <span id="s135">‘I said, if they are going to kill you you’d better go.</span> <span id="s136">I didn’t care what was going to happen to me, I know I couldn’t leave, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s137">So he left.</span> <span id="s138">When he left, and here I was in the middle of the room and I looked at the place and I said ‘ why did I let him go’.</span> <span id="s139">I ran out and I started to yell, but I couldn’t find him any more.</span> <span id="s140">And I never saw him again in my life.</span> <span id="s141">That was a terrible thing, a terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Where was he planning to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Wherever the Russians were, toward the Lemberg area, that way, towards East, in the Southern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s144">He was going towards Russia, but there were already some cities which did belong to Russia at that time.</span> <span id="s145">So he went that way, they were all going that way.</span> <span id="s146">Some people made it, some people didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s147">He made it, I know, because people were passing the border line and they came with the news that they saw him.</span> <span id="s148">And there were some people who were smuggling -- there were all kinds of things going on at that time.</span> <span id="s149">So I was left alone, my parents were in the same city.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Your mother was still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: My mother was with us.</span> <span id="s152">Although we didn’t live together I still kept the place and I kept his office and everything in tact.</span> <span id="s153">In fact I -- for a while I rented his office to some kind of a dentist so I got some rent from it to help me out.</span> <span id="s154">But then things became very very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Can you say more about it, in what way they became difficult to help us understand what it was like to live through that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Well, it was already a shortage of food and you never knew what to expect the next day.</span> <span id="s157">I had everything, and a beautifully furnished place, fur coats, and everything.</span> <span id="s158">One day there is a sign on the wall “all the Jews who have any kind of fur coats have to bring them back.”</span> <span id="s159">O.K, that was one thing.</span> <span id="s160">They were coming to different homes and if there was anything suspicious about some people, they were taking them away, they were shooting them and killing them.</span> <span id="s161">There was lots of killing going on.</span> <span id="s162">And they were pulling people out of their homes.</span> <span id="s163">I was in my own house and nothing happened, thanks God, at that time.</span> <span id="s164">The next thing was, at the end of 1939 when Cracow was invaded, 1940 they liquidated . . . they asked all the Jews together and go to Ghetto, to get out.</span> <span id="s165">They were forming a Ghetto and we were afraid of it so we . . .”</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Explain please.</span> <span id="s167">You did not already have a Ghetto, a Ghetto being all the people . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: They wanted all the Jews in one place.</span> <span id="s169">Yes.</span> <span id="s170">But before that happened we decided that we were going to escape that.</span> <span id="s171">Maybe people thought that war would be very very brief, that very soon the war would be over because of the Blitzkrieg.</span> <span id="s172">So we went out to suburb of Cracow and we rented a small kind of place and I moved in with my father and mother and both brothers and my child and we left everything we had.</span> <span id="s173">Of course they liquidated all the tangibles, everything that we left behind, that was his office and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Did they take your father’s business away from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes, they took my father’s business, and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s176">My father was 45 years in that business and it was all his life.</span> <span id="s177">So we lived together and it was a hectic life.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: How long did you live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: About a few months and then . . . I don’t know, I don’t remember how we wound up in the ghetto anyway.</span> <span id="s180">But I just don’t remember anymore how.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: The Germans established an area where all of the Jews were to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s183">And we had one room for all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: And that was 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yes, that was 1940 and from the Ghetto you couldn’t get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: So, there were your parents, your brothers, and yourself and your child.</span> <span id="s187">There were six people living in one room.</span> <span id="s188">Did you share a bathroom with people, where did you cook . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: The bathroom was outside.</span> <span id="s190">They were very primitive apartments, it was a very old section.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Was there running water?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yes, there was running water.</span> <span id="s193">Well, we were trying to survive.</span> <span id="s194">Everybody was trying to find something to do, work, to make an extra few zlotky.</span> <span id="s195">I remember it was hard to get coal for the winter to heat our place.</span> <span id="s196">It was like a kitchen stove, to give us a little warmth and at the same time you could cook.</span> <span id="s197">It was very primitive.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: And it gets pretty cold there in winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yes, very cold.</span> <span id="s200">It is hard for me to talk about it.</span> <span id="s201">I didn’t realize it would be so hard.</span> <span id="s202">Do I have to go into all those details, can I skip some things and come to the point.</span> <span id="s203">Ghetto was hell, that’s all I can tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: The reason I was asking the questions was so that the people who will eventually hear these tapes will understand what poor qulity of life you had to experience.</span> <span id="s205">All these people in one room and the bathroom outdoors.</span> <span id="s206">Did you have trouble getting sufficient food?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Well, if you had any provision -- I had some Jewelry that I saved and so I was able to sell it and that helped us in the beginning.</span> <span id="s208">Then I found another person that we were -- I don’t know -- we were trying to bring some coal from the outside to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s209">I don’t know how we maneuvered with that I don’t remember anymore.</span> <span id="s210">But it worked a few times so we could sell the coal and get a few zlotkys.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: How long did you remain in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Almost two years, almost two years.</span> <span id="s213">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s214">There was one big problem we had, that they asked everybody, but everybody to come to the main building but they were just like animals.</span> <span id="s215">They put us on an empty lot and we had to stand and wait for what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s216">And I don’t know how I escaped from it.</span> <span id="s217">I don’t really remember, but I know I got out of that mess.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: How long were you in that building?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: In that building -- about one or two hours.</span> <span id="s220">And whoever was left there was taken away to be killed.</span> <span id="s221">And once they had another thing like this and people for some reason, there was a Jewish policeman, some Jewish policemen that were doing some of the dirty work for them.</span> <span id="s222">They wanted to save their lives, that’s true, but that was terrible.</span> <span id="s223">And through those people sometimes some news came in advance what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s224">So the worst thing they said was they are going to liquidate the Ghetto and everybody will be sent to concentration camp they built in Ploshen, in Poland, that was a suburb of Cracow.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: had you heard about concentration camps before this?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Yes, we knew that there were places where they were killing people.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: And you knew that the Germans were going to liquidate the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes, and I happen to meet -- you had to wear a band on your arm with the Jewish star, always -- and one day they set up a place for working people who had a profession outside of the Ghetto in a very nice building in a nice street, and they said they wanted to show how good they are to Jews that they let them produce and work and take orders.</span> <span id="s229">I don’t know why they did this, I still don’t understand, but I registered for that because I had learned how to make corsetry.</span> <span id="s230">I went to school before even the war started, my husband made me go, he said ‘you don’t know nothing what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s231">If I go to war you have to have a profession, what would you like to do’.</span> <span id="s232">We finally realized that I like this, after talking it over.</span> <span id="s233">And I got my diploma and everything.</span> <span id="s234">And I had something to display.</span> <span id="s235">I don’t know how I got the materials and things like this, or maybe I had it left from before while I was taking the lessons.</span> <span id="s236">And in came a very nice lady, a Polish woman, and she started to talk to me, and she said ‘you know what I wonder how you people survive’ she wanted to know what happened there.</span> <span id="s237">I had to be careful because there were many German officers there.</span> <span id="s238">Probably I said that we had a threat that the Ghetto would soon be liquidated and I told her of my child, my mother and two brothers and we didn’t know what was going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s239">She said, ‘ you know what’ she bought a couple of brassieres to make for her.</span> <span id="s240">She came back to pick up those brassieres and she said ‘you know what, I like you and I think if anything happens could you bring your child to us, we are going to keep your child.’</span> <span id="s241">She gave me her address and she said ‘I talked to my husband and he said it was alright’ a young woman, not much younger than I was, I was young then, too, and I thanked her and I was waiting for what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s242">The final day was next day.</span> <span id="s243">So what I did I smuggled myself through the cellar, took off the band from my arm, I got dressed the best I could, and so I took my daughter and we went through the window in the cellar, a small window, and the street was very empty, there was nobody there, and we started to walk.</span> <span id="s244">And I kept saying to my daughter ‘keep smiling, a big smile we are going somewhere’ and we came to that place, to those people and they were so good, so nice.</span> <span id="s245">You know some children spoke with the Jewish jargon but she spoke very beautifully, so did I, and the lady said I wouldn’t be afraid to keep her here.</span> <span id="s246">The war will be over soon anyway.’</span> <span id="s247">And I left my child.</span> <span id="s248">I said good-bye and I left.</span> <span id="s249">I came back the same way, through that window.</span> <span id="s250">I was very lucky that nobody caught me.</span> <span id="s251">That was a very terrible thing.</span> <span id="s252">The next day of course they liquidated the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: What did they do when they liquidated the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: They lined up all the people -- now let me think, I didn’t come back, or did I come back, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s255">I ran out again and I don’t know, it is so hard to tell.</span> <span id="s256">Oh my God, what I did, it is araised from my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Did you know when you took your daughter to that lady that the next day they were going to come and get everyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: We didn’t know exactly what day, but we knew that it was coming, it’s coming.</span> <span id="s259">I had to make up my mind, this or that.</span> <span id="s260">And we had a house, not a house but an apartment building in Cracow and my mother said ‘those people were a safe return’ that was part of my parents and part was my husband’s.</span> <span id="s261">The rest of the building, they should be the owners of the building, we should give it to them, to save my child.</span> <span id="s262">I thought of that when I left my child.</span> <span id="s263">But they didn’t do this for money.</span> <span id="s264">They were wonderful people, I keep still in touch with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: How long was your child with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Until 1945, almost five years, a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: A very long time.</span> <span id="s268">How old was she when you took her there.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: When I picked her up she was 12 years, not quite 12.</span> <span id="s270">So she was about seven, or eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: And you were running a risk in doing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Yes, I could have been killed.</span> <span id="s273">They went through many hardships.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Because of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: The neighbors started to be curious, they had to take her out to where their relatives had a farm, near the Ukrain some place.</span> <span id="s276">And they took her on the other side to stay on that farm.</span> <span id="s277">Then they had to run with her back again.</span> <span id="s278">That was terrible.</span> <span id="s279">But they hired a private tutor for her so she wouldn’t be illiterate.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: They really treated her well.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: In the beginning she was doing very bad, she couldn’t eat and she was anemic and everything, but they really saved her life.</span> <span id="s282">And they were good to me, too, when I came back home.</span> <span id="s283">But I am skipping a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Would it be easier if I would ask you questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: What happened to you when they liquidated the Ghetto, what did they do, where did you go?</span> <span id="s287">How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: I was trying to escape.</span> <span id="s289">I got Aryan papers.</span> <span id="s290">Well, I was supposed to get those papers but I really didn’t get them.</span> <span id="s291">There were some people smuggled to Hungary and I thought that maybe that way I got some tips and I was trying to contact those people and I was on the outside without my armband and I was caught because I was away from the city for a while and I got into an area where it was restricted, only a military zone or something, I just got into the wrong section.</span> <span id="s292">And I was caught and they beat me up pretty bad all over my head.</span> <span id="s293">And of course they put me in jail.</span> <span id="s294">So in the meantime, while all that happened my mother -- my father died not in the Ghetto but in one of those places where we used to live before we went to Ghetto, outside.</span> <span id="s295">He died from a stroke and then we were left without him.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Was the Ghetto literally surrounded by a wall, or just certain streets, or was there an actual wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: So the getting out of the Ghetto was difficult, you had to go through a gate.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yes, I had to go through a gate, that is true.</span> <span id="s300">Because one thought leads to another I just keep messing it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: You said you were put in jail because you tried to run away.</span> <span id="s302">How long were you in jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Not too long because those people in jail were supposed to be killed and they were taking us to the concentration camp in Plashow.</span> <span id="s304">There were maybe 250 people.</span> <span id="s305">And from here we go, I was young, but there were some older people, there were children.</span> <span id="s306">They were hitting people with the clubs.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Did you have to walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: We had to walk.</span> <span id="s309">We had to walk, it was just like you were walking for your own funeral.</span> <span id="s310">And they took us to a spot there where it was all dug out, the ground, but before that happened all of a sudden they started to seggregate people and they were coming to each one asking “what are you doing, what are you, this and that” and I said I was a seamstress.</span> <span id="s311">They picked out 60 people from this group, I was among them, and they took us to the Camp.</span> <span id="s312">And while we were walking away from the others we heard them shooting all the rest.</span> <span id="s313">Isn’t that terrible -- and they had them take off all the clothes, naked, and shoot them all.</span> <span id="s314">I was saved.</span> <span id="s315">My brothers were already there, and my mother, too.</span> <span id="s316">And they were all in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s317">There were regular barracks there were wooden bunk beds.</span> <span id="s318">And I was working as a machine operator patching up the uniforms.</span> <span id="s319">They were full of lice and blood and we had to work on that.</span> <span id="s320">I don’t know if they ever cleaned them afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Did you know that your mother and your brothers were in that camp at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yes, I met them.</span> <span id="s323">Well, you could walk in the camp.</span> <span id="s324">If you didn’t go to work, but you had to work, but when you were free there was a big room, also a wooden barrack there was running water, you could wash yourself but not much to wear.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Did you have adequate clothing for the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Not really, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: What were you allowed to bring with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: I had nothing with me.</span> <span id="s329">I don’t know if the other people took anything.</span> <span id="s330">My brothers were watchmakers so they were working in the watchmaking department.</span> <span id="s331">They had all kinds of trades there.</span> <span id="s332">My mother got a job as a maid for some commander and his wife, and sometimes she was working in the kitchen peeling potatoes.</span> <span id="s333">So for a while we survived in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: How long were you there, you say for a while, how long a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: It was end of 1941 until 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: For four years you were in this one camp, no for three years, and every time they would seggregate people make other appeals, I don’t know what you call this, when they got people together and checked them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Like a repeated selection process?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: How would they decide who was to survive, did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Well, so far the working people didn’t have to fear too much at that time.</span> <span id="s341">But the children, there were youngsters like 14, 13, 12 years old, those they just cleaned them out, right away.</span> <span id="s342">If I would have had my child with me I would never survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: About how old were you when you went to the Camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I was born in 1911, so I was about 29 or 30 years old.</span> <span id="s345">I wasn’t 30 yet, I was in my late 20’s.</span> <span id="s346">The food was awful.</span> <span id="s347">They just gave us thin soup and a piece of bread a day.</span> <span id="s348">So I was forever hungry, everybody else was hungry.</span> <span id="s349">My younger brother got malaria, so we brought in our portion, whatever we got to save his life.</span> <span id="s350">After my brother survived, got better, then I got sick, it was 1944, and I had to go to the hospital, but if you stay longer than three days in the hospital you are subject to be killed.</span> <span id="s351">So I was very fortunate again.</span> <span id="s352">There was a doctor in the hospital, a Jewish doctor who knew my husband and when he saw me he was changing the dates on my bed.</span> <span id="s353">I had an open wound and I had a drainer.</span> <span id="s354">They operated on it and cleaned it out and put a drainer and the pus was coming out.</span> <span id="s355">I was there for something like two weeks with high fever and I was very ill, very ill.</span> <span id="s356">One day again they said the Nazis are coming to the hospital to see the situation of the patients.</span> <span id="s357">The Nazi doctor is coming.</span> <span id="s358">I picked myself up in the morning and went with that leg, open wound, to the appeal.</span> <span id="s359">Before you went to work they have to count everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Like a roll call.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Right.</span> <span id="s362">So the doctor, when I was leaving said ‘you know you are taking your life in your hands’.</span> <span id="s363">I said, ‘I don’t care, they are going to shoot me, at least I have a chance, maybe I survive.</span> <span id="s364">I left the hospital with the wound.</span> <span id="s365">And I was standing, it was November, cold, in the muddy ground with the bare feet, it wasn’t snow yet, but it was lots of rain and mud.</span> <span id="s366">And then I went to the place where I used to work.</span> <span id="s367">And I had two girlfriends in that camp and we really were looking after each other.</span> <span id="s368">I call them my war sisters.</span> <span id="s369">They both are far away, one is in Brazil now and one is in Argentine.</span> <span id="s370">They were among the survivors from the 60 people, they were not killed.</span> <span id="s371">They were with the mother.</span> <span id="s372">The mother was killed, the two were survivors.</span> <span id="s373">I wish I could say that something cheerful happened during that time, but nothing cheerful happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: I think it is remarkable that you survived.</span> <span id="s375">Were you able to buy food to supplement the inadequate diet you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: My mother was working in the kitchen and would peel the potatoes, she sometimes snitched a couple of potatoes, raw potatoes, so we ate raw potatoes.</span> <span id="s377">Sometimes we would make a soup out of the potatoe peels.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Every little bit helped”.</span> <span id="s379">Could you buy things, could you bribe the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: There was nothing to buy.</span> <span id="s381">Some men were hired to work outside the Camp.</span> <span id="s382">They sent them out on some project, so those people sometimes would bring something and they would sell it.</span> <span id="s383">But I couldn’t buy a thing there, at that time I had my mother’s diamond earrings, I threw them out of the car because I knew they were going to search me and I didn’t want them to have it.</span> <span id="s384">I was on a big truck, I threw out the earrings on the street.</span> <span id="s385">Isn’t that terrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: No nothing is terrible when it is your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: It wouldn’t have saved my life, really, but I didn’t want them to have it.</span> <span id="s388">They were too precious to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Did the Red Cross ever come around?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No, there wasn’t such a thing.</span> <span id="s391">My brother once got assignment outside the city and they managed to contact the people where my daughter was and they brought me news that she was alright.</span> <span id="s392">That was a pleasant thing to hear.</span> <span id="s393">That was wonderful.</span> <span id="s394">I was happy then and full of smiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: So you were at Plechow until the war ended in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Well -- they took us -- they needed the Cracow concentration camp.</span> <span id="s397">Then they sent us to Ausschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: And when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: The end of 1944 ….</span> <span id="s400">middle of 1944, and my mother was sent somewhere else.</span> <span id="s401">We were not anymore with my mother and I wasn’t anymore with my brothers.</span> <span id="s402">I went in a different direction, everyone went in a different direction.</span> <span id="s403">I know where I went.</span> <span id="s404">They took us to Milo Sachsen, near Dresden, there was a small little factory, and they took us there.</span> <span id="s405">We worked at big machines making parts for the war parts.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: And every night you would go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: We would go back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s408">That was in the same building.</span> <span id="s409">That was a big factory, upstairs the women were lodged, downstairs was the factory.</span> <span id="s410">We never got fresh air for six months that I was there.</span> <span id="s411">I never saw fresh air and of course already they were there.</span> <span id="s412">And bombs were falling and we were so happy -- nobody was afraid of the bombs, everybody wanted to see that they bombed away the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: You weren’t afraid they would kill you in the process?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I couldn’t care less anymore about it.</span> <span id="s415">I was desperate.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Was the food any better in that situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: You must all have been very thin?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s420">Some people were going crazy.</span> <span id="s421">Some people just lost their mind.</span> <span id="s422">I must have been very strong basically that I survived there.</span> <span id="s423">And there was night shift and day shift, I tried to keep myself clean but it was impossible because there were so many ill women they didn’t care --- their lice was a big disaster.</span> <span id="s424">After the war I still was looking for them because I had them for so long.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Was there soap, or how did you keep clean?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: There was a little soap, I had one dress and one shirt and wooden shoes and always, when we were not working and when we were sitting on our bunk we talked about different food we used to cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: You were entertaining yourselves.</span> <span id="s428">It sounds like a way of torturing yourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yes, terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s430">And there was once a big, big . . . .</span> <span id="s431">it was February 1945.</span> <span id="s432">It was a tremendous air attack.</span> <span id="s433">Americans bombing.</span> <span id="s434">They knew there is that ammunition factory there but they didn’t know exactly the place.</span> <span id="s435">The Germans, the women overseers were vicious, they were terrible and when they started the bombs the bombs started to fall they were so frightened they had bunks to go and save themselves … bunkers underground.</span> <span id="s436">So they would lock us up in that room with the iron doors and the windows were breaking the bombing was so close, and all of a sudden there were 500 women there.</span> <span id="s437">Do you know there was such a tremendous force that we forced ourselves through the iron door and ran out barefoot to the ditches, there was snow on the ground and the bombs were falling, you could see the fire, and there was forest surrounding it.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: The ditches would be like trenches and it would have been safe there?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s440">That is where we were laying and when that was over there was no place for us to go we had to go back.</span> <span id="s441">We came back to the same problem we had.</span> <span id="s442">It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: So you were in Ausschwitz when the war ended?</span> <span id="s444">Or near Ausshwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: I was in Ausschwitz.</span> <span id="s446">I was in Ausschwitz not too long about . . . From Ausschwitz they took us to Chopow, that was a small place where there was a factory.</span> <span id="s447">In Ausschwitz you know that doctor, that pretty doctor, what was his name, Mengele, every day we had the inspection .</span> <span id="s448">And he looked for blemish some place, in the face, or somewhere and when he couldn’t see --- right away.</span> <span id="s449">I was fortunate I was young, that’s what saved me.</span> <span id="s450">But my leg wasn’t healed yet and my girlfriends were standing in front of me to cover my leg and I was lucky.</span> <span id="s451">I was just lucky.</span> <span id="s452">I wasn’t that smart or anything like that, I had no connections of any kind.</span> <span id="s453">I just survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: You had a number of remarkable things from time to time that occurred that would be called luck.</span> <span id="s455">Like the doctor in the hospital who would let you stay, and leaving the hospital when you did, and volunteering to work because if you hadn’t you would have been killed.</span> <span id="s456">There were a number of events like that all helped in your survival.</span> <span id="s457">When did you learn that the war was coming to an end.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Well, I worked in that factory and there was a huge machine, it was a grinding machine.</span> <span id="s459">There were some pieces for the war weapons, they had to be ground because they were making some, whatever it was ….</span> <span id="s460">war equipment and I had never worked on a machine like that in my life and they taught me how to do it and I had to be careful because I had to wear something on my head.</span> <span id="s461">And the little pieces of the metal as I was grinding it settled all in my face.</span> <span id="s462">I was covered with those pieces of metal.</span> <span id="s463">But there was a very nice foreman there, an older man, and he said ---- he always called me engineer because I didn’t have too much problem, I adopted that machine pretty well, and he said “today is my wife’s birthday, I brought a little piece of birthday cake.”</span> <span id="s464">And he put it under the machine, he said not to take it now, later, and to be careful.</span> <span id="s465">Because the people who work there, it would be something . . . .</span> <span id="s466">you know when you are hungry it is such a terrible thing, people became vicious, they would become like animals.</span> <span id="s467">So I had to excuse myself, went to the bathroom and took the piece of cake with me.</span> <span id="s468">I was so touched, it was so nice of him.</span> <span id="s469">Then he would come and say “you know our people are not doing so well, pretty soon you will have to save my life.”</span> <span id="s470">Then he told me his two sons in the war and I hope they didn’t kill them.</span> <span id="s471">And things like that.</span> <span id="s472">That’s how I would hear every day to give me courage he would tell me stuff like that.</span> <span id="s473">Wasn’t that nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: He wasn’t a Nazi, he was a regular worker.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: How did you actually learn that the war was over, do you remember that?</span> <span id="s477">How did they let you know that the Germans had surrendered?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: We knew because they liquidated the factory and they took us in a freight train.</span> <span id="s479">They put about 100 women so that we couldn’t sit, we had to stand.</span> <span id="s480">The train was going for three days and they were bombing the railroad tracks and people were dying.</span> <span id="s481">There were many dead people among us.</span> <span id="s482">And no water and no going to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s483">Can you imagine the stench and everything?</span> <span id="s484">Terrible.</span> <span id="s485">Finally they brought us to Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s486">And that was supposed to be a show place for the Germans if anyone from the Red Cross would come they would bring them there because there were trees and a park and things like that, they had those barracks there with the bunk beds.</span> <span id="s487">And here we came, I was there maybe two weeks and they gave us clean clothes and a shower.</span> <span id="s488">That helped a little bit but I was already lifeless.</span> <span id="s489">And one day one of my girlfriends, the younger one, her sister was my age and she was 10 years younger, Fella was her name and she came and she said to me “you know, the war is over, the Russians are here already.”</span> <span id="s490">I said, ‘please let me alone’.</span> <span id="s491">I was laying like a dead one, I couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s492">She said, ‘I am telling you the truth’, and I raised myself up.</span> <span id="s493">People were running, the Russians came there and they were throwing food from the tanks for the people.</span> <span id="s494">They were picking up the food and they were eating, they didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s495">I didn’t show up there because I didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s496">It’s happened that through all those unpredictable things typhoid broke out.</span> <span id="s497">there was an epidemicl So we were kind of free but now we were afraid of the typhoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Were you afraid of the Russians at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: They were nice to us.</span> <span id="s500">We were not enemies, they took care of the Nazis, but not of us.</span> <span id="s501">People were laying dead in the streets.</span> <span id="s502">The three of us looked at each other and we said, you know we are free the war is over.</span> <span id="s503">So we have to do something.</span> <span id="s504">If we wait here we get the disease and it will be the end of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: It would have been ironic to survive that and get typhoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: We walked out and it was already the quarantine, and you were not supposed to leave that place, but we left it.</span> <span id="s507">I think it was early in the morning, I don’t remember the details but we managed to leave.</span> <span id="s508">You see what I mean, that is another act of surviving and we kept walking and walking, and walking and we didn’t know which way we were walking, but we were in Czechoslovakia and we looked at each other.</span> <span id="s509">It was getting dark and we had no place.</span> <span id="s510">We saw all of a sudden a place -- that was at one time an eating place, some kind of a little restaurant, a small little place, something like that.</span> <span id="s511">So I said, let’s stop and find out if we can stay over night.</span> <span id="s512">And there was an elderly couple and the place was closed up for business, and they were Czechoslovakian and we said “ we are on the way home and we don’t have money but we have to stay somewhere overnight”.</span> <span id="s513">They put us up, they had some kind of a storage room downstairs with different things like restaurant supplies, like sugar, flour, rice, and things like that.</span> <span id="s514">And they put some sacks and they said that we could sleep there.</span> <span id="s515">We were glad, and we got hold of the sugar.</span> <span id="s516">I’ll never forget, I never ate so much sugar in my life.</span> <span id="s517">In the morning they gave us breakfast.</span> <span id="s518">They were nice people.</span> <span id="s519">So we found out from them where is the train station and wehad no money to buy tickets to go on the train so we couldn’t go on the train.</span> <span id="s520">And there is a borderline again between Poland and Czecholslovakia.</span> <span id="s521">She said ‘my husband went fishing on the Rein river, and when he comes back and catches some fish I’ll make dinner for you’.</span> <span id="s522">It was a Sunday, I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s523">Well, we stayed.</span> <span id="s524">He caught a fish, a nice big fish, trout and she made a dinner for us and we ate the dinner.</span> <span id="s525">And they gave each one of us a piece of bread, a few lumps of sugar, I don’t know what else they gave us, they gave each of us a little something to take with us, and we went to that station, and we couldn’t go in and ask, so we decided to wait until we can catch a freight train.</span> <span id="s526">There was on the side a freight train which was supposed to leave later in the day, so we went and found a spot there and sat down and we stayed in that freight train.</span> <span id="s527">It wasn’t that far from Cracow, but it took us four days to get back on that freight train.</span> <span id="s528">When we finally came, we came to a place called Katowiece, about an hour from Cracow and from there we left, we decided the train wouldn’t go any further and we had to take a regular passenger train.</span> <span id="s529">So we got off, we still had a little bit bread left, we were eating so carefully.</span> <span id="s530">We went into that passenger train and I don’t know how we managed all those things, I don’t remember the details but there was some engineering going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Do you remember how you felt during that time, were you frightened, or happy, or relieved?</span> <span id="s532">Or desperate?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Just desperate, very angry.</span> <span id="s534">I was so angry, begging for tickets.</span> <span id="s535">No tickets, ‘get out, the first station you have to get out’.</span> <span id="s536">“I said we won’t get out and they said the same, ‘we won’t get out’.</span> <span id="s537">We told him ‘we suffered plenty, leave us alone we are going back home now from the awful war and we won’t get out for nothing.</span> <span id="s538">So we went to another part of the train and we made it to Cracow.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: So desperation paid of.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Well, it wasn’t fun, really.</span> <span id="s541">Did your war sisters have family back in Cracow?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: I went back hoping that my husband is going to come back.</span> <span id="s543">People were coming back from all over the world in 1945.</span> <span id="s544">The war was officially over, and I wanted to get my child back.</span> <span id="s545">With all that iron in my face, with the wooden shoes and some kind of shabby coat which was hanging on me in all different directions, and we looked at each other and I said to those sisters, “you know what I have the address, I know where my child is, but I am afraid to go.</span> <span id="s546">I was afraid that she won’t be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: That would have been the last straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: That would have been my end, I wouldn’t be alive anymore if anything would have happened to her.”</span> <span id="s549">So they said “you wait downstairs, we go up, we’ll see.”</span> <span id="s550">I was sitting there waiting and all of a sudden I hear voices, ‘come up, come up’.</span> <span id="s551">And I came.</span> <span id="s552">Those people, I have to brag about it because I was awfully fortunate.</span> <span id="s553">They said that my daughter is fine, she is having now a cold, and we have to prepare her that you are here.</span> <span id="s554">We cannot just bring her like this.</span> <span id="s555">They took me to the kitchen with those two sisters -- they didn’t leave me, those two girls.</span> <span id="s556">And we three were sitting there and finally came a little girl, white on face and with the long braids, she had beautiful hair always and taller than I remembered her.</span> <span id="s557">That’s all what she said “Momma” just like nothing ever happened, although she must have missed me all those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: It must have been the most wonderful moment in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: It was.</span> <span id="s560">The girls went to look for their brother and those people told me I could stay there.</span> <span id="s561">They gave me clean clothes and a bath, and a clean bed and I was able to rest up.</span> <span id="s562">I rested up for one week and I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s563">But there was a Jewish Gemeinschaft, a Jewish community there and lots of refugee people there and I wanted to find out what’s happened to my husband and my mother and my brothers.</span> <span id="s564">My brothers I didn’t know nothing until somebody came from Germany back home and they had seen my brothers and told me that they are in a small village near Hamburg, both of them, they are alive.</span> <span id="s565">So that was fine.</span> <span id="s566">My mother died in a concentration camp, in Treblinka, I think.</span> <span id="s567">They put her there working on ammunition powder and she got real problems because the odor from it and all that and then they killed her.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: You said that when you came back there were metal particles imbedded in your skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Finally it came off, nature works by itself.</span> <span id="s570">I didn’t have my regular period either because they were giving us stuff not to have it.</span> <span id="s571">The diet would also affect it, but they put some power in our food.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: I wish the people who are hearing this tape could see you because your complexion now is beautiful and clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yes, it went away, I was a total mess.</span> <span id="s574">Those two girls were skilled dressmakers, skilled, beautiful dressmakers, they could design dresses and make anything so they made me a dress, the first nice dress.</span> <span id="s575">And then another girl came who I knew from concentration camp and we decided to rent a room and I went to that Jewish community and they gave me -- I don’t know how I did that -- but I got a sewing machine through them and we were both working on that machine making a little money.</span> <span id="s576">She was making men’s shirts, I was making brassieres.</span> <span id="s577">And the room was awful, full of bedbugs, well it was cheap, my child was still with the people, under these circumstances I wouldn’t dare.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: What is your child’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Felicia, she is an artist now.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: But tell me, how did you come to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: I had two sister-in-laws here in the U.S.</span> <span id="s582">One from Berlin and one from Vienna, they managed to get to this country.</span> <span id="s583">First they went to Spain, you know like people do, and then they sent me the affidavit.</span> <span id="s584">And on my affidavit I took both of my brothers, I wouldn’t leave them.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: How long after you returned to Cracow did all this take place?</span> <span id="s586">It must have been a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Oh, Cracow.</span> <span id="s588">I had a little problem because my daughter was trained to go to church and pray and go to Mass, so one day she asked me, ‘Mom, why don’t you go with me to church’.</span> <span id="s589">So I told her that right now I don’t blame you if you want to go to church, just go ahead, but I am Jewish and I’ll stay that way.</span> <span id="s590">I went once in a while with her, I don’t mind.</span> <span id="s591">So one day she said, ‘you know, Mom, I want to be Jewish, too.</span> <span id="s592">And that was the time when I took her back with me to the bedroom and all that, but at that time I knew already, I had news that my husband had died in Techeron.</span> <span id="s593">He was trying to go to Army Anders, I don’t know if you heard of it, it was a Polish army, like an underground Army, he was trying, he was really trying to get to Israel and that way he would get away, so they were stationed in Techeron and he got a job in a hospital because he was a dentist.</span> <span id="s594">He attended people there and his friend was also a dentist.</span> <span id="s595">And it happened that they had an epidemic there and he got it and died.</span> <span id="s596">His friend wrote me to Cracow.</span> <span id="s597">“Don’t wait if you think he is coming back because I saw him, he died.”</span> <span id="s598">Well, there was nothing for me to wait for, so I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: And what year did you come to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: In 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: And did you come right away to New York or did you go to Rome first, as many people did, how did you come?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Oh, that is interesting.</span> <span id="s603">First I went to get my brothers to get together with us.</span> <span id="s604">I had to pass I don’t know how many different borders, also without tickets without nothing.</span> <span id="s605">I went in those freight trains with my daughter, she was a marvellous person, but she got very sick on the way.</span> <span id="s606">We almost made it to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s607">My brothers were not in Hamburg, they were in another little town and you couldn’t communicate, I had to communicate through the Jewish agency.</span> <span id="s608">So my daughter wasn’t able to walk anymore, she had a high fever, very sick, so I carried her on my hands and I had a knapsack with me, that is all I took with me.</span> <span id="s609">We had the most horrifying experience on that trip.</span> <span id="s610">You see after the war those are the aftershocks you get.</span> <span id="s611">And I was standing there, I was standing on the corner carrying the child, it was already late afternoon and I was so helpless I started to cry.</span> <span id="s612">I don’t cry easy but I started to cry.</span> <span id="s613">And came up a woman to me and she said to me in German “was ist los?”</span> <span id="s614">I said, well I have a sick child and I know she needs a hospital and I don’t know where there is a hospital.</span> <span id="s615">And she took the child from my hands and said, ‘follow me’.</span> <span id="s616">And she took me to the nearest hospital.</span> <span id="s617">And it happened that she got the typhoid, my daughter.</span> <span id="s618">I was teasing her, sleeping with her together, I was carrying her, we ate from the same plate, and I didn’t catch it.</span> <span id="s619">I never had any disease like this during the war, fortunately.</span> <span id="s620">My daughter was very seriously ill.</span> <span id="s621">I was sitting in that hospital and didn’t want to go no place.</span> <span id="s622">They almost threw me out.</span> <span id="s623">And I went to the Jewish Agency and I told them about my problem, that my child is so sick, and they found my brothers.</span> <span id="s624">My brothers came, and things got better.</span> <span id="s625">We got a place to stay, she got well, once when I came there she was laying on the floor, she was delirious.</span> <span id="s626">And nobody picked her up.</span> <span id="s627">I picked her up and put her back to bed.</span> <span id="s628">The nurses came later and they started to yell, ‘get out, get out’.</span> <span id="s629">Well, I got my girl and lots of pleasure out of her.</span> <span id="s630">I knew when I came to this country that it is the best place in the world.</span> <span id="s631">One should never complain about anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: So after your daughter was better and you were reunited with your brothers . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yes, we all stayed together in Hamburg and then I contacted my family they were sending us packages with food.</span> <span id="s634">We were getting enough to eat but it was institutional food, nothing but starches and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: And what year did you leave Germany to come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: We moved from Hamburg to Stuttgart and from Stuttgart we went to Bremerhaven, a port, that where we sailed from.</span> <span id="s637">We had a horrible journey because there was a big storm.</span> <span id="s638">The New York Times had a big article that there is a ship coming full of refugees in a big storm and nobody knows how much delay and when that ship is going to arrive.</span> <span id="s639">So we travelled maybe three or four days longer.</span> <span id="s640">Most of the time everybody was so sick.</span> <span id="s641">That was really not a nice ship, that was one of the battle ships, a troop carrier.</span> <span id="s642">You had bunks downstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Nothing was easy for you at every turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: It wasn’t easy here either, for a while, for a long time.</span> <span id="s645">My best years were when I was married to Mr. Anderman, that was the happiest time in my life.</span> <span id="s646">He was a wonderful husband, very caring, smart, intelligent.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: How did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: I was in business, in Detroit, and his wife was my customer.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: You said you were in New York just a few months, then your brothers moved to Detroit and you followed.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yes, I was in Detroit.</span> <span id="s651">My brothers both were in Detroit.</span> <span id="s652">We were trying to be together after all those years.</span> <span id="s653">In the meantime my older brother got married, he met a girl in Stuttgart, so I had to wait much for an affidavit for her to come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Did your family here have to provide the tickets for you to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: No, the Joint Distribution Center got the ticket, a Jewish Agency.</span> <span id="s656">All I had was $7 they gave us per person for the beginning.</span> <span id="s657">$14 I had when I came to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Well, at some point there was a turning point in your life, when you met your second husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: It is a terrible loss and he really was wonderful, he had a nice family, he also had one daughter, like I, a lovely lady.</span></p></body></html>
