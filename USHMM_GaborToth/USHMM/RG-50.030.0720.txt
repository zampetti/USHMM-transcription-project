Q: So, you were the oldest in the family?
A: Yeah.
Q: How is it that you came to be born in France?
A: My father was part of a consortium of Dutch people that bought neglected or rundown how would you call that properties, large farms and then brought them back in production and sold them at a profit.
Q: Oh.
A: Yeah, uhhuh.
Q: That's an interesting activity.
A: Yeah.
Q: And, so, his business took him to France at that time?
A: Yeah.
Q: Did you grow up there?
A: No. In 1928 my mother died. And, so, my father came back to Holland and dropped my brother and me off at his mother's house,
Q: Uhhuh.
A: my grandmother. And he went to South AfricA:
Q: Your father went to South Africa?
A: Yeah. And then he came back. He married there and another brother was born there. And then he got malaria and he came back to Europe.
Q: Your father got the malaria?
A: Yeah.
Q: And came back with his new family?
A: Yeah.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: He was a veterinarian; is that right?
A: Pardon?
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Was he a veterinarian at that time?
A: Then he studied for veterinarian and became a veterinarian.
Q: Uhhuh. So, how many years did you live with your grandparents when he was in South Africa?
A: Oh, at least 10 years.
Q: Okay. From 1928 to 1938?
A: Something like it, yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: No, 1937.
Q: Did you was your father in South Africa during all that time?
A: Yeah. And then when he came back to Europe, then shortly after that he went to England and he lived there for the rest of his life.
Q: So, you didn't see him much?
A: Pardon?
Q: You didn't see him much?
A: No, only I think for about two or three years.
Q: Only for two and that would have been in your very early years when you were a toddler?
A: Yeah, but later in my early teens, say eight or nine no, for he left in '37, so seven or eight.
Q: And why did he leave the Netherlands in 1937?
A: I don't remember. But we were going in 1940 we were going to England. And then the war broke out and I got stuck in Holland.
Q: So, you all were going to go to England?
A: Pardon?
Q: Your whole family was going to go to England?
A: Oh, yeah. My parents lived in England then.
Q: And your grandparents would have
A: No, in Holland.
Q: And would they have come with you or not?
A: No.
Q: No. So, it was just that you and your younger brother
A: Yeah.
Q: were planning on going?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay, okay.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I believe that they had their tickets. You had your
A: Pardon?
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: You had tickets already arranged?
A: Yeah. On May 10 we had reservations
Q: Uhhuh.
A: for the night boat to England
Q: Uhhuh.
A: on May the 10th. And when we were about to leave in 1940, a neighbor came running out and asked whether we were going to evacuate. I said, "Evacuate what?" He said, "It's war. The Germans invaded Holland." So,
Q: On the same eve that, that
A: Yeah.
Q: you would have yeah.
A: They invaded in the morning and
Q: Did so, tell me, then, if you were growing up mostly with your grandparents at a time when a child remembers things, you know, what kind of atmosphere was there at home? What was your grandfather like? What was your grandmother like?
A: Oh, they were very well off and we had a nanny that actually, two nannies who took care of us. And there was about seven other servants in the house.
Q: Where did they live? What city was this?
A: They lived in The Hague.
Q: In The Hague as well?
A: But they also had a place in Hattem. It was my grandmother's house. They would go there during the Easter holidays.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And then there was another estate in Daniken even much larger. And that was originally my grandfather's estate.
Q: So, it was three places basically
A: Yeah.
Q: that they owned?
A: Yeah. And then in the summer and also for the hunt in the fall we would go to Daniken.
Q: How did, how did they account for their money?
A: Pardon?
Q: How did they account for their, the fact that they were well off? Was this inherited wealth or was your grandfather involved in business of somekind?
A: The Palthe family I think had always been very well all.
Q: Palthe?
A: Palthe, yeah, Palthe.
Q: Palthe family?
A: Yeah.
Q: And what and that probably then was for generations?
A: My grandmother's second husband.
Q: Oh. So, your father's father was no longer in the picture?
A: No. He died in 1918.
Q: I see.
A: He was a minister and a chaplain in the Army.
Q: So, your father grew up without a father?
A: Pardon?
Q: Your father grew up without a father. Oh, no, not quite.
A: No, my father's father.
Q: Yeah.
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah.
A: Who I was named after.
Q: I see. If there were nannies and many servants in the house, did you interact much with your grandparents?
A: With my grandmother, not my grandfather.
Q: I see. Was he a rather distant person?
A: He had an office in the house and he was mainly there.
Q: Uhhuh. And your grandmother, what kind of a person was she?
A: Like Queen VictoriA:
Q: Really? But she was, yes?
A: Yes, very strict. But also she let us do many things. And when I converted a rowboat into a sailboat that wasn't all that good, she bought me a good, much better dinghy. So,
Q: So, was she involved with you? Were your grandparents engaged with you and your brother or did sort of like you lived in the house
A: No. The servants took care of us.
Q: Were you close to any of them?
A: I don't think so.
Q: Were you lonely as a child?
A: Pardon?
Q: Were you lonely as a child?
A: No.
Q: No? Did you miss your father?
A: I didn't really know him. Like I say, my mother died when I was three years old, so
Q: What was your school life like?
A: Pardon?
Q: What was your school life like? Did you go to a private school or public school?
A: Yeah, private school. And then for a couple of years when I lived with my parents in Bilthoven, I went to Kees Boeke School. It still exists. It's a very progressive school. The teachers were called the kids were called the workers and the staff was called the coworkers.
Q: And was your father did your father have any strong political kinds of leanings that you would be sent to such a school?
A: I don't think so.
Q: So, how did you come to be there? Whose decision was it?
A: Well, it was a good school.
Q: Oh, okay. So, they went by what is a good school
A: Yeah.
Q: in the neighborhood?
A: Yeah. I don't think they ever discussed politics.
Q: Because that was one of my questions.
A: Yeah.
Q: What are the sort of interests that your grandparents had? Were they yeah, tell me. What were they interested in?
A: I don't really know.
Q: Okay.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I just want to mention that his my greatgrandfather, his father's father, was his nickname was The Royale Dominer, which was the Red Minister, because he was a Christian socialist and wrote many pamphlets espousing socialist views.
Q: The one who died in 1918?
A: Yes.
Q: He was called the Red Minister?
A: The Red Minister for his socialist views.
Q: So and earlier I had gotten my, my number and my mathematics wrong, my arithmetic I mean. Your father if your grandfather died in 1918, your father already was at least a young man when he died.
A: Yeah.
Q: So, he would have been influenced by him.
A: Yeah.
Q: He could have been influenced by him. And
A: I think he was early 20s.
Q: Uhhuh. Did you, did you know your father well?
A: Fair, not too well.
Q: Uhhuh. And what kind of a personality was he?
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Distant.
A: Pardon?
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Quiet, distant.
A: I don't really know.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Quiet?
Q: Was he a quiet person?
A: Pardon?
Q: Was he a quiet person?
A: Yeah. You probably knew him better than I did.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Bookish.
A: Pardon?
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: He would read a lot.
A: Yeah. And when he became a vet, he was very much involved and he became a specialist in pigs.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And even the Germans called him. So, he looked at Hitler's pigs.
Q: No. Really? So, he was, he was a swine specialist
A: Yeah.
Q: from the Netherlands?
A: Yeah.
Q: And before the occupation?
A: Oh, yeah. He lived in England, but he was called by the Germans for they had problems. They were trying to raise pigs in very how would you call it hygienic insulations,
Q: Uhhuh.
A: concrete and ceramic tile walls.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And the pigs didn't do very well for they liked straw and
Q: Mud?
A: mud, yeah.
Q: What year would he have been consulted by the Germans?
A: I guess '38 or something like that.
Q: So, it means before the Germans,
A: Before the war.
Q: Before the war?
A: Oh, yeah.
Q: And he, he okay. When he returned in 1937, you say you moved to a different town and you lived together with him; correct?
A: No. He went to England
Q: And
A: and my brother and I stayed behind
Q: Uhhuh.
A: in Holland to my parents thought that kids would have more difficulty in learning a foreign language than adults. Of course, that's not true at all. Kids pick it up much easier.
Q: Yeah.
A: And, so, we stayed behind to finish our education. And then in 1940 they decided for us to come over. Then the war caught us and we stayed in Holland.
Q: The youngest brother, your half brother, was he already in England or was he
A: No.
Q: with you?
A: He lived with other people in Holland.
Q: I see.
A: For a while I lived with a family in Hilversum and he lived somewhere else.
Q: When you went to the school, was that that wasn't in The Hague; right?
A: No. That was Bilthoven.
Q: In Bilthoven?
A: Yeah.
Q: Uhhuh. And where how far is the distance between the places, between The Hague and Bilthoven?
A: Oh, Bilthoven is more in the central of Holland in the Province of Utrecht.
Q: Oh, okay. I know where that is. And, so, it was a boarding school?
A: Yes and no. I lived with a family, another family in Hilversum. And they found out that in Bilthoven in the two years I'd been in that school I hadn't learned much. Carpentry and history were the two things that I was good at.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And for the rest of my education, it wasn't much.
Q: And why was that?
A: Pardon?
Q: Why was that?
A: That was because there you could select what you wanted to study. It was a very progressive school. We exercised in the nude, yeah, and the staff also.
Q: Oh, really?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay. What an exposure, what a double entendre.
A: Does that shock you?
Q: A little bit. A little bit for that time, you know.
A: Yeah.
Q: Did you like it? Did you like going to school there?
A: It was okay, yeah.
Q: Yeah.
A: Yeah. I learned a lot of carpentry.
Q: Did you was it a coed school?
A: Pardon?
Q: Was it boys and girls?
A: Oh, yes.
Q: Okay. And did the teachers teach when you said you were good in history, was politics talked about at school?
A: A little bit. For the history teacher it was German who had escaped from Germany.
Q: Okay.
A: So, he didn't have much time for the Germans, or at least for the Hitler regime.
Q: Right. Were there Jewish kids at the school?
A: Oh, yes.
Q: A lot of them?
A: Quite a few.
Q: Yeah.
A: But at that time, you didn't really know the difference
Q: Uhhuh.
A: until the war broke out and they had to wear the yellow star
Q: Okay.
A: and then disappeared.
Q: So, were you at that school when the war did break out?
A: No.
Q: You had just finished?
A: I was gone from there. My parents had discovered that I hadn't learned much, so then I went to live with a family in Hilversum.
Q: Okay.
A: And there, well, I guess I was brought uptodate to my age and school.
Q: So, you went to another school there, a more traditional one?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay. Where people kept their clothes on?
A: Yeah, uhhuh.
Q: Sorry. I shouldn't joke.
A: That's all right.
Q: And, and by the time 1940 rolled around, you would have been 15 years old?
A: I was 15 when the war broke out, yeah.
Q: Do you remember where you were?
A: Yeah. I was down in Hattem.
Q: In Hattem?
A: Yeah, for I was going to go to England. We went to the British consul on the way and he refused my visA:
Q: Why?
A: And he said it turned out that he was actually a Nazi and, you know, how would you call that a double agent.
Q: Really?
A: He was a Dutchman working as a consul, as a British consul. But later on we found out that he was a Nazi. But he said that I would be safer in Holland and not subjected to the bombing in London. So, he refused the visA:
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And then I went with my grandparents, my grandmother to Hattem and then stayed there. And on May 10 May 9, 1940, we got a telegram that everything was approved. I could go back to England. And then the next morning the Germans invaded Holland. So, we were stuck.
Q: And do you remember the first Germans that you saw? Were they also paratroopers?
A: No, not in our areA: We didn't see Germans for about months later.
Q: Wow, that's quite a time
A: Yeah.
Q: for a small country.
A: And they were busy in the that part of Holland apparently was not too important.
Q: Strategically?
A: And the British across the River IJssel had been blown up.
Q: Yeah. So, can I assume, then, that life hadn't changed much for you?
A: Pardon?
Q: In that month or so, life hadn't changed much for you?
A: No.
Q: No?
A: But my grandmother had when the war broke out in '39, she had survived the first World War. So, she had slowly accumulated quite a lot of food already.
Q: Because she remembered what that was like?
A: Oh, yeah. And
Q: By the time World War II broke out, your grandparents, were they already elderly or were they middleaged?
A: I don't know. My grandmother my grandfather was a lot older. He died in '43 I think. He was about 93.
Q: Wow, Wow. So, he was quite old by then?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay. And how did they respond to
A: Pardon?
Q: How did your grandparents react to Holland being occupied, the Netherlands being occupied?
A: I don't know. They just
Q: They didn't talk about it with you?
A: Not too much. They didn't like the Germans. But, also, my grandfather had done an awful lot of business in Germany.
Q: Your brother and your half brother your brother was with you?
A: Yeah.
Q: I mean, was his fate your fate? That is, that when you were denied a visa, he was denied a visa?
A: He lived in a different town with different people.
Q: Your own brother?
A: Yeah.
Q: And your half brother also?
A: No. My half brother lived with my parents in England.
Q: I see.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I get confused too.
Q: Okay, okay. So, had you finished your studies by then or were you still due to go to school?
A: No, I was still in school.
Q: You were still in school?
A: When the war broke out, I was 15,
Q: Yeah.
A: high school.
Q: Did you have any chance to communicate with your parents during that, during that time or not?
A: Not after the war broke out, no.
Q: Okay. So, how did that summer progress for you? What was that summer like?
A: Pardon?
Q: How was that summer, that first summer of, of the war and of the occupation? If the Germans invaded in May
A: It was pretty normal.
Q: Okay.
A: We sailed a lot. We had a boat at the River IJssel.
Q: Uhhuh. And you say it took about a month or so until you saw the first Germans?
A: Yeah.
Q: And do you remember in what capacity you saw them, what they were doing? Were they marching? Was it tanks? Was it
A: No. A patrol came by and entered our property and put the rifles in the racks around the fish pond and made themselves comfortable to take a break. And my grandfather went out and yelled at them in German and chased them off.
Q: And they went?
A: Yeah. Well, he spoke fluent German. And, you know, a lieutenant I guess it was the second lieutenant he had been addressed in fluent German by an older man and he packed up and left.
Q: Yeah, he was gehorsam. That is, he'll be obedient.
A: Yeah. But they were troops. They were not
Q: Regular soldiers?
A: Yeah.
Q: That reminds me, did you speak German when you were growing up? Did you were you studying German in school?
A: Yeah. You get in elementary school you start with French.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And then later you get English and German
Q: Okay.
A: and Catholic classical education. You also get Greek and Latin.
Q: Oh, God.
A: Yes, and Dutch of course.
Q: That's a lot. That's a lot. When you returned to school the following fall, was it the same school you were in before or was this a different one?
A: No. I had been in the Lyceum which is the more classical education. And then in Hattem there was a very good school. It was actually a Christian school. But my grandmother decided that a little religion wouldn't hurt us. And that school did in three years what all others did in four. And it also was recognized by the Merchant Marine Academy that I wanted to go to.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: So,
Q: So, you went there. Boy, you certainly had the gamut, you know, from a progressive school to a Christian school.
A: Yeah. But the head master was very religious, but we went sailing on Sundays. So, we often met him coming back from church. He came back from church and we were on the way to the boat. So, he gave me a hard time.
Q: Because of that?
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah. And did the curriculum change because was it different because of the occupation?
A: No.
Q: So, there wasn't
A: I don't think so.
Q: There wasn't much influence by the
A: No, not
Q: I see. I see. So, you, you finished your studies in three years there?
A: Yeah.
Q: All right.
A: And then I went to the Merchant Marine Academy up north.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And there by that time, all students had to sign a declaration that they agreed with the Nazi ideas and principles and would not do anything against it.
Q: Okay.
A: If you didn't sign that, that was the end of your education. So, it was the end of my schooling too.
Q: So, you didn't sign it?
A: Oh, no.
Q: Was that unusual that people wouldn't sign?
A: Oh, no. But then you run the risk you have to go in hiding. You had to work for the Germans either in Holland or France or Germany.
Q: So, a lot of kids didn't sign and took that risk?
A: Oh, yeah, right.
Q: What did you do when you didn't sign? What did you
A: I went back to Hattem, the place where my grandparents lived. But I went to live with another family not too far away and, in a sense, in hiding.
Q: Uhhuh. And during the time you were in school, were you involved in any kind of extracurricular activities?
A: Yeah, field hockey.
Q: Field hockey?
A: Organized, and sailed a lot.
Q: Uhhuh. But not politics and not resistance and not going, nothing like that?
A: No.
Q: Okay.
A: Didn't like the Nazis, but the Germans
Q: When you then went into hiding, how did your life develop? What happened then?
A: Well, I lived with them but I could not get (inaudible) cars any more. So, the resistance provided those I guess.
Q: And this was in what year? In 1943 or '44?
A: 1942.
Q: Oh, in '42?
A: Yeah.
Q: So, 1940, '41, '42. And, so, you never did get to the Merchant Marine school?
A: I never did. Finally I was, but it was very short.
Q: Yeah, yeah. So, in 1942 that's still your there's three more years of war left?
A: Yeah.
Q: What happens to you after that?
A: Well, I got involved in the resistance.
Q: Well, tell me about it. Tell me how were you brought in? How the same sort of questions. How did you start? Who involved you?
A: A good friend of mine and I decided he decided that his father was an officer in, say, call it the fellow police and they were mounted. And his father stayed as an officer. And then Harry felt that his father was a collaborator and a traitor and we would try to get to England. And he did quite a bit of research. And we went on a hiking trip and got into Belgium and almost to France. There were safe houses, farms where you could stay. You could not camp overnight outside.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And these safe houses Harry had figured, found out. And that way, we could get through France into Spain and then Portugal and to England. But we lost the trail and we got short of food, so we started going back. And just back in the Dutch, across the Belgium Dutch border we were picked up by a patrol.
Q: German?
A: German patrol, oh, yeah. And they took us actually to a police station and we were interrogated there separately. But we had a good story. We had been on a hiking trip and we were on our way back home.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: So, we spent overnight in separate cells.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And then they let us go.
Q: Okay.
A: And then Harry's father called us and said, "What the hell were you trying to do?" And Harry says, "Well, you're a traitor and we wanted to try to go to England." He said, "Yes, but I'm involved in the resistance. So, if you want to do something, start " we started actually taking downed airmen we called them pilots but, of course, they were any kind of airmen from one place to another. We would be told to go somewhere
Q: Uhhuh.
A: and pick up a couple of guys and take them somewhere else.
Q: Did Harry feel did Harry apologize to his father for having called him a traitor?
A: Pardon?
Q: Did Harry apologize to his father for having called him a traitor after that?
A: I don't remember that, but I guess so.
Q: So, you would be so downed airmen, you would take them these were British airmen?
A: Or American, yeah.
Q: Or American?
A: Yeah.
Q: Did you speak any English?
A: A little bit.
Q: A little bit?
A: Yeah.
Q: And you were your job was to go there and bring them from where they landed to
A: Go to a house where, a safe house where they were. They were brought there
Q: Okay.
A: by other people. And then we had phony passports and we'd take them to another house. And then we didn't know anymore.
Q: Okay.
A: You never knew the people that you met.
Q: Were you and Harry doing this together?
A: Yeah.
Q: So, if you had been caught, you would know about what his activities were and he would know about yours?
A: That was the problem, that I knew his father. I knew way too much. I also knew the guy who was in charge of the whole resistance of the whole areA: I just happened to know the family.
Q: So, how long did you do this? How long were you involved in this kind of activity?
A: Until I was arrested.
Q: And that would have been how long? A year?
A: That was in on December 5, 1944.
Q: Certain dates you don't forget, huh?
A: Pardon?
Q: There are certain dates you don't forget?
A: No.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That's an easy one, though. December 5th is Sinterklaas in Holland.
Q: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What happened? How were you picked up? How were you arrested?
A: Well, I was staying in a house of Mrs. (inaudible). My friend's fiance lived there and his two sisters. He was living somewhere else. And in the morning one morning I was sitting looking at a magazine when German troops, an officer and I think 10 or 12 men came into the yard. And I thought at first I could have run out into the woods through the back door. But then I thought nobody knows you're here, so
Q: Yeah.
A: I stayed. And then they arrived at the house and knocked on the door and asked the girls if they would open the door and if there were any men in the house. And she said, "No," of course.
So, the living room where I was,
Q: Yeah.
A: the corridor is here and the door opened this way. So, I stood in the corner behind the door. And they went through the house. But well, they saw a shaving brush upstairs, of course, and knew. Then the guy in the living room looked under the couch, which was only this high, and they looked through the house and didn't find me. They were outside again talking. And all of a sudden, I heard the guy run back. And he pulled the door open and there I was. So, he poked a rifle in my gut and he yelled, "Da ist er," there he is. So, then I knew that they knew that they were looking for somebody.
Q: Okay.
A: So, then he said, "Where's your friend?" I said, "I'm the only one here." They said, "Well, it will be more pleasant if you go with somebody." So, I kept saying I was the only one. They said, "Go upstairs, get your toothbrush, and get on the bike." And I could have escaped many times on the way to their headquarters, but they would go right back and pick up the family there.
Q: So, they already knew that the two of you were involved, that you and Harry were involved?
A: Not that I was involved, simply that there was a man that lived there, or a boy, a man who was not working for them.
Q: Oh, I see. They picked you up because there you were,
A: Yeah.
Q: you're the right age, and you're not working for them in any way.
A: Right.
Q: And that's suspicious?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: And then at headquarters they asked me many questions and you saw the ID cards.
Q: Yes.
A: Now, Jews had a great big purple J on them.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: Of course, I'm not Jewish and I didn't have that. But they still thought with the dark hair maybe I could be Jewish. I said, "No." They said, "Drop your pants." Well, I'm not circumcised, so I said, "Okay."
Q: Yeah. And, so, then that part was at least safe?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: But then they said, "You have to be punished." And but they didn't really know what to do with me. So, they said, "Let's take you to the gestapo in the town across the river." And there the gestapo questioned me again. They never beat me. They never hurt me. But my story was good.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: I'm a student up north. I came down here for a vacation. In September the trains stopped running for civilians, so I got stuck here.
Q: That was your story?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: And it was so simple and it was partially true.
Q: Okay.
A: So, then they said, "Well, you don't work for us. You have to be punished." There was a hard labor camp, Klein ErikA:
Q: Klein Erika?
A: It was called Klein ErikA: There was also a camp called ErikA:
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And it was very bad.
Q: And these were within, within the Netherlands, these camps?
A: Oh, yes.
Q: Okay. Klein Erika and Erika, the two of them?
A: Klein Erika was the German name for it, but also in Dutch Small ErikA:
Q: Small Erika and Erika herself?
A: Yeah.
Q: So, you were sent to Klein Erika?
A: Pardon?
Q: You were sent to Klein Erika camp?
A: Yeah.
Q: What was that like? What did you
A: Well, it wasn't too bad.
Q: Okay.
A: The camp commander had been a professor at the university in (inaudible). And the guy in charge of the work detail had also been a professor. But when the war got bad, they were drafted and put in charge of a hard labor camp. "When one man escapes, shoot two," you know. But
Q: So, one escapee; two are shot?
A: Yeah. And they had hostages. And the first morning when a new person came in, they selected so many of them to become a hostage.
Q: I see.
A: And then the old hostages were not hostages anymore.
Q: They were released from being hostages?
A: Yeah.
Q: But they were still within the camp?
A: Oh, yeah.
Q: Okay, okay. So, were you chosen to be a hostage?
A: Yeah.
Q: So, that meant if someone escaped, you were in line?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: I run the risk. So, I looked at my buddies and said, "If one of your guys goes, I will go with you," but nobody ran away.
Q: Okay. So, what how did things progress from there?
A: Pardon?
Q: How did things develop from there?
A: Well, we were marched off every morning to work somewhere, install trenches and gunnery placements or unload barges and do any kind of hard labor.
Q: Well, this was already towards the end of the war.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: When you marched, you had to sing; right?
A: Pardon? Oh, yeah. When we were marching through the town, we had to sing. And we had about, I think, 25 soldiers, then came the group. Then we came, soldiers on the side. And then behind us again we marched in fives. And behind us again, 25 soldiers. And two firemen from Rotterdam had been picked up in a raid. They were still in uniform. They had jumped off a train to Germany and were put in our camp. And they were there, one on the left and one on the right. And then the group leader would go and lead a song. The guy on the left would call the name of the song. And then the guy on the right would call (German phrase) whenever the feet came down and then we all burst out in song.
Q: Oh, good God.
A: I can't sing. And I was a hostage and I was miserable and I didn't like it. So, I marched along quite grim.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: One of the guards along the side noticed that I wasn't singing. So, he came in behind me and beat me with a rifle butt and told me to sing. So, I sang off tune and I brought a whole bunch of others out of, out of tune. Another guard heard the discord and finally found out the source and beat me with a rifle butt again and told me to shut up, "Halt mund."
Q: Halt mund, yeah.
A: "Keep your trap shut."
Q: Yeah.
A: So, I marched along. And a soldier saw that I wasn't singing, so I got beaten again. And then after that, I just mouthed it.
Q: You just mouthed the words?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay. Oh, dear.
A: I didn't have no more problems, but it took three beatings.
Q: That was a hard lesson.
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah. What kind of work were you doing once you got to the place you had to go to?
A: We were digging trenches for, along the river
Q: Uhhuh.
A: at gunnery placements and ammunition bunkers. We also unloaded barges, did all sorts of stuff. Once in a while, we had to unload the barge with carbide. Carbide makes acetylene gas, so it comes in steel drums. Two men could easily lift them and then pick them up and roll them down the gangway
Q: Uhhuh.
A: to shore. So, we would break it, crack it, and made sure that it ran into the water. So, a lot of gas would come out and the Germans would scream and panic.
Q: Sabotage?
A: Yeah. And everybody would be evacuated and sent to wait until the boat stopped. So, we got a break that way.
Q: When you were arrested, it was December?
A: Pardon?
Q: When you were arrested, it was December 5th, '44?
A: Yeah.
Q: And how long did it take between the time you were arrested and the time you were in this labor camp, Klein Erika? Was it a week?
A: The evening of the same day.
Q: Oh, really?
A: Yeah.
Q: It was that fast?
A: Yeah.
Q: Did anybody interrogate you about resistance activities?
A: No.
Q: No?
A: My story was simple and good.
Q: And, so, they didn't question it?
A: The train stopped running for civilians. I couldn't get back and that's why I'm here.
Q: When you were in Klein Erika, though, there are two things that come to mind. One, it's wintertime. It's December, January. And, so, conditions probably are not very comfortable. But I want to ask you about that. And, number two, we're already going into 1945 and there's only four months left of the war. Were there battles that were already being fought around the area where you were?
A: No. That was further south. The allies didn't come up September, '44, it was not part of Holland. And, actually, later on in '45 our area was liberated before the western part of Holland.
Q: Okay.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: My father did mention that they would use their shovels as helmets from the antiaircraft fire.
Q: Yeah, tell me about that. You said you used shovels?
A: We were digging the trenches
Q: Okay.
A: from the bridges across the river. One was a railroad bridge. The other one was a traffic bridge. And the allies would come by and try and bomb these. And then the Germans would and also heavy antiaircraft. And when the shells broke, of course the fragments have to come down again. So, we would sit in the trench and have the shovels over our head for the
Q: So it wouldn't hit you?
A: Yeah.
Q: Did they ever land on one of the people who was a prisoner?
A: The guy next to me had one land on his shoulder. He was wearing an overcoat and a jacket. Both had padded shoulders
Q: Uhhuh.
A: but it tore both padding out and it knocked him down.
Q: Okay.
A: But he, he had a sore shoulder, but it didn't break the skin. Thanks for reminding me.
Q: Uhhuh. So, how long did this continue for you?
A: Well, you've maybe heard about the Battle of Arnhem or A Bridge Too Far." It was a movie. Well, the allies were on the south side of the river. The Germans were digging in and the allies were shooting them. So, they lost too many troops. So, they decided that they had expendables in camps. So, our camp was one of the camps that provided labor to the area. And that night, it was my turn and there was always confusion. The gates were open. It was a blackout, quite dark. Two guards came marching towards each other and presented arms, about face, and marched back. And they did it and I watched them for a while. And, like I say, it was very black out. And the trucks were there ready to drive off. The gates were open. And I went up there and walked out.
Q: You just simply walked out?
A: Yeah. I had nothing to lose. Not too far away was the house of a friend of mine. Now, he and his father were in hiding somewhere. But I knocked on the door and I borrowed a bicycle there and went back to my apartment the other side of the river.
Q: A bicycle with rubber? With wheels?
A: Pardon?
Q: The bicycle had wheels?
A: It had even tires.
Q: It had tires?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: But she never saw the bike again.
Q: So, you went back to this was your grandparents' place?
A: Yeah, but I didn't go to her house.
Q: Your grandmother's house?
A: I went to the house where I had been arrested, where I'd been in hiding.
Q: I see. And what why did you go back there?
A: Well, my grandmother's house was right in between two estates that the Germans occupied. Actually, my grandmother's garage had a cannon in it. The Germans had put it there.
Q: They stored their cannon in her garage?
A: Yeah. And at that time, somehow she had been able to stay in the house. And later on, she was kicked out and the Germans took over. But
Q: Uhhuh. So, this when you walked out and escaped from Klein Erika, that was when? January already or February?
A: No, it was about March.
Q: Oh, so you still were there for quite a few months?
A: Oh, yeah.
Q: Okay. So, it's March and you go back to this other house. And was it safe for you there to be in that place? Wouldn't they come looking for you again?
A: I didn't think that the camp would really know who had brought me there. So,
Q: Okay.
A: And where else could I go?
Q: And, so, what did you do then? After that, you returned to this house. Did you go back into hiding?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: I stayed there. And, gosh, we had, we had weapons. We had stun guns.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: So, our group went near the bridge across the canal. The river was further to the east. And the Canadians were coming up on that side. So, we were supposed to hold the bridge in case they came, the Canadians came across. They never did. And then one day the Germans came and they wanted our house. So, we could not go there.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And that night the Germans ambushed the guys that were at the bridge and they were wiped out.
Q: So, this was part of your resistance?
A: And the farmer and his wife were hung in the door of the barn.
Q: Who was hung in the door of the barn?
A: There was a farm, and the farmer and his wife were strung up in the door of the barn.
Q: Because they were suspected of having helped?
A: Yeah, sure.
Q: Okay.
A: Then later on we were asked a German General Blaskowitz had been in the southern part of Holland or not the southern, central part of Holland. And he had been harassed there. Then he was in Hilversum where the allies had their headquarters. And he had come to our area and we were asked to harass him. And, so, we went and cut his wires, telephone wires across there was a small road into the woods with three rows of birches on each side. It was somekind of a fire break. But there were two paths you could walk through more or less.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: There were several houses, summer homes that now the Germans occupied. The telephone wires strung through, across the road through the trees.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And we were asked to cut the wires.
Q: Did you?
A: They said that I was the most technical, so it was my job. But we had to pull down the wires and cut out about six feet so they couldn't just splice them back. And we did. And then we cut several wires. Then somehow the Germans started blowing whistles and they all barged out and started shooting at each other and we backed out through the woods. I had a whole bunch of wires wrapped around my waist.
Q: Yeah, the guilty guy.
A: Yeah.
Q: And that was already March, or is that April?
A: That was about March or April, yeah.
Q: Yeah.
A: Near the end of the war.
Q: Who liberated your area?
A: Pardon?
Q: Who liberated your area finally?
A: We did ourselves.
Q: You did yourselves?
A: Yeah.
Q: Tell me how that happened.
A: Well, the Canadians were on the east side of the River IJssel and the resistance decided to like I said, there were two estates with ammunition in them and a small group of Germans. But then they decided that we could take over.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: So, we went to talk with the officer of the Germans and he said he would not surrender to terrorists, only to an allied officer, equal or superior rank. But he also said that we could blow him up so he would not do anything anymore. And we put a guard
Q: Uhhuh.
A: next to the place for there was a chance that people in the town would come up and harass them.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: So, it was very how would you call it quite friendly actually.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And then we waited until the Canadians came close, and we got one officer to come over and they surrendered.
Q: To that officer?
A: Yeah.
Q: But it was only one officer and the rest of the military forces were further away?
A: Yeah.
Q: And, so, what happened? They came went into they were then taken prisoners of war or they just retreated?
A: Yeah, they disappeared. I don't know where they went.
Q: Okay.
A: I guess to a POW camp.
Q: Okay. So, that would have been in April? Would that have been in April, '45?
A: No, that was later. That was probably, yeah, late April.
Q: Late April. So, very close to the end of the war?
A: Oh, yeah.
Q: And when that happened, when the area was then liberated, what did you do?
A: What did we do? Get drunk.
(Laughter)
A: No, I don't really know. We became the police force.
Q: Yeah?
A: Yeah. We, we then had to guard the bridge and we also we had to be recruited. Several people from the village, we taught them how to shoot, just operate a rifle and gave them, I guess, about five or six rounds to shoot. And then from headquarters, they would police the areA:
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And we were police. And then we felt that our resistance group, that we had done enough and wanted out, but we couldn't.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: We became part of the internal military forces.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And the only way to get out was to join the regular military. So, we all signed up for the Army, the Navy,
Q: Uhhuh.
A: Air Force, and the Marine Corps.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And two other guys and I were called by the Marines. My brother was called by the Air Force. And then they said, "We have enough pilots. Why don't you go and work at a farm for a while." So, he went into the expeditionary forces. He was trained in England.
Q: And what did you do then as a Marine?
A: Well, I trained here with American Marines for the final hit against Japan. But then while we were training, Japan surrendered. And we had signed up for the duration of the war plus so many months. But at the bottom of the contract it said unless the Minister of the Army or the Navy decides otherwise.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: So, he decided otherwise and we finished our training and were sent to Java and were there for two and a half years.
Q: Oh, my goodness.
A: Pardon?
Q: I said, oh, my goodness.
A: Yeah.
Q: So, you were in Java for two and a half years?
A: Yeah, got shot at by people that wanted to be free like we wanted to be.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That was Sukarno?
A: Yeah, Sukarno.
Q: So, tell me, the day that the war was over for you in Europe, do you remember that day?
A: Oh, yeah.
Q: Where were you?
A: I was in Hattem.
Q: At your grandmother's place?
A: Pardon?
Q: In your grandmother's place?
A: Yeah.
Q: Did your grandmother know of your resistance activities?
A: I think she did.
Q: Okay.
A: She didn't want to know. Yes, she did for in the beginning sometimes we would at night clean our stun guns. So, she, she knew, but
Q: Okay. And when do you did you start communicating with your father and, and his wife and child? When did that happen?
A: In the Marine Corps we went first to Scotland to a transient camp and then came here to the states. But it was in Scotland I told them that my father or my parents lived in England.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: The sergeant in charge of our group they were all professionals who didn't really like us for we were much better educated than they were.
Q: Oh.
A: So, he said to write a letter to request a pass.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: But he never, he never sent the letter or gave the letter to the headquarters.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: Then I was in transport for AmericA: And, so, I went to the headquarters and wanted to talk to the Colonel. Well, I talked to a Captain and I told him
Q: Uhhuh.
A: I had copied the letter. I had just written another one. I said, "My parents live here. I haven't seen them since '38, and I had requested transport." And he looked at it and he called out he signed the orders and gave me money. And he called the Sergeant that had refused to give my request and he caught hell. And I was on the train a few hours later to London.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And then my father was in America. So, I never saw him.
Q: Oh, my goodness. Where in London did they live?
A: In Watford just outside London.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And my younger brother I think was six years old.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And he spoke English very fast and I wasn't all that good. So, I asked him to slow down. And he looked up at me and said, "Don't be silly."
Q: The things a person remembers.
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah. What a disappointment that your father wasn't there.
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah. And, so, then you were sent to Java?
A: Yeah.
Q: Tell me a little bit about what that was, what that all involved, what you were doing.
A: Well, for the Marine Corps I had applied for the artillery or the tanks. But I was given some kind of aptitude test. And I'm good with tools, so they made me a motor mechanic and a driver. So, I learned to drive the jeeps, the trucks and tanks, any of the motor vehicles. And they made me a motor mechanic.
Q: Okay.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Can you tell her really quickly how you learned to drive a stick shift?
A: Pardon?
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: How you learned to drive a stick shift.
A: Yeah. Well, I didn't know anything I was in England in a truck. I knew how to drive a civilian car.
Q: Not a military one?
A: And the trucks there needed double clutching. What did I know about double clutching so I could shift? But
Q: Yeah.
A: It was with the left hand. But I really screeched the gears.
Q: Well, you learned on military equipment.
A: Yeah.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: You used to take your cigarette packs and put them on top of the wheel.
A: Oh, that was later in AmericA: UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Oh, okay.
Q: But, you know forgive me. I'm a little confused. When you were sent to Indonesia, you were sent under which military force? Was it Dutch?
A: The Royal Netherlands Marine Corps.
Q: The Royal Netherlands Marine Corps, okay. Because if you were in Britain and then the United States, I wondered
A: Yeah.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: He was being trained by the American Marine Corps, but as a member of the Royal Dutch Marines.
Q: I see. I see. Okay. All right. So, there you are and you worked as a mechanic and motor driver for two years, two and a half years in Java?
A: Yeah. I drove more, but
Q: Were you just waiting to get out?
A: Yeah, I guess so.
Q: Where did your life take you after that?
A: Pardon?
Q: Where did your life take you after that?
A: I came back to Holland for demobilization and then I went to England. And I got a job there with grass dryers. England and Europe did not have dollars, and cattle food with high protein and carotene was very scarce. It had to come from here.
Q: Okay.
A: They had no dollars. So, there was a Dutchman that found out that if you dried grass, it grows to about four to six inches high very quickly.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: It was high in carotene and protein.
Q: Oh, for the cattle?
A: Yeah, for cattle. And then it could be ground up.
Q: Okay.
A: And these were not small factories. And I got involved with that company through my father.
Q: So, you saw him finally after you returned from Indonesia?
A: Yeah.
Q: And that had been probably ten years?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: And the somehow with the grass dryers my first job would be to lay out the anchor bolts in the concrete slabs and then supervise the building of these things. I have a picture somewhere. I don't know where.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And then there was a brick furnace on one end to heat the air. And then there was a rotating drum and the cyclone where the air the grass was blown in, chopped up, and then dried quickly; high protein, high carotene. And then it was ground into meal and then made into pellets for cattle food.
Q: Uhhuh. How long did you work there?
A: Oh, until 1950. And then I, I that job gave an awful lot of free time. It was a very generous salary. So, I was doing quite well and I sailed a lot in the free time. I sailed the south coast of England and the Channel.
And then in 1950 we decided that it might be fun to sail across to over here and then race in the transatlantic race back to England.
Q: Wow, what adventures.
A: So, in '50 I quit my job and went sailing.
Q: And did you sail across?
A: Oh, yeah.
Q: Oh, my goodness. You sailed across to the United States?
A: Yeah.
Q: Sounds like you never sailed back, however.
A: Pardon?
Q: Did you ever sail back?
A: Oh, yeah, of course.
Q: You sailed back to England?
A: Yeah.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: The transatlantic race.
A: We sailed we raced the Bermuda race and then the transatlantic race.
Q: Oh, my gosh.
A: That's 40foot.
Q: Oh, my gosh. I'm so impressed.
A: Yeah.
Q: When did you eventually come to the United States for good?
A: To knock about.
Q: Pardon?
A: Just to knock around.
Q: Just to knock around?
A: Yeah.
Q: Not to really stay here?
A: No.
Q: Okay.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That was in 1951. You were just going to check out the U.S.
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: And then on the steamer across I met a woman who didn't want the fish. The ship was on the way out to the North SeA: When lunch was served, there was open tables. I had already reserved a seat at another table, but
Q: Uhhuh.
A: Soup was served. Then the steward came by with fish.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And the woman next
Q: Uhhuh. I was just hearing a noise. Sorry.
A: Yeah. Then the steward came by with the second serving of fish. And the woman next to me refused and said, "No, I don't want the fish. I have to go on deck to wave to somebody before we pass the yoke of Holland." So, the steward asked would I mind to take her dish and I said, "No." We smiled at each other.
Q: Okay.
A: And then I got her fish dish and she never came back. Then later on the afternoon she was sitting on the deck chair on deck and I asked her if she had been able to get back on the deck on time. And then we would still talk.
Q: And that was the beginning of a conversation that has lasted until now?
A: Yeah.
Q: And, so, when you came to the United States, neither of you had intended to stay here?
A: No.
Q: But you did?
A: Yeah. Then we had decided we might like to get married. So, she went to Washington, D.C., and I went to Stamford, Connecticut.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: When I told my father that I wanted to go back to the states and knock around, he said, "But you know about grass dryers. They don't need them in AmericA: They're no good. Learn to milk cows."
Q: Uhhuh.
A: He said, "In the midwest, a good dairy, you can always find a job if you run out of money." So, I had to work as a pupil and pay a farm to learn to milk by hand
Q: Uhhuh.
A: first. He said, "Learn to milk by hand first." So, after a couple months, they gave me a good record, a letter, and I went to another farm to learn to milk by machine.
Q: And this was in Stamford, Connecticut?
A: No. That was
Q: Still in England?
A: In the states, in England.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: Then when I came to Stamford, a friend of the family there had just bought a farm in Vermont and needed somebody. And, well, I went with them for I needed a job. And I milked cows for a while. And then we got married in Vermont. But then I came down here to (inaudible) Manor and they needed a dairy manager. So, it worked out for a while. And then somehow
Q: And, so, you ended up staying in the Baltimore area?
A: Yes, until we retired. Then we went to FloridA: Well, every winter we took a vacation and we went to FloridA:
Q: Uhhuh. And then you came back here to live?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: And then in, in well, yeah, I fell and hurt my shoulder in FloridA: I couldn't climb a ladder anymore to take the ventilators off the roof during a hurricane. And David said, "You're too far away. If something happens to you guys, I can't just rush over. Why don't you come here." So,
Q: And do you have just the one son?
A: Yes.
Q: Just David?
A: And a granddaughter.
Q: And your granddaughter?
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: And my brother.
A: And a daughterinlaw.
Q: And a daughterinlaw.
A: And a grandson.
Q: And a grandson. So, your son's name is David. Your daughterinlaw's name is what?
A: CynthiA:
Q: CynthiA: And your granddaughter's name is?
A: Anna (inaudible).
Q: And grandson, John.
A: And John, yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: John lives in Richmond. He's in college there.
Q: Okay. Well, is there something else you'd like to add to your story?
A: Pardon?
Q: Is there something else I haven't asked about that you'd like to add to your story?
A: I don't know.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: You told me a good story about loading guns. You were teaching people how to load guns when you were storing Germans upstairs. Somebody accidentally shot somebody.
A: Pardon?
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: You were responsible for a German officer getting shot.
A: Oh, that was still just after liberation.
Q: Okay. This was just after liberation?
A: When the resistance took over and became the police force, then we had several other guys that enlisted as police. But I taught them. I was in charge of a whole bunch of weapons,
Q: Uhhuh.
A: also European and American. I would teach them how to shoot a few rounds and that was it.
Q: Uhhuh.
A: And they would unload the weapons. And I told them that because upstairs we had several prisoners, all Nazis, that normally you're taught to hold the weapon up and unload it. But we said, "Hold it between your legs and if somehow a round goes off, it goes through the floor."
Q: Uhhuh, yeah.
A: And that went fine. And then one day I think it was a Sergeant of the Professional Dutch Army came in
Q: Uhhuh.
A: in uniform and he saw the guys unload rifles. Then he took over and said, "No way." There were people living above us. And he just counted five rounds. But some of the guys would hold the top round down and put another one in the chamber and then close the bolt. So, they had six. It went fine for a while. But then he hit one with six and it fired and went through the floor and killed the guy, the third highest Nazi in the, Dutch Nazi in Holland.
Q: No. Really?
A: Yeah.
Q: What was his name?
A: I don't remember.
Q: You don't remember. But he was the third highest he was German rather than
A: No, he was Dutch.
Q: He was Dutch?
A: He was Dutch Nazi.
Q: And he was killed by accident?
A: Yeah. And then I was strongly reprimanded for letting somebody the officer said I had been how would you call it intimidated by a professional soldier.
Q: Yeah, who didn't listen.
A: Or sergeant.
Q: Who wasn't listening.
A: Thanks for reminding me.
Q: Okay.
A: You know more about it than I do. I forget things.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I just remember the good stories.
Q: Yeah. Well, okay. If that if there's anything else that you'd like to add.
A: I don't think so. Oh, could you get UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: What? The medals.
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay. Show me the medals.
(Pause)
Q: Oh, wow. There's so many of them. So, explain what these are for.
A: That was the Dutch resistance.
Q: Okay.
A: That was that I was in the Internal Armed Forces.
Q: Okay.
A: This is the Marine Corps insigniA:
Q: And this right here?
A: That is that I was a war volunteer. And that's me.
Q: Handsome guy. Okay. Well, then, this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Sybe Bakker on October 7th, 2013
A: Okay.
Q: in Catonsville, Maryland. Thank you. hank you for having shared your story.
A: Uhhuh. My maternal grandparents had a Jewish family live with them for three years in Holland
Q: Really?
A: in hiding. Then my grandfather died and then they had my grandmother had to get another family in the house. And, of course, there was a mad scramble to get rid of the Jewish family and find them another place to live.
Q: And, so, this was not the grandparents you grew up with, but your mother's parents?
A: Yeah.
Q: And you kept in contact with them?
A: Well, yeah. They lived not too far away. They were my stepmother's parents.
Q: Oh, they were your stepmother's parents?
A: Yeah.
Q: Your stepmother's parents. Well, thank you for adding that bit. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Conclusion of Interview
