id="s16">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s17">So my first question is an easy one.</span> <span id="s18">Give us your name, and when were you bo -- or your names, and when you were born, and where.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Answer: My name is Marsha Loen, Marsh Supporzhnikov Loen.</span> <span id="s20">My maiden name was Supporzhnikov.</span> <span id="s21">I was born in Lithuania, Kolnos.</span> <span id="s22">In fact, the outskirts of Kolnos, Labotkia.</span> <span id="s23">And I was born in 1930, July 28.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And when did liberation come for you, and what was it like?</span> <span id="s25">What state of mind, what physical health were you in, and where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: I was liberated in a silo after the last march called Chinno, that a lot of ki -- little camps out of Stutthof were concentrated.</span> <span id="s27">And the two typhuses broke out.</span> <span id="s28">And to tell you the honest truth, I don’t remember when I was liberated.</span> <span id="s29">I thought they were burning down the silo, so I covered myself with straw, but there were people were left, the dead around me, and I woke up in a German house, with the Russian’s doctor taking care of me.</span> <span id="s30">I had the two typhuses.</span> <span id="s31">And then they shaved my head again, and they put a salve on it, and I looked like musselwoman.</span> <span id="s32">And I could hardly walk, or talk, or recognize anything.</span> <span id="s33">And after three days, or a week, I don’t know exactly, they told us we have to leave that village, because the front is coming on.</span> <span id="s34">So we should walk to Lomborg.</span> <span id="s35">Lomborg is in Polmarin.</span> <span id="s36">And it was not far from Chinno.</span> <span id="s37">And as we were walking, I with a little friend of mine holding a hand, we saw two Russian soldiers, and I -- that I will never forget, and a two carriage -- two wheel carriage -- officers, and we asked them to take us to Lomborg, and you know we covered our head with -- with scarves, and we -- they shouldn’t notice that we have typhus.</span> <span id="s38">And they said, “No, we cannot do it, because we are not allowed to.”</span> <span id="s39">But they felt so sorry for the two youngsters, that they put us behind, in that little carriage, but they said, “The first house in Lomborg, you have to get out.”</span> <span id="s40">So, as we came into Lomborg, the first house, they said in -- in Russian, out.</span> <span id="s41">So, we went out, and the first house we walked in.</span> <span id="s42">And all I can remember is everything was empty, except there was a big, big rug, maybe a Persian rug, I don’t know, at that time I didn’t know from Persian rug, or China rug, or anything else.</span> <span id="s43">And in the middle was standing a bottle, with blueberries.</span> <span id="s44">And I didn’t know it was preserve, or something.</span> <span id="s45">There was no water in that house, nothing.</span> <span id="s46">And we were still sick, I and that little girl, we had a temperature little bit, and we were -- we were really out.</span> <span id="s47">And sh -- she said, “Shall we drink it?”</span> <span id="s48">I said, “I am afraid it may be poisoned.”</span> <span id="s49">Left poison, there’s that bottle standing there, there’s no water, there’s nothing.</span> <span id="s50">And then we couldn’t stand it any more, and what happened is is we drank, and we ate those blueberries.</span> <span id="s51">And at that time I was so young, I didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s52">Later on I realized that we got up the next morning, and we felt so much better, that it was fermemented.</span> <span id="s53">It was set up for wine, or something, and it helped the temperature.</span> <span id="s54">And our temperature dropped.</span> <span id="s55">We s -- we went around, and we looked around like scavengers for food, and we found some food, and then I recognized some people from my hometown, and they was already looking -- you know, after two weeks, three weeks, they’re grown up people.</span> <span id="s56">And they saw me, it was like a lifesaver for them, because the Russians are going on the front to Lomborg, and they were raping the women.</span> <span id="s57">German, Jewish, it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s58">They were getting drunk and raping them.</span> <span id="s59">So what they did is they -- they dragged me and that little girl into their apartment where they lived, six women.</span> <span id="s60">And if you put a sign up that it’s typhus, the Russians didn’t care, they just tore it down and they came in, and they made hia -- chaos.</span> <span id="s61">And what happened is -- is that whenever a Russian came in, they took my scarf off my head, and they gave me a bottle with medicine, and they send me out in the front room, and turn on the light, and the Russians, as drunk as they were, they start running, because they know there was typhus in that -- I was over already, but still looked like a musselwoman, you know, sick with the salve on my head.</span> <span id="s62">They start running.</span> <span id="s63">And this is how I saved six women from being raped by the Russians.</span> <span id="s64">Then my hair start growing in a little bit, and I was going down the stairs, and there was a little pond near that apartment, and there wasn’t that much water, and anything, and I thought I’ll wash out my -- whatever I have, in that pond.</span> <span id="s65">And all of a sudden I looked up, and there were two big, black boots in front of me, and I looked up, and he said to me, in Russian -- at that time I was still speaking Russian.</span> <span id="s66">He said, “Ateeja dofka.”</span> <span id="s67">I mean, am -- am I Jewish.</span> <span id="s68">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s69">He said, “I am too, from Odessa, don’t get scared.”</span> <span id="s70">So I took him up into the apartment where the girls were.</span> <span id="s71">They saw us [indecipherable] they got so scared, they said, “Are you out of your mind?”</span> <span id="s72">You know, they dragged me back in the other room.</span> <span id="s73">And it so happened that it -- he was there for two weeks.</span> <span id="s74">He fall in love with me, he wanted to marry me.</span> <span id="s75">He gave me even a wedding band.</span> <span id="s76">And I wasn’t even 15 years old yet.</span> <span id="s77">But nobody knew that.</span> <span id="s78">And he says to me he is going on the front, and he is going to write to his father, and his father will la -- his father is a doctor in the army, a big officer, and arrange to pick me up.</span> <span id="s79">And I thought to myself, “Let him talk.”</span> <span id="s80">But -- but the mo -- wonderful thing was about it, for all two weeks he slept in the front room of our apartment, so nobody could get in.</span> <span id="s81">And when he left, we went to work in a hospital, to help the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s82">So we slept there, so nobody could touch us there either.</span> <span id="s83">And one day a man came up to me, and he said, “Akeem Marouskas Supporzhnikova?”</span> <span id="s84">Am I Marsha Supporzhniko -- Marouska -- ma -- Marioshka Supporzhnikov.</span> <span id="s85">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s86">“My son wrote a letter at home that you are here in Lomborg, and I was looking for you, and here I find you in the hospital.</span> <span id="s87">I would like to send you to Odessa.</span> <span id="s88">He wants to marry you.”</span> <span id="s89">And I told him, I said, “I cannot do it.</span> <span id="s90">I have to go back home first.</span> <span id="s91">I have to see where my -- if I have any family left, I have anything,” I said.</span> <span id="s92">He said, “Do you love my son?”</span> <span id="s93">I said, “I don’t know him well enough.</span> <span id="s94">I don’t know what love is.”</span> <span id="s95">I s -- I -- he didn’t know my age, he didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s96">Nobody know nothing about anybody.</span> <span id="s97">And, you know, I was still scared to tell my age, because my two little sisters were killed because they were under 15.</span> <span id="s98">And I -- so even after I was liberated, I was afraid to tell my age.</span> <span id="s99">So, even to that man that was the fa -- and I asked him, I said -- this may not be interested on the tape, but I asked him, I said, “Tell me, why are you, a officer in a different battalion, from a different town than your son is, and you’re not even Jewish?”</span> <span id="s100">Everybody says Marshall Zou, or whatever his name was, I don’t even remember, and he says, “You see, they took us, the Jewish officers, and doctors, and send us to different places, because when we were caught from the Germans, that the soldiers, the Russian soldiers shouldn’t give us out that we are Jews on top of it.”</span> <span id="s101">So this is my first lesson I learned, that I wasn’t the only one that suffered, and there were other people as young as I was, at -- it concentrated, that answer concentrated into my mind.</span> <span id="s102">And we felt better, and we didn’t know there was [indecipherable] existed.</span> <span id="s103">We didn’t know about people not going back home or nothing.</span> <span id="s104">All I want is to go home, and see what’s happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Would you let me ask you just one quick question.</span> <span id="s106">Did you know anything about your family members at that point?</span> <span id="s107">Are -- you know your sist -- your two sisters -- you said your two sisters were --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: My two little sister, my mother, was taken away in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s109">I didn’t know if they are -- were dead, or alive, or nothing.</span> <span id="s110">I had a feeling that they were killed there.</span> <span id="s111">All taken to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s112">Now that I read the books about it, ther -- and then from there to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s113">I don’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s114">I can only tell you I lost them, about maybe a week after we were in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s115">But the only thing that bothered me is that they were taken out of the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and given civilian clothes when they were taken away.</span> <span id="s116">And when I wanted to go with them, they left a big dog on me, this is all in my other tape.</span> <span id="s117">And all I wanted to go and see if anybody was left.</span> <span id="s118">I was -- my father was in Dachau.</span> <span id="s119">I know my grandfathers were taken away in the beginning, and -- and this -- I knew they were dead.</span> <span id="s120">My other family -- certain family members were all dead, because I know they were taken on the ninefort and killed in Kovno, of the Kovno ghetto.</span> <span id="s121">And anybody did nothing -- not many people escaped from the ninefort.</span> <span id="s122">But the thing is is, is -- what I want to tell you is that I wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s123">So they said yes, they’ll s -- they’ll s -- put us on trains, and they’ll send us home.</span> <span id="s124">So they put us on big trucks, and they took us to a place, a good -- I don’t know how to say it in English, a ranch, a big ranch in -- in Palmerton, it was near Nimitz, near -- not far from Stetlin, not far from Lomborg, Rigenwald, Lomborg, and so on.</span> <span id="s125">And they took us there, and there were some Russian girls, white Russian girls, they were playing the piano.</span> <span id="s126">And the Jewish girls, the one that went with the Germans -- and the Jewish girls, they put us to clean up stalls, and they put us to -- to -- to -- to -- to the dirtiest work in the world.</span> <span id="s127">They didn’t give us enough food, the Russians.</span> <span id="s128">They didn’t kill us, they didn’t beat us, but there was a -- they -- we -- we -- we were always watched, we were always watched with guards, like in the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s129">The only difference was that we weren’t beaten up, we weren’t treated as dirty Jews, but we were treated different.</span> <span id="s130">There were about maybe 10 Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s131">And one day the captain asked me if I -- asked anybody if they would like to go to learn with veterinarian.</span> <span id="s132">There is a doctor in Rigenwald that will teach veterinarian, because what they were doing is taking the cows and the horses of the fields that were running wild.</span> <span id="s133">And they opened a conzerr factory, and they open a cheese factory.</span> <span id="s134">And what they did is, they needed the cows to be healthy, to see if they’re healthy, they take -- to take analysis from horses -- I found that out later, when I came back.</span> <span id="s135">I said, “I’m going.”</span> <span id="s136">Like in German concentration camp, in those little camps, if they needed somebody to go to threshing, f -- harvesting or something, people were sent to s -- Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s137">I didn’t care any more when they took away my mother, my two little sisters, and the rest of my family.</span> <span id="s138">So I was the first one, I -- he sa -- I said, “I am going to Rigenwald.”</span> <span id="s139">We came to Rigenwald, the doctor that they sent to teach us, it must have been from different camps around that, but from our camp we went only one Russian girl, and two Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s140">And what happened is is that -- what’s so amazing is that the doctor was a drunk.</span> <span id="s141">He was compl -- always drunk.</span> <span id="s142">And we learned some.</span> <span id="s143">We learned how to protect when a cow is slaughtered, to recognize if it has tuberculosis around the lungs.</span> <span id="s144">We learned how to take analysis from a horse’s neck.</span> <span id="s145">We learned ho -- if they got this eye sickness, the horses, to get rid of them.</span> <span id="s146">We learned the cows, they had a certain thing on their skin, to put them -- what is the end of a -- of a match called?</span> <span id="s147">It’s a certain chemical.</span> <span id="s148">Put them in a tent, and put them into the chemical.</span> <span id="s149">So get away the sickness shouldn’t spread.</span> <span id="s150">We learned certain things in -- in about three weeks, but the most important thing for me was that I made friends with the put -- Polkolvnik’s wife, with the main man’s wife.</span> <span id="s151">I must have had in me pa-part of it of my father, like I said before.</span> <span id="s152">She went in a nightgown to the opera, and [indecipherable] others.</span> <span id="s153">I -- I told her that’s not proper.</span> <span id="s154">I told her your hair doesn’t look, let me comb it for you.</span> <span id="s155">We got to be the best of friends, I and the Pot -- Polkolvnik’s wife.</span> <span id="s156">And they treated me like a daughter the two weeks I was -- three weeks we were there.</span> <span id="s157">After three weeks we got a paper with a pitshot, you know, with the stamp, like the Russians always do.</span> <span id="s158">Akivia trinarn inyarz.</span> <span id="s159">I was a veterinarian nurse, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s160">We came into that village again, we worked.</span> <span id="s161">We worked with the horses, we worked this.</span> <span id="s162">Two weeks later, after we came back from Rigenwald, they put -- Polkovnik and his wife arrived in that good -- in that trench.</span> <span id="s163">There was a very, very ugly captain that run it, and he hated Jews, very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s164">And he said, “Akdere Marouska?”</span> <span id="s165">Where is marsh -- Marouska.</span> <span id="s166">And the captain said, “In her room with the other Jewish girl.”</span> <span id="s167">He says, “In her room?</span> <span id="s168">You mean to tell me she doesn’t have an apartment of her own?”</span> <span id="s169">And his wife got very mad.</span> <span id="s170">He said, “I want to call her immediately for dinner, to have dinner with us.”</span> <span id="s171">Because there was dinner in the captain’s house.</span> <span id="s172">It’s a bi -- in the good -- you know, in the ranch, the big ranch house.</span> <span id="s173">So when he called me in, I had dinner with them, and he gave a order to the captain that I have to have my own apartment, that I have to be in charge of the cheese factory.</span> <span id="s174">I have to be sent to a different village.</span> <span id="s175">But in a couple of weeks, till they have everything prepared, and -- now, don’t forget, in July atel -- I was liberated in March, and July atel 15.</span> <span id="s176">And what happened is is before I left for the other -- good for the other ranch, big ranch, the Jewish girls were playing a piano, and the Russian girls were cleaning the stalls.</span> <span id="s177">But what they did is, I was there to be heavily guarded, because they would have killed me, the Russian girls.</span> <span id="s178">So what happened is is when I went to that good, I arrived, and I was all of a sudden I was in charge of a milk factory -- cheese factory, and at night the Russian soldiers from all around, from the good that I worked in, the ranch, from all the ranches they would come, and -- and Polish soldiers they would come, and I would give them all cheeses and milk, cause the Russian soldiers weren’t fed either.</span> <span id="s179">They would cut around the tuberculosis, around the cows, and then they would make like a soup with potatoes, and every -- that all they had to eat all day.</span> <span id="s180">Everything was shipped to Russia.</span> <span id="s181">And what happened is is that they liked me very much the Russian soldiers, and the Polish soldiers came, and there came some fliers from Stettlin, and they would bring liquor and so on.</span> <span id="s182">But one thing would happen, when they would get too drunk, the woman that owned that ranch was a very, very wealthy woman.</span> <span id="s183">That’s the first time I ate waffles in my life, because she had the stove that she moved waffles around.</span> <span id="s184">She was from Pullman.</span> <span id="s185">She was German, from Pullman, and she was like a mother to me.</span> <span id="s186">So the minute she saw that they got drunk, she lock me upstairs in one of the quarters, and nobody could get near me.</span> <span id="s187">But I did a lot of things in that camp that a child of my age wouldn’t do.</span> <span id="s188">I was boar hunting, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s189">I was boar hunting with the Russians, with the Polish officers.</span> <span id="s190">I -- I did everything I wanted.</span> <span id="s191">I run that village.</span> <span id="s192">And I was ride out, with the guard of course, I would ride out to the fields, and check up on the pomeron women, and see the German women, and see how they milked the cows, if they are clean in the fields and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: How did you know how to manage that?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s195">It just came natural to me.</span> <span id="s196">It just came natural to me.</span> <span id="s197">In the beginning I was very ver -- I said I was going to take revenge.</span> <span id="s198">In the beginning I was riding my horse, I would see children on the street, I didn’t care, I was ride -- dust, the dirt and everything.</span> <span id="s199">But then about a month later, I was taking them medicine, and food, I was stealing from the Russians, and giving to the poor German kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: This is a Jewish heart.</span> <span id="s202">We’re a very compassionate people.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: So when you got some compassion again, and could build yourself up, then you were able to --</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Not very long -- didn’t take me very long to build up, to feel sorry for those kids, and take them food, and take them medicine, and steal from the Russians.</span> <span id="s205">And one day the captain came to me, and that -- this is a really funny story.</span> <span id="s206">He came to me to my village.</span> <span id="s207">And he says, you know there was a befell -- was like when there’s a order that the -- the Russians can take nothing away animal from the Germans.</span> <span id="s208">Absolutely nothing, no cows, no horses, nothing.</span> <span id="s209">And the eye sickness of the horses, I forgot how it was called.</span> <span id="s210">I was never a veterinarian, so I forgot it.</span> <span id="s211">Broke out and we lost seven horses, and they put -- Polkovnik was coming, and he said, “Your village is full of horses.”</span> <span id="s212">He’s talking to a grown up person, you know.</span> <span id="s213">“I need seven horses.”</span> <span id="s214">I said, “Fine, I’ll give you seven horses.</span> <span id="s215">You release seven see -- seven girls from the -- that you’re holding.</span> <span id="s216">If you put them on the train, I’ll give you seven.”</span> <span id="s217">Said, “I can’t do that many, but I’ll release some.”</span> <span id="s218">I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s219">So how do I do it?</span> <span id="s220">I have to have a plan.</span> <span id="s221">So I sat down, and I talked to the German woman that took care of me, and I made myself a plan.</span> <span id="s222">I am -- I got a lot of fantastic liquor from those majors that came, from the -- the pilots from Stettlin.</span> <span id="s223">And I invited seven officers from the Polish camp.</span> <span id="s224">And we got them so drunk that they were flat on the floor.</span> <span id="s225">We took off their uniforms, there were waiting seven Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s226">We put the Polish uniform on the Russian soldier, and the Russian soldiers, they went out, they got the seven horses, came back, got them dressed back their uniform, dropped them on a cart, and took them back to their camp.</span> <span id="s227">The next thing the rumor was in the village that the Polish army stole seven horses.</span> <span id="s228">Now I had something over that captain.</span> <span id="s229">He was so afraid of me that you have no idea.</span> <span id="s230">Because God forbid he should go to the higher ups, and everything.</span> <span id="s231">So everything I wanted, I got.</span> <span id="s232">So when the soldiers from each camp, when I rode with them, wanted to come and eat at my camp, they came and eat.</span> <span id="s233">If they wanted to -- whatever they wanted to -- the Jewish girls lived the life of Riley, and he was afraid of me as hell.</span> <span id="s234">One day I was riding with a man from Georgia, I’ll never forget, and a short Jewish man came up to me, and in Jewish says to me, “Are y -- do you know anybody by the name of Myashka Supporzhnikov?”</span> <span id="s235">And I said to him like that.</span> <span id="s236">I put my hand to my throat, my mouth, and I said, “Oh please don’t say anything.”</span> <span id="s237">And the Russian soldier understood what he said, or he had a feeling.</span> <span id="s238">He said, “Marouska, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s239">Anything you want I’ll do for you, because you saved my life, you got some medicine when I was sick.</span> <span id="s240">You brought food for me.</span> <span id="s241">I will help you with anything I can.”</span> <span id="s242">A very, very lo -- I couldn’t say low [indecipherable] because he was intelligent, with intelligent you have to be born.</span> <span id="s243">Very average person, you know?</span> <span id="s244">And I couldn’t understand why he does it.</span> <span id="s245">And he said, you know what?</span> <span id="s246">So I tell him the story, that I found out from that man that my father is alive in Lódz, in Poland, and he came to pick me up.</span> <span id="s247">So he said to me, “Not only will I take you -- let you go, but I’ll take you to the train.”</span> <span id="s248">And I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s249">When we came into the villages, the houses were empty, but there was so much clothes, and jewelry, and cameras.</span> <span id="s250">With everything was in my apartment, when I was riding on that horse, I didn’t even have a sweater on.</span> <span id="s251">I’ll never forget, I had the silk, maroon blouse on.</span> <span id="s252">I remember now, I didn’t remember before, riding boots, and -- and they’re real good boots, because one of the officer, police officer, brought it to me, and riding pants.</span> <span id="s253">That’s all I had with me, because I was going with him to check out the fields, how the milk is going, how everything is going.</span> <span id="s254">And I said, “Okay.</span> <span id="s255">You are taking me to the train, but I’m going to give you a letter.</span> <span id="s256">And when the captain does something to you, you tell him, ‘I have a letter from Maroushka about the seven horses.’ ”</span> <span id="s257">I said, “At least I can do for you that you don’t get punished, or put in jail, or anything like that.”</span> <span id="s258">So what I did is I -- I still wrote Russian at that time, I sat down, and in no time I wrote him a letter.</span> <span id="s259">He took us to the train.</span> <span id="s260">And that man says to me, “Now remember, I am Polish, I speak very good Polish, your father send me, and I want you to be like you’re -- you don’t know how to speak, you don’t know how to -- you’re -- you’re dumb.</span> <span id="s261">Whatever anybody says, you just move your head.”</span> <span id="s262">Because at that time, the Polish Akar, the Polish fascists were killing the Jews like crazy, especially on trains, and so on.</span> <span id="s263">And I listened to him, and he might -- I don’t even [indecipherable] I was freezing a little bit.</span> <span id="s264">And I went to -- we went with the train and we arrived in Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: When about -- when abouts was that [inaudible] time?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: That was still in 1945, the end of 1945.</span> <span id="s267">I think it was the end of 1940 -- yes, the end of 1945.</span> <span id="s268">And I arrived in Lódz, and that’s in Poland, and I met my father, and I met a lot of people from my town that were left ali -- not a lot, because you know, people that were left over, and of course, my father couldn’t tell me something that I couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s269">I was smoking, and he said, “You can’t smoke.”</span> <span id="s270">And I said, “What do you mean to tell me I can’t smoke?</span> <span id="s271">I can smoke, I can do whatever I want to.”</span> <span id="s272">If I thought to myself, maybe at that time -- I don’t know if I thought to myself this way, if I can handle a Po-Polkovnik [indecipherable] I can handle my father, you know.</span> <span id="s273">If he tells me not to smoke, it’s none of his business if I smoke or I don’t smoke.</span> <span id="s274">And at that time my father was a tailor, a very good tailor.</span> <span id="s275">That what saved our life also in the Kovno ghetto.</span> <span id="s276">And he start work.</span> <span id="s277">He worked in -- in Lódz as a tailor, and he helped a lot of people from Lithuania, from Kovno that went through Lódz.</span> <span id="s278">He had a big apartment, and in -- the one -- that apartment, downstairs was a big room.</span> <span id="s279">I don’t -- it was like a hole.</span> <span id="s280">And anybody that went through, went through my fa -- they said, “Go to Beryl Supporzhnikov.”</span> <span id="s281">And they went through, and everybody knew him, because he was a very good looking man from Kovno, very well dressed, and always the best.</span> <span id="s282">And th-they came, and he would give them food, and he wouldn’t let them go back to Lithuania, because he found out that it’s not good there.</span> <span id="s283">You know, I found out later on that I have an older sister in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s284">This is how he found out that I am in that camp, from her.</span> <span id="s285">Somehow she found out from somebody that I am alive in that camp.</span> <span id="s286">Maybe somebody that escaped.</span> <span id="s287">And she let my father know it.</span> <span id="s288">People smuggled in things.</span> <span id="s289">So he know what was going on.</span> <span id="s290">The people are trying to go out of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s291">So anybody that went through that wanted to go back to Kovno, to Lithuania, he wouldn’t let them.</span> <span id="s292">He kept them there, he kept them till the kibbutz took them, and took them over to Bratislava, and then to displaced camps.</span> <span id="s293">Because at that time Lódz wasn’t yet Communistic as much, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Actually, maybe we should --</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Can we stop --</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: -- take a little break --</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: -- at the end there?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: -- because this is the -- yeah, let me just -- I made my [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: I have to go to the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s301">This is the end of tape one, side A, interview with Marsha Loen.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marsha Loen.</span> <span id="s304">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s305">So you were in Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: So I arrived in Lódz, and my father, and everybody, we were partying, and of course I was smoking, like I said, and my father said, “You can’t smoke,” and I said, “Yes I can.”</span> <span id="s307">And anyway, he did not have a big control over me, that I have to say.</span> <span id="s308">And it was very sad.</span> <span id="s309">And for one reason my father didn’t have a big control over me, and I hate to say it, my father was a very selfish man, and I remembered him from ghetto, what he did to us.</span> <span id="s310">And I really -- I loved my father, but I didn’t like him.</span> <span id="s311">I’m sorry to say this, should rest in peace.</span> <span id="s312">And what happened is is that in Lódz he says to me -- he -- he knew that my mother is dead, and he got himself a girlfriend, a friend of my mothers, that she lost her husband and two kids, also in the Kovno ghetto.</span> <span id="s313">And what happened is is that he says to me, “I have enough money to smuggle the border.”</span> <span id="s314">Now he-here he helps all the strangers, and his only leftover child, he says, “I have enough money to smuggle the border for me and Rocholla.</span> <span id="s315">I don’t have enough money for you.”</span> <span id="s316">So what do I do?</span> <span id="s317">I went into the kibbutz, in -- to work in the hospital because I know how to give a injection, you know, I learned a little bit there at the Russian camp, by working with the animals, it’s not that different to give a injection, and take a temperature, and so on.</span> <span id="s318">So I went into the kibbutz, and I stayed in the kibbutz, and I learned how to -- in Lódz -- and I worked in the hospital, and in Madrid the head of the kibbutz came to me, and he says, “Marsha,” -- now, nobody knew my age.</span> <span id="s319">I -- I looked so much older than I am, thanks God, that why I was alive -- I don’t know if it’s thanks God or not.</span> <span id="s320">And he says to me, “You know what,” he says, “you want to go -- get over on the other side?”</span> <span id="s321">I says, “Yes, I want to get away from Lódz,” because I was engaged to a man that was 34 years old, and I was not -- I was 15.</span> <span id="s322">He gave a diamond watch to a friend of my fathers, to introduce us.</span> <span id="s323">And he was so jealous when I went away on business or something in Lódz, and when he came back and I wasn’t home, he was running all over, looking for me.</span> <span id="s324">And I had already my wedding dress, because he impressed me so tremendously.</span> <span id="s325">You know, coming out of the concentration camps, coming out of that place, that Russian camp, and everything, and he brought me presents, and -- and he took me to places, but I could not speak Jewish, and I could not speak any other language with him.</span> <span id="s326">So he said, “I will do the speaking, you keep quiet, Marouska.”</span> <span id="s327">And that -- that was it.</span> <span id="s328">So he impressed me with all the diamonds, and all the sweaters, and -- and he was a very, very rich man.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: What nationality was he again?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: He was a Jewish -- a Polish Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: And what language did he want to speak with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: He want to spea -- he couldn’t speak, because the Akar are killing people in Lódz, in the bus stops, everywhere you went.</span> <span id="s333">Not many people could go to a movie in 1940s -- end of 1945, beginning of 1946.</span> <span id="s334">They couldn’t go to a movie.</span> <span id="s335">They couldn’t walk the streets and speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s336">Absolutely not, Jewish.</span> <span id="s337">So what happened is is he impressed me with all those things, and I was going to marry him.</span> <span id="s338">Then -- and then I realized it, oh my gosh, I can’t marry that man, that man is -- could -- is older -- practically as old as my father, he is jealous, I don’t have no friends, I can’t make any friends.</span> <span id="s339">Now this is me thinking, a youngster, a teenager.</span> <span id="s340">And I said, “I have to get away from him.”</span> <span id="s341">So on our engagement party at this cousin’s estate in Lódz, I dance with his best friend, a Jew from the Polish army, and I came back to the couch, and he doesn’t want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s342">So I said to the friend, “Chaim, give me my cape.”</span> <span id="s343">And I took my cape, and I went to my father’s house.</span> <span id="s344">And I said, “Would you like to go to Bratislav right now,” the next morning?</span> <span id="s345">And he was running after me, and he was yelling, and stop, and he came to the door, and that friend of his left, and I locked the door.</span> <span id="s346">He said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s347">I said, “Pack.”</span> <span id="s348">And I run over -- from the other side, I run over to the kibbutz, and I told that man, I’m taking -- that was the next day that that was -- he wanted me to take the transport.</span> <span id="s349">Everything -- you see, we were trained to take the transport over the border, people that wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s350">And that what -- why I went into the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s351">He said to me -- I said to him, “I’ll take that transport.</span> <span id="s352">But my father and my stepmother go,” -- I -- I mi -- I called her my stepmother, she wasn’t yet -- “goes with me.”</span> <span id="s353">He says, “Okay, it’s arranged.”</span> <span id="s354">Because it so happened that the people that were supposed to take me -- it, the couple don’t feel so hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: The idea was to go to Palestine eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s357">The ide -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s358">We had to get out of Lódz.</span> <span id="s359">Oh, yes, the idea to go to Palestine was from the beginning.</span> <span id="s360">To go to Palestine, that was my ideal thing.</span> <span id="s361">So here we are, we’re ready, and everybody, I’m taking 25 people over the border to Bratislav.</span> <span id="s362">From Lódz to Bratislav, the Akar shooting after us.</span> <span id="s363">Now, I want to tell you, my stepmother Rocholla, was with me in the same camp, and I helped her stay behind, because she froze her feet up.</span> <span id="s364">My feet were frozen, too.</span> <span id="s365">They took off her fingers from one foot, in Lódz, and she couldn’t walk that fast.</span> <span id="s366">They wanted to take some of my toes off, and I wouldn’t let them, because the doctor said there’s a chance that they can heal that.</span> <span id="s367">So I went for therapy, and what I did is, I washed floors, I did everything to pay the doctor.</span> <span id="s368">And the doctor gave me therapy, hot and cold baths, and salves, and everything, and it starts -- it looked like I had a fungus on my foot, but it start healing.</span> <span id="s369">And I could walk.</span> <span id="s370">And then when I went into the kibbutz, the kibbutz paid part of it.</span> <span id="s371">So, in about two and a half months, my feet were ready to go.</span> <span id="s372">And I had those -- they got me orthopedic shoes at the kibbutz, and I went.</span> <span id="s373">And as we were going, what I wanted to tell you, I run away from that guy -- later on I heard he had a nervous breakdown, I don’t know about that one.</span> <span id="s374">But I want to tell you the Akar, you couldn’t go to a movie, you couldn’t go to a restaurant if you were Jewish, if you spoke Jewish.</span> <span id="s375">They a -- every day they had something happen Jew in Lódz.</span> <span id="s376">One was shot in a -- in a bus stop, the other one was deesent, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s377">For me, it was a terrible thing, because as bad as the Russian was, they never beat us, they never hurt us, they never shot us.</span> <span id="s378">So I went and I took that transport.</span> <span id="s379">And the Akar was shooting after us.</span> <span id="s380">It was in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s381">And I -- ed -- everybody slowed down, and they were mad at me because of my stepmother.</span> <span id="s382">It didn’t take long we arrived in Bratislav.</span> <span id="s383">Arrived in Bratislav, my father never said thank you to me for taking him, and everything else, but they put us on trains to go to Germany, and to go -- and it so happened that we went through Austria with the train.</span> <span id="s384">And they said, “Who would like to stay in Austria?”</span> <span id="s385">And I saw those beautiful mountains, and that beautiful scenery, and like I told you, at the Russian camp I was boar hunting, and I was riding, and I loved sports.</span> <span id="s386">Even as a child, when I was eight years old, I was at the school Olympics, you know.</span> <span id="s387">So what happened is is that I was a daredevil.</span> <span id="s388">I was a -- like I’m a tomboy when I was a youngster.</span> <span id="s389">Because there was a certain branch out from my wer -- my grandfather from my mother’s side was a very well-to-do man, and I was his angel.</span> <span id="s390">It’s supposed to be a boy, but still he called me by a boyish name, Yankela.</span> <span id="s391">But I was his life.</span> <span id="s392">So what I mean is that I -- I -- from the beginning, you know, I wasn’t in public school, I was thrown out when I was seven years old.</span> <span id="s393">I hit a teacher, accidentally, you know.</span> <span id="s394">Not accidentally, sh -- a man was putting ink in the back of my head, a boy.</span> <span id="s395">And I told her, and she said -- and she didn’t like it, because she knows I come from a better family.</span> <span id="s396">So she, “You keep quiet.</span> <span id="s397">You sit down.”</span> <span id="s398">And it happened four times, I couldn’t stand it any more.</span> <span id="s399">And you know the way they sit in Europe, you’re a German, you know.</span> <span id="s400">The teacher sits in front before you go out the door.</span> <span id="s401">So I took my thing that I was writing in, my book -- my pad -- my notebook, and I took it and I hit it at her, and I said, “I am leaving.”</span> <span id="s402">And accidentally I hit her nose.</span> <span id="s403">Anyway, that’s a long story, I’m not going to get into it.</span> <span id="s404">I was thrown out of the school, and my grandfather had to pay a lot of money.</span> <span id="s405">He would have loved me to go to Hebrew school, but they -- they wouldn’t take me in, so I went to komairts gimnasia, it was a Jewish private school.</span> <span id="s406">So I’m telling you, I was a daredevil from the beginning.</span> <span id="s407">So as we come to that beautiful country Austria, I said, “Papa, if you and Rocholla want to go on to Germany, go ahead.</span> <span id="s408">I’m staying in this country in.</span> <span id="s409">Because they told us they are taking us to places where they put us up, and from there we’ll be able to go to Palestine, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Who were -- who were they?</span> <span id="s411">I just wondered.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: That was also the Bricha.</span> <span id="s413">But at that time I didn’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s414">You understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s415">So I sat on the train, they stopped the train, we went off, and we went toward this place called Verkshide [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s416">It was a horrible place.</span> <span id="s417">It was wooden barracks.</span> <span id="s418">The food was also rationed, but it was good.</span> <span id="s419">We were DDT’s, and so on.</span> <span id="s420">So again, I said, why should I take that.</span> <span id="s421">So I made friends with the American essing officer that distribute the food, and he had the -- the trucks and so on.</span> <span id="s422">I made friends with Dr. Dimetritus, because I helped him in -- that he was a Greek -- not Jewish, Greek that run the -- the -- the hospital in the displaced camp, and also the head of the displaced camp.</span> <span id="s423">So -- and I also worked for the -- for the Itterdude.</span> <span id="s424">That’s organization from -- from the first president of -- of Palestine, and -- in the young brigade, goldonia.</span> <span id="s425">And I -- in the displaced camp, in Verkshide, I made friends with them, so oh -- and I was getting looking very good.</span> <span id="s426">I was a pretty good looking girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Still are.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: And I had very good friends, and I -- that essing officer, and everybody, they were just doing everything when I ask, and so on.</span> <span id="s429">And there were a lot of ma -- people sent to the displaced camp from Israel, they were called Sheliaks, to talk to the people how to get over to Palestine, and at that time.</span> <span id="s430">And I met with them, and I went out with them one night to a night club, that a friend of mine’s mother owned it, Alonstra, it’s in Linz, in Austria.</span> <span id="s431">And I get a call from the pharmacist, from the -- from the displaced camp.</span> <span id="s432">He says, “Marsha, we are going to DDT the camp.”</span> <span id="s433">Verkshide.</span> <span id="s434">He said, “Would you like to have some fun?”</span> <span id="s435">This is how I met my husband, I want to tell you this sto -- that’s why I’m telling you this story.</span> <span id="s436">I said, “I love to, as long as you don’t touch my barrack, or my father’s.”</span> <span id="s437">Said fine.</span> <span id="s438">So I came, and they put me in in a white, big, long thing with a mask.</span> <span id="s439">And I am going around, and I am spraying the barracks, and being very gentle about it, because it’s my people, and everything, and all of a sudden I open a room, and the people are sitting, they are all dressed beautiful, drinking wine, having beautiful food and everything.</span> <span id="s440">And I got so mad that I pulled my mask down, and I start spraying the DDT at them.</span> <span id="s441">And one of them was my husband, Cornelius.</span> <span id="s442">And at that time he saw my eyes, he saw my face, and he said he fall in love with me.</span> <span id="s443">He was em -- then they liquidated Verkshide, and they send us to a much better displaced camp called Bindermichl.</span> <span id="s444">And that was -- Goering’s built some apartment houses.</span> <span id="s445">So they put two, three families into rooms, a family into a room, and with my father -- I live with my father, I got mad at my father, I walked out on him.</span> <span id="s446">I went to live with a girlfriend, it so happened in the same place my husband had a room with another man, and my husband worked for the Joint at that time.</span> <span id="s447">Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s448">And I met him, and what happened is I worked for the bri -- for the Itterdude, and I start getting into the Bricha business.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: What did you do, when you say you worked for them, what did you do exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: I -- I wrote for them, I translated for them in Russian, in Yiddish, in whatever it is.</span> <span id="s451">I worked on the Jewish typewriter, and -- you know, in -- in the same time when we moved to Bindermichl, I said, “I’m going to go to school.”</span> <span id="s452">To go to school -- I spoke a little bit of German, and to go to school you had to be a certain age, but I wanted to -- I want to go into art school.</span> <span id="s453">Just go all over, all those things we’re speaking, German, nothing, for me that doesn’t exist.</span> <span id="s454">I want to go to art school.</span> <span id="s455">To go to art school I had to take a course in German, and I went into art school, and also worked for the Itterdude at the same time.</span> <span id="s456">And one day they said to me, “Marsha, we are going to take some people over.”</span> <span id="s457">And what happened is voke -- going to -- to school in Austria, I got this Austrian outfit, with my big, black braid, with the Austrian hair, you know, with the feather.</span> <span id="s458">And I spoke already the dialect in Austria pretty good.</span> <span id="s459">So they said, “We need you.”</span> <span id="s460">I said, “Why do you need me?”</span> <span id="s461">They came to the office of the Itterdude.</span> <span id="s462">They said, “We need -- we smuggle people, we’re going to be straight with you.</span> <span id="s463">We smuggle people through the Innsbruck border,” they say, “into the Italian, into the middle of the mountain, and there the Italian take over.”</span> <span id="s464">I said, “I’m ready, I’m going.”</span> <span id="s465">So I -- and it was vacation time, and I come in, and they tell me what to do, and I do it.</span> <span id="s466">And what happened also is that the first thing that I went into the Austrian school to learn art, I had a friend of mine do me a false passport.</span> <span id="s467">A Austrian false passport, what nobody had.</span> <span id="s468">So I can do things that nobody else can.</span> <span id="s469">The a -- the essing officer moved with us to Bindermichl.</span> <span id="s470">And you know to have, I mean, a friendship with that -- with the -- you must heard about it -- I know you’re younger than I am, to have a friendship with a -- with an American soldier, you were like a whore, excuse my expression.</span> <span id="s471">But that man was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s472">And I said, “You know, I need a truck.”</span> <span id="s473">He said, “Why do you need a truck?”</span> <span id="s474">I said, “Oh, we want to go to Ebensee skiing,” we want to go there, we want to go there.</span> <span id="s475">He said, “Okay, what else do you need?”</span> <span id="s476">I said that I need some food provision a little bit and so on.</span> <span id="s477">Says, “Okay, we going out next week?”</span> <span id="s478">I said, “Fine, it’s alright with me.”</span> <span id="s479">So he gave me the truck, and we took the people to Zanenfeld.</span> <span id="s480">That’s near Innsbruck, and there was nothing, there was just some hou -- fenced in, like I remember a fenced in place.</span> <span id="s481">I had the picture of it, a trumpet.</span> <span id="s482">I don’t know where I put it, it disappeared.</span> <span id="s483">And we would call in, and we would -- we took a little package, each one took a little package with them.</span> <span id="s484">We went through that little -- what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Little pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Little pat into the mountain.</span> <span id="s487">We took them up the mountain, we went one by one.</span> <span id="s488">And then we would leave them there, the Italians would take over, and the two people that took them would come back to the camp, and come to Zanenfeld.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: How dangerous was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Very dangerous, because first place, I was on a false passport.</span> <span id="s491">Second place, I am caughting smuggling people over the border.</span> <span id="s492">Now that was over the Italian border, you understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s493">They didn’t know what I was smuggling there.</span> <span id="s494">I could say I’m smuggling to it -- Italy, you know.</span> <span id="s495">And -- but it was dangerous, it was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s496">And then one time was shooting off [indecipherable] it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s497">My father didn’t want me to do it, and I said, “You can’t tell me what to do, I do what I want to do.”</span> <span id="s498">And I already met my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: How about Cornelius?</span> <span id="s500">Did he want to -- you to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: That -- I -- he wasn’t that time with me that -- that close, we just knew each other.</span> <span id="s502">He invited me to go to a concert, and I wanted to go dancing, and I was invited from the American head of the camp to go dancing in the club, in the camp club.</span> <span id="s503">And I [indecipherable] said, “That man is crazy.</span> <span id="s504">I should go to a concert when I can’t go dancing?”</span> <span id="s505">He said, “A little culture won’t help you -- won’t hurt you.”</span> <span id="s506">But I didn’t go with him, but every other day he was waiting near the office, the Itterdude for me.</span> <span id="s507">And I finally start going out with him.</span> <span id="s508">In the beginning I was mad, it’s a long story, because I thought he went out with somebody else, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: What did you like about -- what did you like about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: What I liked about him, you see, I never went out with anybody that didn’t have a education.</span> <span id="s511">I never went out with anybody that had dirty nails, or dusty shoes.</span> <span id="s512">Never.</span> <span id="s513">That was my -- I don’t know why, don’t ask me.</span> <span id="s514">I don’t know -- I don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s515">And I liked him, I wasn’t in love with him yet, but I liked him.</span> <span id="s516">And I -- and he brought me beautiful things he bought from the Joint, and there was a lot of beautiful clothes, you know.</span> <span id="s517">And I didn’t really need it, because I went out with a guy -- now this is I wa -- I was already 16.</span> <span id="s518">I went out with a guy that was from the Prague University, and he was the head of the police in the camp, and lived out of the -- outside of the camp.</span> <span id="s519">And he thought I was going to marry him.</span> <span id="s520">And that -- one day he got very sick.</span> <span id="s521">I had a fi -- I fou -- another thing is, it’s very interesting, this is old camp, and this is old displaced camp.</span> <span id="s522">I made friends with the CIC from England, a woman, and she was very in love with that guy Tommy, that man that I am telling you about.</span> <span id="s523">And she went home one day and she brought me a poodle, and for herself a big boxer.</span> <span id="s524">And the boxer in the compartment, in the plane, bit a piece of the poodle’s foot.</span> <span id="s525">So Dr. Dimitri, the doctor, fixed the f -- the -- the -- the poodle’s foot.</span> <span id="s526">And I left him with Tommy, of course in Tommy’s house, and I called him Tommy, because Tommy had some stomach trouble.</span> <span id="s527">He was a Jew from the University of Prague, and I called him Tommy.</span> <span id="s528">So I left him, and one day, one evening I went home, and I came home the next morning, and I want to go into his apartment, and his valet doesn’t let me in.</span> <span id="s529">And I said, “Why, what’s going on?</span> <span id="s530">I have to go in, I forgot something.”</span> <span id="s531">Anyway, I had a lit -- bitty little fight with him, I went into the room, and my girls from the redhaired was sti -- the two dogs were lying next to the bed, and my girlfriend’s from the CIC, re -- the redhead was sticking out of the bed.</span> <span id="s532">He starts running after me, and -- and begging me, and everything, and I said, “No, no, no, no, I don’t want anything to do with you.”</span> <span id="s533">Anyway, I come to my father.</span> <span id="s534">He said, “Do you sleep with him?”</span> <span id="s535">My father was very outspoken with me.</span> <span id="s536">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s537">He said, “You know, a man needs it, and they need to get it somewhere.</span> <span id="s538">So he has your girlfriend handy, so he did it.</span> <span id="s539">I don’t like Tommy, I don’t want him to go out with you.”</span> <span id="s540">I said, “You have nothing to say, Papa.”</span> <span id="s541">I said, “I do what I want, but I don’t want to go back with him, I don’t want anything to do with him.”</span> <span id="s542">So one day I was out with the shleeoch dancing, and I get again a call.</span> <span id="s543">Tommy is very sick, he won’t take any medicine, nothing.</span> <span id="s544">This was already Bindermichl.</span> <span id="s545">He won’t take any medicine, nothing, till you come to see him.</span> <span id="s546">So I said to him, “Chaim, would you go with me?”</span> <span id="s547">He said, “Yes, to save a person’s life.”</span> <span id="s548">So I went with him, and he took the medicine, and he got better, and I had to promise him, I said, “Look, my father doesn’t like me,” right away I used my father.</span> <span id="s549">I don’t even live with him, “doesn’t want -- like you, doesn’t want me to marry m -- y -- me.</span> <span id="s550">Why don’t you go to Italy with the transport, and I’ll meet you there afterwards?”</span> <span id="s551">In the meanwhile, it’s a long story, I met Cornelius.</span> <span id="s552">I thought I fall in love with him, and I thought to myself -- and he asked me to marry him.</span> <span id="s553">And he said, “It would be a good time.</span> <span id="s554">My two friends, my best two friends are coming back from Italy,” they left to go to buna -- San Paolo, or Buenos Aires, I don’t know where it was.</span> <span id="s555">“They’re coming back, could we get married?”</span> <span id="s556">And we got ma -- we were get -- we got married, and Barbie, she should [indecipherable] went back to Italy, and accidentally they met Tommy.</span> <span id="s557">And Tommy said, “Oh, you come from Bindermichl, my fiancée is coming.”</span> <span id="s558">And he took out that picture, and this woman didn’t mean that it was that it was that serious.</span> <span id="s559">So she says -- Barbie, she says, “I’m sorry, your fiancée just married our best friend.”</span> <span id="s560">But before that I went with the opera singer from Romania.</span> <span id="s561">I went with the guy that went -- also from Romania, that went with the King sisters.</span> <span id="s562">And one woman was very jealous, and she said to my father, “How can you let her go out so much, with so many men?”</span> <span id="s563">He said, “It’s better too many men than just one.</span> <span id="s564">So I’m sure nothing will happen.”</span> <span id="s565">And my father didn’t have anything to say about who I’ll go out or what I do anyway.</span> <span id="s566">But he liked Cornelius, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s567">And I said, “You know, Papa, he is half Jewish, he is not even Jewish.”</span> <span id="s568">He says, “You will make something, I know you, you’ll make him Jewish.</span> <span id="s569">Don’t -- I’m not worried about it.”</span> <span id="s570">And he gave him -- I’ll never forget -- my husband hates fish.</span> <span id="s571">And he gave him, he said, “Would you like a drink with a piece of herring?”</span> <span id="s572">Of course, Cornelius was a gentleman.</span> <span id="s573">You know, he was so debonair, I think that what impressed me, he wore that hat with the pipe, you know, he was very well dressed, I’ll show you pictures.</span> <span id="s574">And that what impressed me so much about him.</span> <span id="s575">And I brought him uppa -- and we were in the room eating, and the father gives him a piece of herring, was a gentleman, he start eating that herring, and he chewed and he chewed, and he chewed.</span> <span id="s576">And I said, “Papa, go out and help Rocholla in the kitchen.”</span> <span id="s577">And we were on the second floor, and I said, “Cornelius, spit it out right away,” you know.</span> <span id="s578">And then when I speak German, because the only language that we can communicate, and what Cornelius did a lot for me, is that he helped me go to school, and then in Windham, there were the big bed, and then I was e -- and we were married already, and a friend of ours was lying on the other side, and we were -- I was doing my homework.</span> <span id="s579">I was also at the theater in Austria, and the -- in the kammershpeeler.</span> <span id="s580">But Cornelius made my father, and he made me quit it, because they saw -- there was a play -- I -- I don’t have very perfect legs, so I always had to wear long clothes.</span> <span id="s581">So I played the maid in the kammershpeel -- you know how beautiful the kammershpeeler varm, with the chandelier, and everything.</span> <span id="s582">I played a maid the harem house.</span> <span id="s583">How do you say it?</span> <span id="s584">It was a -- a film made, and also a movie, segments of it in English.</span> <span id="s585">The harem house, you know, with the maid, where the father says tyrin down, do everything, this and this and that, and he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: The head of the house, I forgot what the thing was.</span> <span id="s588">And I played that in the kammershpeeler.</span> <span id="s589">Then Cornelius saw the leading lady walking around in a bra, from one room to the other.</span> <span id="s590">And he said to my father, he said, “Berrik, do you like that?”</span> <span id="s591">My father said, “No, but I have no control over her, maybe you can do something.”</span> <span id="s592">So they did something, and that was the end of my theater career -- career.</span> <span id="s593">Anyway, what I want to tell you, I went to art school, and I learned how to -- to design clothes.</span> <span id="s594">What can you do in that little time?</span> <span id="s595">But I had it in me from my father, that’s one thing you -- he was one of the best tailors.</span> <span id="s596">And my dress won first prize, and I’ll never forget it.</span> <span id="s597">It was a royal blue dress that I designed.</span> <span id="s598">Was with the high neck, royal blue like a crepe suz -- a crepe material that’s silk.</span> <span id="s599">And it had a big Japanese pocket I put on it.</span> <span id="s600">I must have seen it somewhere or something.</span> <span id="s601">And then the belt went in, right into the pocket, and it tied.</span> <span id="s602">And then I put on the model big, red jewelry on the royal blue, with big, red earring, and beautiful black marble.</span> <span id="s603">It won first prize.</span> <span id="s604">So that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Wha --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: And when I got married -- yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Wh-what yar -- what year are we roughly now?</span> <span id="s608">Is that 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: We’re roughly on the end of 1946, as I was going already, with Cornelius.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Actually, I -- I have a few follow up questions now, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Okay, let’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: -- we should -- I should [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: -- can we -- can I go to the bathroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Yes, I just want to say my little thing.</span> <span id="s615">This is the end of tape one, side B, interview with Marsha Loen.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: -- interview with Marsha Loen.</span> <span id="s618">This is tape number two, side A. Marsha, I have about three questions now that I just kind of toss out before you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s620">Just go ahead, Regina.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Question number one, it was not difficult for you to live in Austria, and speak the German language, when you had been actually in the German concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Absolutely not, and I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s623">Can I tell you why?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Please, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: I’m even driving a German car, because you cannot go on hating all your life, you only hurt yourself.</span> <span id="s626">And that is what I learned here in school, when I took a couple of semesters from psychology, after I finished high school, and junior -- college.</span> <span id="s627">Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: But when you’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: -- I me -- I don’t say I’m in love with the people that -- that -- the offspring that the people that did it to me, but I cannot also hate, because I’m only going to hurt myself.</span> <span id="s630">And language is a culture, and the German is a very good car, because I get a very good trade-in on it.</span> <span id="s631">So that’s the answer for you, Regina.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: But even at that time, when everything was still so close.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: It bothered me to a certain extent that I don’t feel nothing.</span> <span id="s634">It did bother me, but I didn’t feel anything about it.</span> <span id="s635">I’m sorry to say that, maybe it’s wrong.</span> <span id="s636">But, you know, to hate is to hurt yourself, and that I’ve learned from the beginning as I was liberated, with the Russians, with everything else.</span> <span id="s637">If you hate, you only hurt yourself.</span> <span id="s638">Without even going to school, I knew about it.</span> <span id="s639">I felt about it, let’s say, this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: The other question I had was, did you ever meet a vakovna actually at that time?</span> <span id="s641">A: No.</span> <span id="s642">Not till after eight years, or seven years I was in this country.</span> <span id="s643">I didn’t even know survivor exist for about seven years in this country.</span> <span id="s644">That is another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Well that we shall definitely talk about that a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Oh yeah, they we’ll finish this soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s648">And -- and the last question is though, was it important for you to some degree that Cornelius was also a survivor?</span> <span id="s649">Did you talk about where you came from, or was that not that --</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Shall I tell you something?</span> <span id="s651">First place, Cornelius was a different survivor that I was.</span> <span id="s652">He had a Christian mother that was a Righteous Christian that impressed me tremendously.</span> <span id="s653">She saved 32 Jews.</span> <span id="s654">In fact, she has right now a tree in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s655">And she’s in one of our guides in the museum as a Righteous Christian, in the same guide that Schindler is, and Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s656">Second place, he was a gentleman.</span> <span id="s657">Third place, he came from Yugoslavia, where the lot of his family was killed, too, in Novosad.</span> <span id="s658">And third place, he was a good looking man, he was well dressed, and he was clean.</span> <span id="s659">And that was the most important thing to me.</span> <span id="s660">I don’t care if he would have been -- I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s661">And the language that we spoke and could understand each other was only German, because he doesn’t speak Yiddish -- Jewish.</span> <span id="s662">I didn’t speak Hungarian, or Yugoslavian, or any other language, or English.</span> <span id="s663">He spoke 12 languages, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s664">I wasn’t that bright.</span> <span id="s665">I was bright, but not that bright.</span> <span id="s666">So, it didn’t bother me at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: So what were -- what were your plans eventually, then?</span> <span id="s668">You did not intend to stay in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Definitely not.</span> <span id="s670">Before I met Cornelius, I was the biggest Zionist that ever existed.</span> <span id="s671">Smuggling the people over the border to Palestine.</span> <span id="s672">In fact, Ben-Gurion’s what was his name, Shorette was at my wedding, and I was crying, because I had to go to America, because Cornelius’ family was here.</span> <span id="s673">And he said, “Marsha, we need people like you in America, too.</span> <span id="s674">Don’t cry.”</span> <span id="s675">So it was a sadness to a certain extent, a sadness in me that I couldn’t go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s676">But another thing I went to a country that I thought I would never got -- get to.</span> <span id="s677">You understand what I -- in a way it was selfish, but I was happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: We’ll talk a little bit more about that when we -- when we get there.</span> <span id="s679">So how did you get there, actually?</span> <span id="s680">What -- what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: What happened?</span> <span id="s682">How did I get to America?</span> <span id="s683">Q: To America, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s685">I married Cornelius, Cornelius had a brother here that came in 1939 for the World Fair, on his honeymoon.</span> <span id="s686">Lost all our money.</span> <span id="s687">In fact, when I married Cornelius he was very rich, because I also went for rich people, because I didn’t want to have no food again.</span> <span id="s688">And then we got a letter that in 1947, when we got married, his mother and father were supposed to go through Vienna.</span> <span id="s689">And I had a false passport, and he had a passport, and we were supposed to meet them in Vienna, and then the thing was changed, and they went through Prague, they went by plane.</span> <span id="s690">They shipped a lot of antiques, that my father-in-law was going to open an antique shop.</span> <span id="s691">I don’t want to go into a big story about it, everything was stolen, and we couldn’t rip -- we were making 30 dollars a week, and paid a private detective all over.</span> <span id="s692">Nothing was found except a couple of paintings that were between the bedding that came in those empty cases.</span> <span id="s693">So this is the first time I lost money, and I didn’t feel sorry for me.</span> <span id="s694">I felt sorry for my mother-in-law, and father-in-law that had an estate with maids and chauffer, and two cars in Europe, you know what it means.</span> <span id="s695">A Fiat, and a Chevrolet for the boys.</span> <span id="s696">And ift -- went to San Marco when David -- when Connor was three years old, and all over Switzerland, and Cornelius went to -- to college in Budapest, and to Switzerland, and -- very, very rich people.</span> <span id="s697">And she had to come and start crocheting, and start work.</span> <span id="s698">I felt rather sorry for them than for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: So how did you -- how did you get over then, by boat?</span> <span id="s700">A: So we came, and we went from Bindermichl, we went to Bremerhaven, and there’s decided there is a boat going through New Orleans, if you -- and it would take 14 days rather than more.</span> <span id="s701">And we went on that boat.</span> <span id="s702">Then that was after -- we were married in ’47, that was in August 1949.</span> <span id="s703">And we went on the boat, and being that Cornelius spoke so many languages, he was invited as a interpreter to speak over the tape recorder, and we came on the boat early.</span> <span id="s704">Came in on the boat early, I was made shtudmarder -- the head of that old woman, barra -- because the women and the men slept separate.</span> <span id="s705">And I met the two Ire officers.</span> <span id="s706">And like I said, I was pretty good looking, had a good sense of humor, knew how to dance, I won a couple of contested.</span> <span id="s707">And that rock and roll in Austria.</span> <span id="s708">Not with Cornelius, he’s a lousy dancer, with his friend.</span> <span id="s709">And being in the theater, you know, and everything.</span> <span id="s710">And I made very good friends with the Ire officer.</span> <span id="s711">And I got very sick going through the channel, very sick.</span> <span id="s712">And, you know, being that Cornelius was with the Joint, and part director of the Joint Distribution Committee, I got an apartment in the displaced camp that they had a telephone.</span> <span id="s713">And through that I met a lot of black marketeers.</span> <span id="s714">Ve -- he never did it, because he was afraid, God forbid, he couldn’t go to America.</span> <span id="s715">So even when he lost all his money, he wrote a letter to his sister-in-law, did my tuxedo arrive?</span> <span id="s716">She s -- she wrote him back, “Cornelius, with all the money that you have now, you don’t need a tuxedo.”</span> <span id="s717">The first thing didn’t bother him, the money, or the diamonds, or everything else, it bothered him is the tuxedo.</span> <span id="s718">So what happened is is that when we lived there, and we had that telephone, a lot of black marketeers would come over and make telephone calls, and everything else.</span> <span id="s719">And they went to England, and they brought me beautiful clothes, you know, as [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s720">But I had a maid from Dabotchka, Maria, I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s721">And they would come in, and if I wasn’t at home, and they would go into the kitchen in the displaced camp, I had a beautiful apartment -- Wiesenthal, from the -- from the Museum of Tolerance, lived above me.</span> <span id="s722">I gave him a party line, and I gave him a maid.</span> <span id="s723">And I wouldn’t have anything to do with that man if he said boo.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: How come?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Because he’s the biggest phony in the world.</span> <span id="s726">I’m sorry to say that on tape.</span> <span id="s727">Anyway -- and if you want to cut it out, you’re welcome to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: No, actually, I would like to ask you more about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Anyway, and the thing is is that that will come later, with the museum.</span> <span id="s730">And the thing is is that I had a telephone, I had all those clothes, we were on the boat, and I didn’t know where Connor is, Cornelius didn’t know where I -- all of a sudden I didn’t know if I was in love with him, if I was not in love with him.</span> <span id="s731">And I start throwing up.</span> <span id="s732">And that Ire officer was already a little bit in love with me, I had a feeling.</span> <span id="s733">So he came down to the thing, and he picked me up -- at that time I was only a size seven.</span> <span id="s734">I wasn’t what I was right n -- he picked me up, in that pink robe [indecipherable] and he gave me his cabin, and he went to live with the other Ire officer.</span> <span id="s735">And my husband, when I saw him on the deck, I got -- I got well after I saw him.</span> <span id="s736">And my husband stayed with me in that -- in that cabin, and everybody, all of those survivors that were on that boat, thought that I had an affair with the tyrit officer.</span> <span id="s737">At my age, just married, you know, and everything else.</span> <span id="s738">But I let them talk.</span> <span id="s739">And my husband was with me, and we had that cabin over, and we were 14 days on the sea.</span> <span id="s740">And I got better, and I went out to mingle with the people, and I arranged a dance on the boat.</span> <span id="s741">And, you know, 14 days over the Mississippi, in order to go to New Orleans, was a long time.</span> <span id="s742">And varabul Connor start feeling better, I start feeling better.</span> <span id="s743">I had nice clothes, and I had that friend, that Ire officer.</span> <span id="s744">In fact, he came to Los Angeles one time, when I was very unhappy, because he left me a PO box, in case I’m not happy, to send him a letter.</span> <span id="s745">And I was unhappy because in the beginning we lived with our in-laws, and so on.</span> <span id="s746">So I was a little unhappy, till I got that letter, and he came over, and he said, “All you do, move out or I take Marsha with me.”</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: So you had a protector there.</span> <span id="s748">A friend, friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yeah, t -- I had a protector, and a friend.</span> <span id="s750">And he -- he di -- he was in love with me, maybe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s751">But I did not have an affair with him.</span> <span id="s752">I’m telling you, on tape, or on the tape, or off a tape.</span> <span id="s753">But everybody thought I did.</span> <span id="s754">And we went 14 days [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s755">And we arrived to New Orleans, and of course, if we arrived in New Orleans -- Cornelius was still the gentleman, and he still knew a little more like all displaced people, because he was -- and he beat the champion in Ping Pong.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: On the boat, or in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: No, in New Orleans.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: In New Orleans.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: In New Orleans.</span> <span id="s760">We were in the Jewish -- the Jewish geminda vizakmindas in -- in -- in -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Nay -- neighborhood [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: No, the gemine, the Jewish farbaltung.</span> <span id="s763">The -- the Jews that took care of the people.</span> <span id="s764">We were the first boat to arrive in New Orleans.</span> <span id="s765">I was so stupid, I took my pearls, and rings, and things, and I was afraid to take it with me at the displaced camp, send it with -- somebody smuggled -- brought it to my -- to my mother-in-law before 1947, before they left, and -- and theirs were -- everything was stolen, including my things.</span> <span id="s766">When I came into New Orleans, they didn’t even look at it, they were so happy to see us, the first boat, you know.</span> <span id="s767">And we were staying with all the Jews, it was like a temple, you know, like the Jewish Federation here.</span> <span id="s768">You know, there was arranged a -- a big room with food, and the bananas and everything.</span> <span id="s769">Because on the boat all I got -- I was invited once to the captain’s table, and they ask me what would I like.</span> <span id="s770">I said, “I would like a piece of black bread.</span> <span id="s771">I can’t stand that cotton any more.”</span> <span id="s772">And then they gave me a bowl of cottage cheese and fruit, and I said, “Would you do me a favor, would you separate the fruit and the cottage cheese?”</span> <span id="s773">You know, with me there was no nothing, captain or no captain, if I had to say something, I said it.</span> <span id="s774">And I start helping the people on the boat.</span> <span id="s775">You know, there was a little boy -- she died, and he’s sick, and now he’s a very famous pharmacist, and he’s very well to -- I haven’t seen him for maybe 20 years.</span> <span id="s776">His name was Leon Lolinka was his name, and he -- his father was from my town, and I knew his mother.</span> <span id="s777">And I brought food for him, I had food brought for him, and juices that was brought to my cabin and everything.</span> <span id="s778">And we arrived in New Orleans like I said, and we were in that geminda.</span> <span id="s779">My husband right away played Ping Pong, you know, his life, cause that what they did also in the displaced camp with his cousin, played chess, played Ping Pong.</span> <span id="s780">He beat the champion, and a Jewish woman that was -- owned a couple of apartment houses, was very impressed with us, the way we were dressed, than the other people, and my husband beating the champion and every -- she invited .</span> <span id="s781">us for dinner, and as we were walking, I had my camera, and I stopped, and I wanted to take a picture of a little black girl in a yellow dress.</span> <span id="s782">She was the most gorgeous, beautiful African-American I’ve ever -- African-Americ -- at that time we called them black -- African-American girl I’ve ever seen, and she came to me, and she said, “We don’t do those things here.”</span> <span id="s783">I said, “I just finished being in a concentration camp, in a displaced camp, in a Russian camp, and you’re coming to tell me that I cannot take a picture of that woman because she has a different color skin?</span> <span id="s784">Forget your dinner, I’m not coming, invite somebody else.”</span> <span id="s785">And I walked away from her.</span> <span id="s786">And that rich woman, that I could have had a lot out of her, believe me, but I didn’t want anything to do with her.</span> <span id="s787">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s788">She apologized, and she said, “This is the rules,” you know, “and I’m Jewish too.”</span> <span id="s789">You know, and I said, “No, to me you are not Jewish, because if you would have been Jewish you would have done something about me, and about my two little sisters, and you wouldn’t let me -- tell me that I can’t take a picture of that woman.</span> <span id="s790">It was the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Was anybody interested where you were coming from, so to speak, in --</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Oh, in New Orleans they were -- not that interested, they were just trying to be nice to us.</span> <span id="s793">Interested nobody was.</span> <span id="s794">Nobody wanted to hear the sad stories, and at that time I really wasn’t read to tell them yet, to tell you the honest truth, as I arrived.</span> <span id="s795">And the -- like I said, we arrived, and I to -- my mother lived in a -- mother-in-law lived in a big house, she was living in a shack.</span> <span id="s796">It was a better neighborhood than Bull Heights, and she was working already.</span> <span id="s797">And, you know, there was no money.</span> <span id="s798">My brother-in-law was broke.</span> <span id="s799">My father-in-law send him money for the boys, and when everybody went into airplanes, he we -- he went into lawnmowers.</span> <span id="s800">They didn’t take him in the army because he had something with his eyes, and he lost that money, and his money, and his wife’s money, and everybody else, and we were completely broke.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: And that was already in Los Angeles, or that was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: In Los Angel -- everything that -- no, in New Orleans we were there a couple of days, and then we took a train direct to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s803">And the 70 dollars that he laid out for us, I paid him back, because I didn’t want nothing from nobody.</span> <span id="s804">And we live with my mother-in-law and father-in-law like I said, and they -- Connor was the youngest one, and I start working in a factory.</span> <span id="s805">We had to live, we had to eat.</span> <span id="s806">I start work in a factory, and what happened is is the foreman wan -- was on vacation -- like I say, I was very handy going -- working already on clothes, and everything.</span> <span id="s807">And the man that owned the place, his name was Rubin, I will also never forget, he came and he said to me, “Why don’t you give out the work?</span> <span id="s808">Why don’t you act as the foreman?”</span> <span id="s809">Worked there couple of days, and every night I came home I was throwing up, and Connor couldn’t get a job.</span> <span id="s810">So we went to the Jewish Federation, that I work now for, at that time, because we came with the affidavit, so we got nothing from HIAS, nothing from nobody.</span> <span id="s811">So we had to do it -- everything ourself.</span> <span id="s812">So we went there, and they gave him a job as a -- a watchman in a motel -- the [indecipherable] the motel is still standing.</span> <span id="s813">That man didn’t ever know what a gun means, or anything at all the gun.</span> <span id="s814">And then my father-in-law would bring the papers and read it for me, because I wasn’t that good in English that time, how many people were killed in motels, with guns, with that.</span> <span id="s815">And then I didn’t want to tell him that I’m sick, so I would throw up at night, because I couldn’t take the sweat, the smell of the factory.</span> <span id="s816">Not that I was a snob, I just couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s817">And then Cornelius got another job with a friend, in -- with German lenses, through his brother.</span> <span id="s818">Not very much paid, and I -- my mother-in-law got me a job with a designer, Suzy.</span> <span id="s819">Suzy with a designer, designed sweaters, and skirts with felt appliquéds, it was very much in fashion.</span> <span id="s820">Sold it to Saks, and everything -- and we had a store on the strip.</span> <span id="s821">And where we lived is, we lived near the strip.</span> <span id="s822">It was between the strip and Santa Monica, and at that time the strip was the place.</span> <span id="s823">There was the -- the mola -- th-the LaRue, there was the Mocambo, Ciro, everything was there.</span> <span id="s824">And that was the place there, a main shop, and the factory downstairs, and I worked there.</span> <span id="s825">She was very good to me, very good to me, because I caught on just like that, one, two, three.</span> <span id="s826">And she would come down, and she would say, “What do you think, what should we design?”</span> <span id="s827">And she lived above, in the better area, over Sunset, at that time, on Clark Street.</span> <span id="s828">It -- it’s sounded center now, where the Billage Hotel is, but it was at Clark Street at that time.</span> <span id="s829">And we moved out from my mother-in-law’s, and everything they spend on us, we wrote it down, and the minute we made 200 dollars, we paid them all back.</span> <span id="s830">But what we did is -- my teeth were all broken from the calcium I didn’t have, and they worked on it in Austria, and they ruined it even more.</span> <span id="s831">So I went into a dentist that was down the street, on Santa Monica and Clark Street, someone sent me.</span> <span id="s832">There was a Thrifty drugstore, and his office was upstairs.</span> <span id="s833">And I made very good fr -- I made very easy friend, I made very good friends with him.</span> <span id="s834">He start working on me, gave me a good price.</span> <span id="s835">I didn’t want it for nothing, and I paid him off slowly.</span> <span id="s836">And we got to be the best of friend.</span> <span id="s837">This were our first friend in America, the Vestliss.</span> <span id="s838">And what happened is is my father-in-law went in the basement in the May Company right there, and bought me a black dress, we were going out, so what I did is, I had a colorful scarf -- because the clothes that I brought from Europe, I couldn’t wear, with those big pads.</span> <span id="s839">Connor’s shoes were squeak -- squeaking, you know.</span> <span id="s840">It was complete different life, a complete different scene.</span> <span id="s841">And these were people that already had catalogs, and -- and -- and live -- lived in Beverly Wood, in Beverly Hills, in the valley, and so on.</span> <span id="s842">And eve -- they got to be very good friends of mine.</span> <span id="s843">And I was working at Suzy’s, and Suzy went to Paris.</span> <span id="s844">And her husband, that was a very good looking man went after me, and I had to quit.</span> <span id="s845">And I didn’t worry, because I had a job waiting for me at Sidney’s.</span> <span id="s846">And Sidney on LaSeneca was also one of the most exclusive -- and all I needed, clothes.</span> <span id="s847">Now, when I was at Suzy’s, I went -- I met Marlena Dietrich, I met all the movie stars.</span> <span id="s848">Marlena Dietrich, I called her a whore, because she -- I didn’t -- wasn’t afraid of her, because she didn’t pay her bills anyways [indecipherable] I -- I -- I said -- I didn’t know what’s the different is in English between Madame and Madame at that time.</span> <span id="s849">So Suzy was downstairs, and she said, “I would like Suzy to fit me.”</span> <span id="s850">I was upstairs.</span> <span id="s851">I said, “Suzy, the Madame is here.”</span> <span id="s852">She said, “In America we say Madame.”</span> <span id="s853">Say -- and I knew that she understood German, and Suzy was from Austria, her father was a Austrian actor, so I, “Suzy, the hura is here.”</span> <span id="s854">The whore is here, in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: My God.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: And, you know, I wasn’t afraid of the devil, you know.</span> <span id="s857">But Suzy, they -- in fact, I had a [indecipherable] too, because the -- she had a publicity lady there at that time, she paid 200 dollars a month, was a lot of money in the 1950 -- 19 fift -- 1949 - 1950.</span> <span id="s858">And she said, you know -- the publicity lady came in, she took some picture and everything else, and she put in a magazine me and Suzy, and cutting out a poodle.</span> <span id="s859">And Suzy had a poodle named Lulu.</span> <span id="s860">It said, “Suzy and partner working on a Lulu creation.”</span> <span id="s861">Do you know that woman didn’t come in for two weeks i -- to the st -- to the -- to the factory?</span> <span id="s862">I had to run the factory, because she did not like it that I was with her in the magazine, the public -- but it wasn’t my fault, in fact, that actress, Barbara Britten was modeling for us at that magazine at that time.</span> <span id="s863">It wasn’t my fault, I didn’t even want to sit there.</span> <span id="s864">Who cared if I’m in a magazine or not?</span> <span id="s865">All I was worrying, where is the next bread coming from?</span> <span id="s866">Where am I going to pay the detective to look for our stuff, and so on, you know.</span> <span id="s867">But at night -- she didn’t live very far, and she would have an idea, she was very creative.</span> <span id="s868">She would have an idea -- in fact, she was engaged to Groucho Marx at one time.</span> <span id="s869">And she would have an idea, and she would say -- she married that guy, Larry.</span> <span id="s870">Why don’t you come over, Pasternak is here with his wife around the pool and everything, and we can work on the -- on the creation, I have something in my -- so we would work for hours.</span> <span id="s871">She never paid me overtime, but she always was very good to me, and she bought me certain things that I didn’t have, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: But I forgot to tell you, when we moved into that little apartment, over the garage, a rent control apartment, Al and Juliet West, who went and signed for me at Sears and Roebuck, so we get it on payments, and we bought our bedroom -- we Lysoled it, and we painted it.</span> <span id="s874">And at that time, it was not modern, wooden floors, but it was wooden floors, we shined it.</span> <span id="s875">And we had red couches with pink troracks.</span> <span id="s876">And we didn’t have a dining, we just had a dining area.</span> <span id="s877">And all my friends that lived in Beverly Hills, and everywhere else, they liked to come to -- to my house to eat, because I learned how to cook from my mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s878">She wa -- she went to Budapest to study cooking business, to teach the cooks how to cook.</span> <span id="s879">So I got to be a very good cook, so everybody liked to come to my house.</span> <span id="s880">I met a lot of interesting people, very interesting people, because I met the Essex, they should rest in peace, they were all older than I was.</span> <span id="s881">He was writing the Mickey Spillane movies.</span> <span id="s882">I met other people, doctors -- in fact, he had a -- this was the funniest thing because I wasn’t used to it.</span> <span id="s883">At one time we lived in Beverly Wood at that time, on Sawyer Street, was a very -- it’s still a very expensive street.</span> <span id="s884">And he gave a Halloween party, and I went as Auntie Mame, and he went as my follower.</span> <span id="s885">And I -- I took a bracelet, and I had jewelry, and I made myself a very fancy thing, with my hair up, you know.</span> <span id="s886">And I come into his house, and on the drapes were hanging a big -- I hate to say it on the cam -- on tape -- a big skeleton with a wiener hanging out.</span> <span id="s887">But they all came in diapers.</span> <span id="s888">The doctors, the lawyers, those intelligent peop -- they came in diapers.</span> <span id="s889">One came as Adam and Eve, with fig leafs.</span> <span id="s890">And here I was worried, you know, this going on.</span> <span id="s891">And then I had another problem with them, because a lot of those intellectuals were on the pink side.</span> <span id="s892">Not red, but on the pink side, because their background was their parents run away from the Bolsheviks.</span> <span id="s893">You know, from the czar, Bolshevik, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s894">So one time they took me to a theater, and we saw a show, and it was a union tee -- I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s895">And somebody was talking against America.</span> <span id="s896">And I s -- got up and said, “What?”</span> <span id="s897">And I start walking out the theater.</span> <span id="s898">And four of them went after me, my friends, that is -- nothing should happen to me, that the people shouldn’t kill me.</span> <span id="s899">They didn’t tell me where they were taking me.</span> <span id="s900">But I had a wonderful time, they are still wonderful people, they’re very old, very old, but wonderful people.</span> <span id="s901">And Juliet and Al, Elizabeth and Rolfe are my very closest friend.</span> <span id="s902">Elizabeth and Rolfe, they had a big drugstore on the corner of Fairfax, a old drugstore.</span> <span id="s903">And Juliet and Al, Juliet -- when I had my baby, David, I wasn’t allowed to have children, because in the concentration camp, you must have heard on the tape, they did something to me by looking for gold.</span> <span id="s904">And I tricked my husband into having David.</span> <span id="s905">When I had David, and I couldn’t afford, and I couldn’t get a nurse, it was my first house, I had a little small house in the valley, where I opened already my own business, that Al -- with the help from Al, that wrote me a blank check, if I need money, that he got back every penny, plus.</span> <span id="s906">And eliz -- help with Elizabeth and Rolfe.</span> <span id="s907">All American friends, I didn’t know that -- that -- that survivors exist, only that person that I came on the boat, I told you, with the little boy.</span> <span id="s908">I came to visit him in Bull Heights.</span> <span id="s909">Cornelius bought a -- a old car, and we drove there every two weeks to visit him, he never told me survivor existed, because he thought they weren’t good enough for Cornelius.</span> <span id="s910">That was so stupid.</span> <span id="s911">Anyway, so what happened is is I did this -- where was I?</span> <span id="s912">In the middle of telling you the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: You talked about David [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: About David.</span> <span id="s915">When David was born, she gave me a maid, Myrtle, that brought up her children, for months.</span> <span id="s916">For months, because I had the studio already, that I didn’t tell you, in Sherman Oaks, to work for me.</span> <span id="s917">This is what kind of a friends she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Maybe this is a good time to --</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Rest?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: -- to stop this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: This is the end of tape two, side A, interview with Marsha Loen.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marsha Loen.</span> <span id="s925">This is type -- this is tape number two, side B. I would like to ask you a question about your son, David.</span> <span id="s926">First of all, when was he born, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Regina, can I interrupt you?</span> <span id="s928">Why don’t you let me tell you before David, when I went to school, and I started working on the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Okay, go right ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: And then I’ll tell you how we bought the -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Okay, fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I went to -- I decided -- my husband’s family was very educated, and I decided that I’m not going to let them see that -- like I was born under a stone, somewhere on the beach, especially my brother-in-law that was a philosopher, and very intelligent man, he just died about si -- three months ago, at 85.</span> <span id="s933">And what I did is, Cornelius went with me with the streetcar from Santa Monica to Hollywood, and every night after work, I went to Hollywood High.</span> <span id="s934">And then, without knowing any survivors or anything, somebody told me they are going to build a monument, and they are having a meeting on Vermont.</span> <span id="s935">Holocaust monument.</span> <span id="s936">So I went there, and I s -- the meeting, and all of a sudden, my part of the committee.</span> <span id="s937">So I prayed -- played through them from school that night when they had a meeting, and I helped build that monument -- I mean the -- the museum.</span> <span id="s938">And in 1978, when we opened the museum, I was chairing it, and that why I wanted to interrupt you to tell you, you are -- you also ask me why am I mad at Wiesenthal, and I want to tell you why.</span> <span id="s939">Because before we opened the museum, Mr. Wiesenthal was supposed to speak for us.</span> <span id="s940">I shouldn’t say that on tape, but I have to get it off my chest.</span> <span id="s941">And maybe I’ll get fired for it, but I don’t care.</span> <span id="s942">Before we opened the museum, Mr. Wiesenthal was supposed to speak for us.</span> <span id="s943">Our chair was Mr. Silverman, American Jew, and we had a meeting in his house.</span> <span id="s944">And I don’t -- I forget the name from the old man that came, and said that he got a letter from Wiesenthal that he wants five dollars per head more, like cattle.</span> <span id="s945">And we couldn’t even afford it to open the museum, how can we afford to give him five dollar more to be our -- our speaker at the mu -- at the big dinner, at the opening.</span> <span id="s946">And then the Wiesenthal Center came to us -- that is now the Wiesenthal Center, with the proposition they’ll give us 25,000 dollars for him.</span> <span id="s947">And being that we couldn’t get it more from the federation, because they gave us a lot, we sold Wiesenthal for 25,000 dollars to the Wiesenthal Center.</span> <span id="s948">The Los Angel -- at that time we were the Martyr’s Memorial, and the Holocaust Museum, we just changed our name to the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust because it’s much easier to -- to get to understand it.</span> <span id="s949">And that’s why Wiesenthal for me is absolutely poo, and the reas -- I have been once at the Wiesenthal Center, and that was with a delegation -- this comes later -- with a delegation from -- from Russia, that came to see what we did, and they saw our museum, they saw the Wiesenthal museum.</span> <span id="s950">And let me tell you something, a very famous man from there, that helped build the museum, behind the synagogue in Moscow said that our museum is a Holocaust Museum, theirs is a Disneyland Holocaust.</span> <span id="s951">I’m sorry to say it on tape, but this what it is, and if ever anybody hears it, please forgive me, if you’re interested in the Wiesenthal Center, because it’s strictly too much to do -- I’m so -- corne --</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Cornelius?</span> <span id="s953">We’re hearing a little noise here, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: And Wiesenthal is -- he should live to 120, I have nothing against him, but he made himself a name.</span> <span id="s955">I know him because he lived upstairs, across from us -- leef -- because this was the elite of the DP camp.</span> <span id="s956">And across from us lived a name -- a man by the name of Ignatz.</span> <span id="s957">We called him -- what -- called him, Ignatz?</span> <span id="s958">And he was prosecuting the Hungarian Nazis.</span> <span id="s959">And then Wiesenthal took it all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: That was in Linz, in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: That was in Linz, in Austria, in Bindermichl.</span> <span id="s962">And if he denies it, he’s a liar.</span> <span id="s963">Anyway, let’s go back to -- now, we can go back to David.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Well -- well, let’s talk about David a little later then, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: -- you just began to talk about you work with the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: David was born then, already, so David was born in 1958.</span> <span id="s968">The doctor said I couldn’t have children, because first place our bloods are different, mine and Cornelius, and I was afraid.</span> <span id="s969">They say the first child it’s nothing, but I was afraid.</span> <span id="s970">Also, when -- if you hear my tape in -- in the museum, they took me into a room, and they looked for gold.</span> <span id="s971">And I was very young, and they did something there, so it was very -- the doctor didn’t want -- they didn’t want me -- but I wanted a child, because when my father -- in ’57 they brought my father, that survived Dachau.</span> <span id="s972">I worked so hard for the Gateway of Mental Health hospital in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s973">I and Cornelius were fundraising in the valley.</span> <span id="s974">So they surprised me on a television show.</span> <span id="s975">It was called at that time, “It Could Be You.”</span> <span id="s976">And they told me I was going to have -- announce my fashion show, cause I’m giving for Gateway for mental health.</span> <span id="s977">And they came to pick me up, and then they surprised me with my father.</span> <span id="s978">And what happened is my father came, and he came into the -- to my house, and he says, “Oh, a Jewish girl, a bizdatnitsi, no children.”</span> <span id="s979">And it practically killed me.</span> <span id="s980">So -- and then my mother-in-law and father-in-law was in a very, very bad accident, and the two sons were so good, and they were so terrific, and that day I decided -- and I knew my mother was -- just has to snap a finger, she had a baby.</span> <span id="s981">I remember this as a child, and in ghetto, she wa -- a ba -- baby was born.</span> <span id="s982">She was made before the ghetto, was born in ghetto.</span> <span id="s983">And I said to myself, “I’m going to get pregnant, I’m gong to trick him into it.”</span> <span id="s984">And I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s985">And being that I am a designer, I wore a certain kind of clothes, that he never noticed it till about the third or fourth month, and then I told him.</span> <span id="s986">And I wouldn’t go to a gynecologist, but again, one of my model’s husband’s was a very famous gynecologist.</span> <span id="s987">He also charged me a big amount, because he thought I was so filthy rich, because of my studio, and his wife models for me.</span> <span id="s988">And I went to him, and I was pregnant, and all through the pregnancy we -- we did out garden in our home -- in our new home, and we did -- the front we added landscape, I -- landscaper.</span> <span id="s989">I was bleeding, and I never told the doctor, and I never told -- and David was born prematured.</span> <span id="s990">And I had the dachshund at that time that was sick.</span> <span id="s991">And -- and I had my little house on Bervis in Van Nuys.</span> <span id="s992">And I opened in ’53 ti -- my studio, ameet studio in Sherman Oaks.</span> <span id="s993">And when I opened the studio is my friend the Vestliss’, they helped me, and who went looking with me, Elizabeth, because they had a big drugstore in the valley, and we found that place, and it was -- and I remodeled it in a early American, because I loved the early American, because that for me presented the country that I came, and that gave me a home.</span> <span id="s994">And even in my house, in my first house, I had the early American.</span> <span id="s995">In my little apartment behind the studio, I had the early American with the hooked rug.</span> <span id="s996">And now I go a little more modern.</span> <span id="s997">I got used to America.</span> <span id="s998">Anyway, and what happened is is that I -- I -- I got pregnant, and I worked, and like I said, I brought my father out, and it upset me, and then when my mother-in-law was in the accident, I said when I’m gone there wa -- nobody going to be left, I have to have something.</span> <span id="s999">And I stuck it out, and David was born in the eighth month.</span> <span id="s1000">And he was -- I took him out -- he was about five pounds, because at that time they just build the Encino hospital, and it wasn’t far from my -- from my studio.</span> <span id="s1001">So what happened is is I got -- and it was Monday morning, I got terrible cramps, and I called a friend if she could take me.</span> <span id="s1002">And she took me in, and the doctor said take her in right away, because I had -- delivering another baby.</span> <span id="s1003">And she was sitting in the front room, and doing a -- she told -- I found out later doing a check, balancing your checkbook.</span> <span id="s1004">That was all still Americans, not -- no survivors.</span> <span id="s1005">I didn’t know any survivors.</span> <span id="s1006">And the -- they came out and they said, “Where can we get hold of Mr. Loen?”</span> <span id="s1007">And Cornelius’ office always on the ru -- on the road.</span> <span id="s1008">And th -- she said -- th -- she says, “Why?”</span> <span id="s1009">Said, “Mrs. Loen is being admitted.”</span> <span id="s1010">So I said, “I’m going to have a baby,” and all the checks were flying all over the waiting room.</span> <span id="s1011">My friend, the schultz.</span> <span id="s1012">Anyway, so what happened is David was born, and he was in a incubator.</span> <span id="s1013">And I had one stitch.</span> <span id="s1014">One stitch, because I was pretty flexible.</span> <span id="s1015">And then Fritz was sick, and he was in a -- in Tarzana in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1016">So, I had the people working for me in the studio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Who was Fritz?</span> <span id="s1018">A: Fritz was my little dachshund.</span> <span id="s1019">And -- I took him out from a pound, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s1020">I gave him a home.</span> <span id="s1021">And he was a pedigree.</span> <span id="s1022">And he had -- his b-behind legs was hurt -- was very bad, so I took him to the finest hospitals in Tarzana, very far away.</span> <span id="s1023">So I would go and visit my baby in the incubator, then visit Fritz, and then come back to work in the studio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: I’d like to ask you just two quick questions for clarification.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: It would have been dangerous for you to get a child?</span> <span id="s1027">That was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1029">I -- it told me -- when the doctor was putting me in the hospital -- what was his name, Cornell?</span> <span id="s1030">I forgot, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: That’s alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Oh, it’s -- we were -- we were so close.</span> <span id="s1033">He was putting me in the hospital, he says, “First I’m going to save your life, and then I’m going to save the baby’s.”</span> <span id="s1034">I said, “Robert,” rob -- I said, “Robert, if my baby dies, I kill you.</span> <span id="s1035">I went through eight months, and I’m going to kill you.”</span> <span id="s1036">So you see, because I’ve done so much in the concentration camps, and afterwards, with charity, with raising money, and everything else, said, “God couldn’t do this to me again.”</span> <span id="s1037">And then, the hospital was so small, and I got terrible cramps.</span> <span id="s1038">It was just built, and they brought in -- in the next room a woman from -- from surgery, she said, “Keep quiet.”</span> <span id="s1039">That lady just came out, she said -- I said, “But I’m wet.”</span> <span id="s1040">I didn’t even know that you break water.</span> <span id="s1041">I never read up on it.</span> <span id="s1042">So they found Robert right away, and he brought with him two doctors, two pediatricians, and he was putting in that stitch, and I said, “Robert, are you knitting or purling?”</span> <span id="s1043">Because I design knitted clothes.</span> <span id="s1044">This is already under anesthetic.</span> <span id="s1045">I had a -- he had to give me a spinal because my water broke.</span> <span id="s1046">And then all of a sudden I hear the other doctor, “Is that you, Marsha?”</span> <span id="s1047">It was Dr. Danielson, his wife was one of my clientele.</span> <span id="s1048">So you see, I was surrounded by friends when David was born.</span> <span id="s1049">And I took him out of the incubator, and after six months I had to put him on a skim milk diet, thanks God.</span> <span id="s1050">And he was reading and writing at two and a half years old.</span> <span id="s1051">At three years old, he was -- he knew every president, he knew every composer.</span> <span id="s1052">Now, he was not genius.</span> <span id="s1053">I took him to UCLA.</span> <span id="s1054">My father-in-law was a very, very intelligent man, and David was his life, so he spent a lot of time with David.</span> <span id="s1055">David has -- has a photographic memory, like I do.</span> <span id="s1056">I remember a lot of things as a child, don’t forget, that I went through.</span> <span id="s1057">A lot I forget because I blocked it out, but a lot I remember.</span> <span id="s1058">And David has a photographic memory.</span> <span id="s1059">So one day, he was running up the steps in my father-in-law’s apartment, and he says -- and he’s reading the paper, he’s running up, he’s not -- he’s three years old, and he says, “Appa, Castro is in Moscow.”</span> <span id="s1060">Yeah, my father-in-law should rest in peace, it was his life.</span> <span id="s1061">One time he took a wooden spoon, and he hit him on the behind.</span> <span id="s1062">I’ll never forget, he called me up, and he said, “Appa,” that’s an Hungarian father, he said, “if you do it, it doesn’t hurt.”</span> <span id="s1063">He loved him so much.</span> <span id="s1064">In fact, I had to take him to the doctor that treated my father, because the day before he jumped on his bed and everything, and I heard him in his room praying, and he said, “Please God, if I did something wrong, bring my -- my grandfather back as -- as a baby again.”</span> <span id="s1065">So I took him to his doctor, to my father-in-law’s doctor, and he told him, Dr. Cohen, that his grandfather was very sick, he could not survive, that, in fact, the last day he brought him a lot of joy by being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Did -- did you have any particular hopes or plans for David that, as a -- as a survivor that made a connection to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: I’ll tell you something.</span> <span id="s1068">I’ve seen a lot of things happen between my American friends that were always Jewish.</span> <span id="s1069">If the son doesn’t get to be a doctor, or a pharmacist, or anything else, and those kids were very unhappy.</span> <span id="s1070">I never told David anything about the Holocaust till he went to go Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1071">When -- when he wouldn’t eat, I wouldn’t say I was hungry, why don’t you eat?</span> <span id="s1072">When he didn’t eat I would say, “David, you have to eat, there are so many children hungry in China.”</span> <span id="s1073">He said, “Why don’t you adopt a couple?”</span> <span id="s1074">That little fat monster told me that.</span> <span id="s1075">But I never told David anything, anything.</span> <span id="s1076">I never exposed him to it.</span> <span id="s1077">David played Little League.</span> <span id="s1078">I burned my hands on the making hamburger there [indecipherable] did in my life, run from the studio, run to the -- to the field, made the hamburgers when it was my day.</span> <span id="s1079">He played Little League, he loved sports, he did judo, anything.</span> <span id="s1080">In fact, he was -- when he was very little, he was very smart, but not coordinated.</span> <span id="s1081">To -- my doctor, Dr. Jessup, told me, “Why don’t you take him boxing or judo?”</span> <span id="s1082">So I took him for judo.</span> <span id="s1083">So in the beginning he didn’t want to go in because he didn’t know how to tie his shoes.</span> <span id="s1084">So I told him, “Then leave it open.”</span> <span id="s1085">But later on, this was the best thing that I ever did.</span> <span id="s1086">But I never, never exposed him to the Holocaust before he was able to understand.</span> <span id="s1087">And I won’t tell any, any child about the Holocaust that is under 11 or 12 years old, because this is a very horrible story that happened, and it can affect their life.</span> <span id="s1088">And especially my son, it was important to me that he doesn’t feel guilty because of me.</span> <span id="s1089">That he doesn’t eat, or he doesn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1090">He didn’t want to be a doctor, he wanted to be a sports re -- the reporter, fine.</span> <span id="s1091">This is your life, you live it.</span> <span id="s1092">At 21 he moved out of the house, we moved to the town house.</span> <span id="s1093">Fine, you live your life.</span> <span id="s1094">I’m not going to make scene.</span> <span id="s1095">He is 40 years old, he is not married yet.</span> <span id="s1096">I would love to have a grandchild, but if he doesn’t want to get married yet, if he want to play the field, fine, what do I care?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: So when did you tell him a little bit about your experience, and what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: I told him before he went to -- he started studying for the Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1099">I told him what happened, very slowly, and very quietly, because he didn’t want to study for his Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1100">I had to get a private rabbi.</span> <span id="s1101">I did not belong to a temple, because -- this is another story by itself, I’m not going to go into it.</span> <span id="s1102">And I -- I ra -- I had the rabbi, I ha -- I hired the shul -- a temple, and he had the most magnificent Bar Mitzvah that ever -- he had everything -- at that time, everything was Calypso.</span> <span id="s1103">And a friend of mine was in the linen supply business.</span> <span id="s1104">Everything was served flambé, and it was kosher, glot kosher, because at that time I knew a lot of survivors already, and some of them were very religious, and I wasn’t going to commit a sin.</span> <span id="s1105">So I found a place that was glot kosher, and it just opened, the Ventura Club.</span> <span id="s1106">And -- but everything they gave you, they did your flowers, I didn’t like.</span> <span id="s1107">They gave me hundred dollar deposit, I paid 500 dollars for flowers.</span> <span id="s1108">Imported hats from Mexico, with everything Calypso, every color.</span> <span id="s1109">I didn’t like his orchestra, so I had another one for the grownups.</span> <span id="s1110">I changed everything around.</span> <span id="s1111">They were supposed to do everything, I did everything.</span> <span id="s1112">But I liked.</span> <span id="s1113">But it was a beautiful Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1114">And, in fact, David was mostly an atheist.</span> <span id="s1115">But now, as he is getting older, is very, very Jewish inclined.</span> <span id="s1116">And I never pushed him, and I never told him you have to be, because when came Christmas, we were at my mother-in-laws.</span> <span id="s1117">Came Rosh Hashanah, we were at my house.</span> <span id="s1118">My mother-in-law made the be -- on -- on Passover, the best matzo balls there is.</span> <span id="s1119">And I never -- in fact, when my father-in-law had his first heart attack, he -- my mother-in-law was running up the street to call us, and she was crossing herself, and David was only going one way.</span> <span id="s1120">She star -- she called me up, she said -- as sad as it was that -- where father is and everything, but said, “I have to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1121">David was going one way, and I said, David, why are you doing it?”</span> <span id="s1122">He said, “Anya, I’m half and half.”</span> <span id="s1123">You know, so that’s -- that’s the -- the funny part that comes into a sad life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Let me ask you about your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: I was very close to them, to my mother-in-law, and father-in-law, very close.</span> <span id="s1126">In fact, I had a ex-sister-in-law -- I have a sister-in-law that I’m very close to.</span> <span id="s1127">She’s Catholic, because for me it doesn’t matter what religion, what faith, what race, as long -- and especially my mother-in-law and father-in-law, David was their life.</span> <span id="s1128">That was the only grandson, and that was their life.</span> <span id="s1129">And my father-in-law, he didn’t live to see it, only wanted to live to see David’s Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1130">My mother-in-law lived to see it, but my father-in-law didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Just a quick follow up on your own faith.</span> <span id="s1132">You don’t have to go into the temple story --</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: -- just a question.</span> <span id="s1135">Did your faith change because of your war experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1137">And I’m not going to lie to you like other people.</span> <span id="s1138">It didn’t change for the better.</span> <span id="s1139">I was -- come from a very religious family.</span> <span id="s1140">And it’s a town where it was the most famous yeshiva, Slabotka Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s1141">Most of the finest rabbis came out, and my grandfather gave a lot of money for it.</span> <span id="s1142">And he was very religious, and he was -- like I told you, I was his pet.</span> <span id="s1143">And he was the first one to be taken away.</span> <span id="s1144">With a hundred -- with 138, I don’t know how much it here, but 103 degrees temperature.</span> <span id="s1145">The first aktja that they had in the Kovno ghetto, they took away my grandfather, my grandmother, both of them, but the closest one I was to Shia and Bessa Schneider.</span> <span id="s1146">And let me tell you -- my mother’s family.</span> <span id="s1147">And one time -- my girlfriend died of kidney when she was 38 years old, for a transplant, many, many years ago.</span> <span id="s1148">And a very famous rabbi, Rabbi Newsbaum was at her home, but va -- he didn’t go to ma -- many homes, but he came to Ethela’s home.</span> <span id="s1149">And I said, “Why, why the nice people die first?”</span> <span id="s1150">And he said to me, “Because God doesn’t want them to suffer.”</span> <span id="s1151">I said, “That is no excuse.”</span> <span id="s1152">I said, “I have never done anything, my two little sisters have never done anything in their life.”</span> <span id="s1153">I said, “Why did -- one was three years old, she didn’t even have a chance to -- to suffer, or not to suffer.</span> <span id="s1154">This is no answer, Rabbi.”</span> <span id="s1155">Then, when I came to the valley, and I was going to have David, I said, “Now it’s time to join a temple.”</span> <span id="s1156">I spent every penny to opening the studio.</span> <span id="s1157">And Al and Juliet West, they helped me out, I told you.</span> <span id="s1158">And I went to a very famous temple, I don’t [indecipherable] to tell you, Rabbi Weiss.</span> <span id="s1159">Later on I was with him on the same ticket speaking, with the federation, and then at -- at the big B’nai Brith conference.</span> <span id="s1160">He didn’t recognize me when I came to the microphone.</span> <span id="s1161">And I came to him, and I said, “I would like to join your temple.”</span> <span id="s1162">And he said, “It cost 750 dollars to join the temple.”</span> <span id="s1163">And I said, “I can’t afford it,” [indecipherable] He said, “Then why don’t you look for another temple?”</span> <span id="s1164">And since then, I would never join a temple, and I was with him on one ticket that -- that -- at the federation I didn’t say a word.</span> <span id="s1165">But, when the aliyah start coming in from Russia, we had a big convention, B’nai Brith convention, and I was there, and it was in the aisles microphones, and I came up, and I said, “Rabbi, you want us to make Jews out of the Russian people.</span> <span id="s1166">They are coming so poor, and we have to make Jews out of them.”</span> <span id="s1167">I said, “Wasn’t -- do you know me?”</span> <span id="s1168">He said, “Oh yes, Marsha, we were on the same ticket at the federation, at the ballroom.”</span> <span id="s1169">I said, “Now, don’t you remember in 1957 I came to you before my son was born, and I wanted to join your temple, and you said to me it cost too much money, I should look for another temple?”</span> <span id="s1170">I got such an applaud, 120 women were there.</span> <span id="s1171">Here he’s giving -- this is such hypocritical -- he’s giving us a lecture that we should help the Russian Jews -- being je -- make them Jews, and -- and -- and -- and 20 or 30 years ago he refused me to join his temple.</span> <span id="s1172">He’s not the rabbi there any more.</span> <span id="s1173">It’s a very good temple, Temple Ariel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Ask you another question.</span> <span id="s1175">You said earlier that you didn’t know there were other Holocaust survivors in -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: [indecipherable] for awhile.</span> <span id="s1178">When -- when did that change, and when did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s1180">You’ll die laughing.</span> <span id="s1181">I was sitting in my studio -- sitting in my studio, Robert Young was sitting there, he knitted on the set.</span> <span id="s1182">I used mostly designed for the Gracie Allen Show.</span> <span id="s1183">Mostly, it was expensive and -- to have a dress designed by me, or they knit it themself or we made it for [indecipherable] Ice Follies, Mrs. Sheepstead, Loretta Young, you know, I had most of the studio people.</span> <span id="s1184">And we’re sitting -- the owners of the Sportsman’s Lounge at that time was Zuzu Fine, and Robert Young was sitting, and a very old actress by the name of Ann Harding, I don’t know if people will remember, because at that time she was old already.</span> <span id="s1185">She was on studio one or something, I saw the night before.</span> <span id="s1186">And I get a phone call.</span> <span id="s1187">I said, “Can I talk to Mariashki Supporzhnikov?”</span> <span id="s1188">And I said, “Ish bin mya,” this woman is speaking Yiddish, I am speaking German because I forgot how to speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1189">I said, “Ish bin Myashka sup,” -- I am Myashka Suppozhn.</span> <span id="s1190">But in German she said, “I’m sorry,” she said, “Myashka Supporzhnikov didn’t speak such a good German.”</span> <span id="s1191">I said, “But I am.”</span> <span id="s1192">She said no, and she start talking in Jewish, and we talk and we talk and the people are there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1193">They are sitting there laughing like crazy for the conversation that’s going on, and here I’m sitting there, and -- and talking to her, and she said, “Now wait a moment.</span> <span id="s1194">What kind of a coat did you wear in ghetto?”</span> <span id="s1195">I said, “I wore a gray poodle coat, I’ll never forget, with a big, big cub -- .”</span> <span id="s1196">What do you call it, that you put over your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: A hood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: A hood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: A hood, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yeah, and it was made out of poodle cloth, because when I came into the ghetto, I was so young, that my clothes grew out of me.</span> <span id="s1201">So my father found a piece of poodle cloth, and he made me a warm coat.</span> <span id="s1202">And everybody envied me, of course.</span> <span id="s1203">She said, “Oh, you are really Myashka Supporzhnikov.”</span> <span id="s1204">That night I was invited to a very big affair, and I stopped off in a home before we -- we went to the party, and from then on I start meeting more and more survivors.</span> <span id="s1205">I knew survivors, but I didn’t really associate with them, because they were from Poland.</span> <span id="s1206">I had nothing did -- I had -- we had nothing in common.</span> <span id="s1207">So I met a lot of Lithuanian survivors.</span> <span id="s1208">And this is -- I mean, my life was always the museum, and always the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1209">The first time I start talking was here in the valley.</span> <span id="s1210">It was one time a very big tycoon, the Glickmans.</span> <span id="s1211">He was in the eel -- real estate business, he was a multi-millionaire, lost a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1212">He was 13 years old, and he had the havara group.</span> <span id="s1213">Was many, many years ago, about 20 years, 30 years ago.</span> <span id="s1214">And I went to their home, and a pr -- a -- a teacher from Grant High School at that time, they called it the bagel factory, it was a Jewish high school, and they were the first builders of the Stefan Weiss Temple, the Glickmans.</span> <span id="s1215">And they called me over, they said, “Would you talk to havara group, tell them your story?”</span> <span id="s1216">That was the first time I start talking about the Holocaust, it was about 32 years ago.</span> <span id="s1217">When he brought me home, that professor, from -- from Grant High School, he said to Cornelius, “I created another billi -- Billy Graham.”</span> <span id="s1218">From that day on, I start talking about the Holocaust to everyone that will listen, and never stopped.</span> <span id="s1219">And what happened is is -- but never, never did I tell anybody anything that they didn’t want to hear.</span> <span id="s1220">The only thing that is before I went to go to be citizen in -- and one of my clientele was a daughter-in-law of Professor J.C. Owens, he was the right hand of Hoover.</span> <span id="s1221">And she said to me, “If you are going to be, be a Republican, not a Democrat.”</span> <span id="s1222">And Cornelius, and his mother, and everybody, big Democrats.</span> <span id="s1223">I says -- I said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s1224">She said, “I’ll bring you some documents, and I want Cornelius and you to read it together, because his English is a little bit better than yours.”</span> <span id="s1225">I said, “Thanks a lot Mrs. Owens, you just did me a big favor.</span> <span id="s1226">In front of all my clientele, you are telling me that.”</span> <span id="s1227">She took it out of the safe, and she brought it to me, and I read the story, when Hoover was in 1938 in Europe, and he came back, and he asked Roosevelt to do something about the Jews that are being killed in Europe.</span> <span id="s1228">He didn’t come himself to Palo Alto, he sent somebody, and told them to inform Mr. Hoover that he cannot be bothered with a handle -- handful of Jews.</span> <span id="s1229">And since then, I came into a friends of mine house, a survivor also from Lithuania, that had a big picture of hers -- over her fireplace of Roosevelt, and that was in the 19 -- late 1950’s, and I spit on his face, and she threw me out of her house.</span> <span id="s1230">And now everything comes out in the open.</span> <span id="s1231">What I knew in ’53, is coming out now, with the boat, and with everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: I have to s -- change.</span> <span id="s1233">This is the end of tape two, side B, interview with Marsha Loen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marsha Loen.</span> <span id="s1236">This is tape number three, side A. I would like to talk a little bit more about your work -- your Holocaust work [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: My Holocaust work is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: When does it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: -- the most important thing in my life after my son and my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: When -- when did that start, and had it something to do also with a change in -- in -- in society, more of an interest in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: No, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1242">When I first started there was people didn’t even know there was a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1243">Some Jewish people didn’t know, like I told you, I talked to the havara group, and it was like I was, you know, something out of the blue.</span> <span id="s1244">They were shocked that there was a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1245">And these were very close friends of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: And that was in the late 50’s, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: And that was in the -- in the li -- yeah, the late 50’s, yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s1248">And -- no, the beginning of the 60’s already.</span> <span id="s1249">And the people were -- were shocked what was going on in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1250">Jewish people, friends of mine, Christian people.</span> <span id="s1251">It doesn’t matter to me if they were Christian, or Jewish, or half and half, or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1252">So I made up my mind then and then, that I’m going -- not -- I was left for revenge, and mine only revenge will be not to hurt people, but to teach them that this should never happen again.</span> <span id="s1253">And that is my revenge, and that why I’m still speaking.</span> <span id="s1254">And that -- we were very rich, we lost a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1255">The same museum that I helped build, and paid out thousand, and thousand, and thousands of dollars, I’m working that museum on a salary right now, through the federation, at my age.</span> <span id="s1256">But I have to, and as long as I can drive, and as long as I can work, I will do it.</span> <span id="s1257">Cornelius is still working again, too.</span> <span id="s1258">But I’ll tell you something, maybe it makes us happier this way.</span> <span id="s1259">Sometimes I’m very tired, I could hardly get done.</span> <span id="s1260">Because a lot of people that work with me in the museum, that are in higher positions that I am, are very misunderstanding, and don’t understand the feeling.</span> <span id="s1261">And I’ve talked to somebody at the federation the other week, and he says to me, “We have a big problem here, Marsha.”</span> <span id="s1262">And he’s right, psychologically, he said, “You are one of the high lite -- lay person, and now you’re staff, and that is a big problem.”</span> <span id="s1263">And he says, “You can’t stand anything that is wrong.”</span> <span id="s1264">And I said, “I can’t, because you know, when I go out, and I raise in two days, four and a half thousand dollars to put up banners, I want to be consulted if the banners are alright or not, because three of them were made, and it was selected the worst of them.”</span> <span id="s1265">I said -- and that is what hurts me.</span> <span id="s1266">That person that runs that museum, I cannot mention name, is very jealous of me, because when it comes -- anything that has to do with museum, everybody knows me, the whole community.</span> <span id="s1267">Starting from the federation, to the - to-- to black young adults, African American, to teachers, to everything else.</span> <span id="s1268">Everybody knows me, and I hope they respect me, and that is the biggest problem.</span> <span id="s1269">But I have to work, and I -- this is the only job I know.</span> <span id="s1270">And I’ve learned, believe it or not, at my age, the last three years I been working on the computer, and I’m pretty good at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Good -- good for you.</span> <span id="s1272">Good for --</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: And I go out, and you know what?</span> <span id="s1274">I was supposed to start as -- as a coordinator, and I was on the level of higher pos -- not with money, but on a higher level, and she couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s1275">So she put me down as eight -- grade eight.</span> <span id="s1276">I got the same salary, and I’m union anyway, but she didn’t want to have the same paper filled out every two weeks as I did.</span> <span id="s1277">So I was put as, instead of 10 plus to eight plus, and it didn’t bother me, because I don’t go out for big honor and so on.</span> <span id="s1278">I also very mu -- many times met, before I started working, I went with Benjamin Meet, and many other people, to Washington for teacher training, to send out teachers to Yad Vashem, because I am part of the council of post-war Jews organization.</span> <span id="s1279">I am the treasurer for many years.</span> <span id="s1280">In ’91, we honored Benjamin Meet, and Vlodka from the American gathering.</span> <span id="s1281">Benjamin Meet is one of the greatest men that I’ve ever met, because he brought the survivors together.</span> <span id="s1282">The first gathering that we went to was in Israel, the second one was in Washington.</span> <span id="s1283">In fact, in the Washington museum, I just got a book from the Washington museum, I left it in our museum, is you open the middle, and there is my best friend from ghetto.</span> <span id="s1284">When I was a little girl he was my boyfriend, Abe Malnik.</span> <span id="s1285">And it’s a big pictures of him, on a -- on a TV screen.</span> <span id="s1286">I don’t know if you’re seen it, the last jo -- the last book that came out.</span> <span id="s1287">I also am in touch constantly with Malsy at the book store, because we sell a lot of guides to you, called, “Those Who Dared,” and “Rescue.”</span> <span id="s1288">That was done by the Martyr’s Memorial at that time, under the leadership of Alex Grubman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: I imagine you also did a lot of interviews with Holocaust survivors later on.</span> <span id="s1290">What did you -- tell us more about that, what you learned from that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: I’ll tell you, I interviewed for the Shoah Foundation 110 survivors, because I needed it -- they paid me, and also I wanted to know a lot -- you see, I didn’t want to talk about things I didn’t know, that you read out of a book.</span> <span id="s1292">And when I arranged for the Holocaust museum, for the Martyr’s Memorial, to go out for people to speak, and to give tours in the museum, I’ve always told them, “Don’t say anything that you didn’t go through.</span> <span id="s1293">You talk only about your own experiences,” because there was, at that time I coached Abe Spiegel, and I coached Ed Lasabnik, and I coached the first three chairs, the lay chairs.</span> <span id="s1294">And I was the lay person that coached the -- those people.</span> <span id="s1295">I also was fundraising for B’nai Brith in the meantime, fundraising for ORT, but I could never take the presidency, because always came the museum ahead of it.</span> <span id="s1296">I was -- I was one of the first people, with my husband, with the Carters, and many people in the valley, with the Katz’s, they were older than we are.</span> <span id="s1297">We raised money to establish the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: It’s an airplane coming over here, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1300">I -- to establish the Gateway of Mental Health, most of the famous hospitals in Los Angeles for -- for the Gateway of Health people.</span> <span id="s1301">We bought the Hoover lot, and I and Cornelius were fundraising.</span> <span id="s1302">I’m very good at fundraising, and especially when I had the money, and I gave, I got back a lot.</span> <span id="s1303">Even now, when we needed banners, I raised the money for it.</span> <span id="s1304">I work for the museum, but I really work with my heart.</span> <span id="s1305">If you don’t get a speaker, I speak.</span> <span id="s1306">If you don’t -- we need to work the computer, I work the computer.</span> <span id="s1307">If you need this, I do this.</span> <span id="s1308">But, the only thing that hurts me very badly is that the person that runs the museum does not like me.</span> <span id="s1309">Absolutely doesn’t understand survivors, and absolutely doesn’t like me.</span> <span id="s1310">But that will change, I hope, in the near future.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: You just said, doesn’t understand survivors.</span> <span id="s1312">Let me ask you -- there were so many different --</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: It was my own fault, Regina, because when the f -- the director left, and he was writing a book that is just coming out, called, “The Deniers.”</span> <span id="s1314">It will come out in 2000, I hope I live to see it.</span> <span id="s1315">And he didn’t have much time.</span> <span id="s1316">I was working just as coordinator, and then when he left, he wrote a letter to the head of the federation, that till they find a -- a -- a director, I can run the museum, and this person can help me.</span> <span id="s1317">And I did that, and in the long run, she got to be the director of the museum.</span> <span id="s1318">She doesn’t have a PhD., she has a Master degree, but that’s not important.</span> <span id="s1319">Sh-She’s very good as a part time curator, but not as good as a director, and I know I may get fired when she hears the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Well, let’s get away from that subject [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: -- what I really want</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: It hurts me very much, this subject.</span> <span id="s1324">Because the museum has to stay, because I put -- this was the first museum built in the United States of America.</span> <span id="s1325">We had breakfast with Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s1326">I still have the picture of me and Elie Wiesel, and Freddie Diamond.</span> <span id="s1327">And Elie Wiesel at that breakfast, was a very small breakfast from the federation, said that this was a jewel.</span> <span id="s1328">We were on the 12th floor of the Jewish Federation building.</span> <span id="s1329">And then we start -- they start building the Washington museum, and Lydia Bodka is the president of the Council of Post-War Jews organization.</span> <span id="s1330">And every year in February -- now I can’t, because I work, we went, and when I had the money, and we helped Latka and Benjamin Meet send people all through the concentration camps, and Yad Vashem -- teachers, to be able to teach the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1331">When I started to -- not lecture, I don’t call it a lecture -- talk about my experiences in the Holocaust -- I’m not a lecturer, I’m not a teacher.</span> <span id="s1332">I -- it was done here a little bit, and there a little bit, and there a little bit, and people came by the hundreds to the museum when it first opened, because for them it was new.</span> <span id="s1333">I was 10 days, I’ll show you, from the president of the University of Utah, southern Utah.</span> <span id="s1334">I was supposed to be 48 hours, I stayed for 10 days.</span> <span id="s1335">I set up a Holocaust museum in the library, and the kids were coming down from the mountains, the Indian kids, and all kind of kids.</span> <span id="s1336">And it was called Jewish week.</span> <span id="s1337">And there was all different kind of illel, did a lot of cooking, and dancing, and so on.</span> <span id="s1338">There was one Jewish students in the whole -- at that time it was a college, now it’s a university.</span> <span id="s1339">So -- and I paid for everything, and then there was a director from Yad Vashem working, Shome Balmar, at that time, at our museum, and I called, and I saw all those big people from Israel, from the American Jewish committee, and so on.</span> <span id="s1340">So I -- right away I send him a ticket he should come right away to Utah.</span> <span id="s1341">And then he lectured at the washing -- at the Einstein hall.</span> <span id="s1342">So you see, whenever I talk, and whatever I do, I always end up Holocaust -- talking about the Holocaust, and what it should be done about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1343">You know, about a couple of weeks ago, I couldn’t get speakers.</span> <span id="s1344">And the museum is small now, very small, because we are sharing till the other building is finished, we are sharing the whole first floor of a building with two other agencies of the federation, with the library, and the Jewish Historical Society.</span> <span id="s1345">So, when they have a big group, we divide it in three parts.</span> <span id="s1346">We send them to the monument, we have a big monument at Palm Pacific Park, that was built by survivors, and I was on the committee too.</span> <span id="s1347">In fact, I’m engraved in the committee.</span> <span id="s1348">And we have the museum, so what we do is we divide it in three groups.</span> <span id="s1349">And I couldn’t get any speakers that day, so I spoke to three different groups at the same time, the same day.</span> <span id="s1350">And worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: I asked --</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: So, you can see that Holocaust is my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Yeah, so it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Not the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1355">I’m sorry for that expression, the hol -- to remember the Holocaust, that this should never happen again.</span> <span id="s1356">It -- not only Jews died in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1357">I was in a death camp, Stutthof, where on the other side there were Catholic priests, there were Gypsies, there were homosexuals, people -- prisoner of wars, people that didn’t agree with Hitler, that were killed in that place.</span> <span id="s1358">Stutthof is the only camp that the original gas chamber -- the original crematorium is still standing.</span> <span id="s1359">But this is the forgotten death camp.</span> <span id="s1360">I wrote a couple of articles in papers about the forgotten death camp, and if you notice, when you were here originally, I made that phone call the minute there is to give out money for survivors or anything, I call all my people that I know, and if they can’t make the phone calls, I do it.</span> <span id="s1361">We have a guide in the museum that we composed for where and when the people should call.</span> <span id="s1362">For insurance claims, for -- for Swiss money, for everything.</span> <span id="s1363">If anybody calls -- we send out about at least -- at least 800 -- 800 to a thousand of those guides for survivors to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Marsha, h-how do you feel about -- no, let me -- let me say this differently.</span> <span id="s1365">S-Survivors have so many different life stories, and so many different --</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: -- experiences.</span> <span id="s1368">However, is there something from your experience, who has interviewed -- interviewed a lot of them, too, something that is united --</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: The something that bothers me is that a lot of them are adding certain things that other people went through, that they discussed with.</span> <span id="s1370">And that what bothers me when I was interviewing, because I read a lot about the Holocaust, even for the Polish people, and Auschwitz, and -- and Majdanek, and everything else.</span> <span id="s1371">I worked with, “The Triumphant Spirit,” with Nick Decalsio on the book.</span> <span id="s1372">And it bothers me when people -- like take the Hungarians, from Budapest I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s1373">They didn’t -- they -- they only start suffering in 1944, and they were put in the ghetto in 1944.</span> <span id="s1374">But they also suffered, and a lot of them were killed in Auschwitz, and everything.</span> <span id="s1375">But I don’t think they went through the things that the people that went through -- that went through from 1939.</span> <span id="s1376">Like, I couldn’t say I went through like the Polish people that started 19 -- 9 -- ’39, or the German Jews.</span> <span id="s1377">But the German Jews, in the beginning, before the Kristallnacht still lived pretty good.</span> <span id="s1378">You understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s1379">And like again with the Anne Frank’s diary.</span> <span id="s1380">You take the Anne Frank’s diary, there’s hundreds of people that wrote diaries, but Anne Frank’s diary was found first.</span> <span id="s1381">And I want to tell you a story about Anne Frank’s diary.</span> <span id="s1382">My cousin, Leah Salisbury that converted to baptism -- I don’t know what she converted, she married a guy -- she’s my mother’s cousin, she wasn’t my cousin, she was the literary agent to Anne Frank’s diary in -- in America.</span> <span id="s1383">I never had a lot to do with her, because her mother was Jewish, and she didn’t do it very much, she only had to do -- she only had to do with show people And she wanted me to come to her estate in -- in Sanvits shwanza, somewhere in New York, Connecticut, whatever it is -- I don’t know what it -- what it is.</span> <span id="s1384">I never went, because I didn’t like it the way she treat her mother.</span> <span id="s1385">It was her mother 80th birthday, I was a youngster at that time, it was my mother’s aunt.</span> <span id="s1386">And I went there -- Aunt Molly, and her biggest pleasure was modeling, at 80 years old for the temple, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1387">And no, Leah went, was stayed up 10 - 15 minutes, and she left.</span> <span id="s1388">So when she send me tickets when Anne Frank’s diary was here, as a theater in Los Angeles, I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1389">And I don’t really believe in Anne Frank’s diary.</span> <span id="s1390">I believe that it happened, of course, it did happen.</span> <span id="s1391">But there is so many diaries been written, there’s so many children been hidden, there’s so many children been killed, like my two little sisters, one three years old, that was born in ghetto, that doesn’t even know what it means that little piece of bread, one piece of fi -- a whole piece of bread, or a whole piece of -- of milk, or anything.</span> <span id="s1392">But she knew every German.</span> <span id="s1393">They were so smart, like God has give them more head, or something.</span> <span id="s1394">Every German that walked by, she knew by name, when she was hidden.</span> <span id="s1395">You know, because when they took away all the children, my biggest crime my mother committed is by hiding of my two little sisters.</span> <span id="s1396">And that why she was killed at 34 years old, in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1397">I don’t know, like I told you, where she was killed.</span> <span id="s1398">Now that I read a lot more about -- when I start reading more about Theresienstadt, and Auschwitz, and everything that was going on, I don’t know where she was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: So you think though that a lot -- many survivors, or at least some who speak about their experience, bring in something that they have read in the meantime --</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: -- or -- or seen on the -- in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Definitely, and that why most of our speakers of the museum can only speak about their experiences.</span> <span id="s1403">If they do not speak about their experiences, they are not called again.</span> <span id="s1404">Because, you know, like I told you, some very intelligent men ask me about the Warshaw ghetto, and I told him, “I would insult your intelligence if I tell you, because I read the same book that you can pick up off the shelf, and read it in there in the library.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Do you think that the public’s perception of survivors has changed over the years, that the American public looks at survivors in a different way than they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: They look in a much nicer way than they did, because the survivors made something of themself.</span> <span id="s1407">That why I like the survivors to buy, “The Triumphant Spirit,” and see what people made of themself.</span> <span id="s1408">Like, the biggest toy factory is owned by Mr. Cort.</span> <span id="s1409">The -- that gave a lot of money to the Washington museum, he gave a lot of money to the monument.</span> <span id="s1410">He gives, and gives, and gives, for the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1411">Mr. Webb.</span> <span id="s1412">Most of the survivors.</span> <span id="s1413">Mr. Chappel, here in los -- I can only talk about the people in Los Angeles that I know.</span> <span id="s1414">One of my very, very good friend, was much older than I was, he just not long ago died, helped build the monument in Florida, Abe Resnick.</span> <span id="s1415">You must have heard of him.</span> <span id="s1416">He comes from Kovno.</span> <span id="s1417">He was in Kovno ghetto part time.</span> <span id="s1418">I knew people that -- that made so much of themself, the survivors, that you have to have respect for them.</span> <span id="s1419">You just have to.</span> <span id="s1420">Even if you don’t like what they tell you.</span> <span id="s1421">Even if you feel guilty that you couldn’t help them, that you didn’t help them.</span> <span id="s1422">You still have to have respect for what they made of themself.</span> <span id="s1423">You take me, a little girl comes into -- married a guy that most of the family is Christian, I’m Jewish, very, very brought up Jewish, come from the concentration camps, my husband was in a labor camp.</span> <span id="s1424">Thanks God my mother-in-law was very understanding and helped a lot of Jews, I told you she’s a Righteous Christian and everything.</span> <span id="s1425">But still, my brother-in-law was in America, having -- living a playboy life, you understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s1426">And so on.</span> <span id="s1427">And here comes that little -- poor little girl, you know.</span> <span id="s1428">And thanks I God -- but I didn’t let it happen to me.</span> <span id="s1429">This is the survivor’s spirit.</span> <span id="s1430">I didn’t let them think of me that he is better than I am.</span> <span id="s1431">No.</span> <span id="s1432">I am the one that is feared.</span> <span id="s1433">I didn’t fear him, he feared me.</span> <span id="s1434">You know why?</span> <span id="s1435">Because I didn’t let him get away with it.</span> <span id="s1436">Because I was better than he was.</span> <span id="s1437">He didn’t go through what I went through, and had to go to school and everything.</span> <span id="s1438">His father paid for everything.</span> <span id="s1439">I did it myself.</span> <span id="s1440">Do you understand what I am talking about?</span> <span id="s1441">Maybe people won’t understand what I am talking about, but I feel very, very good about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: I think it’s very clear.</span> <span id="s1443">But my question is still, so you have really managed to, with great determination, and work, and spirit, to build a new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Still --</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: My life was very rich, thanks God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Did the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: I went to Europe for a -- for months, and month.</span> <span id="s1449">I was very wealthy at one time, and I went to Europe, and I went to the first one -- when Hawaii wasn’t a state yet, I went to Hawaii.</span> <span id="s1450">I went -- my friends were very well-to-do friends, and some of them took us to La Jolla, and you know, I went to places where people -- I don’t say -- you know, my son was born a little later, like I told you, I couldn’t have children, so I had a little more time than the other people had.</span> <span id="s1451">They had to bring up their family.</span> <span id="s1452">A lot of the survivors were lonesome, so they got married just with anybody, you understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s1453">Maybe they -- they didn’t fit, but they made a life together, they brought up their children beautiful.</span> <span id="s1454">The only thing that I don’t agree, that most of the survivor pushed their children.</span> <span id="s1455">And I was -- stood by it, and watched it, and it hurts.</span> <span id="s1456">And a lot of them are sick.</span> <span id="s1457">A lot of them are very sick, and a lot of them need psychiatrists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Did you ever need help?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s1460">Many times I’ve need help, but you know what?</span> <span id="s1461">My husband was my best psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s1462">I talked a lot of things over with him.</span> <span id="s1463">And like I said, I told you I’ve learned to do self hypnosis, because nobody -- I was too strong for anybody to hypnotize me.</span> <span id="s1464">And I made a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s1465">I didn’t have time -- I didn’t have -- I lectured on the Holocaust, I worked.</span> <span id="s1466">My studio was -- you know, I had contact with very unusual people.</span> <span id="s1467">You know, show people are very unusual people.</span> <span id="s1468">You know, like Cary Grant ordered from me a -- a golf sweater, and he send in his manager to bargain with me.</span> <span id="s1469">And I told him, “Please don’t do this to me.</span> <span id="s1470">He doesn’t want it, let him go somewhere else.”</span> <span id="s1471">A hand knitted golf sweater in cashmere.</span> <span id="s1472">Zsa Zsa Gabor once says to me, “Oh, I don’t have to pay you the bill, my name is good enough, that I come to you.”</span> <span id="s1473">I said, “Much bigger people than you are coming to me, and I don’t mean show people.</span> <span id="s1474">I mean scientists.</span> <span id="s1475">I mean other people, just -- just any people.</span> <span id="s1476">They don’t have to be in show peop -- show business to have a brain.”</span> <span id="s1477">I didn’t want to tell her that there is no brain, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1478">But that’s it.</span> <span id="s1479">You know, she had looks, and that was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: I just -- I just read a quote recently, and I just want to give you that quote and see what your response is.</span> <span id="s1481">A scholar recently wrote that still in this country survivors are very often seen either way, either as anxious ghosts, or as secular saints.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: This is full of baloney.</span> <span id="s1483">I think a survivor is a normal person, absolutely normal, much more normal as some of the Americans I’ve met.</span> <span id="s1484">And believe me, most of my friends are Americans.</span> <span id="s1485">And like I told you, it went by eight years before I met with the survivors.</span> <span id="s1486">And I tell you something, I had one girlfriend, h-her son -- I didn’t have children yet, and her son only ate lamb chops with ketchup.</span> <span id="s1487">I mean, this is abnormal.</span> <span id="s1488">If my son would do it, I would say he’s crazy.</span> <span id="s1489">I wouldn’t make it lamb chops a -- and if a daughter, God forbid, took a piece of her lamb chops, Ann Marie had two problems.</span> <span id="s1490">I mean, this is abnormal.</span> <span id="s1491">But for s -- for saying the survivor are abnormal, no.</span> <span id="s1492">I feel -- I feel much more -- much more up to date, and up to life, and if I die tomorrow, I have lived a very rich, beautiful life.</span> <span id="s1493">Poor or rich, even if I lost my money -- at one time I was very depressed because I di -- we [indecipherable] twice -- three times, but then I talk to myself.</span> <span id="s1494">I said, “Marsha, you lost so much in your life, does those things mean anything to you?”</span> <span id="s1495">After the earthquake, when I lost everything.</span> <span id="s1496">And then in the middle of the shakes I went to help a friend that lived up in the hills, in the dark, with my husband, because she was there alone.</span> <span id="s1497">That was more important to me than my Rosenthal, and my Lalique, and everything else.</span> <span id="s1498">To get into the car in the dark, and the shakes were still going, you know, aftershake, to go and help my friend.</span> <span id="s1499">And would any average American do that?</span> <span id="s1500">And I feel myself they would.</span> <span id="s1501">And that why I call myself an American.</span> <span id="s1502">I worked for the man that I like.</span> <span id="s1503">I do everything that the country needs, because that country gave me life, gave me freedom, gave me everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Are there things that you are critical of in -- in American culture and society?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: Yes, to a certain extent about the schools, very much so.</span> <span id="s1506">That why I send my ha -- my son in the beginning to a private school.</span> <span id="s1507">When I went in the public school, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1508">And there’s a lot of things that -- that could be -- when I first came to this country it was so peaceful, it was so beautiful in 1949.</span> <span id="s1509">You could walk on the streets, you could have a ball.</span> <span id="s1510">And now all this murdering, and everything that’s going on, it’s -- doesn’t come out of the people, it’s the way the people are treated.</span> <span id="s1511">And if you say, oh a black American did it -- I -- I mean A-African American did it, or a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- O-Oriental did it, or this one did it.</span> <span id="s1512">What about the skinheads, what they did to the synagogues in Sacramento?</span> <span id="s1513">What about Jewish people that do certain things?</span> <span id="s1514">And what about Christian white people that do certain things?</span> <span id="s1515">There’s no such a thing, I -- unity is the most important thing, and that country does not have unity right now.</span> <span id="s1516">That’s the problem.</span> <span id="s1517">And that why it’s very important that the kids in school, or in college, or in the university, are learning about unity.</span> <span id="s1518">That the person is flesh and blood.</span> <span id="s1519">They are not -- even an animal is protected by the animal society, but the -- the African American that doesn’t have food is not protected.</span> <span id="s1520">I know what it means to be without food.</span> <span id="s1521">I know what it means to be cold.</span> <span id="s1522">I know those things, so I feel with those people.</span> <span id="s1523">In a country that is that rich, and helps everybody else.</span> <span id="s1524">Kosovo, Shmosovo, everything.</span> <span id="s1525">Help your country, too.</span> <span id="s1526">I don’t say they shouldn’t help the people.</span> <span id="s1527">They definitely should.</span> <span id="s1528">But help your country, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: This is the end of tape three, side A, interview with Marsha Loen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marsha Loen.</span> <span id="s1532">This is tape number three, side B, and Marsha would like to -- to read a poem now, but you should probably introduce it, and say something first.</span> <span id="s1533">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1535">I was hurt by a friend, so I didn’t know how to deal with it, so I went home -- you know, I’m -- I’m -- I’m a amateur poet.</span> <span id="s1536">I don’t write all odays, I just write rhymes.</span> <span id="s1537">So I would like to read you the poem.</span> <span id="s1538">The poem is called, “Friendship.”</span> <span id="s1539">Friendship is a gift from God.</span> <span id="s1540">The love from a second person that draws you like a lightning rod.</span> <span id="s1541">It takes patience, it takes understanding, because if you break those rules, it cannot easily be mended.</span> <span id="s1542">That is why we go through life to find a way to understand that person who is a friend, and try to keep that friendship, and lend a hand.</span> <span id="s1543">But if that person get jealous and bitter, it is hard to keep your cool and ditter.</span> <span id="s1544">To forgive it’s easy, sometimes hard.</span> <span id="s1545">Who knows the right thing, and who is smart?</span> <span id="s1546">Is that person who calls himself my friend, or is that person I do not understand.</span> <span id="s1547">The only one who knows is me, I feel the love, I feel the glee.</span> <span id="s1548">To be bitter, and to hate is very easy, but there is better things in life to keep my busy.</span> <span id="s1549">Hatred hurts only that person who projects it.</span> <span id="s1550">That is why I say, forget hate, keep your friendship and don’t neglect it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: So friendship is very important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Yes, very.</span> <span id="s1553">And if somebody hurts me, I just -- I can’t take it sometimes.</span> <span id="s1554">So, instead of arguing, or doing something, I just write a poem, or just an article, or anything.</span> <span id="s1555">What I wanted to tell you is, Regina, that I’m a very lucky person that I’m connected with the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1556">They gave me a job at a certain age, when nobody would have given me a job, when I need it.</span> <span id="s1557">And that’s why I’m very grateful to them, and I will be grateful to them the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s1558">And that again is the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Did you ever go to -- to es -- to Israel, or to pal -- not to Palestine, to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1561">I practically ended up in Palestine, but -- when I was smuggling than the people, but I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1562">The first time I was supposed to go to Israel was in ’67, and the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1563">I was in Russia.</span> <span id="s1564">I did not go to any of the concentration camp, I never will go.</span> <span id="s1565">In fact, when I was in Lithuania -- that’s why I went -- I did not go to Kovno, I stayed in Wilno.</span> <span id="s1566">Because I won’t give him the satisfaction, to go to Poland and spend money, to the murderer.</span> <span id="s1567">It went to Kovno -- I went to Lithuania, to Russia because I had to.</span> <span id="s1568">There was a reason, there was a mission.</span> <span id="s1569">My sis -- older sister was there.</span> <span id="s1570">And at that time I went as a friend, because it was still Communistic, and I had to wait two and a half years for a visa.</span> <span id="s1571">And then I had to stay in a certain hotel, and everything else.</span> <span id="s1572">But never, never, would I go to Poland, or to anywhere where there are concentration camps, and have give them the satisfaction to spend money there.</span> <span id="s1573">I’m sorry, I won’t do it.</span> <span id="s1574">I went all over Europe.</span> <span id="s1575">I went to the Mamblon, I went to Italy.</span> <span id="s1576">I know there were concentration camps everywhere.</span> <span id="s1577">There was one in Ebensee that I didn’t even know.</span> <span id="s1578">I was skiing in Ebensee with my husband.</span> <span id="s1579">We went there because how far was it from Tronkishin where we had the hotel, and we went from -- from -- from Linz, to -- to -- to ve -- I went to -- we went on our honeymoon, we stayed at the Vicearussel near the Glosegrog, you know, the -- what do you call, the oldest lakes.</span> <span id="s1580">It was in alt -- no, it was in Wolfgangsay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Wolfgangsay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: Wolfgangsay.</span> <span id="s1583">And I went always on trips all through Europe and everything, but still, I went to Italy, I went to -- like I told, went -- we went to the Mamblon.</span> <span id="s1584">In ’67, I was supposed to -- I went to Russia, and then my husband meet me, we were supposed to go to Israel, but the war broke out, it was the Six Day War, so I couldn’t go there.</span> <span id="s1585">So I went there the year after, and then I went for the gathering, and then I went for the -- went in 1979.</span> <span id="s1586">Then I went in 1985, and they had the -- for the partisans.</span> <span id="s1587">Then I went again in 1989.</span> <span id="s1588">And then when my ankle broke, it’s very hard for me to travel by plane, so I haven’t been there since.</span> <span id="s1589">But I have papers, I’ll show it to you.</span> <span id="s1590">I have a beautiful citation from the Mengele twins, because I always visit people that were connected with the -- with the Holocaust, and they were hurt by the Holocaust, and made friends with them, and did something for them that I could.</span> <span id="s1591">I went -- they were here, I had a symposium for them in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1592">I can tell you, I went in Israel, I have -- I found family in Israel, and I was very happy.</span> <span id="s1593">Whenever I went there, I was very, very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Did you feel differently Jewish, in a certain way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: No.</span> <span id="s1596">Absolutely no.</span> <span id="s1597">My cousins, and my aunt, they’re not Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1598">They are Jewish, they -- they -- they -- they have their religion, they go to temple, and everything else, they have the Passover.</span> <span id="s1599">In fact, one day I was there on Passover one time, and mostly I stayed in a hotel, I stayed with my cousin Leah.</span> <span id="s1600">And my -- my uncle died first, then I -- they were well-to-do people, they have a -- they had a electric factory, and so on.</span> <span id="s1601">My cousin Leah’s husband had a garage.</span> <span id="s1602">So there was no problems of any kind, and they were very happy to come here, and I was very happy to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1603">And most of it was the gathering of the survivors in Israel that Benjamin Meet arranged.</span> <span id="s1604">I went to Yad Vashem, and one year -- see, my mother-in-law died.</span> <span id="s1605">She was brought out of the Hungarian club into Israel, and they gave a big, big deal for her, but she didn’t have time.</span> <span id="s1606">She was honored here in ’68 with some trees in Israel.</span> <span id="s1607">W-We put in Putnam.</span> <span id="s1608">I have a big citation for her.</span> <span id="s1609">Like I said, I don’t take citation all over the place.</span> <span id="s1610">And then I went -- then I went in ’85, and I insisted -- because they knew me in Yad Vashem arad, and ev -- a-and sh-show me -- everybody knows me -- knew me, and so I say -- I insisted that I want the tree already planted.</span> <span id="s1611">So they went through the books, and they found it, and the tree was planted with two other people from Holland, at the same time.</span> <span id="s1612">And it looks down on the fallen soldiers, from the mountain.</span> <span id="s1613">I haven’t seen it since, I’m sorry to tell you that.</span> <span id="s1614">But one of these days, maybe if we’re still alright, and Cornelius is alright, we’ll take a trip and go over and see the tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: [indecipherable] Yad Vashem in Jerusalem have a different -- it -- is it -- is it different for you than the othen -- other museums that you know in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: Yad Vashem is the most important museum, because it was first built in jer -- in jer -- it’s built in Jerusalem, in our -- you see, everybody has a background, except us Jews.</span> <span id="s1617">One comes from Poland, one comes from Lithuania, one comes -- but now they have a country, okay?</span> <span id="s1618">We always had a country, it was always the Jewish country, Israel, the country of the Jews, but we have a country, and in that country was the first Holocaust museum built.</span> <span id="s1619">And then there is another one, the -- I forgot the name of it, it’s in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1620">Loch -- Loch hamma cut tahowt.</span> <span id="s1621">It’s a more partisan, and so on.</span> <span id="s1622">I helped with that one, too.</span> <span id="s1623">And Dr. Kulka -- I told you, Dr. Harry Kulka took me through the museum, then he took me to the University of Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1624">And I was from ORT, I -- from the first gold pins, I had, and from the first people on the -- in Tel Aviv, I -- University of Engineering is our name on it, mine and Cornelius’.</span> <span id="s1625">I -- I don’t go there very often now, and many places.</span> <span id="s1626">I don’t even fly to Las Vegas to my son, he comes here, cause it’s very hard on my ankle, it formed arthritis.</span> <span id="s1627">So when I went to Washington, I went on crutches, the first time to be taped, not the first time to Washington, because I was there.</span> <span id="s1628">I have pictures on Washington when it still say be careful, and they just had the bottom built, you know.</span> <span id="s1629">And then we ha -- I have the hard hat.</span> <span id="s1630">Here is a little thing there -- right there, pick it up, next to the lake is the Washington museum, right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: It’s on this one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: That was given to me, yes.</span> <span id="s1633">You can read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: Well that’s -- that’s a little model with a plaque that says, US Holocaust Memorial Museum, a campaign to remember Marsha Loen, and it shows the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: Yes, and it’s -- I put on -- on -- what is that called, that hard stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Oh, I’m not very good at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Granite, granite.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: Granite.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: Oh, it’s real granite?</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: It’s real granite, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: Very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: That was given by -- by af -- to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: I’ll put it back a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: That’s alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: I have, of course, always one more question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Which events in this country, in -- in the -- in -- in the USA, in America over the years have been really important to you?</span> <span id="s1649">And they don’t have to be necessarily related to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1650">Any movement, any event -- political event?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: First place, the Fourth of July, the independence of America, because the independence of Israel is very important to me.</span> <span id="s1652">So there is a connection, why I love that holiday so much.</span> <span id="s1653">The second one, I can tell you that’s not connected with the -- is the Bill of Rights, because everybody is created equal.</span> <span id="s1654">Cause if I don’t think like that, who should?</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: I don’t think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: Oh, of course, I like all the holiday.</span> <span id="s1657">I like the turkey on Thanksgiving, like I like my matzo balls on Passover, my turkey has to be done on Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s1658">You understand what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Yeah, I guess I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: I’m very traditional.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: I don’t have to ask you whether the women’s movement was very meaningful to you, because you li --</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: No, absolutely not, absolutely not, because I’ll tell you something.</span> <span id="s1663">It’s important for people that the woman should have a voice.</span> <span id="s1664">It’s important, any person.</span> <span id="s1665">I don’t care if it’s woman, half man, half woman, whatever it is, should have a voice in the country, because it’s a democratic country.</span> <span id="s1666">It’s a country built by -- it’s -- it’s a melting pot.</span> <span id="s1667">You understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s1668">So it’s important that the mo -- women movement, but an effect on me, not.</span> <span id="s1669">What has a tremendous effect on me is that the second generation is interested in the Holocaust, and especially Dr. Gary Shiller, that is the president of the second generation.</span> <span id="s1670">I admire him tremendously, and I hope he’s our next chair of the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Why do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: Because the second generation should take over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: You know, that was another question that I had.</span> <span id="s1674">How do you see the impact of the Holocaust survivor testimonies, on the overall Holocaust consciousness memory in this country?</span> <span id="s1675">A: I think it’s a good idea.</span> <span id="s1676">I don’t think it should be pushed down anybody’s throat, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1677">If somebody wants to know about the Holocaust, they should be able to -- going in -- like in the Washington, the learning center, and push a button, and know what went on.</span> <span id="s1678">If somebody wants to bring their school out to the museums, wond -- that is the most wonderful thing in the world.</span> <span id="s1679">If somebody -- if you have teacher training like we have in the museum every year, a teacher training, and we do it with different agencies, like the ADL, the labor committee, the American Bureau of Jewish Education, we do it together, and that is very important.</span> <span id="s1680">Teacher training, so the teacher knew, when it comes to history, that, like the Spanish Inquisition, and the Crusaders, this also has to be told in history, because it happened, and it happened to a people, and for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s1681">And it’s good for the people in America to know it, because like I said, it’s such a melting pot, that the people should get along together properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: What would you say to some of those people who think that there is now a little too much emphasis maybe, on Holocaust education, to the detriment of other elements of Jewish culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: I would tell them, like you g -- like the Jews go on Yom Kippur to temple, and pray.</span> <span id="s1684">That happened 2,000 years ago.</span> <span id="s1685">This only happened 50 some odd years ago, and believe me, much, much more that happened on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1686">And I think the Yom HaShoah is the most important thing, for any religion, or any people.</span> <span id="s1687">It’s important for us Jews, but a lot of people should come and see it, and hear it.</span> <span id="s1688">Because this is like going to temple on -- on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1689">This happened 2,000 years ago, but it’s still the tradition, and we still do it.</span> <span id="s1690">And people stand in line to get tickets to go to it.</span> <span id="s1691">But the Yom HaShoah only happened 56 years ago, and six million of our people were killed.</span> <span id="s1692">And that is -- that is our yom -- that is my Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1693">Do you know in the beginning, before the survivors start dying off, I was jealous of a funeral, I told you on the tape.</span> <span id="s1694">You know.</span> <span id="s1695">And now, I’m afraid to go to funerals.</span> <span id="s1696">I’m afraid to pick up the telephone, because the survivors are going so fast.</span> <span id="s1697">And that why the testimony is so important, it’s very important, that it shouldn’t be forgotten.</span> <span id="s1698">Look at what happened to the Spanish Inquisition.</span> <span id="s1699">What do you read in the dictionary?</span> <span id="s1700">A date, a time, what happened, and finished with.</span> <span id="s1701">Are there books on it?</span> <span id="s1702">Not many.</span> <span id="s1703">And look at what happened, and it’s practically forgotten.</span> <span id="s1704">This will never be forgotten, as long as I can help it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: How do you feel about the movies that have come out, let’s say since the late 70’s, where th-the pop -- the popular culture representation of the Holocaust is -- how do you put it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: Sometimes it’s overdone, and sometime it’s not true.</span> <span id="s1707">The “Schindler List,” is the one that is the closest, and still it’s still a movie.</span> <span id="s1708">Let’s not kid ourself.</span> <span id="s1709">The best one that I ever saw was last month, “The Shoah,” because it was interviews.</span> <span id="s1710">And you see what interviews can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: In the hands of a master.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Of a master is right.</span> <span id="s1713">And there’s the -- you still see those little pieces of anti-Semitism was flying in the background, but people don’t notice it, and -- certain people notice.</span> <span id="s1714">And I think he did the best that ever was, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1715">Spielberg was alright, I fainted, I went to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1716">I -- I never fainted in my life, but I -- all of a sudden I had to run to the bathroom and throw up.</span> <span id="s1717">But I came back -- because I was the volu -- Los Angel -- Valley Times ask me I should get about three or four survivors at the opening of “Schindler’s List,” and then the lady interviewed us, the reporter, and I did, and I watched it, and I never watched it again.</span> <span id="s1718">But I did interview survivors, and I’ve learned a lot from survivors by interviewing them, the 110 survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: I want to follow up on that, but let me ask you, what was the most difficult thing for you to watch in the “Schindler’s List” movie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: When they carried those children on the carts.</span> <span id="s1721">This is when I row -- run out and throw up, because I’m sure my little sisters was carried somewhere on a cart, or disappeared somewhere, somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: And -- and what are --</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: The shooting, and everything else, I’ve seen it.</span> <span id="s1724">I’ve -- I -- I -- I went through it.</span> <span id="s1725">You understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s1726">You have to ask that from an American.</span> <span id="s1727">You understand, Regina?</span> <span id="s1728">But I personally, when the children on the cart, when they were carrying in that camp, this is what I couldn’t take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Are there still some images and sounds, or so -- or memories that -- that -- that follow you to -- to this day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1731">My mother yelling to me, if you survive, Myashinka, go to Palestine, and find Soatsky.</span> <span id="s1732">And that was my aunt in Israel, Sarah.</span> <span id="s1733">And also another thing is when they separate me, the man and the woman, when they brought us to Stutthof in cattle cars, and they separated the man and the women, send my father to Dachau, and my mother and me and the kids to Stutthof, and my father was yelling, “Give us the poison tablets, give us the poison tablets.</span> <span id="s1734">You don’t want that.”</span> <span id="s1735">And my mothers said, “No.</span> <span id="s1736">Even if a finger is left alive, I am going where the Jewish people are going.”</span> <span id="s1737">But let that end on a real happy thought.</span> <span id="s1738">I’m an old lady now, I work.</span> <span id="s1739">You see we live a pretty normal life, pretty American.</span> <span id="s1740">My accent I couldn’t get rid of, I went for speech therapy, I couldn’t get rid of it, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1741">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: I like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1744">I don’t, but I can’t help it.</span> <span id="s1745">And you see, I have a s-son, that goes -- you heard him go already twice since you are here.</span> <span id="s1746">He lives in Las Vegas, he has his own life to live.</span> <span id="s1747">And he comes -- is coming out now on my birthday, on the 28th, cause I can not drive and fly by plane.</span> <span id="s1748">And then, I don’t like Las Vegas, it’s too l -- noisy, and too much things.</span> <span id="s1749">Last time I went to Las Vegas two years ago on Thanksgiving, and he had a stomachache.</span> <span id="s1750">We were supposed to go out for Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s1751">So now I said forget it.</span> <span id="s1752">If I want to play cards, I go to one of the casinos, and that’s all -- they’re here in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1753">I don’t have to go and see those -- that they spend thousand -- there’s so many thousands of homeless people lying around the streets all over America, and they’re building millions and millions of dollars hotels in Las Vegas.</span> <span id="s1754">Not that we don’t need it, we need that too, but there is a limit to everything.</span> <span id="s1755">Yesterday I went shopping.</span> <span id="s1756">There were standing people, and collecting for AIDS, near Juan’s.</span> <span id="s1757">So I sent Cornelius in to get canned food for them.</span> <span id="s1758">And I tried to give as much as I can.</span> <span id="s1759">When I had the money, everybody got.</span> <span id="s1760">But now I try to give as much as I can.</span> <span id="s1761">In fact, somebody told me I’m too generous.</span> <span id="s1762">Because when I drive by in the morning, I drive by a bakery that has bagels, and I had on a -- a -- a department in the federation, they used that I bring them bagels and cream cheese in the morning, for the department.</span> <span id="s1763">So if -- if I can -- now we are separated, the federation and the museum, and in different places till the building is redone.</span> <span id="s1764">So now I have to wait till somebody comes to pick it up, or I run over and take it over.</span> <span id="s1765">And this is my biggest pleasure, even if it costs me money, that I work, and it comes to me very hard.</span> <span id="s1766">But this is my pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: I have one more question, but let’s stick with pleasures then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: [indecipherable] what -- what else gives you pleasure?</span> <span id="s1770">What --</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: What gives me pleasure?</span> <span id="s1772">Like I told you, I had my studio, and I did a lot of knitting, so I do that a little bit, and it gives me pleasure to go to art show, museums.</span> <span id="s1773">And it give me pleasure to -- do you know what I like to watch?</span> <span id="s1774">This is the craziest thing, the classic movies, the old movies.</span> <span id="s1775">Isn’t that ec -- that relaxes me.</span> <span id="s1776">And after reading a Holocaust book, or something else, I buy myself a little romance book, to relax me.</span> <span id="s1777">So I lay down in bed, and Cornelius watches television downstairs, and I read that -- and I go from the first page, to the middle, to the last page, to know what the ending is.</span> <span id="s1778">And that relaxes me, and I fall asleep with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: That’s -- that’s fast reading.</span> <span id="s1780">My last question actually is you mentioned before that you learned from the Holocaust survivors a lot.</span> <span id="s1781">Think -- think about a few examples.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: An example is that I learned that they are -- some are very, very -- how do you say it -- how do -- l -- say -- some are very depressed, and very down, and you have to be around them, but it happens very seldom to pick them up.</span> <span id="s1783">I also learned that when I go to a party, they dress like young girls, 70 and 75 year old women.</span> <span id="s1784">They want to stay forever young, because they never had a childhood.</span> <span id="s1785">And they never had, really, a young life, because they had to work, and bring up a family, and everything else.</span> <span id="s1786">To me, being a designer, it hurts my eyes.</span> <span id="s1787">But I know what they feel, psychologically.</span> <span id="s1788">The third thing is what bothers me tremendously is that the survivor money is handled by Americans.</span> <span id="s1789">And that hurts very badly, because there is a lot of survivors, and needy survivors still alive.</span> <span id="s1790">I get -- I got a call from a 91 year old woman that has nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1791">A survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Because of the so -- it takes -- it takes them too long to process it, or that it’s not enough --</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: No, it’s not enough.</span> <span id="s1794">What -- what can she do, a woman, she’s 91 years old, she needs some help.</span> <span id="s1795">She needs somebody to help her, or be put in a home.</span> <span id="s1796">Or when a survivor goes into a state home, and there is millions of dollars in -- in New York.</span> <span id="s1797">A survivor should never, after what they went through, stay in a state home, should be treated completely different.</span> <span id="s1798">Not because he’s a survivor, and he’s something special.</span> <span id="s1799">He should have -- his end should be easy on that person, if it’s a man or woman.</span> <span id="s1800">Maybe I’m wrong, maybe I am expecting too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: But how -- how --</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: Like we’re getting the money from Switzerland, and it’s going on education, it’s going on everything else.</span> <span id="s1803">But they don’t remember when they tore my earrings off my ear.</span> <span id="s1804">And my little ring that my grandfather gave me to get away.</span> <span id="s1805">And I didn’t want to give it, and my mother said, “Give it to them, give it to them.”</span> <span id="s1806">They don’t remember when they told us if you don’t bring in your goods, plus your ironing, plus our electrical appliances.</span> <span id="s1807">Not only the gold, and the silver, and the platinum, the electric appliance and everything, you’ll be shot.</span> <span id="s1808">Everybody’s forgotten that.</span> <span id="s1809">And they say that the Jews are greedy, because we -- we -- we -- we ask what is belonging to us, that’s coming to us.</span> <span id="s1810">They haven’t seen nothing from it yet.</span> <span id="s1811">Not for me.</span> <span id="s1812">I need it, too, believe me I do.</span> <span id="s1813">Driving every day over the canyon to go to work, and then have to listen to a lot of things that I -- I am very ve -- get very upset, and I come home, and I get sick.</span> <span id="s1814">Not from the Holocaust, that I am told, from my superiors.</span> <span id="s1815">You understand?</span> <span id="s1816">It’s not easy on me, but I needed work, and I have to stay.</span> <span id="s1817">Don’t you think it would help me if I had some money, what was taken away from me?</span> <span id="s1818">And -- and I help.</span> <span id="s1819">I am on -- I am on the council, I am the treasurer of the council.</span> <span id="s1820">Today was supposed to be a meeting in my house, we’re honoring a survivor that’s going to be 90 years old.</span> <span id="s1821">We honored Latka and Benjamin Meet in -- in 1991.</span> <span id="s1822">We -- we do a lot of vienna poldi, fill a page for doing “Schindler’s List.”</span> <span id="s1823">The council is very important, we are involved with the money to distribute for the needy survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: Well, on that note, I think unless you have something -- I would like to complete the interview, unless you have something, a last word that you would like to say, otherwise I just would like to thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: I want to thank the people -- can I know their name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: Please?</span> <span id="s1827">Oh, you mean the -- Jeff and Toby Herr.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1829">Where is it -- sit -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1830">I would like to thank very much Mr. Jeff and Toby Herr for doing the grant for the interview, or whatever they did to get that interview going, because that will be a step stone in the museum, and for children to learn about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1831">So -- and thank you, Regina, very much for coming and interviewing me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: It was a privilege.</span> <span id="s1833">Thank you very much, Marsha.</span> <span id="s1834">And now I have to do just -- and this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marsh Loen, and this is the end of tape three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">End of Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00 PAGE
