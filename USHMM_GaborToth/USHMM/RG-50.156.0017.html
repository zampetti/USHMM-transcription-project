id="s5">My Hebrew name is Mordechai.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: I was born in Radauti.</span> <span id="s8">This is in Romania in the province of Suceava.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: What were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My father’s name was Samuel.</span> <span id="s13">My mother’s Enid.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Your grandparents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: My grandparents’ names: my father’s parents were Zelig and Rachel Goodman.</span> <span id="s16">And my maternal grandparents were Rabbi Joseph and Sarah Karp.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And were they all from the same town that you were born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: They were all from the same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: How about your great-grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I trace my tree back to the 17th century, and my ancestors came to the town of Radauti in 1718.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: What kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: My father was a merchant.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And your mother worked in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: My mother was, yes, a housewife.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yiddish, German and Romanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Would you say your family was secular, or religious in practice or orientation?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: I would say they were religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Were they observant, religious, Zionists or Hasidic?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: They were of Hasidic ancestry, but they were just religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Did you receive any formal Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Yes, I went to Jewish schools till I was about 15 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Would that have been like a heder?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: No, a private school.</span> <span id="s35">I attended high school.</span> <span id="s36">I had no time for heder; therefore, my parents hired private teachers, and I got a Jewish education at home, daily at least an hour, till I was age 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: What events, local, national, international, were you aware of from the mid-1930’s to 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Well, you must understand that, in Romania, Jews were never considered as nationals.</span> <span id="s39">Although they were citizens, they were also considered foreigners.</span> <span id="s40">Therefore, I just grew up with that knowledge that, although I live in Romania, and although I get a Romanian education, and although my parents, my grandparents, and all my ancestors lived in that part of the country for so many hundreds of years, I am still considered a foreigner.</span> <span id="s41">In the 1930’s, Romania got more and more under the influence of Germany and Italy, especially after 1938.</span> <span id="s42">And knowing what was going on in Germany, we foresaw that we are heading towards a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: 1939.</span> <span id="s44">How old would you have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: In 1939, I was 16 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: So you would have been old enough to see newspapers, or listen to the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s48">I read newspapers when I was ten years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: So do you remember anything that you saw in the newspapers or heard on the radio, or any of that news?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Well, there were all kinds of newspapers in Romania.</span> <span id="s51">Most of them were right wing.</span> <span id="s52">It was a right wing kind of place.</span> <span id="s53">The Iron Guard, an extreme right wing, fascist organization, I think the newspaper was Bon Misterre in Romanian.</span> <span id="s54">The newspaper of the Kuzist Party, an anti-Semitic party, Unkahrame was the name.</span> <span id="s55">And then there were Jewish newspapers around, who actually warned the Jewish population what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Do you remember exactly what they said, what kind of things they were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Well, first of all, the theme of the Romanian anti-Semitic paper, was that the Jews have to leave the country.</span> <span id="s58">This was the theme.</span> <span id="s59">Jewish newspapers dealt with the same problem.</span> <span id="s60">I was aware what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s61">Remember, in 1938, Germany did not start to exterminate Jews.</span> <span id="s62">They just started to persecute Jews.</span> <span id="s63">We never expected that we will be exterminated, but we were afraid that we will be deprived of our rights, of our property, and we will have to leave the country sooner or later.</span> <span id="s64">I went to high school.</span> <span id="s65">There were not too many Jewish students in this school.</span> <span id="s66">I was never accepted in the Romanian group.</span> <span id="s67">The Jewish students were always apart, they never mixed, never were brought in, especially after 1935, ’36.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: So when you read these articles in these newspapers, whether they were the right wing or whether they were the Jewish newspapers, was there any discussion among you or your friends, or your family, people in the Jewish community, about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Well, the community, the Jewish community, was just afraid, you know.</span> <span id="s70">People used to hope that things will get better, will change, because there were ups and downs in Romanian history, always.</span> <span id="s71">People discussed emigrating.</span> <span id="s72">They were looking for possibilities to emigrate.</span> <span id="s73">There were not too many doors open, if you remember, in 1930.</span> <span id="s74">Although my father, for instance, had family in the United States and in Canada, it was a problem.</span> <span id="s75">First of all, he was not ready to leave, you know, it’s hard to leave.</span> <span id="s76">Secondly, I think it was also a problem getting a visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: In what setting or settings did you have contact with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Well, when I went to high school in the 1930’s.</span> <span id="s79">We did have neighbors.</span> <span id="s80">We were friendly with them, but we were never close friends.</span> <span id="s81">Jews tried to keep separate, not because they wanted to, I believe, but because they felt that this is the way it has to be.</span> <span id="s82">It was also that the Jews were never integrated into, really, the society.</span> <span id="s83">Whether they were not accepted, or whether this was a thing they inherited from the past – the segregation – I don’t know, but this was a fact in the 1930’s.</span> <span id="s84">It was that shtetl mentality, actually.</span> <span id="s85">It was a small city, 6,000 Jews within a population of about 60,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: What’s “shtetl?”</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Shtetl is the autonomous Jewish community in Eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Did your family do business with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s90">My father dealt in agricultural products – grain, hay – most of his dealings were with gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Did you ever have gentiles in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes, we always had servants, one, sometimes two.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: You talked about the anti-Semitism in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s94">Before the outbreak of the war, did you have any encounters, personally, with anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Well, in June of 1940, my father was thrown from a moving train by a band of the Iron Guard.</span> <span id="s96">He died six months later of his wounds.</span> <span id="s97">This was something very common in that year, at that time.</span> <span id="s98">It was a time when part of Romania was occupied by Russia.</span> <span id="s99">They blamed the Jews for betraying Romania.</span> <span id="s100">I don’t know how the Jews “betrayed” them, but the Jews were the scapegoats.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: this is not totally related to the previous questions, but to get some idea of where your family was, did you have relatives living outside of your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Not close relatives, no.</span> <span id="s103">My father’s father left the city in 1913 for Canada.</span> <span id="s104">And all his family followed – his brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s105">My maternal grandparents lived in the same city, as I told you before.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: The ones that lived outside of the city, even though they weren’t close relatives, what happened to them and when?</span> <span id="s107">Were they killed in the Holocaust, or escaped to another country?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Well, I had relatives who were killed in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s109">I had relatives who escaped.</span> <span id="s110">Not too many.</span> <span id="s111">My father’s family started leaving in 1913, the rest of the family in 1920, but in the 1930s, nobody from our family left.</span> <span id="s112">They were all caught and sent to camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: This is a bit of a shift, but did any of your family ever serve in the military in Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s115">My father was in the reserves.</span> <span id="s116">He was an officer in the Austrian army.</span> <span id="s117">I should mention that our province was part of Austria until 1918.</span> <span id="s118">In 1918, it became part of Romania.</span> <span id="s119">So he served in the Romanian reserves.</span> <span id="s120">All my relatives were actually in the Romanian army as privates.</span> <span id="s121">Romania had a conscript army, so whoever attained the age of 21 had to serve.</span> <span id="s122">I was 17 when I was deported.</span> <span id="s123">That was before my time.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: How did you receive news of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Well, we had radio, so we knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s126">We were not isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Do you remember where you were at the time that you heard that the war had broken out?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Well the war in 1939 broke out in Poland.</span> <span id="s129">Radauti was close to the Polish border, and a couple of weeks after the war broke out, Polish refugees started to go through our city --officers.</span> <span id="s130">It’s a very interesting thing, what I remember, and it happened in our house.</span> <span id="s131">Polish officers, refugees, people without a country anymore, who fled their country, came in Romania, were given shelter in our city – temporary shelter.</span> <span id="s132">And a committee was formed, a committee of citizens – not a Jewish committee – they went from house to house and asked who would like to accept Polish officers for a short stay.</span> <span id="s133">So we said, “We will accept.”</span> <span id="s134">We had a big house, about six rooms.</span> <span id="s135">Two Polish officers came, and they saw a mezuzah on the home, and they refused to come in!</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: What was the reaction of the Jewish community in which you lived when the war broke out between Poland and Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Well, nobody expected that the Jews would be exterminated in Poland.</span> <span id="s138">They knew that Polish Jews, while they didn’t have it good under the Polish government, they will be worse off under the Germans.</span> <span id="s139">But we were hoping that the war will not reach us.</span> <span id="s140">That’s all we could do.</span> <span id="s141">In 1940, was the first year that Jews were excluded from public schools in Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">We had a lot of Jewish refugees in our city, because all the Jews who lived in villages, in rural country, had to leave when the anti-Jewish laws started going to work in Romania.</span> <span id="s143">As a matter of fact, we had a couple of families staying in our home who had fled, who had to leave their homes.</span> <span id="s144">I was a child, maybe 15, 16 years old, and didn’t grasp that the situation was as bad as maybe older people might have.</span> <span id="s145">But it was a kind of doom.</span> <span id="s146">People were afraid.</span> <span id="s147">They didn’t know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s148">Very insecure.</span> <span id="s149">And there was really no help.</span> <span id="s150">They had nowhere to turn to.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Did they meet?</span> <span id="s152">Get together at the temple, at the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s154">They didn’t have work to do, because whoever was not self-employed in a profession didn’t really have work to do.</span> <span id="s155">So I would say at least 50% of Jewish people were unemployed.</span> <span id="s156">I remember I, myself, going to synagogue in the morning, in the evening.</span> <span id="s157">They started in 1940 to – I don’t know why they did it – take, they say, “hostages,” and I was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">They used to take groups of a hundred Jews and keep ‘em separated in – I would say it was a prison – a private home.</span> <span id="s159">They were called “house hostages.”</span> <span id="s160">They had to feed themselves.</span> <span id="s161">In case Jews will attack gentiles, the hostages will be executed.</span> <span id="s162">It was kind of a ridiculous, foolish anti-Semitic thinking, that Jews will form armed plans to attack gentiles.</span> <span id="s163">Can you imagine anything like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Well, how did this happen?</span> <span id="s165">Who were the people?</span> <span id="s166">How did they take hostages?</span> <span id="s167">Was it the Romanian army?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No, it was the Romanian police who would come to a certain home and pick up people.</span> <span id="s169">They went by lists.</span> <span id="s170">And they came to my home.</span> <span id="s171">They had my name on the list, so they just picked me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Any of your other relatives or friends picked up too, or just you?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s174">It lasted for about two or three months.</span> <span id="s175">And they’d change hostages maybe every two weeks.</span> <span id="s176">It was just the beginning of persecution.</span> <span id="s177">They enacted anti-Semitic laws, and they didn’t know what to do with them, so this was one thing to harass Jews, to keep ‘em as hostages, to accuse ‘em that they were forming bands – they are planning to attack their gentile neighbors.</span> <span id="s178">And spreading the word between the gentiles, the Jews are ready to attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: When you were taken hostage, what time of day did they take you, and where did they take you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: It just happened.</span> <span id="s181">I don’t remember whether it was during the day or during the night.</span> <span id="s182">I think was during the day.</span> <span id="s183">They just used to pick up groups of 200 people, they would keep them for two weeks, and then they’d change ‘em for another 200 people.</span> <span id="s184">Nobody, to the best of my knowledge – and this was, as I said, in the spring of 1941 – nobody really was harmed.</span> <span id="s185">It was just, at least in our city – I don’t know whether it was national – it was just something to harass the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Well, were you pretty scared when they came to pick you up?</span> <span id="s187">You were very young then.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I was 16.</span> <span id="s189">I don’t think that I really was scared, because as I said, we did not believe that we’ll be harmed, at least not by the police.</span> <span id="s190">I really don’t know, but here I had the experience that my father was killed just a few months before.</span> <span id="s191">I would say he was killed by the Iron Guard and not by the police, but at the same time, the police were known as hitting.</span> <span id="s192">I wouldn’t say that I was happy about it.</span> <span id="s193">I just thought it was something that will just pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Violation of civil rights in Eastern Europe, I may be wrong, but wasn’t that pretty much the way things went?</span> <span id="s195">Had you grown up under that kind of an environment?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Look, Romania, by the Treaty of Versailles in 1918, they occupied some territories from the old Austro-Hungarian Empire.</span> <span id="s197">They were supposed to give all the citizens equal rights.</span> <span id="s198">Well, Jews got their equal rights just by name, they never got full equal rights.</span> <span id="s199">In Eastern Europe, there was always the concept that nationality is one thing and citizenship is another.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A man was of Romanian citizenship, of German nationality, and of Catholic religion, or you were a Romanian citizen of Jewish nationality and of Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s201">Jews were never – although they were Romanian citizens – considered as Romanian nationals.</span> <span id="s202">Most of them, especially the ones who lived in the new territories of Romania – this is Bukovina, Transylvania, and Bessarabia, territories acquired by the Romanians after 1918 – never considered themselves as Romanian nationals.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Like somewhere in the courthouse, was there a document saying “Max Goodman,” and then it listed what nationality he was, what religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: First of all there were separate offices for where you get your birth certificates, your death certificates.</span> <span id="s205">Jews had a separate office.</span> <span id="s206">If you wanted your birth certificate, you had to go to the Jewish office to get it.</span> <span id="s207">If you wanted a marriage certificate, you had to go to the Jewish office to get it.</span> <span id="s208">The Jewish community had a separate status.</span> <span id="s209">Jews were citizens by name, but as I said, they were never considered as full-fledged citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">This went back as long as Romania existed as a state.</span> <span id="s211">After 1918, Romania more or less was considered a democratic country with an elected Parliament, but the elections were always forged.</span> <span id="s212">It was really not a democracy.</span> <span id="s213">And Jews, although they had a few deputies in the Parliament, it never amounted to much.</span> <span id="s214">Romania had about a million Jews – about 18 million people, so it was about 6% Jewish population – but in some parts of the country, especially in the province I’m from, the urban population was about 30-35% Jewish.</span> <span id="s215">Most of the Jews were concentrated in cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: While you were being held a hostage, these other people, I assume they were all Jewish, weren’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Was there any talk among you as to possibly trying to escape from Romania, or what you would do after you were released from being a hostage?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s220">People, they didn’t know where to escape.</span> <span id="s221">Where should they go?</span> <span id="s222">Nobody wanted to let ‘em in.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: So then what was life like after you were released?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Well, life carried on, with every day new laws, anti-Jewish laws, anti-Jewish regulations, until October of the year 1941, when the Jewish population was deported en masse.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Now how does that date coincide with the Nazi occupation of Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: The Nazi influence started in 1938.</span> <span id="s227">Romania allied themselves to the Berlin-Rome Axis, I believe, in 1939.</span> <span id="s228">In 1941, the war against Russia broke out, with Romania a full-fledged ally of the Germans after they advanced into Russian territory.</span> <span id="s229">We were in Dniestre and there they were in Bug, adjacent to the Romanian province of Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s230">In October, 1941, they started to deport Jews of two provinces pp of the province of Bukovina, of the province of Transylvania – into Dniestre.</span> <span id="s231">About 200,000 Jews were deported en masse.</span> <span id="s232">The whole city, the whole population.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: This was on what day?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: From our city, it happened in October of ’41.</span> <span id="s235">In other cities, I have to explain to you what actually happened.</span> <span id="s236">Russia, in 1940, occupied the Romanian province of Bessarabia, half of the province of Bukovina, and a county of the Hoy who belonged to a third province, Moravia, and annexed it to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">In 1941, when the war broke out, Romania reoccupied these territories.</span> <span id="s238">The Jews in these territories were departed, starting with June of 1940, right after the war, while the Jews adjacent to these territories – and we happened to be the ones who were never occupied by Russian, but we were close to the Russian border – we were deported in October of 1941.</span> <span id="s239">The whole Jewish population of the city of Radauti.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: How was the deportation activated?</span> <span id="s241">And by whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: It was announced through publication, that all the Jews, starting with a certain date – and this was within four or five days, have to present themselves to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s243">They will be “recolonized,” they said, “resettled” in the territories of the East.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Who was “they?”</span> <span id="s245">Who was issuing the statement?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: The Romanian authorities.</span> <span id="s247">And I believe –as I say, I was then 17years old – I think groups formed.</span> <span id="s248">Families started to keep together.</span> <span id="s249">And they just took whatever they could on their backs, and came to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s250">In the railroad station, we were pushed into cattle wagons, about 100 people to a cattle wagon.</span> <span id="s251">The railroads in Europe are much narrower – much more than in the United States – and therefore the cattle wagons are much smaller.</span> <span id="s252">So about 100 people were pushed into these cars – these rail cars.</span> <span id="s253">We traveled about, I would say, a couple of days, and then we ended up at Dnestr, on the former border between Romania and Russia, and then just pushed over the bridge to Moghilev Podolsk, into Trans-Dnestria.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Probably half of them – we’re talking about 200,000 Jews – went trough Moghilev Podolsk, probably half of them through another point.</span> <span id="s255">Trans-Dnestria is a huge territory between the Dnestr and the Bug Rivers.</span> <span id="s256">This was the original plan, I assume, to resettle Romanian Jews into this territory, just the way the Germans planned to resettle, at that time, all Polish Jews into Lublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">The Final Solution was not decided on yet.</span> <span id="s258">They started to concentrate the Jews in ghettos.</span> <span id="s259">Romania had at that time about 800,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s260">I have to tell you that while Romania was reoccupying in 1941, the territories of Bukovina and Bessarabia in 1941, the Einsatzgruppe “D” operated in these territories, helped by the Romanian army, and killed about half of the Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">When Germany started the war against Russia, you see, they formed four groups who followed the army with the mission to kill Jews and Communists.</span> <span id="s262">These groups were called Einsatzgruppen.</span> <span id="s263">They were SS groups.</span> <span id="s264">“A” was in the north, “B,” “C” the middle, and “D” was in the south.</span> <span id="s265">We were fortunate to be in the path of Einsatzgruppe D.</span> <span id="s266">So following the armies who advanced into Russian territory, this Einsatzgruppe D started killing Jews in the territories they occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">No we were not occupied, if you remember.</span> <span id="s268">I’m talking about the Jews of the north, Bukovina and Bessarabia, who were occupied in, I think, 1940 by Russia, and reoccupied in 1941 by Romania.</span> <span id="s269">There two provinces had a Jewish population of about, I would say, 300,000, of which at least 150,000 were killed in the first few months of the war by the Einsatzgruppe D. So, after that, Romania decided that before we annex these territories, to deport first the Jews, whoever was left in Bessarabia, to Trans-Dniestria, and then followed by the Jews of the adjacent provinces, of adjacent counties, to these territories.</span> <span id="s270">And we followed them to Trans-Dniestria.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: What was life like for you in the ghettos, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Well, I was between the lucky ones, because I found, right away, work.</span> <span id="s273">I worked in a slaughterhouse.</span> <span id="s274">We had relatively good living quarters.</span> <span id="s275">We had a room, I would say, half the size of this living room – what would you say it is, about 15 by 20 feet?</span> <span id="s276">We had a kitchen next to it about half the size.</span> <span id="s277">And it had another little room about a fourth the size.</span> <span id="s278">And we lived there, 16 people.</span> <span id="s279">And this was considered as a good lodging.</span> <span id="s280">As I said, I worked in a slaughterhouse, and I worked there almost three years.</span> <span id="s281">So at least I had enough meat.</span> <span id="s282">I kept my mother and my sister, who was younger than I, with me all the time.</span> <span id="s283">But, in that Ghetto Dzurin, who had about 4,000 Jews in 1941, about 2,000 survived till 1944.</span> <span id="s284">2,000 died, mostly of starvation.</span> <span id="s285">People were sent from the ghetto to work in labor camps under Germans, and never returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: How about your relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Most of my relatives were sent to labor camps.</span> <span id="s288">Most never returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Well, what other recollections do you have of the ghettos that we haven’t covered here?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: As I told you, I worked in a slaughterhouse.</span> <span id="s291">We used to open, in the morning, the doors, we used to clean the place.</span> <span id="s292">By cleaning, it means we threw out everything, little pieces of meat, pieces of bones, you know, pieces of skin.</span> <span id="s293">In front of the doors, every morning, 200 to 300 people gathered to get some of these remnants, of these leftovers.</span> <span id="s294">They were just thrown out, and then people started to fight like dogs over these pieces.</span> <span id="s295">It’s unbelievable what people will do when they are hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">And this was life.</span> <span id="s297">A Romanian ghetto was different than a German camp.</span> <span id="s298">The government did not provide food for us.</span> <span id="s299">It was the Jewish community left in Romania who provided us with whatever they could, and half of what they sent never arrived.</span> <span id="s300">Fortunately, people, if they could take along only what they could carry, they took along the best they had.</span> <span id="s301">At least in our ghetto, once a week, for two hours, Jews were allowed to cross the ghetto limits into an open marketplace.</span> <span id="s302">It was a barter with peasants, who used to bring some bread in exchange for a pair of socks, or 50 pounds of flour in exchange for a suit.</span> <span id="s303">And it’s amazing how ingenious these people in the ghetto were to provide merchandise for the peasants, and exchange them for food – whoever was lucky enough to bring along something.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">For some it lasted longer, for some it lasted less.</span> <span id="s305">The soup kitchens helped, but it was not enough food.</span> <span id="s306">As I said, half the population just starved to death.</span> <span id="s307">There are many things to remember.</span> <span id="s308">My God.</span> <span id="s309">There was these so-called “Aktions,” when the ghetto had to provide a certain amount of workers for German work.</span> <span id="s310">The ghetto had a Jewish militia, a Jewish police, and the Jewish police had to catch the Jews to turn ‘em over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s311">These Jews never returned.</span> <span id="s312">You never knew.</span> <span id="s313">There were rumors, “Tomorrow they’re going to round up people,” everybody tried to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">There were lists who’s going to go, but nobody was ready to go, so the police just caught whoever they could.</span> <span id="s315">It was the Jewish police together with the Ukrainian guards who went to the ghetto, because they had to deliver so many people, to find Jews in their hiding places and pull ‘em out, and turn ‘em over to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">You would go in the morning, you would see dead people laying in the street, who died overnight.</span> <span id="s317">And the people they were with – all they did, they just used to take them out from their homes or wherever they were, just put ‘em in the middle of the street, and then a pushcart used to go through and pick up these people and take them to their graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">People were so cramped together.</span> <span id="s319">In that whole city of 4,000 there was just one water pump, so there was no washing facilities.</span> <span id="s320">If you could wash, it wouldn’t have been so bad.</span> <span id="s321">During the summer, there was a river next by, and people used to go early in the morning, very early, because that river was actually outside the perimeter of the ghetto, just to take baths.</span> <span id="s322">People were killed there, because they were caught!</span> <span id="s323">Just because they went to take a bath!</span> <span id="s324">It’s unbelievable!</span> <span id="s325">Many times, when I think back, what I went through, I just wonder whether it is real!</span> <span id="s326">Or if it is just a dream!</span></p> <p><span id="s327">You start not to believe it anymore, yourself, what you went through, because it is so unreal.</span> <span id="s328">I remember, I was thirsty, when we were deported and the River Dnestr came by, it was fall, rainy, muddy, and I just drank that water from the river.</span> <span id="s329">I once got sick – dysentery – and because that common “hole” where you would relieve yourself was far from our home – here was no privacy – I decided it was too far for me to go, so I stopped eating.</span> <span id="s330">And I got so weak that I couldn’t even move anymore from my bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Then a relative came, and had with him some brandy made out of sugar beets.</span> <span id="s332">It was homemade brandy.</span> <span id="s333">Gave me some of that brandy, and I drank it and I felt better.</span> <span id="s334">And then he had some barley bread, hot barley bread, with pieces of broiled animal fat.</span> <span id="s335">So I ate that hot barley bread and little pieces of animal fat, and after two, three days, I got healthier.</span> <span id="s336">And I had a friend, a doctor, and I told him what I went through, and he said, “Well it would have killed you, but it cured you!”</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: What were the living conditions like where you lived?</span> <span id="s338">How many families?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Well, there were 16 people, mostly relatives, as I said, in probably 300 square feet.</span> <span id="s340">I had my bed at the entrance.</span> <span id="s341">It was a sack with some straw, and this was my bed for three-and-a-half years.</span> <span id="s342">And there I slept with an uncle of mine and a cousin of mine – three of us – just at the entrance.</span> <span id="s343">This was our portion of that living room.</span> <span id="s344">We had typhoid fever – this was going all the time, while we were there – I had it, and my mother had it, and my sister.</span> <span id="s345">We survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A doctor who took care of us did not survive.</span> <span id="s347">A lot of people died.</span> <span id="s348">There was no medication.</span> <span id="s349">There was a hospital.</span> <span id="s350">It was a county hospital, intended for ten beds.</span> <span id="s351">They used to keep 100 people there.</span> <span id="s352">The sick people, the typhoid carried from other people, they went there, that some other people shouldn’t get sick.</span> <span id="s353">There were quite a few Jewish doctors; most of the doctors got infected and died, taking care of sick people.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: And all the people that were in that ghetto, they were all from your particular area?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: There were some indigenous Jews, Jews who lived there.</span> <span id="s356">Trans-Dniestria was a Pale of Settlement.</span> <span id="s357">There was a heavy Jewish population before.</span> <span id="s358">Most of them got killed before we got there, but some survived, and they were there with us, but most of the Jews were from the provinces of Bukovina and Bessarabia.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Were there any people in that ghetto that were not Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Not in the ghetto, no.</span> <span id="s361">The ghetto was Jewish.</span> <span id="s362">In the surroundings of the ghetto there were the gentiles.</span> <span id="s363">They were free.</span> <span id="s364">They were Ukrainian peasants, most of them anti-Jewish.</span> <span id="s365">I think the Romanians recruited a local Ukrainian police, young Ukrainians who grew up under the Soviet regime, and they were worse than the Romanians in dealing with the Jews.</span> <span id="s366">We preferred much more to deal with the Romanians than to deal with the Ukrainians, who were also occupied by Romanians, but they collaborated – especially when it came to persecute Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: So in your ghetto there weren’t any gypsies or Jehovah’s Witnesses or…</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: No, not to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s369">I don’t know about Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span> <span id="s370">There were gypsies in Dniestra, but not in our camp.</span> <span id="s371">I know it, because when we were liberated in 1944, on our way back home, with people who were all deported, with us were a lot of gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: You had contact with relatives and friends in the ghetto, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s374">There were people from our community, from back home.</span> <span id="s375">I had close relatives with us.</span> <span id="s376">My grandparents were with us, my mother was with us, my sister was with us.</span> <span id="s377">Within the ghetto you had free contact.</span> <span id="s378">It was not a big territory, you could communicate, you could discuss things, you could hide together if there was an action to get Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Were you able to get some news – and if so, how – about what was going on with the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: You were not permitted to have radios, but I believe that in the ghetto there were people who put together one or two radios.</span> <span id="s381">It was not public, you know, it was very hidden, they didn’t say.</span> <span id="s382">But word came through what was going on.</span> <span id="s383">Mostly what we were in is what was going on in the eastern front, because our hope was that the Russians would come and rescue us.</span> <span id="s384">While we were not aware that exterminations are going on in Poland, in Auschwitz, in Treblinka, whatever, we thought that there wouldn’t be soon help, we will just starve to death.</span> <span id="s385">In 1943, things started getting a little bit easier, in that more food came into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">And some of the people, the ones who were originally from the so-called “old” Romania, from the county of Lahoi, were permitted to return back to their city – about 2,000 people from about 15,000 – before the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s387">I found out here that it was through some connections between an American official, I think it was Ira Hirshman, who contacted, I believe, some delegate of the Romanian government in Ankara, who evidently discussed the situation of the Jews in Trans-Dniestria, and made it easier for us.</span> <span id="s388">But al that time, we were not aware of it.</span> <span id="s389">Whether it was so or not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s390">I would say if the Russians wouldn’t have come in the spring of 1944, would they have come in the fall of 1944, they wouldn’t have found one person alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: What thoughts did you give to your survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Well, I would say, first of all, luck.</span> <span id="s393">I was just lucky!</span> <span id="s394">I was just lucky that I found work, that I was healthy, and found work which kept me fed.</span> <span id="s395">That I survived illness.</span> <span id="s396">And that’s it!</span> <span id="s397">Maybe God’s will?</span> <span id="s398">That there were the Russians who saved us in time?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Were there German military or other kind of government personnel in or around the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: They were around, but not in.</span> <span id="s401">As I said, the ghetto was in territory administered by the Romanians.</span> <span id="s402">The war was going on, and Germans did construction work – especially on the Bug River in the northern part of the territory – and demanded a labor force from the ghettos.</span> <span id="s403">This is where the Romanian military police used to load up Jews from the ghettos and turn ‘em over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s404">And very few of these people ever returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Do you remember what branch of the German military?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: I think it was the Todt organization that was there.</span> <span id="s407">This was their labor branch?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Do you remember any of the names of the officers or any of the…</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: I never dealt directly with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: When were you liberated and by whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: It came in March of 1944.</span> <span id="s412">It was the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: What happened on that day?</span> <span id="s414">Do you remember the events – what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Well, days before, we saw the Germans.</span> <span id="s416">We were close to a main highway, I would say about two miles from that highway.</span> <span id="s417">The highway was high – we were in the valley – and we saw German troops going towards the west, day and night and day and night, for days and days.</span> <span id="s418">And suddenly, there was a lull, and there was nobody.</span> <span id="s419">And then Russians came in.</span> <span id="s420">And there were English and there were American jeeps, and they just liberated us.</span> <span id="s421">It was the Russian soldier, but he had the American armament.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">I mentioned that there were a few Jews who were originally from that ghetto who survived with us.</span> <span id="s423">There was an older man who survived.</span> <span id="s424">And his son, who was a captain in the Russian army, came with the first Russians who came into our ghetto, and found his father there!</span> <span id="s425">So he was happy, was with his father, and the whole ghetto gathered around that house, to see that Russian captain.</span> <span id="s426">After a while he emerged.</span> <span id="s427">He went up to his jeep, and said in Yiddish, “Be well, my fellow Jews.</span> <span id="s428">Next year we should meet in Jerusalem.”</span> <span id="s429">Now this was a Russian soldier!</span> <span id="s430">A Russian officer, who came with the Russian army to this ghetto!</span> <span id="s431">He was set up already with the Russians, and he saw that the future of the Jews is to go to Jerusalem!</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Next day we were bombed by the German army.</span> <span id="s433">They came back to bomb the ghetto, and quite a few people got killed.</span> <span id="s434">After we were liberated by the Russians a couple of airplanes just dropped bombs.</span> <span id="s435">People thought first it is the Russian air force, and they were happy, they made signs to them.</span> <span id="s436">And then the bombs start falling!</span> <span id="s437">So quite a few people got killed.</span> <span id="s438">This was the end of it.</span> <span id="s439">The ghettos were open, so you could move, you could get jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Young people were taken into the Russian army; we were not taken, because we were considered as Romanian by the Russians, as I told you, while other Jews who came from Bessarabia or from the northern part of Bukovina were considered as Russian citizens, and were taken into the army.</span> <span id="s441">People started moving home.</span> <span id="s442">The population, when we got home, was very friendly, because they thought that the Jews will be closer to the new regime who will set up in Romania, that there will be a change in government.</span> <span id="s443">They allied themselves with Russia, with the allies, started fighting Germany.</span> <span id="s444">So the Jews were accepted as full-fledged citizens right after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: When you say, “you”…When you say, “we”…You went back to your hometown.</span> <span id="s446">Then who was that?</span> <span id="s447">Who was the “we?”</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Whoever returned.</span> <span id="s449">To tell you who “we” are: There were 6,000 Jews living in Radauti, in my town, before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s450">Right after the war broke out, there were 3,000 refugees – Jews – who had to leave villages, came to Radauti.</span> <span id="s451">So about 9,000 were deported.</span> <span id="s452">Out of this 9,000, approximately 2,500 returned.</span> <span id="s453">This is the “we” – the people that returned from deportation.,</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: And you and how many in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: My family who returned was myself, my mother and my sister, Yolte.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q:; So did you talk about going to Palestine, or the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Well, I talked about going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s458">I was really active in Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s459">Than I went back to school.</span> <span id="s460">And then I got a job.</span> <span id="s461">And then I decided – it was very hard for me – to leave.</span> <span id="s462">In this particular time – we’re talking about 1947, 1948, right at the proclamation of the State of Israel – I felt, with all the so-called liberties which we were given by Romania right after the war, that there is no future for Jews in Romania, we’ll have to leave sooner or later, but I thought that we have time, it doesn’t have to be done right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">So first I went to school, and started earning some money.</span> <span id="s464">And then when we thought, maybe now is the time to go, there was no possibility.</span> <span id="s465">They had closed the borders.</span> <span id="s466">So when I decided to finally apply to leave the country, it was 1951.</span> <span id="s467">This was actually six years after we came back.</span> <span id="s468">And I didn’t get my exit papers then until 1958.</span> <span id="s469">It was seven years I didn’t get my papers!</span></p> <p><span id="s470">There were waves and waves of people who left Romania.</span> <span id="s471">They decided they’ll let people go, and then they stopped, and then they decided to let them go again, and then they stopped again.</span> <span id="s472">It was like Russia started to get more and more involved in Romanian affairs.</span> <span id="s473">It was just like the exit of Jews now from the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s474">In a certain year they would let ‘em go, and then all of a sudden they would stop, and in some cities they would give ‘em permits, and it some cities they wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s475">You never knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s476">But we left in 1958, in September, and we stopped in Vienna for about a year, and then we came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: What was it like when you were living in Romania after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Well, right after the war, Romania formed a democratic government.</span> <span id="s479">So between 1945 and 1948, there was freedom the way we would call freedom, today.</span> <span id="s480">We had freedom of speech and freedom of association.</span> <span id="s481">There was no discrimination against Jews.</span> <span id="s482">In 1948, the Communists came to power and started to introduce their type of freedom, with all their deprivation, not only against Jews, but against the whole population.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">There were prominent Communist leaders who were Jews.</span> <span id="s484">They didn’t consider themselves as Jews, but they couldn’t hide it.</span> <span id="s485">And therefore, Jews were not discriminated [against], and the non-Jews, knowing that Jews are involved in government, didn’t discriminate against Jews.</span> <span id="s486">But little by little, Jews were just pushed out.</span> <span id="s487">And a certain discrimination started.</span> <span id="s488">The Communists introduced passports for everybody.</span> <span id="s489">Passports were issued only to citizens, but you had to declare your nationality.</span> <span id="s490">There were not many nationalities in Romania.</span> <span id="s491">There were Romanians, Germans, Hungarians and Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">The government gave you the possibility to change your nationality.</span> <span id="s493">In other words, although you were a Jew, you could say, “Okay, I’m not any more a Jew.</span> <span id="s494">I see myself now as a Romanian national.”</span> <span id="s495">So you could change your nationality to say you’re not a Jew anymore, you’re a Romanian.</span> <span id="s496">Well, most of Romania’s Jews did not change their nationality.</span> <span id="s497">It started later, in the late 1960’s, discrimination against Jews who did not change their nationality – especially the Jews who applied for exit visas to Israel – because of the Communist mentality: whoever doesn’t want to be “with you” is “against you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Were there any organizations that helped you after the liberation?</span> <span id="s499">After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Well, materially, it was the Joint Distribution Committee who used to send parcels, and help.</span> <span id="s501">The Jewish community was organized.</span> <span id="s502">It was the Central Organization of Jewish Communities of Romania who organized social help and social assistance to invalids, sick people, to all the elderly.</span> <span id="s503">The remnant of this organization still exists in Romania.</span> <span id="s504">It’s now headed by the so-called Chief Rabbi of Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Do you keep in contact then, or do you get literature?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Once in a while I get some items.</span> <span id="s507">They’re the community Jews who left Romania much later than we did.</span> <span id="s508">And I get the Israeli newspapers, and they keep in contact with what is going on in the Old Country.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Do you maintain contact with others who were with you in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Well, I have some friends who are in Israel, and when I am in Israel, we have always a gathering.</span> <span id="s511">And there is nobody here who was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s512">My wife was also in a ghetto, but not in the same ghetto that I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: How did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: This was after the war.</span> <span id="s515">In Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: How did you come to the U.S. and to Minnesota?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: I had family here.</span> <span id="s518">As I told you before, my grandfather left Romania in 1913 for Canada.</span> <span id="s519">He went together with brothers and sisters of my father.</span> <span id="s520">I never knew him, because I was born after they left.</span> <span id="s521">They left Romania starting in 1913 to 1920.</span> <span id="s522">I was born in 1923.</span> <span id="s523">But when I came out of Romania and was in Vienna and didn’t know what I’m going to do, I got in touch with them, and it was their advice that I should come to the United States.</span> <span id="s524">And they happened to live in St. Paul, so I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: These were your uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: It was my father’s sisters, actually, who were already old people when I came here, but it was their children, cousins of mine.</span> <span id="s527">They were instrumental in bringing us here.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: You weren’t born when your grandfather left for Canada in 1913, but was there any discussion about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Let me tell you why he left.</span> <span id="s530">My grandparents had 16 children.</span> <span id="s531">From these 16 children, six died in infancy, and ten grew up to get married.</span> <span id="s532">He happened to have eight girls and two boys.</span> <span id="s533">My father was the oldest.</span> <span id="s534">He married off two of his daughters; he gave away as dowry, everything he had, so he had nothing left to marry off the other six girls.</span> <span id="s535">The only way to solve the problem was to leave the country, so he took his family and left for Canada.</span> <span id="s536">Now this was very typical of what was going on in the early 1900’s.</span> <span id="s537">This is the way most of the people left eastern Europe, because of material needs.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Can you tell me what it has meant to you to be a survivor of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: This is a good question.</span> <span id="s540">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s541">I survived; I’m alive.</span> <span id="s542">But whether it is worth living, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s543">Somebody said, “Until the minute of your death, you’re not able to judge if it was worth living.”</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: After your experience during the Holocaust, could you describe to me your general feelings about human nature, not-Jews and Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Well, I would say people were conditioned.</span> <span id="s546">You cannot blame the whole nation, German nation, because of what happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s547">You cannot blame the whole Polish nation, the whole Romanian nation.</span> <span id="s548">It is a small clique who came to power in these countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: We’re talking about Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Germany.</span> <span id="s551">One of their slogans was the Jews are to blame for everything bad what happened to Germany.</span> <span id="s552">Some did believe it, although some did not.</span> <span id="s553">Even the anti-Semites were not ready to go out and kill the Jews.</span> <span id="s554">They said, “Okay, we should maybe push ‘em out.</span> <span id="s555">We should take away something from them.”</span> <span id="s556">They were not ready to exterminate Jews, but it is like with a sick person.</span> <span id="s557">Somebody gets sick.</span> <span id="s558">Okay, this is a big shock, especially if he gets sick in a sudden way.</span> <span id="s559">“”He has cancer!”</span> <span id="s560">“Oh, that’s too bad!”</span> <span id="s561">Everybody cries.</span> <span id="s562">Then he advances in his illness and gets worse and worse and worse; he’s very sick, and when he dies, everybody says, “It is a blessing!”</span> <span id="s563">The same thing happened to Jews.</span> <span id="s564">They started to be persecuted.</span> <span id="s565">So it was maybe a shock for their non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s566">They didn’t accept it, they didn’t agree with it.</span> <span id="s567">But they then got used to the idea.</span> <span id="s568">And then it got worse and worse and worse, and then, when they started exterminating them, they maybe might have thought, “Okay, so it’s the best thing what can happen to them.</span> <span id="s569">At least they were not persecuted any more.”</span> <span id="s570">Just like the sick person who just died.</span> <span id="s571">It was a blessing, because he died.</span> <span id="s572">So this is the way I see the whole relationship.</span> <span id="s573">It was conditioned.</span> <span id="s574">Anti-Semitism was just dormant.</span> <span id="s575">It was never extinguished.</span> <span id="s576">It was always within the non-Jewish population, especially where there was a heavy Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Has your belief or practice in Judaism or a Supreme Being changed as a result of the Holocaust experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: No, I would say not.</span> <span id="s579">Just to give an example, after we were liberated, after the Russians came, there were some Jews in the ghetto who celebrated.</span> <span id="s580">But most of ‘em gathered together to a religious service, to say Kaddish for the people who died.</span> <span id="s581">We never accused God that we were deported.</span> <span id="s582">We accepted whatever was done to us.</span> <span id="s583">Religious life continued, at least in my surroundings.</span> <span id="s584">We never questioned the Holocaust the way it is questioned today.</span> <span id="s585">I’m talking about immediate, you know – why there, and then?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">I think it is more after the Holocaust, after the Holocaust became a science, with everybody studying, analyzing it, breaking it down to pieces, little bits, the question arose, “Okay, where was God at the time?”</span> <span id="s587">I didn’t become less religious, more religious, because of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s588">And I don’t blame God for what happened.</span> <span id="s589">Whatever happened, just happened to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Do you believe that the films or books about the Holocaust accurately depict it?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Oh, I have my doubts.</span> <span id="s592">They’re made for an audience, and they’re made to please the audience.</span> <span id="s593">You’re talking about the film, The Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Any that have come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: It is not done as a documentary.</span> <span id="s596">It is a moneymaker for who produces it, and it has whatever you have to put in a film to please the audience.</span> <span id="s597">For example, I saw Mila 18, from that famous novel about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s598">The defense of the Warsaw ghetto is, I believe, one of the most historical, most patriotic things what ever happened in Jewish history.</span> <span id="s599">It was a magic thing in Jewish history.</span> <span id="s600">So in Mila 18, half of the book deals with love, with things which had nothing to do, really, with the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s601">Just to please the reader, because this is what the reader would like to see, would like to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Would you be willing to share with us any photos, mementos, or other things for the purpose of exhibition or research related to that period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: I really don’t have any photos.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">END OF INTERVIEW</span></p></body></html>
