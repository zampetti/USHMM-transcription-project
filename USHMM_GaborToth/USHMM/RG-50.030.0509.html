on August the 28th, 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: And where exactly were you born in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: In a -- in a town outside [indecipherable] maybe 50 miles outside, maybe more, it’s Neunkirchen.</span> <span id="s18">I -- want me to spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s20">What -- what was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Preis, P-r-e-i-s.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And did you have any other names that you used during the war time?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: So, can you tell me a little bit about your parents, their names, and any siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: My mother’s name was Josephine, my father’s name was Berthold, my brother’s name was Ignatz.</span> <span id="s26">He never used the name, he hated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What name did he use?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: I -- he was called Bushy, that’s an Austrian expression, little boy.</span> <span id="s29">And so he never really used it, only on pape-- on documents and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And tell me a little bit about the personalities of the members of your family, your father, your mother, your brother.</span> <span id="s31">Tell -- give me a little picture of each one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: They were -- how shall I say it?</span> <span id="s33">In my -- in -- as -- as a child looking at them, just normal people, if [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s34">I really ca -- i-it’s very hard to say, you know, what -- because you’re looking at it as a child.</span> <span id="s35">They’re just ple -- nice, normal people.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: You know, a lot of siblings have naturally, you know, some kind of sibling rivalry.</span> <span id="s37">Did you get along very well with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: [indecipherable] I was, you know, sibling rivalry, I would y -- tease him.</span> <span id="s39">If I really wanted to hurt him I called him by his name.</span> <span id="s40">But that was about the extent of it, I mean, we didn’t -- one day he -- I locked him up in the room, an -- and he said he’s going to jump out the window and I said go ahead.</span> <span id="s41">But that’s not -- so anyway, we -- you know, there was really not -- he was four years younger than I am, and -- so there was not this much rivalry.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: And tell me more about your parents.</span> <span id="s43">Did they run a strict household, and also what kind of work did your father do and your mother, did she work?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: No, my mother didn’t, but my father was in the scrap metal and then he wheeled and dealed.</span> <span id="s45">I ca -- really, it’s very interesting that I cannot really remember, because I was very young.</span> <span id="s46">Was a normal child, not interested in anything but myself.</span> <span id="s47">And -- so it’s very difficult to say.</span> <span id="s48">I can’t really remember, you know, that it wa -- that something really would have impressed me, or interest me.</span> <span id="s49">All I was interested is having -- you know, playing and that’s it.</span> <span id="s50">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Were your parents strict at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yes, and no.</span> <span id="s53">You know, European parents, I mean, they would be going to jail here.</span> <span id="s54">But no, they -- it -- just a normal family life.</span> <span id="s55">My father -- when we lived in outs -- in Neunkirchen, my father commuted from Vienna for awhile, and then we moved.</span> <span id="s56">So -- but it was a nor -- it was a normal, average life, we can compare the middle class life to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Tell me a little bit about whatever memories you have of this first town that you were living in, where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: I remember playing with -- having a friend, which was very interesting.</span> <span id="s59">Then, of course, I had no clue whose -- all her brothers were in the par -- in the party, the Nazi party, had pictures up of Hitler and all.</span> <span id="s60">And here she was my playmate.</span> <span id="s61">I mean, we were four years old -- four or five years old, and I remember that, but otherwise -- and we were good friends, we’d -- she would come to my house, I’d go to her house.</span> <span id="s62">And that -- you know, the parents never said you can’t play with her or anything.</span> <span id="s63">And -- but I do remember the pictures because you know, it was something different with the -- the emblem, the colors and whatever else.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Was it something that made you uncomfortable in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: I couldn't really -- I mean, I noticed it, because you know, we knew what was going on in Germany, but Germany couldn’t be compared to Austria because in Germany the Jews, though they were persecuted, they were not to that extent.</span> <span id="s66">They still had a more or less, if you can call it normal life, existence.</span> <span id="s67">And that’s all they really [indecipherable] five si -- four or five years per -- no, five -- five, six maybe, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s68">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: So this is when you moved to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Vienna, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: So tell me about the transition, moving to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: What do you mean living together?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Oh, the transition, moving from this smaller town to -- to going to the big city of Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: No, it wasn’t that small a tow -- it was a city, but really not.</span> <span id="s75">Adjusted.</span> <span id="s76">You know, moved, adjusted.</span> <span id="s77">I was -- my parents -- I was taken care of.</span> <span id="s78">And what are children interested in, right?</span> <span id="s79">You make new friends.</span> <span id="s80">And we had family living in Vienna, broth -- my father’s brother was living in Vienna, and I had a cousin.</span> <span id="s81">So, you know, the transition wasn’t that great.</span> <span id="s82">You are in the same country, you are speaking the same language, so it doesn’t -- didn’t make this -- there wasn’t this great an impact.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Did you like living in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: What are some of your fonder memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Just -- I really -- a nor -- a very normal life until 1938, and I remember that.</span> <span id="s87">I was -- I happened to go to the movies, and this was Jeanette MacDonald, which is long before your time, and was May time and here the troops were marching in and they were -- the people were there with open ha -- hands and hearts to wo -- welcome them.</span> <span id="s88">And here I just loo -- you know, to me it was just a movement of troops.</span> <span id="s89">We knew there was something going on, but nobody really had a concept what will be ahead.</span> <span id="s90">Because everything was looked at from Germany, and the people who came from Germany.</span> <span id="s91">We happened to know -- my father happened to know somebody who came from Berlin, and the things -- the stories he told weren’t that hair raising, so we really -- it really became bad after the anschluss, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And that’s the day when you were at the movies, that you’re remembering?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Mm-hm, yeah.</span> <span id="s94">It was -- it was in May, I don’t remember the date, but I know it was in May of ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: And what did you associate with, you know, what came right after, or what did you think was starting to happen right after this?</span> <span id="s96">Did you know much?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Nobody -- nobody knew.</span> <span id="s98">Nobody had a concept.</span> <span id="s99">I mean, nobody could unders -- you know, nobody knew that na -- I mean, they were -- the Austrians welcomed the invasion, what they call invasion, with open arms, and there was -- I s -- I presume now, looking back, there was a lot of poverty, there was a lot -- there wi -- you know, people that didn’t have -- there was no work, so -- and the Austrians isn’t, by nature, are not very pri -- used to be -- not a very productive person.</span> <span id="s100">As long as they had three meals, or four meals, and didn’t have to extend themselves, that was their outlook in life.</span> <span id="s101">And so here they felt, you know, they were -- they were going to get something, because what did Hitler do?</span> <span id="s102">He took it from Peter, gave it to Paul.</span> <span id="s103">I mean, he took the businesses away, and so consequently the people suddenly became business owners, and started ye -- regardless if it had the ability or not, they started the middle class life, so to say, and were very happy with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: So if we could go back a little bit to -- prior to the anschluss --</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: -- just to get a little bit better picture of your home life.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: If you could give me just -- sort of set the scene and give like a physical description of your home as you recall it, in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, we had a -- we had -- we had a -- two, three bedroom apartment in -- on the third district, and it’s very hard to describe.</span> <span id="s110">It was just a normal apartment and a normal -- what you would call an American -- equal in to an American life.</span> <span id="s111">Not -- not -- I -- I really don’t know how to describe it to you.</span> <span id="s112">Just a very normal life, which abruptly ended, and we got notice that we were going to be relocated, that’s what the -- would be call -- and we knew when, and we were lo -- no, we were relocated in -- we -- into an apartment and we stayed there with another family and their daughter.</span> <span id="s113">It was really a storefront, an apart -- and a -- and a room, and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s114">And my mother, father, my brother and I lived in the storefront, and this other couple, who were very elderly and their daughter lived in the back.</span> <span id="s115">And this is how we started our new life, so to say, until we got notice that we’re going to be relocated, and at that point we all left.</span> <span id="s116">And my father happened to have a friend who was not Jewish, and who was an illegal member of the party, and he send him a postcard, and he said, if you need me, call me, I’m there.</span> <span id="s117">And my father called him.</span> <span id="s118">He -- he -- he became the director of the sanitarium.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Do you know his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Yeah, his name was Kittel, K-i-t-t-e-l.</span> <span id="s121">And his wife was esn -- his wife’s name was Mia, he -- his was Leo.</span> <span id="s122">And they -- I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s123">I was this -- I was the niece from the German speaking part of Czechoslovakia, from Barin.</span> <span id="s124">And I stayed with them for many, many months and my father and mother found a place, and for awhile my brother was with them, and then he moved with -- to Mariani and her husband.</span> <span id="s125">Mariani is a friend of ours, was a friend of my father’s, and her husband.</span> <span id="s126">And they ca -- when they had to vacate their apartment, they were going to be relocated so to speak, they came to us and they stay -- they stayed in the kitchen, and every time the chimney sweep would come, they had to get up and come into the -- come into our room and stay with us, because he came in the back, or the front, whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s127">And my br -- as I said, this is -- I’m mixing the whole thing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: So may -- so maybe we can get the chronology here.</span> <span id="s129">So the first time you moved from your original home in Vienna --</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: That was something you did not because of a -- a relocation order, or was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Right, I -- I ca -- you know what?</span> <span id="s133">I really don’t remember how it came about that we had to vacate, and we sold our -- the furniture and everything was sold, and we moved into this storefront.</span> <span id="s134">I don’t know how -- how the whole thing came to be, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: And what age are you about, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I was 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And so what year is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: [indecipherable] maybe I was -- I must have been older, about f-four -- maybe 14 -- 14 - 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: And was -- was this actually one of the first places where you were in hiding, or were you still living --</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: No, no, no, we ju -- we still lived a so-called normal existence.</span> <span id="s141">And we were there until ’41.</span> <span id="s142">I think we moved there in ’40 -- in ’40, and we were there in ’41, and then we were being re -- suppose -- relocated, and that’s when we went into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: What did you know, if anything, about the relocation order?</span> <span id="s144">Did you know anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: It -- it was all underground cr -- grapevine, so to speak, you know, you -- you heard, you know, people found out, they told you that this and this street will be next, so you were alerted to it by -- by people who knew, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: So it sounds like even before you got the actual order --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: No, no, no, no, you went before, you know, you had to go before.</span> <span id="s148">In fact, we had a superintendent who was very, very good to us, and Mariani and her husband stayed in her father’s apartment, and he gave them a little room to stay there, hiding.</span> <span id="s149">And the woman, the daughter of the people who lived in the same apartment as we did, went there to sleep every night, she had -- she -- he let her sleep next to him in his bed.</span> <span id="s150">I mean, when you think about it now, the situations were such, as I’m recounting them I can’t really believe it, because I’m telling it to you and I say, if people will listen to this, what will they think?</span> <span id="s151">So -- and then of course, when we got notice to leave, you know, that we were being picked up, or rounded up, or s -- we -- we left.</span> <span id="s152">And at one point we stayed, we -- we moved right in next door with Mariani and her husband, and when they came for us we could hear them through the wall, because they -- they came in and, you know, they were looking for us.</span> <span id="s153">And my brother had parakeets, h -- in the storefront window.</span> <span id="s154">And those birds -- you know, they came in and they made a lot of noise, of course, and those parakeets started to screech, and whatever.</span> <span id="s155">We could hear all this.</span> <span id="s156">And of course they were they -- you know, they realized that we left, we left everything but what we really needed, and went.</span> <span id="s157">And that was it.</span> <span id="s158">And wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: But you were just next door, and -- and somebody could have found you very easily?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Oh yeah, I mean they -- if they had no clue that we -- they would have never, ever thought that we would be -- there would be anybody next door.</span> <span id="s161">So -- it was an adjacent apartment, so -- and then of course we had to leave because people in the building wouldn’t -- knew us, and people in the neighborhood knew us, so we really had to vacate and find another place to stay.</span> <span id="s162">And then we just started traveling from place to place, whoever would take us, we would stay with, you know, whatever length of time we could.</span> <span id="s163">Because you had to be very careful, because if you stayed -- the law over there wa -- was or is that when you are -- I think it was a week, you had to go to police, and report that you are living there.</span> <span id="s164">So if anybody would have seen us, or -- or -- you know, for any length of time, that will be a tip off [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: So, if I have this correctly, that’s really when you first went into hiding --</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Hiding, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: -- and this is 1941, we think, and this is when you moved next door to the storefront --</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: -- that’s really the --</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: I mean, this is the -- we had no -- we had no -- we didn't know where we are going to be, and so this was the only place we could be for the -- for the day or two, or I -- I can’t remember how long we stayed there.</span> <span id="s171">It wasn’t long because it was one of those very small rooms, and so we really didn't know how long we’re going to be there, or wa -- we were there, we just -- my father found a place for me, and my brother then went with Mariani.</span> <span id="s172">And I can’t remem -- you know, they just -- he -- she took him and I went to this friend of my father’s and I stayed there.</span> <span id="s173">I stayed there for many, many months, and then I changed to other places, and eventually ended up with Mariani when they -- when -- because every so often I would leave, and then a couple months later come back to the same place.</span> <span id="s174">And that was really a -- you know, it was -- i -- you were never any length of time, so to speak.</span> <span id="s175">We had one very -- was a very weird thing, I don’t know how, when and where, I don’t remember that any more, but there was an SR man who took us in.</span> <span id="s176">In fact, he took Mariani, her husband, me, my brother, and we stayed there.</span> <span id="s177">And he had -- he had a party, and the woman who was living -- the -- the daughter of the people who were living there, went and she was -- she served -- she served them.</span> <span id="s178">And her name was Whittler, and she -- you know, she would walk in and she would say, heil Whittler.</span> <span id="s179">You know, she would name her -- you -- she would say her name.</span> <span id="s180">Nobody could understand.</span> <span id="s181">And here she was, she was -- wore a little -- she was a huge person, and she was a little outfit -- you know, one of those serving things, a little [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s182">I mean, those are the -- the funny -- the funny things, but we stayed there for a little while and his wife, for some reason -- she was British, and she resented it, and we had to move, and Mariani, my brother, and her husband moved and I stayed.</span> <span id="s183">I was the nursemaid.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: But this is the man who was part of the SA?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And how is it that he was willing to take you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yeah, he used to be -- when I stayed with this friend of my father and mother, he used to come and visit me, which was very welcome, because he would come in full uniform, you know, and he would walk -- come in -- he always came in through the back, through the garden, he would -- you know, so everybody could see him.</span> <span id="s188">And they lived in a private house, and that was very welcome, you know, they -- they wanted him to come to see, you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Spiegel.</span> <span id="s191">It was a really, when you sp -- a really -- you would think it’s a Jewish name, but he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s192">Maybe he was and we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: But you felt safe with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s195">No, I mean, he was -- he -- as I said, he was very nice.</span> <span id="s196">And then his wife -- it was -- the place was so cold -- they didn't heat the upstairs, the water froze in the water picture.</span> <span id="s197">I would get undressed under the cover, and then in the morning I would take all my clothes, put them under the cover, warm them up and get dressed again.</span> <span id="s198">It was terribly cold there beca -- why?</span> <span id="s199">Because they didn’t heat their upstairs.</span> <span id="s200">And the -- and the interesting part was her father lived upstairs too.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Now, I know we’ve kind of jumped ahead to a lot of the experiences in hiding.</span> <span id="s202">I wanted to just step back and -- and try to jog your memory a little, I know you were very young right after the anschluss.</span> <span id="s203">At that stage, how old are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: I think 14.</span> <span id="s205">I wa -- the anschluss was 13, I was 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: So I know you’re still pretty young.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I mean it was -- it was a [indecipherable] -- how long -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: 1938 I was 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s211">So -- but I wanted to go back a little --</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: -- and just to make sure we have a full understanding.</span> <span id="s214">Tell me the role of religion in your family’s life before the anschluss.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Well, we went to Sunday school, went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s216">At one point I could really read, and I could write.</span> <span id="s217">In Europe, if you were Jewish, they didn't let you forget it.</span> <span id="s218">So you were Conservative, because at that point there was no Reform.</span> <span id="s219">And that is it, you know, that’s the extent of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Did you have certain favorite holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: All of them, because we always got new clothes.</span> <span id="s222">That was a -- almost like a ritual.</span> <span id="s223">Not that we didn’t have anything to wear before, but -- but the holidays we wer -- we always got new clothes.</span> <span id="s224">And it took me awhile here not to buy anything new for the holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: And you have fond memories.</span> <span id="s226">Did you have in your home the Passover Seder and --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Yes, we had Seders which lasted forever.</span> <span id="s228">And I remember my grandmother being alive, and my brother was little -- he was little and she wouldn’t let him be fed in -- in the house because it was Passover, Mother had to go to the neighbor to feed him.</span> <span id="s229">That ar -- it’s -- it’s so weird how you remember things.</span> <span id="s230">And so, remember changing the dishes and cleaning up and whatever.</span> <span id="s231">And -- which when -- you know, was -- is a pleasant memory, which the children really today don’t have, only if you’re really Conservative, or Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: And did you -- did you speak Yiddish at home, did you learn other languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s234">We were what they would call assimilated Jews, you know [indecipherable] that -- that probably, I mean I don’t know it was a problem or not.</span> <span id="s235">But European Jews as a -- as a rule, were assimilated.</span> <span id="s236">He -- it -- it’s only the population which made you understand that you are Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: But they do the same thing here.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: How was it for you as a child, this idea that you knew you were Jewish, especially in relation to non-Jews?</span> <span id="s240">You know, what -- what -- what happened?</span> <span id="s241">Any incidents you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Not -- how shall I say?</span> <span id="s243">After the anschluss is -- there was a teacher, she was really anti-Semitic and she would -- I can’t really reme -- I remember she made a remark about the Jews in class, that I remember.</span> <span id="s244">But I ca -- I wouldn’t be able to remem -- remi -- remember what it was.</span> <span id="s245">And no, anti-Semitism in -- in Europe was -- how shall I say?</span> <span id="s246">Like here.</span> <span id="s247">It was there, you knew it.</span> <span id="s248">If you really would ha -- if you wanted to be killed, you would tell them that Jesus is a Jew.</span> <span id="s249">I mean, that was the worst thing you could have ever done, and nobody would ever do that, okay?</span> <span id="s250">But you were always aware that you were Jewish, but for some reason, tha -- my attitude and my family’s attitude was, they’re ignorant people, and I’m abo -- we are above it.</span> <span id="s251">And that’s how you survived.</span> <span id="s252">I mean, it wasn’t as -- it -- anti-Semitism in Europe I think was more -- more open than here.</span> <span id="s253">But whenever the church becomes powerful, then -- then it does not lead to good.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: What about one on one friendships?</span> <span id="s255">Did you have mostly Jewish friends, also non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yeah, yeah, we had non-Jewish friends, I had non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s257">My father most certainly had non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s258">And they would say, you’d -- you -- you are not like the -- like other Jews, you’re a different Jew.</span> <span id="s259">I mean, that shows you their ignorance.</span> <span id="s260">And of course we did not l -- we didn’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s261">My mother had red hair, blue eyes, I had blue eyes.</span> <span id="s262">So, you know, we weren’t -- we weren’t looked upon as -- as the -- the typical portrait Jew.</span> <span id="s263">But most -- I mean, most European Jews didn’t look what they were supposed to look, or what they wanted them to look.</span> <span id="s264">So that’s really it.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: What about school?</span> <span id="s266">Were you in public school, and what kind of memories --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: -- do you have fond memories of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I do -- I di -- I think the whole thing is overshadowed by the -- by the rest of the -- my life.</span> <span id="s270">So, you know, I went to school.</span> <span id="s271">I know that I would ep -- bring matzo to school.</span> <span id="s272">And I would go to school on Saturday and not write, okay.</span> <span id="s273">But otherwise, school was school, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Did you go to synagogue every week with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s276">Holidays, just like -- you know.</span> <span id="s277">Loved to go to si -- I loved to go because it was Conservative and you had to be upstairs.</span> <span id="s278">And for the holidays, as a kid, you could [indecipherable] downstairs and of course when there was [indecipherable] you were outside, and you went out to play.</span> <span id="s279">And you know, it was really -- it is -- was the same type of life as a mi -- as a middle class family you lived here.</span> <span id="s280">I mean, there was really not that much difference.</span> <span id="s281">So it’s very, you know, it’s very -- it -- it’s a very long time.</span> <span id="s282">So you really don’t remember, or maybe you choose not to, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: What do you remember about any changes at school after the anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Way -- there was no school.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: When -- when did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: I think in -- well, there was no school from ’41 on, because we went in -- you know, there was no school from 1941 on.</span> <span id="s287">So I basically had very little education.</span> <span id="s288">As I told my son once, I went to the university of life.</span> <span id="s289">So that’s that.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: And did you miss school, or you had so many other concerns by this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: You know, there was so -- there was so many other things going that going to school never really -- I don’t think it ent -- I can’t say it never, but I don’t think it ever entered my mind, because the -- you know, to survive was the most important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Now you, at this age clearly understood that -- that to survive, that -- that you are in a particularly challenging position as -- as a Jewish child to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Right.</span> <span id="s294">Yeah, no the -- that you realized, I mean, you know, that you real -- you realized it and I didn’t because at -- we were, you know, at that time we were still able to move around the city, though we wore the emblem.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: When did you st -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann Green.</span> <span id="s297">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s298">So we were doing a little bit of backtracking and -- and talking about after the anschluss, if -- if -- we were at the end of the other side of the tape, if you could just tell me again when approximately you think you started wearing the Jewish star, and also what other things started happening that seemed very different?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Well, my mother was pulled out to go clean the streets, scrub the streets, I was with her.</span> <span id="s300">My father had to go shovel snow, and at random th -- I think we started to wear the star in ’39, and of course when we were hiding we had to take it off.</span> <span id="s301">And we -- you know, you mov -- at that time you were still able to move around with your star, you know, able to cre -- come and go.</span> <span id="s302">Once you took it off you just had to be careful not to meet anybody who knew you, and maybe would alert them that you’re still around.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Did you run into people you knew a lot anyway in Vienna?</span> <span id="s304">And how did people respond to you wearing the star, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: No, no, because we moved out of the district, and it was real sheer chance that you don’t meet somebody.</span> <span id="s306">You had to be very careful, and you had to be very alert, and it was a -- a very, very difficult, very -- very hard to relate, because basically, living here -- I mean being an American, or in any country, if you haven’t experienced it, it’s really not something one can understand.</span> <span id="s307">As I always say, if I say my shoe hurts, until yours hurts, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s308">You can’t really -- you know, you say, oh yes.</span> <span id="s309">But it’s very, very difficult because it was just a -- a -- something you can’t comprehend.</span> <span id="s310">And you just do the best you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Do you think as a teenager you actually started f -- you know, feeling real fear?</span> <span id="s312">What -- what do you think you felt back then?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Well, fear is -- was the thing which was always with you, or maybe caution.</span> <span id="s314">I don’t know if you understand fear.</span> <span id="s315">Fear is only when you are exposed to it, you know, when you face it.</span> <span id="s316">But being -- you were always conscious and you always knew and you -- of course you were afraid that you are being found out.</span> <span id="s317">So you don’t -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s318">You don’t live with f -- I don’t think you live with fear, you live with the -- with the thought of hoping that it will -- it will be over soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Now during this time, first of all we see the -- I mean, what are the things that you’re seeing on the streets?</span> <span id="s320">Are you seeing Jewish stores, you know, things happening to stores and synagogues, and what do you remember about those sorts of incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Well, the stores were da -- you know, defaced, and they wrote Jew on it, and the stores were being taken over by people tha -- you know, the party gave the stores to -- to everybody whom they thought was worthwhile being in the party, or whatever.</span> <span id="s322">And it -- it was just something you can’t -- y-you can’t really retell because that’s [indecipherable] store things happen, and you took them -- that’s the way it was, okay you -- as long as you were -- the drive to survive was to be invisible.</span> <span id="s323">And th-that’s all you really could do to survive, especially when you were hiding.</span> <span id="s324">I mean, if you walked around with the star, if somebody didn't like your face, they could do anything to you, whatever they wanted to, you were only a Jew.</span> <span id="s325">So you were expandable.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: What do you remember about Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Just hearing about it, because you weren't present.</span> <span id="s328">But I remember as the story goes, my mother came from Grodz, which is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s329">And they took the rabbi there, and they had him -- they held him over the -- the river which goes through town, with a [indecipherable] you know, o-on the bridge, they held him there, just to scare him, they didn’t throw him over.</span> <span id="s330">I mean, you ni -- you’re not -- you -- you’re seeing something, you’re -- you’re hearing something which is really not -- which one can’t comprehend, because they weren't human.</span> <span id="s331">It’s like today, we haven’t learned.</span> <span id="s332">We really haven’t learned.</span> <span id="s333">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: And do you think as a teenager you comprehended what was happening at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Not really, no.</span> <span id="s336">Because I -- when I was a teenager, sometimes I did things you wouldn’t believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Like what?</span> <span id="s339">I had -- I had a boyfriend who was -- who did not need to wear the star.</span> <span id="s340">I didn’t wear it, I was already in hiding.</span> <span id="s341">We’d go to the city, we’d go like teenagers here, okay?</span> <span id="s342">At that point I was 18 -- 17 -- 18.</span> <span id="s343">We’d go to a -- we’d go to a restaurant, we go -- you know.</span> <span id="s344">One day I went to buy a birthday present for my mother, and I left in the morning and I came back in the late afternoon.</span> <span id="s345">And I remember like today, at that time they had umbrellas, and they had a cu -- they were regular umbrellas like the little ones now, they had a [indecipherable] and a -- was a lea -- it was all of leather.</span> <span id="s346">When I came in my father took it and ch-chased me.</span> <span id="s347">Because, I mean, think.</span> <span id="s348">There was no phone, there was no way, but you know, you’re a teenager.</span> <span id="s349">What -- what is -- what is the problem, you know?</span> <span id="s350">You’re having a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: And did you feel like you were a little bit invincible as -- you know, as some teenagers feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I think youth is.</span> <span id="s353">I -- I always said when I had children, I hope -- I have to remember what I did when I was a child or a teenager, and that will help me survive.</span> <span id="s354">I’m a survivor by nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Well, you were a little bit of an adventurer it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Well, I was a teenager.</span> <span id="s357">I was not -- I don’t think I was any different than teenagers today.</span> <span id="s358">But -- and you -- you don’t think what the consequences.</span> <span id="s359">I mean, if they would have caught me, they would have caught my parents.</span> <span id="s360">I mean, a whole family, and an extended family would have gone.</span> <span id="s361">Never gave it a thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: And what were the conversations like at home if your father was upset for instance that one day?</span> <span id="s363">What -- what were the kind of conversations you were having at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: You know, were you talking about strategies or plans for what you would do next, and what -- what was -- did you talk about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: [indecipherable] you -- you lived day by day.</span> <span id="s367">You -- you couldn’t plan, because you don’t -- you didn’t know what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s368">At one point, when I stayed with Mariani, I had to leave during the day so I got a place to stay at during the day, I became the maid.</span> <span id="s369">And her hus -- and they were very nice people, but her husband apparently wasn’t too bright.</span> <span id="s370">One day he called and he said, this is the gover -- some government calling, and they know that he is -- he’s hiding somebody and they’re going to come over and get me.</span> <span id="s371">Well, I cleared out of there so fast I must have -- I must have run I don’t know how many miles, just -- and that was in the inner city, and I -- we lived in the outskirts.</span> <span id="s372">And I never gi -- went back there.</span> <span id="s373">He thought it was a great joke, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: He was just kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yeah, he was kidding.</span> <span id="s376">You know, he was -- he wanted to know if it -- and at th -- and th -- you couldn’t walk a -- you had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s377">I couldn’t use the vacuum cleaner because everybody knew they went to work in the morning, so there was nobody supposed to be in their house.</span> <span id="s378">So -- I mean, i -- totally stupid.</span> <span id="s379">You know, not -- thoughtless, and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: I’m just going to take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Tell me what happened to your father’s business.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: It just dissipated, it dissipated, you know, and that was it.</span> <span id="s384">That I understand.</span> <span id="s385">So -- and then he -- my father knew a lot of -- lot of people and he would a -- he was able to -- you know, there was a lot of selling and buying, and -- and he knew a lot of -- he had a lot of non-Jewish friends, and that’s what he did.</span> <span id="s386">You know, as mu -- as -- as well as he could.</span> <span id="s387">And that’s how we survived, I suppose, to a certain degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Did anything happen to the synagogue where your family went?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yeah, they burned it down.</span> <span id="s390">They burned it down.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Do you remember the name of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s393">The only temple which stayed in is -- was not destroyed, I think, was the -- I can’t remember the name now, it just escaped me.</span> <span id="s394">The main synagogue in Vienna, in the first district, you know?</span> <span id="s395">I think -- no, it wasn't central, central is here.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: So what do you remember about the actual beginning of the war in 1939?</span> <span id="s397">Were you hearing much in the way of news?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Yeah, we would hear, and of course we also listened to the voice of America.</span> <span id="s399">And you know, the grapevine, it -- it -- and the circles my father traveled in, there was always news, but you know, you really -- it -- everything went so fast, and everything was so new, that people really did not -- I mean, did not comprehend.</span> <span id="s400">I mean, we had people aba -- when we still lived in the storefront, people would come to our house, they put coffee, for after dinner co -- after dinner -- the main meal in Europe was lunch.</span> <span id="s401">And they would come and have coffee and debate and talk and th -- you know, for naught.</span> <span id="s402">And, you know, so we are -- it’s -- it’s something really you -- you -- you rethink, and you re -- even today when I think, or when I’m talking to Mariani, the interesting part about it is that we were able to lead a normal life, to the norm of norm.</span> <span id="s403">But -- so you can’t real -- you know, when I look back, it’s -- you ju -- it just became -- you -- this is what you were confronted with, and that’s what you had to make the best of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: You sort of adjusted your concept of what was normal, it seems.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yeah, yeah, you tr -- you know, you had to, because otherwise you couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s406">You cou -- you know, you would -- you would just waste your -- your energy and strength, which I suppose you subconsciously realized that you shouldn’t do.</span> <span id="s407">Oh, I’m so far away from you, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s409">All right, so I wanted to know what you were hearing about people being deported at this time.</span> <span id="s410">What -- what sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: We --</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: -- information did you have, if any?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: We knew that there was Theresienstadt, and -- but we really didn’t know what it -- what it was.</span> <span id="s414">My parents were deported.</span> <span id="s415">My parents were caught.</span> <span id="s416">How, when and where, I don’t know, but this friend I had who was Romanian, he did not have to wear a star, so he had more entry into places, and he found out that they were deported.</span> <span id="s417">He was supposed to meet my father, and apparently didn’t, because they caught them, and they went to Theresienstadt, and at one point you could send food to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s418">If they got it, we never knew.</span> <span id="s419">But we could go to different -- different districts, and mail whatever we could spare or get together, and mail it to them.</span> <span id="s420">And then, of course, they stopped that.</span> <span id="s421">So I don’t know if they ever received it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: When you were still with your parents, and things were changing though, of course, after the anschluss, did you -- I know you’ve talked about having an optimistic outlook --</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: -- and hoping that things would change for the better soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yeah, but my father -- my father felt this not going to -- this is not going to last, I mean, people would -- they -- because he had so many non-Jewish friends, he -- he never really understood either that it could last this long, or anybody could even contemplate anything like that.</span> <span id="s426">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Do you think you picked up your optimistic attitude from your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s429">Probably.</span> <span id="s430">I mean, my father felt, you know, why emigrate.</span> <span id="s431">And probably, when I think about it now, he was in his early 50’s, he had two young children, and a wife, and I -- probably was afraid, which is very possible.</span> <span id="s432">And as I said, really not understanding the -- the power.</span> <span id="s433">So, he -- we were going to -- I think it was Nicorag -- one of those South American countries, and -- but it never materialized.</span> <span id="s434">It was always on the edge, you know, we were going to go in two weeks, okay?</span> <span id="s435">And then it dissipated.</span> <span id="s436">So we never really -- as I said, he -- it was not -- he -- he just didn’t have his heart to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: What about your mother?</span> <span id="s438">How did she react?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: You know, European wives are more -- we are going back 60 years, 70 years, so it’s, you know, whatever he felt.</span> <span id="s440">And I s -- I suppose she wasn’t as keen to -- to relocate either.</span> <span id="s441">You know, you heard -- and then, of course, it stopped, you know.</span> <span id="s442">America closed down, and -- I mean, th -- a lot of my -- my brother -- my father’s brother went to Poland, okay, the one in Hungary, who lived in Hungary, they lived under false papers.</span> <span id="s443">They had Christian papers, and they came here, they were brought here by a priest.</span> <span id="s444">So, you know, not everybody -- the majority was bad, but there were some very good people in between.</span> <span id="s445">So, you know, so people sa - peoples the -- the people survived, only could survive in account of people who helped them.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: And I guess that would be in your case, people who were willing to hide you.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah, you know, and they -- I mean, they -- they put their -- they -- they didn't all do it for love.</span> <span id="s448">A lot of it was money, okay, but they really put themselves in danger at that -- if you were found, you know, if your -- if they found you, or if somebody denounced you, so it’s -- it was a very -- it was very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s449">Like, if somebody today would come to you and say, can you hide me?</span> <span id="s450">So, you -- you know, it’s -- those people really put their own life at stake.</span> <span id="s451">So -- right?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: So just to ge -- continue with where we were.</span> <span id="s453">I know we talked about a number of different things and now I want to come back to the time when you were in hiding.</span> <span id="s454">So if you could just sort of summarize.</span> <span id="s455">When you started going into hiding -- also at that particular moment, what if anything do you remember about conversation -- conversations with your parents, you know, that you would see them frequently or try to, cause I know at this time you’re separating from your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Right.</span> <span id="s457">We went into hiding I think the end of ’41, beginning of ’42, and I would see my parents, I would come to see them, they would come to see me.</span> <span id="s458">Would bring food which they purchased on the black market.</span> <span id="s459">And we lived in different places, and we switched places, and really I -- I traveled a lot, I traveled into -- I was at many different places because I was young, and you know, people could not keep me for any length of time.</span> <span id="s460">Certain places I could go out, other places I could never leave.</span> <span id="s461">There was a place in the inner city, in the old city where I stayed, and I was not be -- I wasn’t able to go out, and it was -- it was a big -- very, very big apartment with all very old antique furniture, and it was very scary to be there, especially when you were alone and they always said, if somebody ever comes in here, I’d be hiding behind one of those big dining room table legs.</span> <span id="s462">You -- you think of the dumbest things.</span> <span id="s463">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Did you ever have any of those kind of close calls in any of the places where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: No.</span> <span id="s466">Yeah, one.</span> <span id="s467">I had one very [indecipherable] and with another ca -- in a Jewish house.</span> <span id="s468">But they were -- they did not have to wear a star at the time, and for whatever reason somebody came into their apartment, some official, and I was in the bathroom, and I -- in the bathtub, and I grabbed my robe, and I ran.</span> <span id="s469">I ran up the block, and I knew a doctor there, so I went there, and -- and that was it.</span> <span id="s470">I mean ga -- you know, you -- you go -- get into situations where you don’t think, you just -- especially when you’re -- you know, you’re running.</span> <span id="s471">And you just take off and you don’t think.</span> <span id="s472">I mean, here I was running, if somebody would say, look, what she’s doing here?</span> <span id="s473">Somebody could have picked up on it, and -- and that was it, it was -- the ma -- it’s really -- the whole thing was more luck than anything else.</span> <span id="s474">Whatever was supposed to be, that’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s475">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Were you -- did it ever feel like an adventure?</span> <span id="s477">I mean now, looking back, I see that you can smile over some of these anecdotes.</span> <span id="s478">At the time was it more frightening and you always had some --</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Well, yes -- no, it wa -- it was serious, it was not -- it was not a game.</span> <span id="s480">I mean, this much I understood.</span> <span id="s481">But at the -- at the point of danger, I w -- I wa -- suppose I was not old enough, or didn’t comprehend that the f -- that fear drove you to move, drove you to run, and that’s what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Now, can you estimate how many, perhaps -- approximately how many different hiding places you -- you had in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: At least 10 or 12.</span> <span id="s484">I -- you know, at least.</span> <span id="s485">Because certain places I stayed for awhile, other places it wasn't convenient to stay.</span> <span id="s486">And you know, people were frightened, and so I moved from place to place.</span> <span id="s487">And somebody -- you know, there was an underground communication, you know, somebody would say -- well, I know somebody who would -- you could stay with, because the people who did it knew somebody else, you know, their fre -- in their circle, so -- but it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s488">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s489">And sometimes when I went -- I think I was the one who moved the most.</span> <span id="s490">And -- being a girl, and being 17 - 18, so I was the -- really the one who moved the most.</span> <span id="s491">Sometimes I would stay with my parents.</span> <span id="s492">They were -- I mean, luckily enough, they were always together.</span> <span id="s493">And then somebody would find a place where I would go and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Now, were the people who were hiding you always receiving some kind of money or compensation?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yeah, they were -- yeah, most of them were -- were -- got -- got money, most of them -- my mother always brought food.</span> <span id="s496">And -- but money wa -- there were a few where it was money, but most of them did not.</span> <span id="s497">It was strictly doing it for the -- for the good of the people or whatever, or their conscience, or they -- or you know, you can’t -- you don’t know.</span> <span id="s498">It was -- it was a tremendous undertaking for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: And were they -- the people hiding you, were they all non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yeah, yeah, they were all non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: And how did you feel in their treatment toward you?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Always very, ver -- I mean, you were always taken into the family, or most of the time taken into the family.</span> <span id="s503">I -- I mean the longest I stayed [indecipherable] the longest [indecipherable] was I stayed with my father’s friend, and I was -- I was just part of the family and that’s it.</span> <span id="s504">But really, the chances they took were im -- um -- you know, they had -- they had family whom I never knew if they knew or if they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s505">I mean, you had to be pretty dense not to, you know, but nobody ever said anything or did anything, you know, so -- I mean, eventually I had to leave, and then of course, I went th -- stayed with Mariani, and then we were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: When did it begin when you stayed with Mariani and can you tell me -- first can you tell me her full name, and her husband’s full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Her -- her name was Mariani -- Mariani Fierstein, okay, Brauer, and her husband’s name was Otto Brauer.</span> <span id="s508">And I think it was -- I -- I was there for about a year, maybe less.</span> <span id="s509">That was a -- we stayed in th -- the place was a laundry and it wasn't the ha -- the house was a shack.</span> <span id="s510">It was a wooden shack, it had -- it had three bedrooms, and three -- one, two, three or four -- four so called bedrooms, okay, and a living room which was also a workplace where the ironing was done, and the kitchen.</span> <span id="s511">And it had no cellar or anything, it was undergr -- it was a wooden shack.</span> <span id="s512">It was just totally incredible when you think abou -- I mean, I’m laughing now, but it -- to describe it is -- like a lean-to.</span> <span id="s513">And th-there was a hand laundry, you know, they had kettles there, and they boiled the laundry and they scrubbed the laundry, we did too.</span> <span id="s514">Just because we had nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s515">And we learned to iron on a flat board instead of an ironing board.</span> <span id="s516">I became a cur -- I could iron men’s shirts perfect.</span> <span id="s517">And we ironed with an iron with a hot st -- stone in there, and it had no back.</span> <span id="s518">And of course you did other people’s laundry, so we had to be careful that stone shouldn’t slip out from the thing.</span> <span id="s519">And then we were -- we lived there, and we all -- we -- the facility was an outhouse and there was another -- there was another man there, hi -- there was something -- he was mentally ill.</span> <span id="s520">And he lived in a little -- also in this lean-to.</span> <span id="s521">And his thing was, he was waiting -- he liked Mariani’s bath water.</span> <span id="s522">He used to call it -- Mariani came there in the summertime, when they moved in it was summertime.</span> <span id="s523">And he -- we would have four foot of snow on the ground, and he would call her the summer lady.</span> <span id="s524">And we would give him the food which was left over, but he never ate that, he had it in cans, and he waited until it became moldy and then he ate it.</span> <span id="s525">I mean, the man was sick.</span> <span id="s526">Sometimes I wonder if he knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s527">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: How is -- he was living in -- next door, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: He was living in another little lean-to, and no heat, next to the -- next to the outhouse.</span> <span id="s530">It’s incredible, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Do you remember it being uncomfortable living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Well, I -- Mariani, her husband and I slept in one be -- in two beds.</span> <span id="s533">I slept across, and they slept -- I mean, we are laughing, if we wouldn’t be laughing, we’d be crying.</span> <span id="s534">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Now, were you very close friends already with Marianne before this?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Well, Mariani lived with -- with us.</span> <span id="s537">I mean, I b -- I didn’t know Mariani until I was 13, when she -- when they c -- needed to go some places, and my father and the lady who lived in the other room apparently met Mariani, knew Mariani, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s538">And they needed to vacate their apartment because they were going to be relocated, so to say.</span> <span id="s539">And they came -- they -- so they brought them to us.</span> <span id="s540">And as I said, they stayed in the kitchen in a -- up in a -- in a bunk bed.</span> <span id="s541">And as I said before, when the chimney sweep came, the super came, and said, you have to get up because he’s coming to sweep.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: And that’s before you went to the laundry place?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Oh yeah, that was long before, yes.</span> <span id="s544">That was before we even moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: How did this arrangement get made to hide in this shack in -- behind the laundry or --</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: I don’t know where -- somebody knew of her, and approached her, and -- hers -- hers was strictly money.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: What’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I think her name was Pukas.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And so she was the owner, or she ran the laundry?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: She was -- she was the owner of the laundry and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: What do you remember of her personality, what type of person was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: She was not too bright, but a nice person and we have another incident where she -- there are certain things she had to have, among them was a ti -- a goose for Christmas, and I think Mariani told you about that, that we went, we finally got the goose, and you shou -- it was a tapestry bag we put it in, and suddenly a door -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann Green.</span> <span id="s554">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s555">You were telling me about a story, an anecdote where you and Marianne were getting a goose, I believe, for Christmas.</span> <span id="s556">Can you tell me again the details of the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Well we picked up the goose, and it -- carried it in a -- a tapestry bag and apparently a dog picked up the scent and followed us until we got to the trolley.</span> <span id="s558">And got into the trolley, nobody noticed that the dog is following us.</span> <span id="s559">I got home, I had a navy coat on -- I wore, and I had a navy sweater, and when I undressed, I was navy.</span> <span id="s560">The color -- I must have perspired so from fear, that -- th-the colo -- the color came off.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Is this the kind of thing you were actually able to laugh about in the moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s563">After -- after it was all over, we laughed about it.</span> <span id="s564">I mean, we did not -- you know, wa -- we -- for some reason we had either durability or the -- I -- I -- I really don’t know what it wa -- the drive to survive that we could make light of it.</span> <span id="s565">We -- we didn’t dwell on it.</span> <span id="s566">We want -- though we were victims, we weren’t the victims in our mind.</span> <span id="s567">And you know, we had th -- we had no -- it wasn’t in our power to -- to survive, to -- to -- so we -- we did the best we could, and not to let us -- not to sink to their level.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Were there other humorous anecdotes during your time in hiding?</span> <span id="s569">A: As I said, this man who was really mentally ill, used to love Mariani’s bath water, and he brushed his teeth with it.</span> <span id="s570">Apparently he liked the soap she used or whatever, because at -- what we used as a -- to -- to bathe was one of those tin tubs from many, many years ago, even before my time.</span> <span id="s571">And he would pass by and he’d say, did she take her bath?</span> <span id="s572">Did she take her bath?</span> <span id="s573">You know, this was in summertime, we used to be outside and he’d say, did she take her bath?</span> <span id="s574">And the minute she was -- she was ready to s -- throw the water out, here he was with his can wash -- waiting to wa -- to rinse his mouth.</span> <span id="s575">It was disgusting.</span> <span id="s576">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: And did you laugh at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Yeah, we laugh, of course.</span> <span id="s579">I mean, that was our entertainment, if you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s580">We -- we -- we -- we created our own entertainment.</span> <span id="s581">So my br -- my brother used to raise rabbits for food, and he worked -- there was a shoemaker next door and he would work there, and they would give him oats, and -- like oatmeal, and he would feed it to the rabbits.</span> <span id="s582">And then he -- but he never -- he would never eat them, and he would take them to a neighbor and she would kill them and skinned them and whatever else.</span> <span id="s583">But he would ta -- his portion he would feed to the cat, and the woman was incensed that he used to do that.</span> <span id="s584">But that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Why did he raise them and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: For foo -- he -- well he -- we ate them.</span> <span id="s587">We -- you know, domesticated rabbit tastes like chicken.</span> <span id="s588">He would -- that was our supplement of meat, but he would not eat them because he was -- he was -- he fed them, he bred them, so he didn’t -- he didn’t eat them.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: When did your brother join you in hiding, cause he wasn't with you all the time before.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: No, I -- I was away.</span> <span id="s591">He was always -- he was always with Marianne.</span> <span id="s592">So I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: What else did you do for food?</span> <span id="s594">What else did you eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Well, there was -- there was a lesbian [indecipherable] they were gard -- they -- professional gardeners, and they had greenhouses, and they would bring us vegetables, lettuce, and things like that.</span> <span id="s596">And the food was bought in the black market.</span> <span id="s597">That was always avail -- you know, that was available.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Did you have enough money with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: I didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s600">Marianne’s husband.</span> <span id="s601">I didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s602">I was -- we were just there, and they took care of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: And was the woman, Mrs. or Ms. Pukas, was she involved at all in the food -- getting food for you, or helping you to get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Well, I pres -- I suppose, you know, whatever was being ab -- whatever was being purchased in the black market, whoever could bring it, and whoever could locate it.</span> <span id="s605">Because the [indecipherable] on -- you know, everybody else was on food stamps.</span> <span id="s606">So you purchased food stamps and then you could buy food, or you had people who grew food, and we had chickens also, and they laid eggs.</span> <span id="s607">And ma -- Mariani became the farmer’s wife, and she would go out and look for the eggs, I mean, so when you think about it, it’s -- it’s -- as sad at it -- as it is, it’s almost -- you can’t really comprehend it, it’s just not something -- you look back and you say, I really did that?</span> <span id="s608">And this was luxury yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Did you ever feel hungry while you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s611">No, it was -- it -- it -- I well -- how shall I say?</span> <span id="s612">When I was with my father’s friend I lived a very civilized life, and I mean it was civilized with Mariani too, and with -- with almost everybody else, I mean, I -- I moved around, I lived in many places, and it is interesting, some of the people must have known.</span> <span id="s613">I lived in a place where she -- the woman owned a restaurant, a hotel and a coffee house, and the wine growers would come, you know, to f -- to si -- is -- and she would entertain them.</span> <span id="s614">At 11 o’clock at night she would go to bed and she would leave me there with all those people until they were all ready to go home.</span> <span id="s615">And she had a -- she had a -- an -- she had a maid and she must have known, I mean, i-it was just almost like impossible not to, because there I didn't go out, I stayed in -- in the apartment all the time, so -- I mean, I was in situations where you -- looking back now I said, you know, I ca -- I can’t comprehend them.</span> <span id="s616">So -- so to relate them, and make people say, that is not that’s -- you know, it -- it doesn’t make sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Now, when you first left home and you first went into hiding, were there certain items that were important to you that you could bring?</span> <span id="s618">Or did you have to leave pretty much everything at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yeah, cl -- clothing.</span> <span id="s620">I brought -- you know, you brought as much clothing as you could carry.</span> <span id="s621">You couldn't -- you couldn’t carry a lot because you’re moving in someplace, you -- you know, your space was very limited.</span> <span id="s622">But you know, there are a few things you took and you also have to remember I was hiding from the beginning of ’42 until ’44.</span> <span id="s623">There was winter, summer, so you really had -- that was an additional thing you had to fend for.</span> <span id="s624">S-So as long -- you know, as long as my parents were around, they were -- they -- they took care, but thereafter it was really Mariani and her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: What’s the age difference between you and Mariani?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: She was born in 1910, and -- 15 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: And what did it feel like, was she a close friend, was she more like a mother substitute, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: No, y-you know [indecipherable] in Europe you will -- you are -- you -- you don’t -- you don’t address people in the [indecipherable] I don’t know wha --</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Familiar way --</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: On a familiar basis.</span> <span id="s631">You’re more -- I mean, I always would call her Mrs. Mariani, if -- you know, all those years.</span> <span id="s632">And only when I -- when she came here, she became Mariani.</span> <span id="s633">You know, as -- as we got older -- I mean to her I’m chil -- to her I’m still the child, okay, that’s -- it’s very funny now, but that’s the way it is.</span> <span id="s634">So no, she was -- sh-she always -- there was always a certain amount of respect, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Since you were separated from your parents, did you -- do you feel that you looked to her for certain parenting sort of guidance?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: No, I was re -- I was self sufficient, self reli -- not sufficient, self reliant, I didn't -- no I didn't, really not.</span> <span id="s637">I mean, she told me when to get on and off, but otherwise -- I mean, we ha -- I -- it’s very difficult, I mean she -- she did not a-assume a parental type of a -- it wasn’t that type of a relationship.</span> <span id="s638">It was more like, you know, we all lived together.</span> <span id="s639">I mean, we slept together, you can’t get much closer.</span> <span id="s640">But there was still as -- a certain respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: What are some of the ways that even if it was not in the style of a sort of parental role, but some of the ways that perhaps she helped take care of you during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Well, y -- you know, if I ne -- if I needed to -- I would ask her for anything, for -- there was really no -- no -- for advice or anything, I mean, we just lived day by day.</span> <span id="s643">There was no -- you know, there was nothing that you would say, what shall I do, or how shall I do.</span> <span id="s644">That never came into question because there was no -- there was no way or no reason for anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: What about your education?</span> <span id="s646">You weren't going to school, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: No, we -- I -- I -- no, we would -- she [indecipherable] her husband would -- we would do math and we would read.</span> <span id="s648">And I was an insa -- I was an voracious reader, and we listened to the radio, and music, and talk, mostly talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Anything you remember about your conversations?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s651">I mean, most of it was really political.</span> <span id="s652">I mean, we would listen to the -- to news, we would listen to the Voice of America, you know, and they’re bombing here, they’re bombing there and they are retreating because it is advantageous for the Germans, but we are winning.</span> <span id="s653">And, so it was really mostly we were waiting.</span> <span id="s654">We -- we would see the planes coming in and we were delighted, you know.</span> <span id="s655">Bela -- it’s because it was m -- really in an outer district.</span> <span id="s656">We see the -- wa -- American or British planes flying over, dropping bombs, and we were delighted.</span> <span id="s657">I mean, when I lived in the city it wasn’t this much fun because everybody went into the basement where you were -- I was alone in a big apartment house, and that was not fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: That was when I was hiding, you know, when one of the places, when the air raid sirens came, everybody had to vacate their apartment and at one time I was hiding in the closet because they were going from apartment to apartment to see if all the apartments are empty.</span> <span id="s660">And of course you never knew if you’re -- this building is going to be bombed, th -- at that point you were scared, but there was nothing you could do.</span> <span id="s661">You could just wait it out and hope for the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: I think Marianne also mentioned when you’re hiding together with her, that while everybody during the air raids went to the cellar, you would go to the attic.</span> <span id="s663">Is that what you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: No, th-that probably was when we were at this [indecipherable] house.</span> <span id="s665">No, I don’t remember that, because most -- as I said, that’s the only time we had an attic.</span> <span id="s666">Otherwise, there was no attic.</span> <span id="s667">That -- that -- the worst was the apartment buildings because here the apart -- the house was totally still, there was nobody there, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: So you were afraid of both the air raid and then being found?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: [indecipherable] right.</span> <span id="s670">I mean we -- I mean, we knew what bombs can do, or maybe have seen destruction, and it was just the eeriest feeling to be in a -- in a building, the only person in a building, so to say.</span> <span id="s671">I p -- the a -- in your imagination, because you didn’t see it.</span> <span id="s672">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: So -- so now when you are in the hiding place in the -- in the wooden shack, I believe, that’s behind the laundry --</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: -- place, so what -- I just lost my train of thought -- when you were there -- do you know approximately how long you were in hiding there, and would you sometimes leave from there and come back and go to different hiding places in between?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Here and there I would leave, yes.</span> <span id="s677">Here and there, when something became available.</span> <span id="s678">I mean, we lived in odd quo -- I mean in -- under odd circumstances.</span> <span id="s679">My poor brother slept on a chaise lounge which was infested with slee -- with fleas.</span> <span id="s680">It was horrendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: And where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: That was there because you know, you were on the ground, there was -- there were just boards on the ground as floors.</span> <span id="s683">So -- I mean, it -- it -- it didn't look this terrible.</span> <span id="s684">I me -- I’m just describing it which is really -- you can’t imagine it, okay?</span> <span id="s685">But it wasn’t that uncomfortable, and the -- the living room was -- the bedroom was perfectly fine looking, you know, we had the windows and all.</span> <span id="s686">But those were the --</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: So you left when you thought there was a better place to go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: No, not better, you know, just to make room, just to disappear.</span> <span id="s689">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Cause you were worried about being caught at the laundry place?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: No, and -- just making room, you know, there were so many people, I mean -- so when there was something else opened up, and somebody said, you know there is -- you’ll be able to stay there, you moved on.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: And about how long in total would you say you were at the -- at this wooden shack?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Maybe a year in total.</span> <span id="s694">Yeah, maybe a year in total, may -- a year and a half, I really ti -- I have no concept of time.</span> <span id="s695">Course it’s 60 -- over 60 years, and I don’t dwell on it.</span> <span id="s696">If you were a person who dwells on it, it’s a totally different story.</span> <span id="s697">Not only is it -- it becomes worse, because your imagination goes, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Now, I think I heard, also from Marianne, some kind of story about the day when it was supposed to be your brother’s Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yeah, yeah, that’s when they caught, and they came [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: And when was this and can you tell me the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yeah, was -- it would be May 19th.</span> <span id="s702">He was -- he was born in ’29, so he was, in ’44 he was -- tw -- 39 and five, he was 13.</span> <span id="s703">What am I doing?</span> <span id="s704">He was 13.</span> <span id="s705">And we were waiting, you know, for my parents to come and this friend of mine came and he said they were caught.</span> <span id="s706">And I cannot remember any more how -- somebody denounced them.</span> <span id="s707">Tha -- yes, somebody denounced them.</span> <span id="s708">So -- and he came and he told us, and he was able -- he went to visit them in the jail when they were in jail, and my parents told their interrogator that we went over the border to Hungary, so they shouldn’t be looking for us because they caught the parents, so they knew the children was there, but my parents told them that we went -- we were sent to Hungary, and that’s -- that was that.</span> <span id="s709">And then they were transported to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: But when did you learn about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Well, they were allowed to write, and they wrote to this friend of mine, and that’s how we knew where they were.</span> <span id="s712">You know, when they arrived, you know, we are ha -- we are in a beautiful place, everything is nice, and that’s how we were able to send them f-food.</span> <span id="s713">We would send a bag of onions or something, bag of potatoes, you know, something you can -- not knowing if they ever get it or not, but that was -- was -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: The day of your brother’s Bar Mitzvah, where were you that day when you got this news?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: We were in -- we were home.</span> <span id="s716">I mean, we were hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: In the laundry place?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: In -- in -- yeah, yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s719">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: And -- and so he did have his Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s722">I -- I -- when we say it would have been his Bar Mi -- he was 13.</span> <span id="s723">There was no way that he would ever have had it, okay?</span> <span id="s724">This was just like a -- you know, here he was, 13, his 13th birthday.</span> <span id="s725">So -- but --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: How did your brother take the news?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Well, he was 13.</span> <span id="s728">He was not very -- he was not very vocal.</span> <span id="s729">You know, he was a 13 year old boy who lived under very vicarious circumstances or conditions and so -- and as I said, he wasn’t very -- he -- he was not very vocal.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: How did you take it?</span> <span id="s731">Was it somehow possible to be optimistic after -- after this?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: You had to be.</span> <span id="s733">You had no choice.</span> <span id="s734">It’s ye -- I -- I suppose this is -- we all were -- I mean, it was not a pla -- it was not pleasant, we did not know -- but we didn’t know -- we had no -- we had absolutely no understanding, because nobody can -- I mean, it’s not something a normal mind can comprehend.</span> <span id="s735">You can fear, but you really -- and -- and also, the optimism that it will be over, it will be over very soon because America is there, and Britain is fighting, okay?</span> <span id="s736">So it’s not going to be -- it’s going to be very fast, I mean.</span> <span id="s737">When he went into ru -- when Germans went into Russia, I mean, th-this was the end, oka -- but a -- you were always optimistic that something is going to happen what’s going to end it.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: And you were actively following the news about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s740">In fact, when we were caught, we were interrogated by the Gestapo, and so he said, and you listened to the Voice of America, and the radio we had, we couldn’t really listen to it, but we had a neighbor there, she was Jewish, he wasn’t, and there was a -- the owner of the building, her husband was Jewish, she wasn’t, and she had two adult children, one -- one was a physician and one was -- I don’t know what she was.</span> <span id="s741">But they were -- they knew we were there, and they would listen or they would call Mariani and say -- and her husband, say to come and listen to the Voice of America.</span> <span id="s742">So when this Gest -- when I was interrogated, he said to me, “And I understand you listened to the Voice of America.”</span> <span id="s743">And I said to him, ”No,” I said, “we could never, ever listen with the radio we have,” I said.</span> <span id="s744">“If you put your finger,” I said -- there was an opening in the back and, “if you put your finger there, the voice would get -- the music would get strong,” I said, “and if you took it away, it died.”</span> <span id="s745">So he looked at me and he said, “I don’t know if you’re this stupid, or if you’re playing.”</span> <span id="s746">And I looked at him and I said, “No, that’s the way it was.”</span> <span id="s747">And I was in there first, and then when Mariani came, I handed her my coat, and I sa -- didn’t say anything, you know, and that was it.</span> <span id="s748">But it would -- and then -- I mean -- I’m -- I’m -- how shall I say?</span> <span id="s749">We were able to laugh about it, you know?</span> <span id="s750">I mean, it was scary at the moment, but I co -- I couldn’t really think of anything else, I mean, he accuses us of listening, which was a very normal thing, I mean, he di -- he might not even have known, you n -- but with that radio, you couldn’t -- you couldn’t if you would have wanted to.</span> <span id="s751">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: When is the last time that you spoke to or saw your parents?</span> <span id="s753">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Bless you.</span> <span id="s755">I s -- probably a week before they were caught.</span> <span id="s756">You know, there was no telephone -- there was really only when my mother could come or I could go.</span> <span id="s757">Mariani and I really moved quite freely.</span> <span id="s758">Didn’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s759">I pa -- what does looking Jewish mean, right?</span> <span id="s760">I mean, if you would -- if you would be black, or you would be oriental, it’s fine.</span> <span id="s761">But here we were.</span> <span id="s762">I had blue eyes, she had blonde hair, blue eyes, very statuesque type of a per -- you know, appearance.</span> <span id="s763">Nobody looked at us, we hoped.</span> <span id="s764">We had no papers.</span> <span id="s765">We just, you know, we just walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: So you were out on the streets often?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s768">We were out in the street.</span> <span id="s769">We even -- we even went to the Turkish bath every couple of weeks once, we would go and you know, make believe we having a great time, and we did.</span> <span id="s770">That was -- that was our -- here I was, what, 18 - 19?</span> <span id="s771">Going to the Turkish baths at -- in there, nobody knew who you were, you -- you know.</span> <span id="s772">And it was like a bi -- you know, big -- it’s not like the bath house here, there we -- you pro -- might have seen them.</span> <span id="s773">And this was our recreation.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: So you tried to enjoy life when you could?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: We -- we tried to make the best what we had, you know, that’s it.</span> <span id="s776">Like my brother never ventured out, because he was almost six foot tall, and he couldn’t go out because what is he doing midday on the street, when everybody else is in the army, or -- or working?</span> <span id="s777">So what is he doing at night out, he can’t go out, so he never went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Well, this makes me wonder was it easier to go out as a young woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Yeah, you know, because I mean we knew -- you know, we wouldn’t travel the time when people were working, we tried to travel with the crowd.</span> <span id="s780">You know, don’t --the danger was that you met somebody, and in -- in there.</span> <span id="s781">But they might not even have meant you harm, but in -- in their just strict -- just gossiping, or say, oh we saw Annie, okay?</span> <span id="s782">She looked -- you know.</span> <span id="s783">If they would s -- [indecipherable] to have spoken to us it would have been terrible, because where do you live?</span> <span id="s784">How come you’re still here, you know?</span> <span id="s785">So that was the danger of going out.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Now you were aware of -- you said there’s this underground sort of movement, you were aware of many Jewish people staying there in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Oh yeah, I mean they -- not everybody knew everybody, but this is how you -- you found places.</span> <span id="s788">If somebody needed a place, and you knew of somebody who might or will, you passed it on.</span> <span id="s789">And that’s, you know, it was like underground -- a whole underground circuit.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Where was -- do you remember the address or the general location of this laundry place where you hid?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Yeah, it was 13 Roebuckerstrasse.</span> <span id="s792">I went back there and it was -- it was totally cleared, so it was the weirdest, weirdest sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: When did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Maybe 15 - 20 years ago.</span> <span id="s795">My husband wanted to go see Austria, so we went.</span> <span id="s796">It’s a ver -- was a very, very strange experience.</span> <span id="s797">First of all, I carried a chip on my shoulder to the population, and I knew every nook and crevice.</span> <span id="s798">I could travel the underground, I could travel on -- but I felt like a tourist, and then that was it.</span> <span id="s799">In fact, we went to -- where was it?</span> <span id="s800">Corinthia we went and the -- that was really -- the homeland of Mr. Schwarzenegger, and [indecipherable] of my number, because I wasn't going to give them the satisfaction to say, look at them, what are -- what are they talking about we did to the Jews?</span> <span id="s801">So I -- I just -- I was not going to give them the satisfaction to say that, you know, and they wanted to know how come I speak so -- I can speak dialect.</span> <span id="s802">So how come?</span> <span id="s803">If I was a war bride?</span> <span id="s804">No, I wasn’t, okay?</span> <span id="s805">And Austrians, when they -- I mean, it’s stupid to say, are very nosy.</span> <span id="s806">And, you were a war bride?</span> <span id="s807">No.</span> <span id="s808">How come you speak such good -- you know.</span> <span id="s809">I learned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: You didn’t want to tell them you’re from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s812">I mean, you know, I wasn't -- I he -- I traveled with an American passport, you know, and they can tell where you were born, so she knew I was aw -- you know, but sh-she wanted -- they wanted to know, you know, more detail, and I wasn't going to volunteer.</span> <span id="s813">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s814">Now people will say why did you -- why did you cover your number?</span> <span id="s815">I says because I just was not going to have them say, what did they say what we did to the Jews?</span> <span id="s816">Look at them travel, you know?</span> <span id="s817">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Now, I think we’re getting to the point where --</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: We go to camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: -- you know, you have been -- where you’re found out in your hiding place, but I’m -- I was just curious in general, is there anything else you remember as far as anything you haven’t already shared, what would be the biggest challenges of this life that you had in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: It was just one big challenge, there was no big, no small, it was just -- it was so -- to survive.</span> <span id="s822">And e -- I don’t th -- I mean, I did not have the capacity, I don’t think as -- I don’t know, age or --or -- or brain, to -- to realize how dire the situation was, you know?</span> <span id="s823">I mean, you wanted to survive and you -- the hope that it will end, that’s all.</span> <span id="s824">I mean, you -- y-you just, as I said before, you tried not to -- not to be di -- to -- to -- not to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s825">You lived in your own little mind.</span> <span id="s826">And that’s the whole a -- it -- it’s really very, very difficult to -- to under -- I -- I myself don’t like it -- don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s827">And looking back on it I say, did I really live like this, did I really do that?</span> <span id="s828">And as I have said many times, that the m -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann Green.</span> <span id="s830">This is tape number two, side B. I think you wanted to say something?</span> <span id="s831">Did you want to -- okay.</span> <span id="s832">So now I wanted to ask you, continuing where we left off, if you would tell me what happened when you were discovered in the hiding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: This is the place with Mrs. or Miss Pukas.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: The -- the laundry.</span> <span id="s837">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Well, it’s six o’clock in the morning, we could hear the gate opening.</span> <span id="s839">There was a fence, and there was a gate.</span> <span id="s840">The gate opened, and the bedroom windows faced, and we saw I don’t know how many coming in.</span> <span id="s841">And they just came in and they arrested us.</span> <span id="s842">I mean, they went through the whole -- through the place, they were looking for things.</span> <span id="s843">And I don’t know if Mariani told you, but her husband wrote a memoir, and of course they found it.</span> <span id="s844">And he also was -- he had colon cancer, a -- operated on, but he wore a --</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: A catheter?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s847">And of course they saw the -- his manuscript and that didn’t help any.</span> <span id="s848">So anyway, we went from there, they arrested us and they brought us to the city jail, and there we were, I think, for almost a month.</span> <span id="s849">We were privileged prisoners there because we were the only, more or le -- that was mostly migrant workers, and I was [indecipherable] in quarantine, and the [indecipherable] was into a big room.</span> <span id="s850">Mariani and I slept on the table because we weren’t about to sleep on the -- with them, because we were scared.</span> <span id="s851">And we would get up in the morning and we would go into the washroom and strip and wash, because one thing we knew, we had to try to keep clean.</span> <span id="s852">Those people all looked at us because they didn't know from that.</span> <span id="s853">Anyway, eventually --</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: And when was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: That was in the city jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: But when?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: When?</span> <span id="s858">That was in May ’44.</span> <span id="s859">May ’44, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: I think she said it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: I have it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: -- June.</span> <span id="s863">Think it was close to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: It’s ju -- no, I’m sorry, it was in June.</span> <span id="s865">It was in June -- no, it was in -- in June, I think, yeah.</span> <span id="s866">No, we were deported in June, that was at -- it was my -- it -- it was either -- it was either the end of May, or the beginning of June, because the end of June we were deported.</span> <span id="s867">We -- yeah, we got -- we came to Auschwitz, to Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: How do you think or what do you know about the way in which you were found in your hiding place?</span> <span id="s869">What -- what have you been able to understand how that happened that you were caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: We really -- I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s871">The woman who was hiding us, nothing happened to her.</span> <span id="s872">All the things we had that -- photographs, and little whatever was left there -- excuse me, stayed there, and Mariani recouped that after the war.</span> <span id="s873">So we don’t unders -- excuse me -- we also -- she also has a deserter -- not -- I don’t know if -- if she told him he can’t stay any more, and he was caught.</span> <span id="s874">So we -- I don’t know if it was he who was trying to save himself and said there are Jews there, or if she became scared and told somebody, and they went and denounced us.</span> <span id="s875">I w -- nobody ever knows -- will know.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: It came as a total surprise at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Total.</span> <span id="s878">Out of -- out of the blue.</span> <span id="s879">No pla -- there was no -- nothing said, nobody -- nothing -- nobody but the deserter came -- you know, there was nobody new who would have -- we would have said, oh maybe.</span> <span id="s880">But it was all the old acquaintances, or people who were aware of us.</span> <span id="s881">So, really I don’t know.</span> <span id="s882">I truly don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: And you stayed in the jail for --</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: A month.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: A month.</span> <span id="s886">And what were conditions like there?</span> <span id="s887">You were starting to explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Yeah, wi -- how and when I can’t remember any more, but it -- we -- first we stayed in that humongous -- with like maybe 40 or 50 people.</span> <span id="s889">And then we were moved into a smaller cell, with maybe only 20 and then I don’t know if it was the matron or who, took a -- chose us to give out food and dishes and we swept the hal -- the hall, and our -- our s -- we -- Mariani had a pr -- and I had a pr -- a private cell.</span> <span id="s890">I shouldn’t laugh, but it was -- I mean, it was -- and they never locked the gate or any -- we couldn’t go anyplace, I mean we were in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: But it was sort of relaxed conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Yeah, it was, for us it was a rela -- you know, the breakfast, lunch and dinner was ser -- you know, we would give out the cutlery and we collected and would sweep the floors.</span> <span id="s893">So the day passed.</span> <span id="s894">And Mariani was a ferocious smoker.</span> <span id="s895">She didn’t only smoke cigarettes, she would -- they would -- you know, cigarettes were very hard to get by.</span> <span id="s896">They would take the butt, open it up [indecipherable] the tobacco and they re -- either roll it, or re-stuff it and smoke it.</span> <span id="s897">And -- so one day Mariani said, she s -- we have to [indecipherable] to get -- if you can get to our stuff, and the only reason she wanted to get in there because she had two boxes of that smelly, old tobacco.</span> <span id="s898">And the interesting part is she smoked all this, and she s -- that was the end of smoking.</span> <span id="s899">Like cold turkey, no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: When is it that she stopped smoking?</span> <span id="s901">You’re saying --</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: In -- in jail.</span> <span id="s903">When -- when she was finished smoking whatever she had there, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: So you were able to bring a few items with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Yeah, I mean, you know.</span> <span id="s906">And th-the most important was the tobacco.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Now, you had about a month there --</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: A month there.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: -- and what were you thinking would happen next?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: We had no -- we had really, absolutely -- I mean, n-no -- I -- I -- no -- how shall I -- we didn't know.</span> <span id="s911">We just didn’t know.</span> <span id="s912">The only thing we knew was Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s913">We didn’t know Auschwitz, we didn’t know Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s914">I mean, I had a very -- we had a very interesting thing happen to us in -- when I traveled with my husband, we were in Salzburg.</span> <span id="s915">Mauthausen is right there, and my husband is a tourist, he speaks to everybody and speaking the language -- he spoke the -- the bridge was closed, so he wanted to know from the policeman why the bridge was closed.</span> <span id="s916">So he -- they were making a movie and the policeman said to him, have you gone to Mauthausen?</span> <span id="s917">And my husband said no.</span> <span id="s918">So he told him how to get there, but among other things he also said he lived the ri -- the -- it’s -- it was a country road, okay, and the trucks would go past there.</span> <span id="s919">There was -- you know, there was the road, and there was houses on one side of the street.</span> <span id="s920">And he said, you know, the trucks would go by, we didn’t know that there was a camp there, there were thi -- they were doing this.</span> <span id="s921">So that’s the mentality of the -- of -- we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s922">I mean, we didn't want it, but we just waited for him, and we opened our arms when they arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: So you find it hard to believe that they didn’t know that --</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: From -- from a -- you know, I have a slanted -- I’m for -- that -- that I have a very sla -- because I’ve lived there, I -- yo-you know, I felt the anti-Semitism all my life, so consequently I -- I’m -- I’m talking about the -- more or less, I’m not talking about the people of today, I can’t because I don’t know them.</span> <span id="s925">But they are probably better educated, and what is a -- a -- an Austrian?</span> <span id="s926">Austria was a mixture of Czechs, Poles, Yugoslavs, you know, I mean there’s no such a thing as a pure Austrian.</span> <span id="s927">They all came from the so -- I mean, it was the great Austrian under the -- under the emperor.</span> <span id="s928">So there’s no such a thing, so you have a mixture of -- of people.</span> <span id="s929">And as I said, I’m -- I’m -- I was -- I’m prejudiced, I suppose, and I look at them totally different.</span> <span id="s930">And so I can’t really -- I’m -- I can’t have a unprejudiced opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: So you had no idea what was about to happen --</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: -- but then --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: We went on the special transport, we were only I think 15 or 16 people, and really was a -- a regular train car, and we knew there was something going on, but of course, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s935">Nobody could in -- nobody ever got out of there to tell, and America knew, but they didn’t spread the word, so nobody knew.</span> <span id="s936">America knew where the camps were, right?</span> <span id="s937">So we were -- I mean, we know it did not bode well, but we really had to see what it is.</span> <span id="s938">We had to wait, we had no -- what were we going to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Describe the journey, how long and -- and when did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: I don’t -- I -- I don’t think -- it was just a couple of hours.</span> <span id="s941">Was a -- you know, Vienna is not this far away from -- from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s942">It wasn’t an overnight, it definitely wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: And it was a comfortable ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Oh, it -- it was a regular third class coach, you know, we had -- we had the whole compartment -- we had the whole -- we had the whole car, I should say, not compartment, you know?</span> <span id="s945">And I suppose we were guarded.</span> <span id="s946">That I can’t even remember, you know, we were -- because here we are, we didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s947">I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: But -- but you felt it was ominous?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s950">In fact, there was one man, he was alone, and he asked -- he had some gold pieces, and he asked Mariani to sew it into his coat.</span> <span id="s951">And she did.</span> <span id="s952">Not that it ever helped him, because he lost his coat, okay?</span> <span id="s953">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: You were with other Jewish prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Yeah, we were about with 15 other people.</span> <span id="s956">We were with 15 other people.</span> <span id="s957">We -- and there was one -- there was one family who thought that they weren’t Jewish, the -- they converted, but they were with us, too.</span> <span id="s958">And the mother died, and I think Mariani took care of the girl, and I think the father also survived.</span> <span id="s959">I don’t know because I left -- I was lucky enough to be shipped out, so I wasn't there when Ausch -- wh-when Birkenau was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: So you’re on this journey, it’s not a very long one, but when do you first know that you’re arriving to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s961">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Well, we arrived, and we were sele -- you know, there was selection, the separation of men and women.</span> <span id="s963">And in hindsight, of course, we -- after we were -- we -- after you -- the -- we talked to inmates, we found out what was going on.</span> <span id="s964">Before that you had no idea.</span> <span id="s965">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s966">And Mariani’s husband was sent to one side, my brother went in the other side, and Mariani and I are -- were together.</span> <span id="s967">And we were together for a whi -- for a -- in fact, I wanted my brother to go with Mariani’s husband and they pushed him back.</span> <span id="s968">He went right into -- into selection.</span> <span id="s969">And Mariani and I were in the block together for maybe four weeks or so, four or five weeks, and then I worked that we -- I was sent to work in -- they tor -- I still don’t know what they did with it.</span> <span id="s970">You tor -- you tore the clothing into strips, braided them, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s971">Whatever they did with it, whatever they used it for, I never found out.</span> <span id="s972">And then I worked -- I built a road to the east, we were transporting rocks and breaking the rocks, and there we had a guard who would let us sit in the outhouse by the tower to take a re -- it was brutally hot, even in -- in September.</span> <span id="s973">No, th -- October -- no, was towards -- it was hot.</span> <span id="s974">And he would let us go in one by one and when the super -- the guy who was supervising, him came -- he came on a horse, so he could see him, so he would call whoever was in there out.</span> <span id="s975">I mean, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: But he gave you breaks, he let you ta --</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: He gave us breaks.</span> <span id="s978">He gave -- it was a young -- it was a young Austrian kid who really probably didn’t want to be there, and didn’t agree, and gave each and every one of us a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Was it very hard work?</span> <span id="s980">Very hard, manual labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: It was physical labor.</span> <span id="s982">I mean, people breaking -- you know, breaking stones and loading them into lorries and moving the lorries, and dumping them in this -- in the -- in the road bed.</span> <span id="s983">And -- I mean, it was physical labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Were you pretty strong at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: I must have been.</span> <span id="s986">I must have been because otherwise I couldn’t -- there’s one thing you tried to avoid, and that was being in the hospice.</span> <span id="s987">Okay, that was not -- and I was there two -- I had dysentery, and in fact, that’s where Mariani broke her nose, she came to visit me and she slipped, she broke her nose.</span> <span id="s988">But fortunately I got out of there, and after I got out of there, I -- we did landscaping for -- with pick and shovel.</span> <span id="s989">And they had -- also they had Russian prisoners there, pr-prisoners of war, I suppose.</span> <span id="s990">And there was one of them, he used -- they had -- he must have been working in an orchard or something, and whenever we crossed, he would give me apples.</span> <span id="s991">I mean, when y -- you know, I remember the -- the -- how shall I say?</span> <span id="s992">The good things.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: You remember little moments of human kindness.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Right, you know.</span> <span id="s995">And that -- I mean, I would -- I would buy cabbage.</span> <span id="s996">There were people who worked in -- in the fields and they would bring heads of cabbage back, and I would give one ration of my bread, one day ration, for cabbage.</span> <span id="s997">And I really think that’s what helped me survive, because it was the only --</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: You had no other sort of vegetables, or roughage, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: No, no, no, whatever it was, it was boiled.</span> <span id="s1000">It was soup.</span> <span id="s1001">The only solids we ever got was potatoes.</span> <span id="s1002">And if you were lucky you were the last one, so you can get the peels, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Were you hungry a lot of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s1005">Y-You n -- you know, we would have -- I -- I would have -- we would have sit in -- we have food fantasies, we would set a table with candles, and the tablecloths and napkins and silver.</span> <span id="s1006">I mean, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: In your mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: In your -- yeah, you were -- we were talking.</span> <span id="s1009">The way -- this is the way it’s going to look.</span> <span id="s1010">You know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: You would talk with friends and fantasize about the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1013">You know.</span> <span id="s1014">It’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: And mostly about food, or other things, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yeah, no, but -- bu -- you know, tha-that was the weirdest thing, to se -- here you are, you have nothing to eat, you have to watch that nobody steals your bread, or you ge -- or you traded your bread for a -- for a quarter head of cabbage.</span> <span id="s1017">And -- and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1018">So it is really -- the -- the weird -- I think the weirdness about this all, that here we are, we are sitting here and we are talking about it.</span> <span id="s1019">Right?</span> <span id="s1020">And we can laugh, as sad as it is, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Did you form friendships?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Yes and no, you know.</span> <span id="s1023">I -- I had a -- a friend which -- she died of TB.</span> <span id="s1024">We slept together -- so -- in the work camp.</span> <span id="s1025">See, I was very lucky because I was only in Auschwitz from the end of June to October, and at that point they were looking for German citizens.</span> <span id="s1026">Suddenly I became [indecipherable] German citizen.</span> <span id="s1027">Was elevated.</span> <span id="s1028">And they were looking for laborers, labor for a -- for a factory.</span> <span id="s1029">And that’s when we were shipped out, and then we were shi -- there were -- we -- it must have been all the way up north, and -- and what is it called, they have -- they have the -- right by the -- you know, the -- where the bogs are, what is it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: That region of -- of Germany, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Yeah, and I don’t know what it is called.</span> <span id="s1032">And then they transport -- they had no place for us, so they pick -- they pitched enormous tents, like circus tents and they put us in there, and there was a storm and one of the tents collapsed.</span> <span id="s1033">It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Where is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: That was in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: In a -- a different camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Yeah, w-we were on transport.</span> <span id="s1038">And they kept us there for while, and the horrible part there was it was very damp, and it was very wet, and the only place -- th-the onl -- they built a latrine.</span> <span id="s1039">All they did was dig a hole, put -- took the bark off the trees and made a landing, so to say, and then put a log across, and my biggest fear was to fall in, to slip because it was wet.</span> <span id="s1040">I -- I mean, you n -- you walked there and your -- your -- you wore those wooden shoes and they would stick in the mud, you know?</span> <span id="s1041">So here you are, going up on this little --</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Like a ledge --</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: -- like a -- a platform, but it was all tree -- it was like an -- a -- a logs, but they had no bark on it, because if you had bark on it, you don’t slip.</span> <span id="s1044">And my fear was to fall in there.</span> <span id="s1045">And from there we went to Bergen-Belsen, and we just hung there until we came -- wi -- they send us to the ammunition factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Now, I want go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s1047">Do you think you would recognize -- I have a map of Auschwitz -- of Birkenau, and I don’t know if you would be able to point out any of the places where you remember being, or -- I know you said when you were first there, you were in a certain area with Marianne.</span> <span id="s1048">I don’t know if any of this looks familiar to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: No.</span> <span id="s1050">We were in block 13, and you know what the greatest -- the most horrible part about Auschwitz was, to me anyway, was that I could not comprehend -- now I understand, but then I couldn’t comprehend, the cru -- the cruelty of the -- of the Jewish people to -- you know, like the blockoma, okay?</span> <span id="s1051">I walked -- when we were there, the first day, I went up to a young kid, she had her mother and her sister with her, she was younger than I am, beautiful, beautiful girl, Polish.</span> <span id="s1052">And I ask her to -- the house -- the bunk was empty, if Mariani could go inside.</span> <span id="s1053">It was brutally hot, and humid.</span> <span id="s1054">She wouldn’t let her go in, okay?</span> <span id="s1055">And I said, if I ever come across her, I’ll really kill her.</span> <span id="s1056">I had such anger at her.</span> <span id="s1057">I did come across her.</span> <span id="s1058">What did she do?</span> <span id="s1059">At -- we were li -- at the day we were liberated, she -- I s -- suddenly see her, what’d she do?</span> <span id="s1060">There was a German kid, and she knocked him off his bike and she took the bike.</span> <span id="s1061">And I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1062">I wouldn’t even dirty my hands on her.</span> <span id="s1063">It was -- it was so -- I mean, I-I could not understand, you know, that the -- the kapos and whatever, would -- I mean, she wasn't specially cruel, she was dumb, because she had entry to clothing and everything, and she would parade -- she was a kid -- sh -- I -- I remember one day she had a pink peignoir with feathers and slippers and a cigarette holder, and she would parade through the -- I mean, she was a kid.</span> <span id="s1064">She was beautiful but she was -- maybe she was maybe 16 or 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Did you have other experiences like that, or see other --</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: No, no, she was the -- really, she was the only one.</span> <span id="s1069">But a-as I said, when I was there, I couldn’t comprehend the cruelty.</span> <span id="s1070">But that -- that was the method.</span> <span id="s1071">That’s what the -- that was ve-very German type -- you know, that’s -- that was their method of doing it, because that really gnawed in your ment -- on your mind.</span> <span id="s1072">I mean, now I understand it, because they had to survive themselves, okay?</span> <span id="s1073">That was their way of surviving.</span> <span id="s1074">I don’t know what I would have done if I would have been in the position.</span> <span id="s1075">So you -- you can’t really blame them, but at -- a-at -- at the time, I could not understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Now you at first were with Marianne --</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: -- staying with her, and then what happened, you were separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: We were separated, I went -- see, Mariani had -- she w -- Mariani was stateless, so she had no -- she did not have an Austrian --</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: And why was that, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: No, I don’t know, that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1082">But they were looking for German citi -- citizens to -- to -- we didn’t know for what.</span> <span id="s1083">And they wanted us to work in an ammunition factory, and we did.</span> <span id="s1084">That’s where we fi -- that’s -- that was the lifesaving part of it, because I was only in camp for 11 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: When -- when you were with Marianne, or when you were still in Auschwitz but you were separated from her, would you still have occasion to see her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1087">Yeah, we -- yeah, she was in a different -- she was in a different block and I was in a different block.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: And how would you get to see one another, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Y-You w -- you were f -- you can’t say you were free to walk, but you were -- you know, like for instance, I once -- I knew my -- my -- we were -- when we were going out for w-work, my brother’s group was walking this -- we were going the opposite directions, and once I -- I gave some bread for some garlic.</span> <span id="s1090">And I -- you know, you had that thing that there’s certain things you should try to get to eat, to s -- to -- like we do today, we go to the health food store, you know?</span> <span id="s1091">So -- and I handed it to him and they caught him.</span> <span id="s1092">They caught me and they caught him, and I just -- I happened to -- there was a kapo there, a woman, and her boyfriend told me that he was alright at the time.</span> <span id="s1093">That’s -- you know -- because I didn’t know what they were going to do to him.</span> <span id="s1094">It just s -- and he -- you know, he s -- put his hand out, I put mine out in walking by and somebody saw it, so that was a bad experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: And with Marianne you were able to spend time with her and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1097">I mean, she knew where I was, she knew -- and I don’t know where she was, but we were -- we were together and we were apart, and sometimes we were in the same bunk, then we were separated and then we come back into the same bunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Do you think it was important for you to have someone like that -- her there, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Oh definitely, definitely.</span> <span id="s1100">Yeah [indecipherable] it was important for -- I suppose important for her, and you know, I was -- I was -- though I was eight -- 19, I was still, you know, I don’t know if you can say a kid.</span> <span id="s1101">I mean, I was -- I wasn’t this exposed to the world, so at that point I looked at her as a -- a -- a co -- how shall I say, guardian or si -- whatever, you know?</span> <span id="s1102">At one point I go -- I was desperate, I told her I had -- I had lice, you know?</span> <span id="s1103">And she said, “You take care of yours and I take care of mine.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: She was scared to get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Was she scared to get it from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: I don’t know, I mean -- you know?</span> <span id="s1108">So -- but there was nothing she could do for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: She told me some story about showering in the middle of the night, do you remember this?</span> <span id="s1110">Taking cold showers in the middle of the night to stay --</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: No, that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1112">You couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s1113">I mean, at night you couldn’t -- you were in, okay?</span> <span id="s1114">And the worst thing which could happen to you, that was in Birkenau, is -- you know, you had a bucket for elimination, so there was a thing which, if you were the last one in the morning to use that, because if you used it the last one, it was you who carried it out.</span> <span id="s1115">As I said, if you don’t laugh, you cry.</span> <span id="s1116">When I -- when we first went -- got there, you know, we undressed, we went into the shower, they cut your hair.</span> <span id="s1117">They tattooed you and they gave you clothes.</span> <span id="s1118">And you have to remember we came from -- that we want to say normal life.</span> <span id="s1119">We had normal clothes on and here I get whatever they gave me, I know what it was.</span> <span id="s1120">It was a navy blue, straight dress.</span> <span id="s1121">And it had a whatever on there.</span> <span id="s1122">And I had to go to the bathroom and the latrines all have the windows.</span> <span id="s1123">And I’m si -- I’m looking in and I see a -- somebody standing there in the reflection in the window, you know?</span> <span id="s1124">And I turn around and I’m looking for the person.</span> <span id="s1125">It was me.</span> <span id="s1126">Didn't recognize myself, because my hair was cut, and I had this funny dress on, and here I am, looking -- looking around, I thought maybe there’s somebody, you know, there must be somebody in back of me, it wasn’t me.</span> <span id="s1127">And at -- suddenly I realized, it’s you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Was this a real shock to your system?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Yes, that was a shock, because you know, I had no mirr -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann Green.</span> <span id="s1131">This is tape number three, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: A transformation, yeah, I mean I had long hair.</span> <span id="s1133">Suddenly I -- I was -- we were lucky, our hair wasn’t shorn.</span> <span id="s1134">So -- you know, and I remember they cut it, and the shock was such, you know, it -- we was -- within a couple of hours that you came from -- want to call it normal environment into -- in -- into -- you know, just totally different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: So this is right upon arrival?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Right upon arrival, okay, you’re -- here I am.</span> <span id="s1137">I’m looking.</span> <span id="s1138">Who is this person?</span> <span id="s1139">And the shock to see it is me, and I was always very well endowed.</span> <span id="s1140">Here I had no bra on.</span> <span id="s1141">I mean, I just -- it ga -- it was -- I didn’t un -- I -- I -- I just did not comprehend that it is me right away.</span> <span id="s1142">I couldn’t und --</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: So what else went with this feeling?</span> <span id="s1144">I mean, this was obviously very different than anything else you’d already experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Right, I mean, th -- it -- it wasn’t life threatening or anything, it was just shocking.</span> <span id="s1146">It was -- th-the -- the sudden transformation, that was the -- the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: When did you receive the tattoo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Right at entry, you know, right when we were in the -- we undressed, I think -- we undressed, our hair was cut, went into the sauna, or even -- and I think we might even have gotten the to -- tattoo right away, cause wi -- went very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Do you remember your number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Can you tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1153">A7268.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: And would you mind telling me just this little story you mentioned when we weren’t recording, about describing or trying to tell young children, your children and perhaps your grandchildren what this number on your arm is all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: When -- I always felt that y -- very young children, or children as a rule, to tell them something adults can’t comprehend was not necessary to convey to them, so I told them that -- they wanted to know what my number was and I told them that when I was a little girl my mother didn’t want me to get lost, so that was my telephone number.</span> <span id="s1156">And they took that as -- a-as that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s1157">And as they got older, and they heard and they learned and they never questioned why I said that.</span> <span id="s1158">They -- you know, they were old -- when they learned and heard about the Holocaust, they were old enough to know that I didn't want to scare them or burden them, and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: And you said there was something that came up because Marianne has a similar number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Yeah, Mariani has it se -- A7265.</span> <span id="s1161">And they wanted to know how come that her telephone number and my telephone number is the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Did you ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Similar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Did you have to answer those kind of que --</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Well, at that point, you know, we told them, you know.</span> <span id="s1166">But they were already older, you know.</span> <span id="s1167">Because then they have heard, you know, the kids hear.</span> <span id="s1168">We think they don’t, but they do, and they might not talk about it, but they, at that point they apparently knew.</span> <span id="s1169">And whenever they ask a question I would answer them, but I would never elaborate, because whatever they wanted to know they -- they were told, but let them digest it so to say and if they want to know ask more.</span> <span id="s1170">And I -- I really feel that when they ask me to speak in the -- in the temple, I said, the children only have to be 13 or 14, and -- and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: That’s the same age you were when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Yeah, but I never give it -- I just felt, you know, the ol -- you know, as I said, I -- it’s so interesting because here they are, middle class house, you’re telling them you lived the same life and then they see movies and they hear, and then they look at you, and it’s very har -- it -- it’s really not something you can understand, you -- or imagine.</span> <span id="s1173">You can look at pictures or everything.</span> <span id="s1174">I’m -- as I have said before, and I’ll say it again, that even I can’t believe that al -- you can -- you can sink this low and come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Now, when you saw Marianne’s husband Otto going to this one side --</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: No, we had -- we had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: When -- when did you learn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: When we got into camp.</span> <span id="s1179">When we got in -- in -- into the blocks, you know, and we met other prisoners.</span> <span id="s1180">I mean, I once -- there was one lady who came in from Theresienstadt, and the chimneys were going and the smell -- I mean, you can -- when you -- when hair burns and when flesh burns, you smell it.</span> <span id="s1181">And she thought it was a bakery, because that’s what she was told.</span> <span id="s1182">All right?</span> <span id="s1183">So it’s really -- you know, it’s not only I who ca -- who, it’s -- it’s just some -- I mean, you see the smoke, you see the s -- you -- you have the smell, and she was told it’s a bakery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: But -- but you knew otherwise pretty soon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Oh yeah -- no -- well, of cour -- once you’re there, you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: And is that smell one of your most dominant memories of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1188">I ha -- I was -- when I came here and I married, and I had -- eventually had children, I wanted them -- I wasn’t ga -- I-I was not going to burden them with my background.</span> <span id="s1189">Since I can’t comprehend, there was no reason to -- t-to -- you know, you -- to do that, becau -- you have to eat that, because I didn’t have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s1190">I just felt that this wasn’t the right approach, so I never do -- dwelled on it, and I wanted tha -- I consciously, subconsciously, I wanted to lead as normal a life as one can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: And you think this did help you, this approach?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yeah, because I -- I don’t dwell on it, I don’t feel sorry for myself.</span> <span id="s1193">It’s a part of history I could have lived without, and everybody else could have.</span> <span id="s1194">But it happened, can’t be undone, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Did you ever at the time let your emotions get the better of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: I don’t think so, no, because I -- I -- everybody’s ho-ho -- every inmate hoped to get out, okay?</span> <span id="s1197">If it wasn’t tomorrow it was the day after.</span> <span id="s1198">You -- you -- I myself always -- I always -- I was invisible.</span> <span id="s1199">Stand, stand, sit, sit.</span> <span id="s1200">Three hours, two hours, it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1201">[indecipherable] brainless, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1202">It was just -- I felt that this was -- by looking at the situation I felt that this was the -- the only way to survive.</span> <span id="s1203">You tried to be well, you tried stay out of the hospital, and -- and that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: When did you learn what had happened to your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: When I came out, when we were liberated, when -- when I came back to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: You didn’t know what had happened to him at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: No, th-the -- we said, whenever we get separated, whatever we’ll be, we come back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1208">And -- and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: And -- and what did happen to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: I -- he went into tra -- he was in tr -- he went in trans -- into selection, he got gassed.</span> <span id="s1211">So they had -- they have -- the Germans are very good keepers of data.</span> <span id="s1212">They have -- every sa -- have -- I can’t find it, but I have it.</span> <span id="s1213">They tell you what transport they went in, they tell you when they went into the gas chamber, they know every -- everything is documented.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: At some point at Auschwitz you didn’t see him any more, but you didn't know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: No, I mean, and I -- once you ch-changed your working -- where we work station, he was sent someplace else, and they were sent some -- he worked on a -- on a -- it was like an Air Force base, but not active for flying, they were demolishing the planes which were shot down, which they can sal -- it was like a salvage yard or something.</span> <span id="s1216">I learned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: And how were you -- not that it’s possible to console someone, but did you spend time with Marianne after she learned about her husband, and was it possible to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: No, we did -- we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1219">I mean, we -- we found out, you know, later, but there was no -- ye -- you know, you were totally helpless, there was nothing you could do.</span> <span id="s1220">If you went into a -- a -- a depresh -- if you would have gone into a depression or something, it would have been detrimental to the -- to your -- to your own well being or survival, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1221">I don’t think we did it consciously, but s -- some -- because the dri -- at that point the drive to survive is incredible.</span> <span id="s1222">Even if the chances are small, you don’t realize that the chances are small.</span> <span id="s1223">You are a -- if you’re optimistic, you are going to get out and that’s it, you know, so the mind is a very, very complicated organ.</span> <span id="s1224">Is it an organ?</span> <span id="s1225">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: The brain, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: The brain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: I think the brain, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1232">It’s a very, very complicated part of the body.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Were you very worried about being selected as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1235">I mean, the last selection I went through was with Mariani and I was -- I had a rash, and this was a total no-no.</span> <span id="s1236">And so Mariani said -- we were falling back, so by the time -- you know, you did anything and everything, and I kept my clothes here -- I mean, you’re naked, but you have your possessions.</span> <span id="s1237">So I went and I -- so I should be -- with the whole thing, you know, a -- apparently they had enough, and here I was, and they gave me -- I showed them my number and he gave me a push like I almost no -- fell, you know, but they had enough.</span> <span id="s1238">You know, he didn't want me any more, and neither they didn’t -- and not Mariani either, so -- she was in back of me.</span> <span id="s1239">So that was that.</span> <span id="s1240">It’s -- it is t -- as the -- as the dice falls, that’s what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Were the living conditions, what were they like in your barracks where you were sleeping?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Yeah, the regular barracks, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Was it very cramped and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Yeah, I don’t -- I can’t remember how many we were, but we slept head foot, foot head, you know?</span> <span id="s1245">I think probably te -- I -- I really don’t know how many.</span> <span id="s1246">At least 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Were you with other Jewish women also from Austria, or where were they from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: No, w-we were -- I don’t really know where they all came from, but no, no, just -- we came in with the Hungarian transport.</span> <span id="s1249">When we came in the Hungarian transports were just coming in.</span> <span id="s1250">That’s why I have an A, because most -- most older Hungarian transports who had tattoos, got an A. I mean, they prac -- I mean, it was 11 months before the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Now, tell me about how you learned about your parents?</span> <span id="s1252">Did you learn something about their fate while you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: That’s also after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: No, also after.</span> <span id="s1256">There wa -- th-there was a transport came in and there was one woman from aus -- from Theresienstadt, and I ask her if she knew my mother, a be -- my mother had red -- very, very dark red hair, and so I described her to her, so she says, yes, she knew her, she walked -- she worked in the laundry, okay?</span> <span id="s1257">But she said, you know, she ca -- all right, this lady came to Auschwitz, she doesn’t know what is going to be.</span> <span id="s1258">And that was it, that’s the last I heard.</span> <span id="s1259">And my parents were th -- transported out, one of the last transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: To Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: And when did you learn about that finally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Not I -- not too long ago that I -- I don’t know how, when and where.</span> <span id="s1264">I don’t know if it was Debbie that we got a -- that sh -- that we received a -- the notice that on this and this date, they came to Auschwitz, and they were gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: So you never really knew for sure what had happened to them for many years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: No, no, I mean, that’s logi -- that -- you know, they did not survive, because if they would have survived, they would have come back.</span> <span id="s1267">And this was -- you know, this was their arrangement, whoever comes back, goes back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: So, there was this one person who gave you little breaks when you were working, but other than that at Auschwitz, were you working very long hours?</span> <span id="s1269">Was it very difficult work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Yeah, they -- we all did.</span> <span id="s1271">We stay -- I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1272">We went to what -- appelle, okay?</span> <span id="s1273">And then we went out to work.</span> <span id="s1274">And then we came back, I -- you know, time and days, I -- one go -- I -- we came back for a whatever, in the early -- late afternoon I suppose, and have appelle, have food and go to bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Did you ever get a day off?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: No.</span> <span id="s1277">What’s a day off?</span> <span id="s1278">We wouldn’t have known what to do with a day off.</span> <span id="s1279">No, it was -- it was -- it’s a -- it was detention, it was jail, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Did you feel any connection any more to the religion you’d grown up with, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: I -- how -- you know, it’s wa -- I -- I knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1282">I had no -- I had no -- I have no anger.</span> <span id="s1283">I didn’t ask why me.</span> <span id="s1284">And it was -- I mean, I would have never changed my religion, or you know, never given it a thought, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: I mean, did you pray at all while you were in au -- Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: To survive.</span> <span id="s1287">But not really pray.</span> <span id="s1288">Hoping rather than praying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: So you didn’t -- you didn’t necessarily pray to God during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Probably not.</span> <span id="s1291">Probably not.</span> <span id="s1292">You know, just -- I -- somehow religion never -- never -- never entered, you know?</span> <span id="s1293">The -- the one thing you -- you wanted was to survive.</span> <span id="s1294">How, when and where was up to God, right?</span> <span id="s1295">So it’s -- I really can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Were there any -- was there any way in which you observed any of the Jewish holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: No, you wouldn’t know when they were, unless somebody would have had a calendar someplace, or heard someplace, you know -- I mean, some people had entries to offices and things like that, and they would say, you know, today is -- whatever, okay?</span> <span id="s1298">Now I knew when I was selected to -- to leave, it was my mother’s birthday because somebody told me that it was October the 18th.</span> <span id="s1299">So I didn’t know when I -- you know, but that -- that’s about it.</span> <span id="s1300">It was just so happen, but y -- there was no time, you lose time, which is fortunate because you don’t, you know, th-that, there is no time.</span> <span id="s1301">You can’t tell a week from a month from a day.</span> <span id="s1302">Didn’t matter if it was Saturday or it was Tuesday, it’s [indecipherable] I mean, to me not anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Marianne said that you know, you had be very resourceful, of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: -- and even to learn to steal food.</span> <span id="s1306">Did you see that, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: No, I don’t be -- I never stole food.</span> <span id="s1308">I always watched that nobody steal from me, but I never stole food.</span> <span id="s1309">And -- and -- and -- and I bought -- you know, I would -- what is the word?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Exchange?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Yeah, trade.</span> <span id="s1312">But I -- no, I never stole food.</span> <span id="s1313">That’s the one thing I ta -- I would -- you know, you would be lucky and were able to help to carry the kettle, which meant that when you -- when it was all empty, you had the bottom, whatever was there.</span> <span id="s1314">But otherwise all you had to be was the last one in line to get the potatoes, you had all the peels, which was great.</span> <span id="s1315">But otherwise --</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Now, what was -- what was the situation with your health?</span> <span id="s1317">Was it changing a lot while you were at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: I went from 150 to maybe 70 pounds.</span> <span id="s1319">So when I got -- I was very sick when the -- when we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1320">I had -- I had diarrhea, and I had -- it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1321">To come from the bunk to the -- to the latrine was like you -- you know, you were lucky if you made it.</span> <span id="s1322">And we were liberated the [indecipherable] I think it was the 84th division, and Pa-Patton’s army, they were still coming down.</span> <span id="s1323">And they opened the gates and of course everybody went out.</span> <span id="s1324">And I turned around and I went back.</span> <span id="s1325">I ge -- I could have gotten trampled, but I -- it was so scary, because everybody pushed out for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s1326">And we had that -- it was very interesting because the camps for the north -- there were camps in -- further north, above our camp, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: And now you’re talking about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: About the work camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: And the name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: It was in Salzwedel, it was a -- a converted wire factory, but we made ammunition.</span> <span id="s1331">I -- I made hulls for bullets.</span> <span id="s1332">And it worked in a drum, and every so often a bullet would get stuck, you know a hull would get stuck, and I would let the machine run.</span> <span id="s1333">That was my contribution to -- but you had to be careful, because the guard would hear it if she was close by, so you had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s1334">But that was a -- it was like an achievement.</span> <span id="s1335">So anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: So just to go back, so we’re sort of finishing up when you were at Auschwitz, did you witness or have anything to do with any resistance activities there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1338">We just had to stand once, I don’t know for how many hours because somebody escaped.</span> <span id="s1339">And they brought him back and they put -- they ha -- they put him in a bunker.</span> <span id="s1340">Meaning a bunker was like y-you couldn’t sit, stand straight for -- I mean, I don’t know, I -- that’s what I was told, that you could not stand straight.</span> <span id="s1341">And we had to stand appelle.</span> <span id="s1342">And then once they hung somebody in front of everybody to show them what happened when you escape.</span> <span id="s1343">That was my whole --</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Do you think you saw these things and reacted emotionally, or do you think you were shutting down your emotions a lot of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: I think we shut it down.</span> <span id="s1346">You just shut off, because you cou -- you -- you had to.</span> <span id="s1347">You know, you -- if you wanted to survive, you could not -- you couldn’t -- you -- you just couldn’t wallow -- you couldn’t be -- wallop in it, you couldn’t -- and you could not come back to -- to a normal life if you would.</span> <span id="s1348">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Do you have any sense if most of the others around you were reacting similarly?</span> <span id="s1350">Did you talk with others about this sort of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: You know, I have very little contact with people who -- I-I just hear, okay?</span> <span id="s1352">Debbie has a friend, it was -- it’s -- oh, and his parents are survivors, and he looked at me, and he said, “How come you’re so normal?”</span> <span id="s1353">I didn't -- I really did not -- I di -- I -- so his wife to -- I don’t know if it’s his wi -- it -- both parents, I -- I really -- and she said, “I want you to meet my mother.”</span> <span id="s1354">And I said to Debbie, “Debbie, this is not -- I’m not doing this, you know?</span> <span id="s1355">I -- I don’t want to be rude, but at the same token,” I said, “I don’t need this.”</span> <span id="s1356">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Do you find it at all difficult, for instance in this interview --</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: -- bringing back all the memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1361">It’s been si -- it -- i -- it’s part of life which I could have lived without, we could all have lived without, but you can’t -- you can’t change it.</span> <span id="s1362">It’s been, and I -- you can’t let it take hold of you.</span> <span id="s1363">It’s been, it’s like when somebody pa -- dies -- when somebody passes away.</span> <span id="s1364">I mean, it’s not fun to have lost my husband, but that’s life.</span> <span id="s1365">He lived a good life, he enjoyed his children, he enjoyed his family, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1366">Maybe camp made me like that, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1367">I really don’t.</span> <span id="s1368">Sometimes I think there’s something wrong with me.</span> <span id="s1369">I really do.</span> <span id="s1370">But, as I said, that was -- my thing was that I did not want to mutilate my children, because I have seen people do it.</span> <span id="s1371">I have -- I have a friend who has -- was not in camp, whole family survived, and she mutilated her children.</span> <span id="s1372">For no reaso -- you know, it’s for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s1373">She has a tremendous amount of hatred towards the church, towards the people.</span> <span id="s1374">You know, you -- you can’t -- not everybody is responsible, you can’t make everybody responsible.</span> <span id="s1375">Sure, they -- it -- it didn’t need to be, but there was nobody to stop it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Do you feel hatred some of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: No, really not, really not.</span> <span id="s1378">It’s a -- whom do you hate?</span> <span id="s1379">You hate a phantom.</span> <span id="s1380">You can’t -- you can only hate when you hate one person, okay?</span> <span id="s1381">So you’re not really -- you can’t -- you can’t make everybody responsible, though they were, the great majority of the people were, okay, but that -- that’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s1382">That’s the way it is, right?</span> <span id="s1383">We haven’t learned.</span> <span id="s1384">And of course, because it was only Jews, nobody was really interested in helping.</span> <span id="s1385">I mean, we thought America was the great -- the -- the greatest th-thing God every created, right?</span> <span id="s1386">But as -- as -- as you go along, there is -- there is -- it’s still better than any other place.</span> <span id="s1387">So, that’s it, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: So, now when you leave Auschwitz, can you tell me -- you started to tell me before --</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: -- also tell me what happened at this point with Marianne.</span> <span id="s1391">She did not go with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: She -- Marianne stayed in Auschwitz, in poy -- in Birkenau, okay.</span> <span id="s1393">She was liberated by the Russians in January, we were liberated in May.</span> <span id="s1394">I think she went to -- she went in the [indecipherable] I believe it was, she told me, to Romania.</span> <span id="s1395">And from there she went -- I don’t know, to Vienna, I believe, or to Italy.</span> <span id="s1396">I really don’t know because her sister was in Italy, her brother was in Venezuela.</span> <span id="s1397">.</span> <span id="s1398">So I -- that -- I -- I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1399">I found my -- I -- I knew a sold -- an American soldier, Jewish and he went to Vienna, and I ask him to go to the Jewish agency to find if my -- if -- who is alive and who isn’t.</span> <span id="s1400">And I gave him the names and among them he found Mariani.</span> <span id="s1401">And she wa -- at -- in the time I think -- I believe she was a nurse in the Jewish hospital there.</span> <span id="s1402">And so he told her that I was alive in Linz.</span> <span id="s1403">I could not come down because the ru -- there was the Russian zone in between.</span> <span id="s1404">And finally I borrowed an I.D. card and I took the train, and I ba -- and I got through.</span> <span id="s1405">And the Russian -- you know, the Russians were coming into the play -- the train and look for I.D. cards.</span> <span id="s1406">The als -- the other danger was if they liked you they can take you out.</span> <span id="s1407">So here we were, okay.</span> <span id="s1408">So we went -- so I went and I went with another girl, and I get to the street where Mariani lives, it’s about 11 o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s1409">And of course after a certain time the doors are locked, and we -- you know, you have to ring for the super.</span> <span id="s1410">And here I hear footsteps on the cobblestones.</span> <span id="s1411">There were two Russian soldiers coming down.</span> <span id="s1412">And this was an encounter you really weren’t looking for.</span> <span id="s1413">So -- but finally what happened was I had pennies, and I so -- and I saw -- and I saw a light in the window.</span> <span id="s1414">And I knew what floor she was on, but I didn’t know if it was her window.</span> <span id="s1415">And suddenly she passed her window, so here I am throwing the pennies, and she finally realized, you know?</span> <span id="s1416">So she came -- she opened up and she came down just before they -- before those Russian came up, and I -- that’s how I me -- that’s how I met and saw Mariani the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Was it a very nice reunion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Yes, yes, that was a good reunion.</span> <span id="s1419">And th-this other lady who used to live with us, she survived, too.</span> <span id="s1420">And her mother survived, that was interesting.</span> <span id="s1421">And they were -- she -- at that time she must have been in -- in her 80’s and the husband was in her 90’s.</span> <span id="s1422">The father, I think, died.</span> <span id="s1423">But the mother survived.</span> <span id="s1424">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: What’s -- what’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Biamgauten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: And -- and when was she with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: She -- when we lived in the -- in the storefront, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Now when you -- so take me back to when you leave --</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: -- Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1432">When was this and tell me about this next journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: In October ’44, we were transported by cattle car, and it was up nor -- up in -- in northern Germany, it was -- so they -- they pitched three circus tents, huge, enormous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: All right, just to continue where we left off, you were telling me about tents that were put up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Yes, the tents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: And -- and where, exactly, is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann Green.</span> <span id="s1440">This is tape number three, side B. Okay, continue -- you were telling me about a storm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: It was a terrible storm, and the tent we were in collapsed.</span> <span id="s1442">Now, we were just sitting on straw, I don’t know how many hundreds of people in one tent, and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1443">And from there they moved us to Bergen-Belsen for a very short time.</span> <span id="s1444">I couldn’t tell you if it was a week, or two weeks, but our transport went to Salzwedel into an ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s1445">And there -- that was from October to May, when I was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Now at Bergen-Belsen, were you telling me something about Anne Frank while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: I an -- I heard only recently that she was on a transport where they housed them in huge tents before getting to Bergen-Belsen, so I said that that must have been the transport.</span> <span id="s1448">In Bergen-Belsen, be -- that was in the very, very beginning of Bergen-Belsen, I tho -- because there were just barracks there, we didn’t do anything, we just sat around all day long, and -- until we were transported to the factory.</span> <span id="s1449">And there we worked two weeks day shift, two weeks night shift.</span> <span id="s1450">As soon as the body got accustomed to -- to day shift, we went to night shift and the other way around.</span> <span id="s1451">But there we were only maybe eight or 10 girls in one room, and we had a -- was wintertime and we had a stove there which came in very handy because we used to wet the seams of our clothes and put them up against -- on the stove pipe, to steam it, to kill the fl -- to kill the lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: That seems very resourceful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: Well, that’s all we had.</span> <span id="s1454">That and DDT.</span> <span id="s1455">And -- a-and we worked.</span> <span id="s1456">We left in the morning and came hom -- and then that was really almost if you can call it luxury because we had a purp -- you know, we were indoors.</span> <span id="s1457">The only scary part there was apparently they knew that that was in effec -- there were als -- there were also French prisoner of war camps around there, and they didn't bomb us, but we -- th -- we mo -- they moved us into the -- into the place where they kept the ammunition.</span> <span id="s1458">It wasn’t very secure feeling, it wasn’t, because we -- we were right there, the whole thi -- if they would have ever bombed it, the whole thing would have gone up.</span> <span id="s1459">But they never bombed there.</span> <span id="s1460">They flew over, but they never bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: What did you know about the war at this stage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: We -- we -- we didn’t -- we knew it wasn’t going well because there was one elderly gentleman there who befriended one of the prisoners who was -- she converted from ju -- to Christianity and he was married to a Christian.</span> <span id="s1463">And he contacted her husband and he was the person who would always tell us, you know, it’s going good, or it’s going bad, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1464">So there we had some semblance of knowledge at the time.</span> <span id="s1465">But unfortunately somebody reported him, and I don’t -- he -- they jailed him.</span> <span id="s1466">I hope he -- you know, he was a real nice old gentleman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Did you remain optimistic during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: We were always optimistic.</span> <span id="s1469">We had to be.</span> <span id="s1470">If you wanted -- if you -- you tried to survive, and the only way to survive was to be optimistic that some -- something will -- Americans are wi -- go -- Americans are going to come, they’re going to -- the war is going to be over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Was it only other women working at this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Yeah, just women.</span> <span id="s1473">Was just -- yeah, there were just women.</span> <span id="s1474">We had the -- the German supervisors, you know, people who used to work in the factory before were supervisors, and of course we had the guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: How did they treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: There was no friction there.</span> <span id="s1477">There was no friction there.</span> <span id="s1478">I mean, I was told once -- I had -- I mu -- I don’t know what I did, I -- probably I let that thing run, and she told me that if I don’t -- if I keep it up I won’t be around long, so I was very careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: But on a daily basis --</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: Yeah, no, th -- on the daily, you worked, you -- no, you worked you -- you had your -- your lunch period, your -- you -- you were treated like a moral -- I mean, you were a prisoner, but you were treated like a worker.</span> <span id="s1481">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: And that’s considered a slave labor camp, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: Yeah, that was slave la -- I mean, it was all slave labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Do you receive reparations for having worked there?</span> <span id="s1485">Or do you receive, you know, restitution money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: No, I don’t get -- no, I don’t get anything from Germany, I have a -- I have a disability from Austria and I get Social Security from Austria because I -- because you know, I -- I never -- I never worked legally in Austria but they give me Social Security.</span> <span id="s1487">What is it, I think 300 some odd dollars a month.</span> <span id="s1488">And -- and when th -- when they first started to give ref -- reparation, I was going to send it back, I was so in -- I was so -- really, I was so upset, I said I’m sending it ma -- I think it was 500 dollars or something, and I was going to go and send it back and they said, you stupid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Now -- excuse me, I was reading -- I was reading in a survivor’s memoir about Salzwedel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: -- and read an interesting story about the water faucets in the camp, and I was wondering if you knew anything about this.</span> <span id="s1492">She wrote that the water faucets in the camp were wired with bombs.</span> <span id="s1493">Had you ever heard anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: No, no, that I have never -- I mean saw -- Salzwedel was a -- I mean, was luxury.</span> <span id="s1495">We -- I mean, we worked.</span> <span id="s1496">We were -- the f -- the food wasn’t food, but it was wi -- compared to -- to -- to Auschwitz it was, you know.</span> <span id="s1497">We were laborers, so they knew enough to give wa -- you know, we -- it was only soup also, but it was more a -- you know, we were laborers, they needed us at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: Was it difficult work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: No, I mean, I just monitored a machine.</span> <span id="s1500">The machine did the work.</span> <span id="s1501">You know, all they did was make the -- they stamped the hulls.</span> <span id="s1502">Some people probably had more, you know, heavier work, I was just lucky to get this machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: And was it -- you said it was only women, was it also only Jewish women in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1505">I think so.</span> <span id="s1506">Because when we would -- u-unless they came from other places too, I really couldn’t say that for -- the people I knew, you know, only the supervisors were old wor -- you know, the workforce from before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: And what about routines like there was also appelle and roll call at this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1509">I th -- no, we just came home, washed, went for food, went back.</span> <span id="s1510">No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1511">I don’t believe so.</span> <span id="s1512">Maybe they counted as we lined up for food, I really don’t remember, but I really don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1513">I cannot remember having to get up and standing outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: And now we get to the time of liberation, so tell me a little bit more.</span> <span id="s1515">I know you -- also you already mentioned people, the women, flooding the gate.</span> <span id="s1516">But what else are your impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: What do you mean flooding the gate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Oh yeah, going out</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: Rushing to the gate.</span> <span id="s1521">What other first impressions do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: My first impression was that we had -- all the guards from the other camps came to our camp.</span> <span id="s1523">They tore off their insignia and they also had prisoners come from other camps, they brought them down, but they themselves tore off all their insignia on their clothes.</span> <span id="s1524">And I have to say Americans treated them with kid gloves.</span> <span id="s1525">I -- it was absolutely revolting to watch.</span> <span id="s1526">Revolting in a way, in another way admirable, because the only -- wa -- the only incident happened, the cook, who was a German soldier, ran, and the guy in the turret shot him, and they let him lay there for I don’t know how many, a couple of days.</span> <span id="s1527">But that was the only -- how shall I -- incident which was -- that you say was any type of -- can’t say cruel, what happened.</span> <span id="s1528">But the -- the -- the camp commander, everybody was treated, it was just absolutely disgusting to watch.</span> <span id="s1529">I mean, I didn’t me -- y-you know, they weren't always -- they were -- weren't even treated as -- as -- as pris -- as prisoners or anything.</span> <span id="s1530">They were just handled with such -- almost they were guests.</span> <span id="s1531">It was disgusting to watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: And did they stay there, or did they just walk free, and walk out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1534">They -- they -- they were -- but they were -- it -- it was done in such a laissez-faire way, you know?</span> <span id="s1535">And of course there were someth -- you know, were peop -- jewi -- some of the prisoners who were in the office in work, they spoke for them and told them that they were marvelous and whatever else.</span> <span id="s1536">I mean, we weren’t mistreated, don’t misunderstand.</span> <span id="s1537">I mean, it was -- it was total luxury compared to before.</span> <span id="s1538">So that -- that was interesting and I wa -- something very funny happened.</span> <span id="s1539">As the troops were going through, I said it was so American.</span> <span id="s1540">I mean, they were young kids, you know, it was th -- practic -- the end of the war, and they must have got -- found food in farms or wherever, whatever they, you know, collected.</span> <span id="s1541">They u -- they threw eggs, cartons of eggs at us, we should catch them.</span> <span id="s1542">As the trucks were -- they were going very slow, I have to say, but as they were moving through, they were throwing eggs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Did a lot of eggs break?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: All of them broke.</span> <span id="s1545">And then they fed us and they made chicken soup with rice.</span> <span id="s1546">And it was more fat than soup, and I would say 99 percent the people got jaundiced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: How about you, how was your health?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: And I didn’t, because I didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1549">I was -- I was so sick that I -- I ca -- I mean, I was afraid to take anything in.</span> <span id="s1550">So you walked around, everybody was yellow.</span> <span id="s1551">It was -- it was funny.</span> <span id="s1552">It wasn’t funny, but it was funny.</span> <span id="s1553">And -- and it took me awhile to go out.</span> <span id="s1554">I waited until you -- you know the -- the flow stopped, and then I went out, but I had no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: And when you went out, that was the last time you saw that place, you just left?</span> <span id="s1556">Or did you come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: I -- you know, no, they transported us onto an Air Force base, and we stayed there for a couple of -- you know, time is very difficult to remember.</span> <span id="s1558">I don’t know if it was weeks or months.</span> <span id="s1559">And th -- and I was with Hungarian girls there, and -- and we went to ha -- we go -- we started to work at the British officer’s home, keeping house [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Where wa -- where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: In Hanover.</span> <span id="s1562">And from there I tried to get back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1563">You know, wh-when everything calmed.</span> <span id="s1564">And one day there was a bus going, and I took it.</span> <span id="s1565">And I ended up in Linz and I couldn’t go any further because there was the Russian zone in between.</span> <span id="s1566">So I looked for a place to stay.</span> <span id="s1567">I was with two other girls.</span> <span id="s1568">And I found a -- I found a room, and I found it -- and I looked for a job.</span> <span id="s1569">And I worked for the civil censor, which -- there was a -- the amer -- an -- a unit there which was all -- well, most of them -- most of them spoke German, and a lot of them were -- and one of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1570">And I ca -- I got the job there, and I was able to rent a -- the room, and I met a young man and a bi -- he -- and he said to me, what are you going to do here, you know.</span> <span id="s1571">And I had a cou -- I have a cou -- I have a cousin in Israel and he asked me if I wanted to come live on a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1572">And that’s the one thing I could not -- I couldn’t even imagine, living with people.</span> <span id="s1573">That’s the one thing I ga -- you know, I -- I just couldn't -- so I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s1574">And he said to me, what are you going to do here, you know.</span> <span id="s1575">So I said, well I don’t know, you know, I will see.</span> <span id="s1576">Go back [indecipherable] eventually I get back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1577">And he says, would you really want to live here?</span> <span id="s1578">So I said, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1579">So anyway, he wrote to his brother.</span> <span id="s1580">I remembered my mother -- my father’s sister, her husband came here, and I remembered the address of the brother he went to stay with in Brooklyn, Stillwell Avenue, and I knew the -- I remembered the number, don’t ask me today.</span> <span id="s1581">I remembered the number, and I knew it was Stillwell Avenue and it wa -- I knew it was Brooklyn, and I knew he had a plumbing business.</span> <span id="s1582">So anyway, this friend of mine, Paul, wrote to his brother, and his brother put an ad in the paper to look for him -- in Aufbau, the -- the German refugee paper.</span> <span id="s1583">And he, in turn, looked for my -- for my uncle, and he in turn got in touch with my mother’s uncle who eventual -- whose -- whose in-laws eventually sent me a visa, and I came here on the second boat crossing the -- crossing over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Now when was that and where did you leave from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: I left from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1586">I -- what happened is I worked, okay, and I went on vacation.</span> <span id="s1587">And I got a call from my landlady that the American embassy is looking for me.</span> <span id="s1588">And so I went -- got on the train and I went back and I contacted them, and they wanted -- you know, they told me that I have a visa to go, and they made an appointment for an examination, and I was lucky because I had silicosis, which I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1589">Wek -- you know, I didn’t know, I was -- I gained wek -- from 70 pounds I went to 150 so I was roly-poly, you know.</span> <span id="s1590">I didn't look sick, nothing hurt me.</span> <span id="s1591">S -- and I remember the nurse at the embassy, she listened and she listened and she listened, and -- but eventually she let me go.</span> <span id="s1592">S -- and I only found out when I came to the States, almost a year later, that that’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: How did you find out a year later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: How?</span> <span id="s1595">I was treated for -- they treated -- a year later they treated me for TB.</span> <span id="s1596">And sputum, everything was negative, but I was [indecipherable] they didn’t know, took x-rays, they see spots.</span> <span id="s1597">So I stayed in bed.</span> <span id="s1598">First I stayed in bed for six months, that didn’t help because I was do -- what happened was, when I weighed -- I mean, I came here, I weighed 150 pounds, you know?</span> <span id="s1599">I had a friend, a school friend from Vienna, and she was beautiful, she was tall, slim, blonde.</span> <span id="s1600">She looked at me and she said, nobody in America walks around like this.</span> <span id="s1601">So what’d she do, she takes me to a European doctor, a woman.</span> <span id="s1602">And she gave me ups, downs, ons and overs.</span> <span id="s1603">Pills.</span> <span id="s1604">I went down to 113 pounds, and I started coughing.</span> <span id="s1605">So I had to -- I went to the doctor, so they took an x -- they -- no, he sent -- so I went to the doctor and he said I have to go to a rest home.</span> <span id="s1606">And he sent me up someplace close to Monticello and I was -- I was the -- I was the youngest person there, everybody was recuperating, it was -- it -- it was from the workman’s circle.</span> <span id="s1607">I didn't belong.</span> <span id="s1608">Why -- how I got there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1609">And the nurse there said everybody should have an x-ray.</span> <span id="s1610">So I said, okay, I have an x-ray, I -- I had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s1611">Took an x-ray.</span> <span id="s1612">She brings it -- Liberty was a big TV -- TB center.</span> <span id="s1613">And the doctor looks at it, and he said, put her into the pavilion.</span> <span id="s1614">They had a t -- a TB pavilion up there.</span> <span id="s1615">And I picked up the phone and I called my husband, I said, can you pick me up?</span> <span id="s1616">He said, no I can’t, so I said, I’m taking the bus.</span> <span id="s1617">And I took the bus back to New York, and I went to my doctor and of course they treated me for TB.</span> <span id="s1618">Then, at the time, streptomycin came out, which was a very dangerous drug, and I -- they gave it to me, that was four injections a day for a week, three, two, and then one for two weeks.</span> <span id="s1619">I got that three times.</span> <span id="s1620">Nothing changed.</span> <span id="s1621">So, after six months, finally they decided I should go see somebody else.</span> <span id="s1622">And the woman worked for the city, and she says she wo -- she happened to be Viennese, and she said to me, get up, lead a normal life, and wait.</span> <span id="s1623">I did that.</span> <span id="s1624">And then I went to the Vincent Aster diagnostic center.</span> <span id="s1625">I don’t know if this still exists, but you -- you -- it’s -- you pay, but you get a specialist assigned to you, and I was lucky, and the man wrote his thesis on silicosis.</span> <span id="s1626">And he ada -- he diagnosed me and that was it, and he said, so and so many percentage die, somebody -- some recover somewhat and some recover.</span> <span id="s1627">And that was it.</span> <span id="s1628">And I thought -- and then -- and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: This was sort of a major health issue that kept following you around after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: In fact, in fact, somebody started a class action suit.</span> <span id="s1631">I didn't even know about it.</span> <span id="s1632">One day I got a letter that whoever produced the drug, I can’t remember any more, I will get a check because -- I didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1633">They must have -- I don’t know how it works, but apparently every drugstore knew at the time what drugs were administered to whom, so they found out that I got it too.</span> <span id="s1634">I think that -- I think it was a thousand dollars or something, at the time it was like I didn’t know where it came from.</span> <span id="s1635">But that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Now, to go back, I mean how was your health in the immediate aftermath of being liberated?</span> <span id="s1637">Were you able to rebound fairly quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Yeah, I rebound, I rebound, and I was careful, of course, right away what I was eating, and I probably went to a doctor or something.</span> <span id="s1639">That I can’t even remember any more.</span> <span id="s1640">But apparently it went away, and I started to gain weight and I went back up to 150 pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: And at liberation, can you describe some part of the feeling, and also the feeling of others around you.</span> <span id="s1642">Were people emotional?</span> <span id="s1643">Did you feel emotional?</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: Yes, but you know what?</span> <span id="s1645">He -- it was so -- something so totally -- you couldn’t comprehend it.</span> <span id="s1646">You know, everybody was pushing out, and I was in the middle, and -- and I just stopped -- I didn't wa -- you know, I just stood there and let everybody else pass me because I was so overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s1647">Ye -- it -- it was something you were waiting for, and when it happened, you were like stunned.</span> <span id="s1648">It was something you couldn’t -- I -- I don’t know why I wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s1649">It was just a reaction I had.</span> <span id="s1650">Probably security.</span> <span id="s1651">Because here I was in no man’s land.</span> <span id="s1652">I mean, I -- I didn’t know the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: I read in this other survivor’s memoir that in the town there were department stores, and that some of the prisoners -- the women from Salzwedel, from the camp, were going into the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: Yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Did you see this, or part of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: -- I saw that, I saw re -- soldiers doing it.</span> <span id="s1657">I saw people doing it.</span> <span id="s1658">It’s not my -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Did you go as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: No.</span> <span id="s1661">It’s not my temperament, you know?</span> <span id="s1662">I ti -- somehow or other I -- I -- it’s not me.</span> <span id="s1663">Yeah, I saw that, yeah.</span> <span id="s1664">This is the like the gurd -- th-the -- the -- the blockoma who knocked the kid off the bike for no reason at all, because what’s she going to do with the bike?</span> <span id="s1665">You know?</span> <span id="s1666">I mean, what that little kid ever do to her?</span> <span id="s1667">So, I mean -- if she would have [indecipherable] confront somebody, adult or something, you know, but to knock the -- I mean, she literally knocked the -- I see her in front of me.</span> <span id="s1668">And of course I had no use for her to start off.</span> <span id="s1669">You know, so -- no, that’s -- yeah, that’s the -- the -- I -- I would watch the soldiers go into apartments.</span> <span id="s1670">You know, once we walked on the street, and I would watch, but th -- I’d -- how shall I say?</span> <span id="s1671">I had no n -- I shouldn’t say I had no need to -- what -- wha -- what could you get?</span> <span id="s1672">I mean, you go in, what do you take?</span> <span id="s1673">You know, I mean, why?</span> <span id="s1674">So I -- I -- th-that wasn’t my thing.</span> <span id="s1675">I mean, I wa -- it just -- I -- I couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Were you talking with the American soldiers who liberated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: No, because they weren't -- th-they were stri -- it was strictly -- there was a war going.</span> <span id="s1678">I mean, they was going to the -- to take the next tow -- town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: So they kept moving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: They kept moving.</span> <span id="s1681">I mean, there was some left behind, okay, who -- the administration, but -- but that was it, you know.</span> <span id="s1682">And as I said, basically how -- how we got to Hanover I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s1683">That -- the reason, how they moved us, all I know is we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: And is there a point where you really felt finally free?</span> <span id="s1685">Was that still at Salzwedel, or a -- later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: You -- you feel free, but you have no place to g -- you don’t belong, you have no place to go.</span> <span id="s1687">What next?</span> <span id="s1688">You were still -- you lived -- you still lived with 20 girls.</span> <span id="s1689">You still -- your food was still given to you.</span> <span id="s1690">There wasn’t -- really no normalcy.</span> <span id="s1691">I mean, to -- you know, and you didn’t know when it’s going to be and how it’s going to be.</span> <span id="s1692">To me it was strictly that I was trying to get back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1693">I couldn’t, so I had to start in Linz, where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: When’s the first time you felt a more normal life again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: When I had a -- when I had a room.</span> <span id="s1696">When I had a room to myself.</span> <span id="s1697">And it -- you know, and they -- si -- it -- si -- since there was occupation, it was still not -- it was a sti -- it still wasn’t normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: That’s in Linz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: Is that when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: In Linz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: -- you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: Yeah, that was in Linz, because our association mostly was with -- it wasn’t with the population because if you li -- if you believe it or not, you were still the Jew.</span> <span id="s1704">And, you know, the two other girls, one Jewish, I don’t know where I picked them up, but they weren’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s1705">But we had nothing in -- you had nothing in common with the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Did you still feel some anti-Semitism at that time there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: Oh yeah, of course.</span> <span id="s1708">You go back you feel it now, you have it now.</span> <span id="s1709">You know, I mean, the Austrians are -- they were victims, they di -- were not -- believe me, I mean, they were definitely victims.</span> <span id="s1710">So -- I mean, this is why when I covered my number, I said I’m not going to give her the satisfaction, no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: So now you’re in Linz for awhile, and then you were telling me about -- it’s the person there who contacted --</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: -- the person in the U.S. --</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: -- your -- your family member.</span> <span id="s1716">But tell me about the rest of your journey within Austria from Linz.</span> <span id="s1717">Cause you went back to Vienna, is that right?</span> <span id="s1718">When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Yeah, we went -- but I -- I never settled there.</span> <span id="s1720">You know, I visited Mariani, I stayed with Mariani and I went back to Linz.</span> <span id="s1721">And she was in -- she was in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1722">I mean, she weve -- she from -- I think from Auschwitz, she’d been to Romania, or Bulgaria, I don’t remember any more.</span> <span id="s1723">And she came back, but I never went back to ve -- I mean, I went back, but I was ra -- I had a room.</span> <span id="s1724">I rented a room, I worked.</span> <span id="s1725">And -- and I -- a-and really didn’t know at -- I really had no -- no plans, I -- I wasn’t really thinking.</span> <span id="s1726">I-It was like empty.</span> <span id="s1727">And -- and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: Did you look for family in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: Oh yeah, that -- no, that -- you know, that was already -- that was already in 1945, okay, so definitely I mean, but nobody came back.</span> <span id="s1730">In fact, my -- my father’s two uncles -- two brothers weren’t even back then, and they came back much, much later.</span> <span id="s1731">In fact, they came back -- I mean, I was here already and I -- I found out from my cousin in Israel that her father and his brother came back, but they were, at that point, they w -- I -- you know, it’s so very difficult, when you’re young, everybody at a certain age is old.</span> <span id="s1732">So I have no reference to think how old they were.</span> <span id="s1733">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: When you visited Vienna like this, did you have any desire to return there and live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: If the family would have been there, or if I would have seen some reason to go there.</span> <span id="s1736">But at that point I already -- End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann Green.</span> <span id="s1738">This is tape number four, side A.</span> <span id="s1739">So you were saying about the idea of perhaps living in Vienna again after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: I na -- I don’t know if I entertained the thou -- the thought.</span> <span id="s1741">The problem was to -- to -- to establish yourself, to have a -- I -- I was not -- I had no schooling, I had no -- I -- I trained as a millinery, okay, for a-awhile.</span> <span id="s1742">At one point when my father was thinking of mic -- leaving, there was a woman, she gave courses in mil -- from -- in millinery, so I was sent there and I did that.</span> <span id="s1743">So f-for me t -- t -- job, you know, job-wise was a -- something I really didn’t -- at the -- at the time I don’t think I -- I was th -- I was -- was thinking anything through or planning.</span> <span id="s1744">You know, you never planned for so many years, so planning was not something you easily did.</span> <span id="s1745">You just like, wherever you fell, that’s where -- wherever you landed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: I know we’ve talked about your emotions throughout this period.</span> <span id="s1747">What were your emotions like when you realized your family members weren’t coming back to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: I was happy to see Mariani, but that was about -- I had no aba -- and gi -- at that poin -- you know, I think the camp does something to you.</span> <span id="s1749">And I had really no -- you know, you lived from -- from minute to minute, from hour to hour, so you were really not -- there was not this much emotion, you know, there was no -- you -- I mean, you did not -- you -- you -- you -- it wasn’t a psychologically normal situation.</span> <span id="s1750">And regardless of whatever, I suppose, subconsciously that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: So would you say you, unfortunately you weren't very surprised that your family members didn't return to Vienna?</span> <span id="s1752">Was that a shock for you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: Not a sho -- it -- it -- it was a -- it was -- it’s not a shock, you can’t say it’s a shock, because it was a -- a way of -- i-it was an ex -- i-it wasn’t an expectation.</span> <span id="s1754">You had to hope that they would return, but it was hope against hope, because that was not the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: It’s like you had to prepare yourself for so long that -- mentally that they wouldn’t return.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Right, because I mean nobody knew that you’re going to survive.</span> <span id="s1757">You hoped you would survive.</span> <span id="s1758">The last thing was we -- everybody will come back, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1759">But when -- when you realize the full -- the -- the com -- you know, what happened, you don’t -- you -- you realize that that’s -- that’s par -- that was part of the situation and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: When did it sink in for you actually, the magnitude of what had happened during the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: You -- when the realization, wh -- when you -- when you saw the whole thing, when you realized the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1762">And of course part you knew, I mean when you saw the -- the -- the -- the s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: Crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: -- the crematorium, when you saw the smoke and the smell, you knew what was going on, so you were almost prepared for it, because it was -- you know, you -- there were people even in camp that yo -- the underground worked.</span> <span id="s1765">And this one was working here, and this one was working there, and people were telling stories, so you had -- and -- and -- I see -- when you see the smoke and the smell, you -- you real -- you realize.</span> <span id="s1766">And then finally you also realize that when you go into the shower that you never know if you’re going to come out or not.</span> <span id="s1767">So that was a -- you walk in, okay, you don’t know what is coming.</span> <span id="s1768">So this is a situation which is -- which nobody can comprehend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Did you think very much about death during those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: No, because we -- be -- you gonna s -- you gonna survive because if you don’t feel that you’re going to survive, you’re not -- you know, it’s -- you can’t -- you just wouldn’t be able to function.</span> <span id="s1771">I mean, you walked the -- you -- you had -- you had no control.</span> <span id="s1772">You walked in.</span> <span id="s1773">Is the water going to come, or is the gas going to come?</span> <span id="s1774">Everybody knew at that point because we were there long enough to know.</span> <span id="s1775">You walked out, you were lucky.</span> <span id="s1776">Next time, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1777">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: -- I wonder what the kids are going to say when they hear this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: I think it’s -- it’s -- it’s good that you’ve been very open.</span> <span id="s1781">I really appreciate that, and -- and I’m sure your family will, too.</span> <span id="s1782">But I wanted to ask you, did you ever re-establish contact with the people -- any of the people who hid you in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: I tried to.</span> <span id="s1784">We -- when we went back -- no, I was in contact with the -- with the friends of my father, I was in contact [indecipherable] for awhile.</span> <span id="s1785">I’m a terrible, terrible -- I hate to write letters.</span> <span id="s1786">I think -- am I analyzing myself?</span> <span id="s1787">It -- it’s something -- a letter to me is a permanent thing, and I just hate to write letters.</span> <span id="s1788">I really do.</span> <span id="s1789">I’m a talker, I’m on the phone, I hate to write letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: You don’t like the permanency of the letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: I don’t know what I don’t like.</span> <span id="s1792">I just don’t like writing letters, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: And it doesn’t matter what language?</span> <span id="s1794">It’s not just that -- writing in English or a second language --</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: No, no, no, has nothing to do with this, absolutely nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s1796">I -- I can labor over a -- a sympathy card, a get well card.</span> <span id="s1797">Okay?</span> <span id="s1798">I mean, it’s the most idiotic thing there is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: So -- so you did have some kind of contact, but not -- not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: Oh yes, I had contact with them, and I send them things and all.</span> <span id="s1801">And then when we went to Austria, we stopped where the do -- where their daughter lived, and I rang her bell.</span> <span id="s1802">It was lunchtime, but she never answered, so I never saw her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Whose daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: The friends of my parents.</span> <span id="s1805">And th-they had a daughter who was married, and sum -- Summering, that’s a resort, and she lived there and she had a little store, I can’t remember what it was.</span> <span id="s1806">And I know she was married there and she divorced, and sh -- but she stayed there, and I ca -- I found out where she lives, and I ca -- went to the house and I rang her bell and she never answered the bell, so I walked away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: And did you ever hear of, or have contact with M-Ms.</span> <span id="s1808">Pukas, who hid you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: No, with her I had no contact at all, none at all.</span> <span id="s1810">When we went back, we stay -- we stayed in a hotel around the corner where I was -- where we were hiding.</span> <span id="s1811">In fact, the window looked down on the place, but it -- they tore everything down, so it didn’t look familiar at all.</span> <span id="s1812">It -- it was the weirdest, weirdest -- and so then I wa -- when I realized where I was, I went there, and those -- I tried to see the people who lived in the -- in the building next door -- it was an apartment house next door, out of bricks.</span> <span id="s1813">And nobody was home, so I couldn’t speak to anybody.</span> <span id="s1814">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: So then we get to the point where you get the news that you can go to the U.S..</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: Tell me a little bit more about the journey and arriving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: Well, the journey was we was se -- I was sent to a camp in Munich, a displaced person camp where they gathered all the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Do you know the name of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: No.</span> <span id="s1821">And there I made friend with a couple of people, and we got on the boat.</span> <span id="s1822">And we came here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Do you know when you left?</span> <span id="s1824">When you left -- you left Hamburg, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: I left Hamburg in -- it was in May.</span> <span id="s1826">It took 10 days to come here.</span> <span id="s1827">I think I came here on the 20 -- no, I got my visa on the 27th.</span> <span id="s1828">It was a -- I still ca -- I came here in May.</span> <span id="s1829">I came here in May, so the trip was 10 days.</span> <span id="s1830">I arrived, and we arrived like this -- we came on a merchant marine.</span> <span id="s1831">And it was six o’clock in the morning, the sun was up, and ev -- there were a thousand people on that boat, and everybody went to the side of the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1832">How we didn’t tilt is a miracle.</span> <span id="s1833">And we had a very interesting a -- episode on the pl -- on the -- on the boat coming here.</span> <span id="s1834">They also transported Germans, repa -- repatriates who were American citizens and decided to go back in the war to Germany.</span> <span id="s1835">Well, one of the men appa -- for whatever reason, jumped off into the propeller.</span> <span id="s1836">And -- course he must have been smithereens.</span> <span id="s1837">But we had to circle, I don’t know for how many days, I think it was.</span> <span id="s1838">Was a -- a -- the law that you -- they cannot leave.</span> <span id="s1839">So I don’t know how m -- it was -- I think it was either two days, or -- it was a long time, I mean, that they had to circle.</span> <span id="s1840">Of course they couldn’t find him.</span> <span id="s1841">And I wonder what he did that he got scared because we were almost here.</span> <span id="s1842">And then I arrived, and I got off the boat, and my two -- my mother’s uncle, and my uncle missed me, so -- so they put me on a -- on a bus, and they brought me to the Ansonia on Broadway and what, 74th?</span> <span id="s1843">The old Ansonia, I think it is a -- it is like a -- an apartment building now, it used to be a hotel.</span> <span id="s1844">And I wait -- th-they put me the end.</span> <span id="s1845">I had -- they contacted my uncle because they were looking for me, and so they told them that I was at the Ansonia.</span> <span id="s1846">And you know, by the time they came from the pier, I decided I wasn’t going to hang around there, I was going to go look at the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1847">I mean, I came from a big city, I wasn't -- I mean, I wasn’t a country bumpkin.</span> <span id="s1848">And I’m -- walk out, and I’m going down to the river, going toward west end.</span> <span id="s1849">Suddenly this lady, screaming and frantic.</span> <span id="s1850">I mean, she was responsible for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: And how old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: I was 20.</span> <span id="s1853">She is -- you know, she’s where are you going, you know, I [indecipherable] you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s1854">And she held me, and she wasn’t going to let go of me for the rest -- and then finally my uncle and my mother’s uncle came and picked me up.</span> <span id="s1855">That was my entry to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: It does seem you have an adventurous spirit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: Ah, yeah, I suppose so.</span> <span id="s1858">You know, I was there, there was nothing for me to do.</span> <span id="s1859">I wa -- I do the -- I did spe -- I spoke --</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: Oh, you already knew English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: Yes, I knew English, but I mean, not to the -- to the point that I could converse, you know?</span> <span id="s1862">I mean, I knew enough to say that I -- don’t worry about me, you know, I come from a big city.</span> <span id="s1863">But it was -- I mean, it was funny to me, it wasn’t funny to he -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Was -- was the whole journey coming to the U.S. exciting, or was there, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: It was -- it was -- we -- my -- to us, I -- I mean, it was adventure.</span> <span id="s1866">Everybody was seasick, but a few people were -- fe -- few people, among me, and we weren’t, so we ate.</span> <span id="s1867">Th-That ship carried enough butter for a 10 day journey.</span> <span id="s1868">They -- the third day they ran out, because you know, that was something we did not ha -- people didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1869">So I was introduced to peanut butter, I never knew what peanut butter was.</span> <span id="s1870">So -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1871">Th-The journey over here was adventure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: And tell me, how was, just in general, broadly speaking, how was the adjustment living here as a new immigrant, learning more of the language, going to school --</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: I -- I stayed with my mother’s uncle, and I -- I worked -- I worked where they made -- they don’t do that any more -- they made things for curling your hair out of leather, you -- there was a metal covered with leather and you rolled your hair.</span> <span id="s1874">And we -- I did that, and I got a Social Security card, okay?</span> <span id="s1875">And there was a number, so I tore it up because I wasn’t going to be another number.</span> <span id="s1876">No clue what it was.</span> <span id="s1877">Just shake your head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: No, it’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s1881">I mean, you -- obviously, and that’s something I wanted to ask you, you know, how do you feel that the war time and the Holocaust affected you in the future.</span> <span id="s1882">I mean, there can be countless ways, but are there some things that you could point to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: No, I c -- I really can’t.</span> <span id="s1884">I ca -- I can’t judge that.</span> <span id="s1885">I can’t judge that.</span> <span id="s1886">You can judge it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: Well, there are things that you’re obviously aware of.</span> <span id="s1888">For instance, that story to me says that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: You’re stupid --</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: -- because of your -- no, because of your experience at Auschwitz, you didn’t want to be considered a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: Un-Until today, I can’t remember my Social Security number.</span> <span id="s1892">I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s1893">Okay?</span> <span id="s1894">I t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: Are there other obvious things like that, that you see as sort of the impact of what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: Not rea -- no, not really.</span> <span id="s1897">I mean, this is -- this is dumb.</span> <span id="s1898">I -- it’s almost like a dumb revolt, okay?</span> <span id="s1899">Me -- I had no clue what the Social Security number is, I just -- I don’t know, what do I need it for?</span> <span id="s1900">And that was it.</span> <span id="s1901">That’s when I told the lady that it’s a free country, I can -- I can put my numb -- my name down anyplace.</span> <span id="s1902">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Did you feel free once you got to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1905">Beca -- that -- you know, there was no -- y-you also have to remember I -- you -- I had no -- he -- I wasn’t a real teenager because I always lived with fear.</span> <span id="s1906">Not -- not visible, but it was always there.</span> <span id="s1907">You can’t do this, you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s1908">You have to be careful.</span> <span id="s1909">So -- and then of course once you were marked, that was a whole different story, so you really couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1910">And for all intents and purposes I was a normal teenager.</span> <span id="s1911">And so probably that had something -- so when I came here, I was free.</span> <span id="s1912">And there were some Viennese people living across the street from my mother’s uncle and she was just a few years -- a year or two older than me, and she took me under her wing, and we -- you know, she knew people and we were just like other teenagers.</span> <span id="s1913">We weren’t teenagers any more at this point.</span> <span id="s1914">She took me to Jones Beach.</span> <span id="s1915">We went to Coney Island.</span> <span id="s1916">I was an hour late in coming home and my uncle was standing on the street with his pocket watch, you know.</span> <span id="s1917">And I said to him -- and he was worried about me, and I said, don’t worry, I come from a big city.</span> <span id="s1918">So I really -- I mean, once I was here, I felt a -- you know, I -- I had people to fall back on, and then I started -- I started to work as a trimmer in a -- in a millinery factory because I had a friend whose parents had a factory -- a hat factory in Vienna, and they were working there, so they got me a job there and I worked there.</span> <span id="s1919">And one day the boss came and he said to me to do -- to trim two hats.</span> <span id="s1920">It was already after hour, we had to wait for her husband because he had to finish some job to go out.</span> <span id="s1921">Anyway, he asked me to do two hats, and she helped me -- for to go to the post office for orders.</span> <span id="s1922">Next thing you know, the sto -- the s -- the shops -- th -- not the shop steward, whoever is in charge of -- okay, came in and told me that I did this, that and the other, and I can’t do that.</span> <span id="s1923">And I looked at her and I said, “Well why not, you know, I wasn’t doing anything,” I said.</span> <span id="s1924">“He asked me because he wanted it to go out before the post office closes.”</span> <span id="s1925">So she said to me, “That was not of your business.”</span> <span id="s1926">And from that point on, the union and I don’t work together.</span> <span id="s1927">Because I co -- I -- I couldn’t understand the logic of that whole thing.</span> <span id="s1928">I mean, the order doesn’t go out, you don’t get -- don’t get work, you sit there and twiddle your thumbs.</span> <span id="s1929">But that was the law.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: How did you meet your husband?</span> <span id="s1931">I think there’s a -- a -- a charming story, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1933">The couple -- you know, the people I’m tal -- telling you about, the mother and father and her -- their daughter.</span> <span id="s1934">They had a son who was married here and had family here, and I went -- I was going to Stuyvesant, okay, and I got lost in the crossover to take the west side train.</span> <span id="s1935">And there was a man coming down and I ask him how do I get to the west side train?</span> <span id="s1936">And he had a very heavy Irish accent, and as he is talking to me he is walking, and I had no clue what he was saying.</span> <span id="s1937">And Jack came along, and he addressed me in German and he said where I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1938">So I told him where I wanted to go, so he starts telling me that his family, his grandfather -- oh, his father came from a little town outside of Austria, close to the airport in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1939">How do you meet somebody from that little tow -- from that little village, okay?</span> <span id="s1940">It got to be that man, okay?</span> <span id="s1941">It had to be the -- the brother of this woman.</span> <span id="s1942">So -- so he want to -- a-and another thing, you have to remember, Americans couldn’t do no wrong.</span> <span id="s1943">Th -- and you’d spoi -- and also you talked to everybody.</span> <span id="s1944">I me -- because that is -- was the only way of -- there was no newspaper, there -- communication.</span> <span id="s1945">Did you -- you were there, did you ever meet somebody, so -- so he asked me if I wanted to go for ice cream, so I said sure.</span> <span id="s1946">And a -- a -- continuously I’m thinking that this is this -- this im -- person, you know, because he was telling me about the town and the temple and the this and the that.</span> <span id="s1947">I said, ho-how would you meet any other person who comes from that little tow -- it’s like a pin in a haystack in New York, okay?</span> <span id="s1948">And I never gave it a thought that the guy was living in Queens.</span> <span id="s1949">But that doesn’t mean anything, because he could be in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1950">So that’s how I met my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: And how long before you were married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: December, six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: That’s nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: So, six months and 60 some odd years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: So, I have just a few more questions and I think we’re -- we’re almost done.</span> <span id="s1956">So, I guess what I was trying to ask before -- I -- I -- I’ll say it a slightly different way, see if something else might come to mind.</span> <span id="s1957">Just in terms of what the long term impact that you feel you can see of the war and the Holocaust on your -- perhaps on your decisions -- for instance, you were telling me about consciously not wanting to dwell on things too much with your children.</span> <span id="s1958">That was a conscious decision --</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: -- of yours.</span> <span id="s1961">Are there other things, either in terms of, you know, your career, work, f -- religion, other family issues.</span> <span id="s1962">Things that you feel that the Holocaust really affected you, and affected your decisions in those areas of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: I th -- I think the only -- the only thing which affected me, I would say -- but I would have never, ever changed my religion that -- although the question -- so maybe, you know, more -- being more active, rather than a -- than m-more -- you know, than just saying yes, I’m Jewish and I’m going for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1964">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: That because of what you went through you feel more connected?</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: No, I felt that the children should -- not I. I had -- I had my -- I -- I was -- my Jewish education so to say, or exposure.</span> <span id="s1967">But no, for the children to know, and as I said, when they were old enough, they -- they learned, and that was -- always was important to me.</span> <span id="s1968">But I didn’t -- I -- they wa -- they -- I did not want them to -- to feel responsible for -- for what I -- what -- what ma -- what I went through, or what I experienced.</span> <span id="s1969">And as I said, I did not -- De-Debbie went to Israel, I remember for -- for -- after high school graduation, and there was one week where they did nothing.</span> <span id="s1970">They went -- I don’t know if they went on a kibbutz or whatever, it was all Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1971">And she called, and says, “I’m Holocausted out.”</span> <span id="s1972">So I said, “I don’t blame you.”</span> <span id="s1973">You know, tha -- it was too much, and she was already 18.</span> <span id="s1974">So -- no, I really don’t -- I can’t really say that -- not momentarily anyway, that -- I would have to think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: And the idea that you had to live with a certain type of fear or anxiety for so much of your youth, when did you feel that you really broke free of -- of that -- of that situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: Th -- I -- I -- I si -- there is still a c -- a certain respect for auth-authority.</span> <span id="s1977">I never forget I was hailed down by a policeman once who needed to go someplace and wanted me to drive him.</span> <span id="s1978">And when he -- that -- I was here very short -- I mean, at -- at -- at -- was -- no, I d -- I didn't dri -- I didn’t drive for -- was -- didn’t drive for a very long time.</span> <span id="s1979">And he flagged me down, I was in absolute -- I broke out in a sweat.</span> <span id="s1980">And I mean, I ne -- I didn't do anything, you know, it -- he just said for me to [indecipherable], just the uniform in itself.</span> <span id="s1981">But an -- I hav -- I don’t have that now.</span> <span id="s1982">When they stop me now it’s for a ticket.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: And I believe your husband was not a survivor, he was born in the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: No, he was born here, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: And if you would just tell me, just briefly about your friendship with Marianne?</span> <span id="s1986">It has continued in this country, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: Yes, yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1988">I mean, at the moment if it wouldn’t be for us, she wouldn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s1989">Because for some [indecipherable] whatever reason, she has a second cousin who has absolutely no interest or whatever, in her.</span> <span id="s1990">And it’s sad, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: How long have the two of you been friends now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: Well, since I’m -- I’m -- I’m 80 now, and I was 13 then.</span> <span id="s1993">[indecipherable] math?</span> <span id="s1994">Right?</span> <span id="s1995">That says -- 65 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: And when you spend time with her, do you -- the two of you reminisce about this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: We -- we can tal -- when we -- it is always that it is a miracle that we can -- we will -- we will always only pick the fun, okay?</span> <span id="s1998">I mean, we bo -- about sad, we don’t have anything to talk about.</span> <span id="s1999">I mean, we laugh about things, okay, which happened, which come up.</span> <span id="s2000">Sometimes they’re revelant to something and I will say, do you remember?</span> <span id="s2001">You know?</span> <span id="s2002">So it is not -- maybe there’s something wrong with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: Maybe that’s the way you’ve, you know, been strong and -- and held things together for so long, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: I -- I -- I don’t know, I mean you can’t -- you can’t say it is because I was young, because Mariani was older than I am.</span> <span id="s2005">And then you meet people who were -- who just can’t let go, for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s2006">But life goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: But when the two of you get together, you do reminisce, but often about the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: No, no the -- I mean, you know, I me -- I mean there were times I used to call her every single day when she was still -- when she was not -- when she could see it, and she was alone, so I would call her every single day, and talk to her, you know?</span> <span id="s2009">And here and there we would, you know, laugh about something.</span> <span id="s2010">I mean, she will tell -- she will tell you when she bought me my first high heeled shoes and I couldn't walk in.</span> <span id="s2011">So, you know, things like -- we had -- as I said, we will say, you know, it’s a miracle that ha -- all things said and done, you live a more or less normal life.</span> <span id="s2012">That’s -- whatever the norm is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: With a healthy does of humor, it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2015">I mean, if you don’t have any -- if you’re not -- if you don’t have humor then you -- it’s -- that is not -- you can’t survive in any situation, you know?</span> <span id="s2016">So that’s it, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: I think that’s -- that’s all my questions.</span> <span id="s2018">Do you have anything else you’d like to share?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: No, just that I was very lucky that I was only in camp for 11 months, a-and maybe that is what helped me to survive, because you don’t know what time would do to you.</span> <span id="s2020">It’d be much more hopeless than -- than a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: So I guess you would perhaps take the attitude that even though you got caught while you were in hiding, you were fortunate to stay in hiding as long as you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: Definitely, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: I think I have one more question for you.</span> <span id="s2025">This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann Green.</span> <span id="s2026">This is tape number four, side B. Just wanted to ask you if you ever have any dreams, or nightmares related to this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: No, no, no, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: And what about during any of those years?</span> <span id="s2029">During the war time and Auschwitz, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A: I don’t think so, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2031">I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s2032">I really can’t remember.</span> <span id="s2033">I don’t remember having nightmares.</span> <span id="s2034">I really don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: And the way in which you say you don’t want to dwell on the memories --</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: I nev -- I never did, and I -- I don’t think that I ever dwelled on a day to day basis what is going to be tomorrow.</span> <span id="s2037">Whatever was going to be tomorrow, we face it tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: And have you continued that attitude toward life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: More or less, yes, more or less.</span> <span id="s2040">Because there is a be -- you know, to look into the future, you worry today and tomorrow something different.</span> <span id="s2041">I mean, it’s human nature, yes, we do worry.</span> <span id="s2042">I’m not saying I’m not worried about certain things and drive myself crazy over nothing.</span> <span id="s2043">But most of the time you were -- you -- you tried not to.</span> <span id="s2044">Even if my children say I’m neurotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: Well, I want to thank you for -- for agreeing to be interviewed.</span> <span id="s2046">Very much appreciate that.</span> <span id="s2047">And now this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ann Green.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">End of Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509 PAGE 2</span></p></body></html>
