id="s36">A: I can tell you from 1939, when the Polish army was destroyed from the Russians.</span> <span id="s37">This was exactly out of Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s38">The Russians want to catch up with the Polish army, and the Polish army settled in our town to rest.</span> <span id="s39">The Russians sent out leaflets to surrender, and they didn’t give up, the Polacks, so they sent over 25 airplanes, over Gorodok, and they start throwing fire bombs, and they destroyed all the houses, and the Polish army.</span> <span id="s40">So we’re left without a home!</span> <span id="s41">So we have to move out from this town to Mukacevo ,and there we stayed with Soviets till the Germans came.</span> <span id="s42">The Germans came in 1941.</span> <span id="s43">The first year, 1941, they gathered all the men and they said they’re taking them to work.</span> <span id="s44">And they prepared pits, graves, and they killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: How did you receive information of these events?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: From Ukrainian people, because they took the Ukrainians to help them do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Did you have any contact with gentiles during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: In what kind of setting?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: We had contact, because my husband hears that they’re gonna take men to work.</span> <span id="s51">So he’ll flee.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: He fled?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yes, he fled to Gorodok, where we lived before.</span> <span id="s54">And then he took me over.</span> <span id="s55">The gentiles, they drew up a petition that he can stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: How did you come in contact with non-Jewish people?</span> <span id="s57">Was it in the home or in business?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: My husband was a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s59">He worked for them free.</span> <span id="s60">That’s why they let him stay.</span> <span id="s61">Otherwise they wouldn’t let him stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Were these the Polish that let him stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: The Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s64">This was a town, all Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Were you aware of any anti-Semitism around you, or as it may have affected other Jews in your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: There was a lot.</span> <span id="s67">Ukraine, there was good people and bad people.</span> <span id="s68">Police, especially, was bad, because the Germans, they promised them to help establish a Ukraine country.</span> <span id="s69">That’s why they helped the Nazis to kill the Jews.</span> <span id="s70">And a lot of them, before, they were anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s71">A lot.</span> <span id="s72">Where we have lived for all our years in this town, and it happened.</span> <span id="s73">Murder!</span> <span id="s74">It happened, like all over, murders for money.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Jewish business people were murdered?</span> <span id="s76">Was that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes, Jewish business people were murdered.</span> <span id="s78">For money.</span> <span id="s79">From the Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: did your relatives live outside of your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s82">They lived in other town, in Mukacevo.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: To your knowledge, what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: The same what’s happened to everybody.</span> <span id="s85">In 1941, it was a blitzkrieg, so the Russians ran further back.</span> <span id="s86">So some young people, they run with them, a lot of people, and they survived in Russia.</span> <span id="s87">A few cousins of mine survived, because they went then to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Then what happened after you left your home town?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: We stayed in Mukacevo till they gathered us into a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Where was the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: In Mukacevo.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: In about what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: That was in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: And what was life like in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: In the ghetto was a miserable life.</span> <span id="s96">You cannot go out too far in the city.</span> <span id="s97">You cannot walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s98">We wore Mogen Davids from the beginning, a white Mogen David on our arm.</span> <span id="s99">Then, after a while, they put yellow patches, small yellow patches, in the front and in the back.</span> <span id="s100">And our houses, eight inches, patches on every Jew’s house.</span> <span id="s101">To recognize.</span> <span id="s102">My brother went out once, was walking on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s103">They took him to the police station, beat him up terrible.</span> <span id="s104">The shochetim, they’re not allowed.</span> <span id="s105">You know what a shochet is?</span> <span id="s106">What makes the beef kosher?</span> <span id="s107">So we just have to leave it.</span> <span id="s108">Eat vegetable, bread.</span> <span id="s109">And it was not allowed to go out, to buy by the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s110">We suffer hunger.</span> <span id="s111">The only thing, my husband was out of the city, like I told you, and he used to send food over to me, and I helped others with this.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: And what were you doing then in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s113">What was your day like in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s115">I had my parents, I had my sisters, my brothers, my whole family, back together.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: What was the reaction of the other people in the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: The reaction was sad, very sad.</span> <span id="s118">We knew that something is hanging over our heads, and we couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s119">My sister was living in a small Ukrainian town.</span> <span id="s120">The Nazis came and they took my brother-in-law, and they pull him to a wagon and they drag him all the ways till he fell dead.</span> <span id="s121">And the children, they got so scared.</span> <span id="s122">The one boy, he got so sick, stomach, so I sent.</span> <span id="s123">Some doctor says to go out and find -- you know what piafkes is?</span> <span id="s124">It’s like little snakes, blood suckers, and a policeman caught me.</span> <span id="s125">He says, “ Where are you going?</span> <span id="s126">To the partisans?”</span> <span id="s127">I says, “ No, I want to save my sister’s boy.”</span> <span id="s128">I’m carrying these blood suckers.</span> <span id="s129">But it didn’t help, so after a while, they called the doctor, and the doctor gave him an injection, a milk injection, and he got well.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Were there discussions about fleeing or staying in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: There was very little.</span> <span id="s132">We weren’t organized, you know.</span> <span id="s133">That was the trouble.</span> <span id="s134">.</span> <span id="s135">The last minute, the last two weeks before, some people fled.</span> <span id="s136">And there was a forest man, and he took them in.</span> <span id="s137">Whatever Jew came to him, he saved them.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: What actions did the German forces take in the early months or years of the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: What action?</span> <span id="s140">I’ll tell you what!</span> <span id="s141">They asked for gold, silver, fur coats.</span> <span id="s142">Even the metal, all kinds of metal, they took.</span> <span id="s143">They ask contributions, and work, work.</span> <span id="s144">My husband worked -- it was summertime -- haystacks, hay to pack in stacks.</span> <span id="s145">So he asked that Nazi, “What are you going to do if is a good worker?”</span> <span id="s146">He says, “he best Jew will be the last one.”</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Can you recall any specific anti-Jewish measures or legislation by the occupation?</span> <span id="s148">By the Nazis, or the Ukrainians, or the Poles, against the Jews during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: That’s what I told you.</span> <span id="s150">It was not allowed to shecht, slaughter.</span> <span id="s151">And not too much to observe.</span> <span id="s152">Like my husband went on Shabbos to shul, and one of the Communists says, “Puchtick?”</span> <span id="s153">My husband’s name was Puchtick, not Porter; we changed it in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: What was your knowledge of the outside world, other ghettos, mass killings or concentration camps, during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: We knew what was going on in Poland.</span> <span id="s156">A lot of Polish Jews came over from Poland, and they told us.</span> <span id="s157">Just, we didn’t believe it!</span> <span id="s158">We knew something is going on.</span> <span id="s159">You live in fear.</span> <span id="s160">But we didn’t believe what’s gonna happen.</span> <span id="s161">The main thing, we weren’t organized.</span> <span id="s162">Was no leader to organize, to do something.</span> <span id="s163">Everyone, if he fled, he fled by himself, like, not knowing where you go, and what you’re gonna do.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: So how long were you in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Months.</span> <span id="s166">They didn’t keep us too long in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s167">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s168">This was the last of 1942, so they chased us out from one ghetto to the other ghetto, and we knew that this is the last of our life.</span> <span id="s169">It was on a Friday afternoon.</span> <span id="s170">They put us in the middle of the street, and they count, and they chase us in a different street to be all together, because they gathered all the Jews together.</span> <span id="s171">Was more women than men, because the men they killed right in the first year when they came.</span> <span id="s172">And then on Shabbos morning, they took everybody (whispering) to the graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: And then what became of you, after they took the other people to the graves?</span> <span id="s174">Where did you go then?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: I went with them, together.</span> <span id="s176">A cousin of mine was living in this street, so I said to my sister, let’s go and see this cousin, what they are doing.</span> <span id="s177">Maybe we can do something.</span> <span id="s178">And I said to the people, “Let’s burn the houses and run!”</span> <span id="s179">I said, “Let’s burn the houses, and when it’s a fire, maybe they cannot kill everybody.</span> <span id="s180">Let’s run into the forest.”</span> <span id="s181">Nobody listened to me, so I went out with my sister.</span> <span id="s182">Then we met a policeman, and she said, “ No, I’m afraid to go.”</span> <span id="s183">She went back to the house, and I went into this cousin’s house.</span> <span id="s184">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s185">So I don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s186">I see a barn, an open barn, was standing near this house.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Was this in the ghetto or outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: The ghetto.</span> <span id="s189">So I went into this house, and this was already on Friday night.</span> <span id="s190">And I sit in a corner.</span> <span id="s191">And I saw, in the morning, that my cousin went out from some place.</span> <span id="s192">She went into the house to take some water, and she went back.</span> <span id="s193">So I saw her going back to this special place, and I was sitting all day Saturday in this barn, and the Nazis and police coming in, and out, in and out.</span> <span id="s194">And they didn’t see me sitting.</span> <span id="s195">Late, after, I went out, and I went to this place, and I called -- her name was Pessel -- and I said, “ Pessel, this is Feiga!”</span> <span id="s196">And she answered.</span> <span id="s197">This was early Sunday morning, maybe about three o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s198">I climb up under the partition, and we decided to go down.</span> <span id="s199">It was quiet already.</span> <span id="s200">We climbed down, crawled maybe about two blocks, on our hands and knees.</span> <span id="s201">We went into the forest, and we came to this Polack, and he took us in, in this forest.</span> <span id="s202">We stay a couple weeks…</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Out in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Just in the woods.</span> <span id="s205">Just like that.</span> <span id="s206">Without food.</span> <span id="s207">We used to go out at night and pick potatoes from the fields and bake them outside.</span> <span id="s208">And after a while, they find out there is Jews in this area, so Nazis came, and police, and they want to surround us.</span> <span id="s209">So we flee, and they didn’t catch us.</span> <span id="s210">After a while, I find out that my husband is alive.</span> <span id="s211">Three boys came to find out what’s happened, maybe somebody is alive in their families.</span> <span id="s212">So they took me, and they brought me over to my husband.</span> <span id="s213">My husband was already with partisans, Jewish partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Where was he located?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: He was in the same area, in the woods.</span> <span id="s216">About 30, 40 miles farther.</span> <span id="s217">A Ukraine person gave him a rifle, 150 bullets, and two grenades.</span> <span id="s218">So they kissed the grenades and his rifle, when they saw it -- this commander, this group.</span> <span id="s219">He was all ready.</span> <span id="s220">This commander, Krug, he was a Communist, so he was afraid to stay.</span> <span id="s221">But he went to Kiev, and from Kiev they send him back to his town, and say, “ You go back and you have to organize underground people to fight against the Nazis.”</span> <span id="s222">So he organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Who told him that, the Communists?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: The Communist leaders in Kiev.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Kiev is in Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Kiev was Russia.</span> <span id="s227">So he came, and he started organizing the nearest to him, to his town.</span> <span id="s228">He started organizing the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s229">And then after a while, the Russian army left.</span> <span id="s230">They had to go to the forest!</span> <span id="s231">And they started fighting against the Nazis, with bombs.</span> <span id="s232">They made bombs, into the rail tracks, put in bombs to destroy the trains, the Germans.</span> <span id="s233">And electricity they destroyed.</span> <span id="s234">And then when they were stronger, the partisans, they went on to police stations -- destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: And what were you doing all this time when they’d leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Me?</span> <span id="s237">I was a cook.</span> <span id="s238">I was cooking for the partisans.</span> <span id="s239">(Shows photo in book) See, here is this Polack.</span> <span id="s240">He saved a lot of Jews in his forest.</span> <span id="s241">This is Slovik.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Cassimir Slovik.</span> <span id="s243">And this is from a book entitled, Jewish Partisans: A Documentary of Jewish Resistance in the Soviet Union During World War II, Volume Two.</span> <span id="s244">And it’s complied and edited by Jack Nusan Porter.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: This is my son.</span> <span id="s246">Jack Nusan Porter is my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: And it’s published by the University press of America.</span> <span id="s248">So what was your husband doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: My husband was going every night on duty, like I told you, on police stations, with a group.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Blowing up police stations?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Blowing them up.</span> <span id="s252">Bridges blown up.</span> <span id="s253">Electricity destroyed.</span> <span id="s254">And laying mines under the tracks.</span> <span id="s255">Things like that.</span> <span id="s256">In winter we used to sew white robes, they shouldn’t recognize.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Do you remember any events?</span> <span id="s258">Do particular events stand out in your mind during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Events?</span> <span id="s260">1942, the Nazis in the Ukraine, they came to our forest, and they wanted to destroy us.</span> <span id="s261">We had a connection with Ukraine, and they let us know, so we moved out into a different forest.</span> <span id="s262">In 1943, they did the same thing.</span> <span id="s263">We have to move out, to a different place.</span> <span id="s264">And then, I’ll tell you, when the front was going farther and farther -- near Moscow -- their leader, Nacerkev, he was an anti-Semite, a nationalist, he wanted to destroy the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s265">So he sent away our commander, Krug, on a duty, and he wanted to undermine our camp and destroy us.</span> <span id="s266">His Adjutant came over secretly and he told us what is going on so we should keep our guard double, and not to sleep, and to be awake.</span> <span id="s267">So in a couple days, what’s happened, is that our commander has to stay one day in a different group of partisans, and that day a lot of Germans came and wanted to destroy them.</span> <span id="s268">They didn’t know where to go, so he brought ‘em over.</span> <span id="s269">On the third day, he brought all this group, partisans, to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Were these Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: The Jewish and non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s272">Was a mix of Jewish and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s273">So it’s happened, a miracle.</span> <span id="s274">He couldn’t do anything, that leader, that Nacerkev.</span> <span id="s275">You understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: You better explain it to me.</span> <span id="s277">Was it because there was non-Jewish people in there, and he didn’t want them?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: There was non--Jewish people, but most of it, Krug’s group, was Jewish, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s279">That’s why.</span> <span id="s280">He wanted to kill all the Jewish, and to be free of the Jews.</span> <span id="s281">He was an anti-Semite, a nationalist.</span> <span id="s282">But you know what happened?</span> <span id="s283">He sent over a different leader, and they wiped him out.</span> <span id="s284">They killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: They killed this anti-Semite?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: So then how did things go for you after they sent in the new leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: It was better.</span> <span id="s289">Was much better.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Any other events that you can remember that the partisans were involved in during this time?</span> <span id="s291">Can you remember any specific things that they blew up?</span> <span id="s292">Any places?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s294">I remember they blew up these police stations.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Any of the villages, you remember they were in, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: And some villages, they knew they are against the Jews.</span> <span id="s297">When the Germans came in, they gave permission for three days to rob the Jews, the houses.</span> <span id="s298">They cleaned up everything!</span> <span id="s299">And so we knew what that kind of people did to us.</span> <span id="s300">The partisans went to those people, “We need clothes.</span> <span id="s301">We need food.”</span> <span id="s302">So we took from those people clothes, food.</span> <span id="s303">And some of them they killed, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: During the time you were with the partisans, were you getting any news about how the war was going?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s306">They used to come from the headquarters and let us know what ours do in the war.</span> <span id="s307">So many tanks destroyed, and where they are, and what they’re doing.</span> <span id="s308">All was through the radio, and headquarters, from the partisans, they let us know the news.</span> <span id="s309">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s310">We knew.</span> <span id="s311">And in 1943, they send by planes ammunition and clothes for our forces, the Russians.</span> <span id="s312">I went with my husband to see exactly.</span> <span id="s313">By parachute they threw down.</span> <span id="s314">They made three or five clusters of fire, they should know where we are, where to throw.</span> <span id="s315">That was the sign, you know, to let ‘em know where, exactly which place, where to drop it.</span> <span id="s316">So they dropped ammunition and clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: This must have been quite a boost to the morale of the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s319">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s320">This was.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Did this allow you to do some things that you hadn’t been able to do before, in terms of resistance, fighting, with the new supplies?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: I don’t think that it was able to do so, because the war was going on, and it was too hard to deliver.</span> <span id="s323">Just one time they delivered these packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: When did you become convinced that the war was kind of coming to an end?</span> <span id="s325">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Well, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s327">This was in spring, 1944.</span> <span id="s328">They let us know.</span> <span id="s329">(Sighs) It was so sad.</span> <span id="s330">We cry, and we kiss each other.</span> <span id="s331">We didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s332">Before, we were afraid maybe the Russians will go through our forest, their whole Army will run through the forest, not the main streets.</span> <span id="s333">But they didn’t.</span> <span id="s334">And when we find out that we are free, we didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s335">We cry and say, “ Where are we going?</span> <span id="s336">And what are we going to find?”</span> <span id="s337">I knew that all my family was destroyed, four sisters, and four brothers, my parents, their children.</span> <span id="s338">My parents, they had already 16 grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Was there any discussion about going to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: That time was impossible.</span> <span id="s341">After the war, when we came out, we decided only to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s342">We didn’t think to go to America.</span> <span id="s343">Nowhere else, only to Palestine.</span> <span id="s344">And the Zionist organization was working so hard, to organize people to go underground to go into Palestine.</span> <span id="s345">And it was not so easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Because they didn’t give certificate.</span> <span id="s348">And to go from Russia was not so easy.</span> <span id="s349">Was still under occupation, Nazi’s occupation, until 1945, you know.</span> <span id="s350">When we were already out of the forest and we are living near Rovno, my husband could make out partisans’ passport for some people to travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: He made those himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s353">It was a partisan group, so you could make out those passports to give to people.</span> <span id="s354">Like example; From Munkatch, two people, they were working for the Nazis -- you know, workers -- so they came to Rovno, and my husband arranged for them work.</span> <span id="s355">One was a sefer, one was a watchman.</span> <span id="s356">And after a while -- Munkatch is in Czechoslovakia -- they gave them partisans’ passport, and they could travel home.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Did you and your husband get these passports, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: My husband could make it.</span> <span id="s359">It was our office, our office and the Russians together.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Was he working in the office?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: No, my husband was working in an office where you took raw fur, raw skin.</span> <span id="s362">The Ukraine used to bring the raw skin, and he gave them letter, exchange.</span> <span id="s363">They bring over raw skin -- you know, from their cattle -- and he gave them ready-made skin for boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: And what were you doing then, during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: I was pregnant, and I had my baby.</span> <span id="s366">That’s in 1944.</span> <span id="s367">We had him in Rovno, still under the German bombs for the nine months I was pregnant, and we had to go out of the city for nine months to hide against the Nazi bombs, because they were bombing every night the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Who was occupying the city at the time, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: The Russians were occupying.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Was there any anti-Semitism during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: There was not too much.</span> <span id="s372">Not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Was there much of a Jewish community left there in Rovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Not much.</span> <span id="s375">You can count ten, 15 families, maybe 20 families.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: And did the families get together and talk about the future?</span> <span id="s377">What they wanted to do?</span> <span id="s378">What were the discussions?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: The discussion was to be organized, and to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s380">The Russians gathered all the orphans -- children, Jewish and non-Jewish -- and they want to send them away to Russia to schools.</span> <span id="s381">So we find out that some of the children are Jewish, so every family took those children into their families.</span> <span id="s382">We took two children, a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s383">The boy was 14 years old, the girl was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s384">We took them in like our own children, and we kept them until we went out from Russia.</span> <span id="s385">And we bring ‘em over to Katowice, Germany.</span> <span id="s386">That was on the border, Katowice.</span> <span id="s387">And there the Brichah, the Zionist organization, they worked very good.</span> <span id="s388">They organized all the children and they put them into a kibbutz, and from there they sent them away to Israel.</span> <span id="s389">Now they are in Israel.</span> <span id="s390">I visit them.</span> <span id="s391">I have even pictures taken with them.</span> <span id="s392">They are just like my children, to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Was there any discussion at this time about you and your husband and other members of the Jewish community going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s395">Was organization and discussions -- secretly -- because if the Russians would find out that we are talking about Palestine, they didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s396">So we used to make a party, make-believe, an engagement party or a wedding, and discuss about those things, to organize, and where to go, and what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: And how long did that go on, that you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: That went on for months.</span> <span id="s399">For a year.</span> <span id="s400">We came in beginning of 1944, and then we left in the middle of 1945.</span> <span id="s401">A year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Were there any organizations, Jewish or otherwise, that helped you get out of Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Just the Zionist organization, secretly to go out.</span> <span id="s404">We were Polish citizens; for us was easy to go out from Russia.</span> <span id="s405">Just to travel from one country to the other country, was not so easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: The Polacks, they didn’t want to let us out, when we came to Poland.</span> <span id="s408">We had to make a passport, like we are coming as Greeks, coming from a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s409">And the Brichah made out passports, false papers to go to Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: When did you go to Greece?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: We didn’t go to Greece!</span> <span id="s412">No, no.</span> <span id="s413">We came out from Katowice, with those passports, and we went to Poland, and then in Poland, we had to go to Cherchen, in Czechoslovakia, and to go farther and farther to come to Italy.</span> <span id="s414">But we didn’t go to Italy, we settled in Austria, at Bindermichel D.P. camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: How did you find out about that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: This is all through the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s417">They worked on this.</span> <span id="s418">This is brilliant boys, young boys.</span> <span id="s419">They organized, they led us, and we went through.</span> <span id="s420">We have to walk for miles by foot through those zones --Russian zones, Polish zones.</span> <span id="s421">So we settled in Bindermichel, Austria, near Linz.</span> <span id="s422">And from there we were planning to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s423">Accidentally, my husband’s brother in Chicago, he found out that we are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: How did he find out, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: I find out there was a Jewish working -- he was an interpreter --+ working with the Russians and with the Americans.</span> <span id="s426">So he met my husband in Bindermichel, and he looks like Russian.</span> <span id="s427">And he says, in Russian, “Kudavar?’</span> <span id="s428">“From where are you?’</span> <span id="s429">My husband, he says, “ I am from ‘there’ and ‘there.”</span> <span id="s430">And he asked him if he has somebody in America.</span> <span id="s431">He says, “ I have a brother in America.</span> <span id="s432">He’s in Chicago.</span> <span id="s433">It’s just I’m planning to go to Palestine, not to America.”</span> <span id="s434">He says, “ Well, don’t you want to let your brother know that you are alive?’</span> <span id="s435">My husband says, “ Yes, I would love to.”</span> <span id="s436">He says, “Give me your name, and I’ll put it in Forward.”</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: The newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: A newspaper in New York.</span> <span id="s439">He said, “I’m going next week to New York.</span> <span id="s440">Give me your name, and give me your brother’s name, and I’ll put this in the newspaper, and he’ll find out.”</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: At that time, was The Forward typically running names of people who had survived the Holocaust in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: In New York!</span> <span id="s443">So this man, when he came to New York, he put us in, that note in that newspaper.</span> <span id="s444">And in a few weeks, they send over a lot of papers to our camp.</span> <span id="s445">So we find out that my husband’s brother knew already that we are alive, and he sent us right away papers to fill out to come to America.</span> <span id="s446">And he sent a letter: “Any time you want to go to Palestine, you go from America to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s447">That’s the way -- through the HIAS -- we came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: And how did your husband’s brother get to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: He came in 1913.</span> <span id="s450">Before the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: So where did you come to in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: We came to Chicago, to my husband’s brother.</span> <span id="s453">We stayed there for a short time.</span> <span id="s454">We couldn’t find a flat to live.</span> <span id="s455">My husband couldn’t find work.</span> <span id="s456">So we visited Milwaukee, our relatives.</span> <span id="s457">And there my husband found work, and we found a place to live in a mixed schvartze-weitze (black and white) neighborhood, and we settled.</span> <span id="s458">My husband started working, very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: So, do you maintain contact with the Jewish community then in Milwaukee?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: And do you maintain contact with other survivors, or any survivor organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s463">We have a New American Club.</span> <span id="s464">And now we have young, second-generation survivors, active.</span> <span id="s465">Once my son came to speak for them about the partisans, to be organized.</span> <span id="s466">And, too, to talk about it, to let children -- their children -- know what it was, what we went through.</span> <span id="s467">My husband, he used to tell my children, especially Jack.</span> <span id="s468">He likes to know everything.</span> <span id="s469">That’s why he was interested, to write and to publish those books, especially about Jewish partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Was Jack born in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Jack was born in Russia, in Rovno.</span> <span id="s472">He was a baby.</span> <span id="s473">That’s why we couldn’t go to Palestine -- with a small baby.</span> <span id="s474">That was the only reason.</span> <span id="s475">Otherwise we could go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Did you ever get to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Twice I was in Israel.</span> <span id="s478">I was in Israel when my daughter was in a kibbutz, working in Kibbutz Saad, a religious kibbutz.</span> <span id="s479">I went there to visit her.</span> <span id="s480">And I went this year.</span> <span id="s481">In November I was in Israel, to visit my relatives.</span> <span id="s482">Just it was not pleasant.</span> <span id="s483">I was in a car accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.</span> <span id="s485">Can you tell me what it has meant to you to be a survivor of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: It’s meant to me very sad.</span> <span id="s487">Sometimes I’m thinking that I’m not normal, because I am only one, the survivor, and I am alive.</span> <span id="s488">The only thing what I’m thinking is that I believe in God.</span> <span id="s489">That’s kept me alive.</span> <span id="s490">And I live for my children, for this generation.</span> <span id="s491">And I tried to teach my children that they should go in a Jewish way, an orthodox way.</span> <span id="s492">I sent my one son to a yeshiva when he was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s493">My daughter went to Chicago to a yeshiva school, high school.</span> <span id="s494">This is my life.</span> <span id="s495">This is most important.</span> <span id="s496">They should go in a Jewish way, and teach their children.</span> <span id="s497">This is my happiness.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: I can understand that.</span> <span id="s499">Yes.</span> <span id="s500">If you can, after your experience during the Holocaust, please describe to me your general feelings about human nature, non-Jews and Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: I don’t trust them.</span> <span id="s502">No, I don’t trust them.</span> <span id="s503">When my oldest son used to go out, he’d come home, and he says once, “Mom, I met a girl, and she wants to be megiar.”</span> <span id="s504">You know, convert.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Convert to Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Convert to Judaism.</span> <span id="s507">I said, “ You better not, because I don’t trust nobody.”</span> <span id="s508">I don’t know, maybe some are good people.</span> <span id="s509">The whole world is not bad.</span> <span id="s510">Just I, myself, I don’t trust anymore.</span> <span id="s511">Is it wrong?</span> <span id="s512">What do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: I can’t say, you know, because I haven’t had the experiences that you have had.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s515">I don’t trust.</span> <span id="s516">Especially Germans, Polacks, I don’t trust.</span> <span id="s517">And we see, even in America, some, they’re getting married, and after a while, because the husband is Jewish, and she’s not Jewish, the husband wants to teach the children Jewishness, and she’s against!</span> <span id="s518">And they get divorced, or the unhappy life they have, and their children mixed up.</span> <span id="s519">That’s why I don’t trust.</span> <span id="s520">You born a Jew, stay Jewish.</span> <span id="s521">You born a Christian, stay a Christian.</span> <span id="s522">I love people, believe me.</span> <span id="s523">I love people!</span> <span id="s524">No different, a Jew, a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s525">Just intermarriage, I don’t trust.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Have you had a chance to see any of the movies or television programs, or read any of the books about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s527">Do you think that they accurately tell the story of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s529">They do.</span> <span id="s530">Even if some people, they’re denying, on the TV, it’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Would you be willing to share with us any photos, mementos, or other things, for the purpose of exhibition or research from the period of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Photos?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Yes, did you have any photos from the resistance, or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: I have just in these books on the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: And were those from your husband’s, or your, collections?</span> <span id="s536">From those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: This is some my son collected.</span> <span id="s538">He collected those, all pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: So there’s two volumes, and it’s called Jewish Partisans, and it’s by Porter, and it’s from the University Press of America.</span> <span id="s540">The latest copyright date on this book, Jewish Partisans is 1982, and copyrighted by Jack Nusan Porter.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Can you think of any other comments, then, that you wanted to add, about your years in the partisans, that we should add onto this tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: What kind of comments?</span> <span id="s543">No other comments.</span> <span id="s544">It was a lot, you know.</span> <span id="s545">So far, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s547">PAGE 11</span></p> <p><span
