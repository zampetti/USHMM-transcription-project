to stay in contact.</span> <span id="s226">How were you able to overcome the homesickness?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">RW: I don’t remember having to overcome it because it’s a way of life and you had to do the best you could in order to live.</span> <span id="s228">The way with the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">FW: What helped you the most to adjust to this...</span></p> <p><span

through the OSE.</span> <span id="s263">After that a Jewish family took me and it was very good but then it was no good because she was Jewish and I was Jewish and the Nazis were there.</span> <span id="s264">So when I was put with a gentile family and it wasn’t that nice.</span> <span id="s265">They were very nice to me but I didn’t have much to eat and I went to school and I had already a false

houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">RW: Horrible.</span> <span id="s270">Just horrible.</span> <span id="s271">At the time.</span> <span id="s272">First of all with the Jewish family it was very nice.</span> <span id="s273">She was a widow and she had a son and he wasn’t bad but I made some nice friends, Jewish kids, and it was very pleasant.</span> <span id="s274">And don’t forget, you know you’re eleven, you’re young, and it’s in a strange country.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">FW: Were you able to make yourself understood?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">RW: Oh yes.</span> <span

was scarce and we had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s357">And we had a cook who was Jewish but she converted.</span> <span id="s358">She was a good cook but she couldn’t do better for us, even though she knew we were all Jewish because, after all, you were rationed too.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">FW: Did you realize at the time exactly how serious things were?</span></p> <p><span

more, that gets used to things fast when you have to.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">FW: What do you think was the greatest help to you in those years of moving around and having to adjust to all these circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">RW: I don’t know, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s380">I guess life went on and you took it day by day or whatever.</span></p> <p><span

think in these terms as a kid; you’re happy.</span> <span id="s386">You were brought up differently in Europe in those days than you are now.</span> <span id="s387">My son would think differently at the age of 14 or 15 than I did at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">FW: No, I meant...</span></p> <p><span id="s389">RW: I don’t know, or don’t recall any more.</span> <span id="s390">I figured I’m happy with the others and I didn’t look ahead.</span> <span id="s391">But I figured also that maybe someday, since I had relatives here, that maybe I’d go to America.</span> <span id="s392">And furthermore, from the time I was hidden with the gentile people, I did not know if my brother was living or not and the same here.</span> <span id="s393">I mean the same for him.</span></p> <p><span

took you to these homes...</span></p> <p><span id="s397">RW: It felt good because you were among Jews and you had a Jewish life.</span> <span id="s398">You didn’t have to be afraid that the Nazis would come.</span> <span id="s399">Oh, by the way, in the convent we had to evacuate one ...</span></p> <p><span id="s400">--- After the liberation he was in a home and I was in a home.</span> <span id="s401">But where I was, I think I was one of the oldest and he was older than me in age and they didn’t take people of that age so I went to a home where I was one of the youngest and his age group was more of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">FW: And then you were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">RW: And then we were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">FW: Did you, was it a hard thing, each time you were changed, several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">RW: No, because it was always Jewish homes and always Jewish kids and a Jewish atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">FW: So it didn’t bother you when they gave you news that...</span></p> <p><span id="s407">RW: No, because we were all in the same boat.</span> <span id="s408">We all had no parents and it was like camp living, when you go to summer camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">FW: How did you know that your mother wasn’t living.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">RW: Well after the war I guess when you found out about the concentration camps and everything, we... some kids were very fortunate.</span> <span id="s411">Their parents came back.</span> <span id="s412">And somehow, I guess through the Joint Distribution or the Hyas or the UJA, they found out, but with us I don’t think.</span> <span id="s413">But we also found out that many people died and we didn’t hear anything so we figured that my mother died.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">FW: You were never given final information as to...</span></p> <p><span id="s415">RW: I don’t think so because you can’t recollect who died.</span> <span id="s416">See, my brother came out of Goorse much later than me and after a while the Nazis came and closed these camps and I guess everybody was shipped to Auschwitz or whatever.</span></p> <p><span
