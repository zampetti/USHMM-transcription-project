I was the fifth child, like I said before.</span> <span id="s23">And I had a very healthy, happy upbringing.</span> <span id="s24">My mother was in business.</span> <span id="s25">My father, at that point already, couldn’t work because he was sick, so he used to help in the house with the children and he helped Mom in the business.</span> <span id="s26">And we were loved, getting along sisters and brothers, very good.</span> <span id="s27">And it was great.</span> <span id="s28">I went to school.</span> <span id="s29">My mother always believed in a private school.</span> <span id="s30">She never believed in a public school.</span> <span id="s31">So, we were taught Hebrew and Yiddish and Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: What was your mother’s business?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Food business.</span> <span id="s34">We had a food store.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: You had a shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: A shop, yeah food store.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Did you live near your shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Not too far, within walking distance, not too far.</span> <span id="s39">And my mother was a very devoted mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: What was her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Her maiden name was Rosenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Rosenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Rosenberg, R O S E N B E R G.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s45">What were your brothers’ and sisters’ names, starting with the oldest and moving down to the youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: My oldest sister was Itga (ph), the second one was Shayna (ph) and the third one was Fulma (ph).</span> <span id="s47">In between was a boy, his name was Mihal (ph).</span> <span id="s48">And then I came and my name was Jospe.</span> <span id="s49">And then I had a brother, Abraham.</span> <span id="s50">And then there was Mischa (ph) and, uh, what was my sister’s name, the youngest, the twin?</span> <span id="s51">Fega (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s53">So, the two youngest were the twins?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: The two youngest were the twins, yes.</span> <span id="s55">And it was a very happy home.</span> <span id="s56">I had a grandmother that lived with an aunt in the same building.</span> <span id="s57">And we were always playing together, my aunt’s children and us.</span> <span id="s58">And never had a problem.</span> <span id="s59">It was a very happy house.</span> <span id="s60">My mother used to tell jokes and did birthdays and everything for the kids.</span> <span id="s61">She was a very hard working woman.</span> <span id="s62">People used to say that I looked like her and I care like her.</span> <span id="s63">It was never a dull moment, all this happiness.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: I would say not orthodox, but conservative, conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: They go to services every Saturday?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Not every Saturday, no.</span> <span id="s68">Holidays mostly.</span> <span id="s69">If something special came up, but I wouldn’t say every Saturday, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: And can you say something about your father and his, what he was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: My father was, I could only say my father never hit us.</span> <span id="s72">He didn’t know what means.</span> <span id="s73">He had patience.</span> <span id="s74">He was very good to us.</span> <span id="s75">He was like playing the part of the mother, because my father was in the… he had… he used to make skins.</span> <span id="s76">But this didn’t… he couldn’t carry this on, because he had problems breathing, had a weak heart.</span> <span id="s77">So he couldn’t continue to doing that part.</span> <span id="s78">So, that’s when he had to quit his work and he stayed home with the children and helped out Mom at the store.</span> <span id="s79">He was a very lovable man, good, caring, very caring for the family.</span> <span id="s80">He was not born in Białystok.</span> <span id="s81">He was born in Sokolka, which is not too far.</span> <span id="s82">My mother was born in Białystok.</span> <span id="s83">And we were surrounded, always, by love and by friends and by family.</span> <span id="s84">We didn’t know from any hardships because we always had what to eat, being my mother was in business.</span> <span id="s85">And we got along with everybody.</span> <span id="s86">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: What language did you speak in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: We spoke mostly Yiddish with the parents and then Polish, of course, in the streets and the school.</span> <span id="s89">And Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Was it an all Jewish school that you attended?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s92">Yes it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in Poland before the war began, in Białystok?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: I had very little… the only time I experienced is when, the ghetto, when we were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s95">Otherwise, I really didn’t, because we were, like I said, I went to Hebrew school and my friends were mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s96">But the neighbors on the block, just enough to say a hello and good-bye and they had their life, and we had our life.</span> <span id="s97">I never had any problem.</span> <span id="s98">My father used to have problems, because he used to love soccer and every Saturday they had a soccer game.</span> <span id="s99">And after we finished our lunch, we used to go.</span> <span id="s100">But he always took along a cane, in case they hit him or they throw stones or whatever.</span> <span id="s101">If the game… if that team lost, you couldn’t get home, because they used to be very mad.</span> <span id="s102">And that’s what they used to do.</span> <span id="s103">They used to throw stones, hit you, so he always took a cane along with him.</span> <span id="s104">But he wouldn’t miss a game.</span> <span id="s105">He loved it.</span> <span id="s106">He loved that sport.</span> <span id="s107">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s108">Mom took care on the kids, he was at home and that’s what it’s all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: What did you, did you and your family… were you aware of Hitler from the time that he rose to power in Germany?</span> <span id="s110">And did you feel threatened by what was happening in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Actually when you heard the stories, when you heard what’s going on… we, of course you started to get scared, but we didn’t know so much what, what’s going on.</span> <span id="s112">And my father, may he rest in peace, always said, he was a medic in the First World War and he always says that the Germans wouldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s113">They may put you to work, but they will never harm you in any way.</span> <span id="s114">And like anything else, you listen to your parents, whatever they told you.</span> <span id="s115">I mean, you didn’t have much of a chance to run any place.</span> <span id="s116">We were on the… in our town, first came in the Russians.</span> <span id="s117">And we were with the Russians maybe a year.</span> <span id="s118">And we were on the… they evicted a lot of people that were in business for themselves.</span> <span id="s119">So, they put us on a truck to go, I don’t know where, to Siberia or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: The Russians did?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes, the Russians did that, because my mother had a house and we had a store, so we were already like, rich, you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s122">So that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s123">And my mother gave them some money and they took us off the truck and we remained home.</span> <span id="s124">Had we known what was going on, that we wouldn’t stay home, of course we would have gone to Russia better.</span> <span id="s125">But that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s126">And then a year later, this was 1939, when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s127">The Russians left and the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s128">And we were with them for a while from the beginning, then they started to make all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s129">When the men went to the Temple, like on a Saturday, they burned down the whole Temple with the people inside, whoever it was there.</span> <span id="s130">Then one Saturday they took away all the men.</span> <span id="s131">They left the women, but all the men.</span> <span id="s132">And that’s when the trouble started.</span> <span id="s133">A while later, they put us into the ghetto and this was terrible.</span> <span id="s134">The ghetto was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Okay, before we get to that, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the time before the war started.</span> <span id="s136">When the war started it was 1939, you were about sixteen years old?</span> <span id="s137">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Can you tell me something about what your interests were?</span> <span id="s140">I mean you were a young woman, you’re just coming into your... you’re getting close to adulthood.</span> <span id="s141">Can you take me back into that time and just recall what your life was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Well, like I said before, I have… I admired my sisters.</span> <span id="s143">I always looked up to them.</span> <span id="s144">My oldest sister was a designer.</span> <span id="s145">She was very good at it.</span> <span id="s146">She used to design for me clothes.</span> <span id="s147">She used to make me dresses.</span> <span id="s148">My second sister, she was in the house.</span> <span id="s149">My third one, she loved school, but she was sick.</span> <span id="s150">And I always used to complain to Mom, that she’s… takes advantage of me.</span> <span id="s151">She hits me.</span> <span id="s152">Whatever she has, I cannot have it.</span> <span id="s153">Like we used to come from school on a Friday.</span> <span id="s154">She wanted something special.</span> <span id="s155">She wanted some kind of pastry and she always got it.</span> <span id="s156">And milk, she did not want it to eat, but it was in the house.</span> <span id="s157">I was forced to eat everything, whatever they cooked for me.</span> <span id="s158">And I rebelled.</span> <span id="s159">And I came to my Mom’s store.</span> <span id="s160">This was after months.</span> <span id="s161">And I came to my Mom’s store and I started to cry.</span> <span id="s162">And I said to her, “What’s going on?</span> <span id="s163">You don’t love me.”</span> <span id="s164">I mean, what could a child think?</span> <span id="s165">I don’t know how old was I, maybe seven or eight.</span> <span id="s166">And I said, “You don’t love me.”</span> <span id="s167">I says, “How could you say that to me?”</span> <span id="s168">My mother said… I said, “You see, you yourself said when Fulma touches me…” in other words, she gives me a…</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: A pinch?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: A pinch, exactly, I was looking for that.</span> <span id="s171">And that place hair wouldn’t grow, that’s what she used to say, because she was strong in her hand.</span> <span id="s172">And when I would go to school with her, she has, she walks and I run, and I couldn’t catch up with her.</span> <span id="s173">“So, how could you tell me that she is sick and I am well?”</span> <span id="s174">“Oh,” my mother said, “Oh, I see you have already brains.”</span> <span id="s175">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s176">She says to me, “How many fingers do you have?”</span> <span id="s177">I said, “What are you talking about?</span> <span id="s178">Everybody has ten fingers.”</span> <span id="s179">So, she said, “If you hurt one, if you cut one, does it hurt you?”</span> <span id="s180">I said, “Of course, what kind of talk is that?”</span> <span id="s181">That’s when she sat me down on her lap and she explained it to me.</span> <span id="s182">“I love you all the same, but she happen to be sick, that’s why she gets everything.</span> <span id="s183">I don’t want to upset her.”</span> <span id="s184">So, again, I said, “I don’t believe you.</span> <span id="s185">How could you do that to me?”</span> <span id="s186">So, she said, “Watch.”</span> <span id="s187">She had, what do you… now it’s going to come back to me.</span> <span id="s188">I’m getting all excited.</span> <span id="s189">Epilepsy.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Oh, mm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: And most of these things happened during the night and I never saw it.</span> <span id="s192">So when she told me that, I trusted her, my mom.</span> <span id="s193">But I… still I had to see it for myself, that kind of child was I. And sure enough when the light came up and I used to see everybody running to her bed and foam came out of her mouth.</span> <span id="s194">And from then on, you couldn’t do nothing to her, she was the best sister.</span> <span id="s195">She couldn’t be wrong in any place.</span> <span id="s196">I looked into her eyes.</span> <span id="s197">This all I have to thank my mom, that she explained it to me properly, because otherwise I would grow up hating her, how she dared do that to me.</span> <span id="s198">That kind of mom we had, very smart and outgoing in every way.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: What was the sister’s name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Shayna.</span> <span id="s201">She was the third one and I was under her.</span> <span id="s202">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: What were your interests?</span> <span id="s204">Did you have any dreams?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: My interest?</span> <span id="s206">To go school.</span> <span id="s207">And that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s208">I didn’t have any other ambitions, but to go to school at that point, because I had older sisters to care for.</span> <span id="s209">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s210">We didn’t jump to any conclusions ahead.</span> <span id="s211">That’s the way we were raised.</span> <span id="s212">My oldest sister got married.</span> <span id="s213">And she had two children.</span> <span id="s214">The other sister got married in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s215">And my brothers, my brother got married in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s216">And they all had children in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s217">And that’s what it… it was kind of hard on us.</span> <span id="s218">And my sick sister, she too got married in the ghetto and she had a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Had you started dating by the time the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Not dating, actually not dating, just having friends.</span> <span id="s221">We used to belong to organization, and… Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: What was the name of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Jabotinsky?</span> <span id="s224">Would you know?</span> <span id="s225">Mm hmm.</span> <span id="s226">Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s227">And that’s… we used to be together, like, and go on, you know, like hikes and things like that, but of course, everything was supervised.</span> <span id="s228">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Okay, now tell me a little bit more about the Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s230">The way I understand it, it started in 1939.</span> <span id="s231">The Germans occupied for a week and then the Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s233">They were more than a week.</span> <span id="s234">They were there for maybe a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: After the… so the Germans came in, and then they occupied just for a little while and then the Russians occupied for…</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: No, just the opposite.</span> <span id="s237">First were the Russians, first were the Russians and then came the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: The Germans returned and occupied again and established the ghetto later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Right.</span> <span id="s240">Uh huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: During that time that the Russians were occupying, you mentioned that your… did your family actually lose their store?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Oh yeah, we lost everything, yes.</span> <span id="s243">Yes, at that time.</span> <span id="s244">Short time after we went into ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: And what, how did you feed, how did your family support itself during that time, before the ghetto, that it lost the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Before the ghetto, I, it wasn’t a long time, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s247">We didn’t feel the pinch in anything, because like I said before, my mother took care on everything.</span> <span id="s248">In the ghetto we felt the pinch, yes, definitely, but not before.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Do you remember when the Germans came in and occupied Białystok?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Oh sure, oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Can you tell me about that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: The day, we heard planes coming back and forth and they threw bombs.</span> <span id="s253">We were right, not far from there.</span> <span id="s254">And we still thought that they were practicing.</span> <span id="s255">The Russians are practicing because we didn’t believe that this was the Germans already.</span> <span id="s256">A short time after, you saw already riding on the motorcycles, you know, and coming into town and that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s257">And that’s when the trouble started.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Were they brutalizing the Jews of Białystok?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: What?</span> <span id="s260">The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Did you witness any brutality?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: I mean, thank God, we were lucky at that point, that nobody was missing from the family, but a lot of people didn’t have their husbands already.</span> <span id="s265">They took them away, or their sons.</span> <span id="s266">They used to pick them up from the street and, and take them out.</span> <span id="s267">But at that point, we were yet, the whole family was together yet, until the, the selection that they made.</span> <span id="s268">That they put us into the ghetto and I had to go out to get some food, because nobody else could.</span> <span id="s269">My brother wouldn’t go out, he was afraid.</span> <span id="s270">And so my father couldn’t carry anything, so I used to take off the yellow star that we wore.</span> <span id="s271">And I was blond.</span> <span id="s272">And I took it off and I went out through the… they had like a hole they made.</span> <span id="s273">And I went underneath and I went to the Poles, the ones that used to do business with my mother.</span> <span id="s274">And I used to buy from them potatoes.</span> <span id="s275">And I used to bring it in underneath the… on the way back, the same way like I came out.</span> <span id="s276">And I did it quite often for the family, they should have what to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: How did you get money to buy the food?</span> <span id="s278">Was that saved from before?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Oh, money left, we had money from before.</span> <span id="s280">Yeah, money we already had.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So, it wasn’t taken away when you went into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s283">No, the money, at that point, they didn’t take nothing.</span> <span id="s284">When we came into Auschwitz, that’s when they took everything away.</span> <span id="s285">You hid it, you know, in certain places.</span> <span id="s286">You know, you prepared yourself.</span> <span id="s287">But at that point we still had money.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Can you tell me a little more about going into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s289">What were your living quarters like?</span> <span id="s290">Or do you remember, how you were... do you even remember being informed that you had to move and what your family’s response was to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s292">Like I said before, I was not of the ones that listened into everything.</span> <span id="s293">I had older ones than me, listening in, you know, but you followed whatever they, they told you.</span> <span id="s294">It was one bedroom that we had in that… in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s295">And that’s what everybody was together.</span> <span id="s296">But my sister, my oldest sister and my… my oldest sister and my second sister, they were married already and they had babies, so they couldn’t go with us when we were hiding, because they were afraid that they going to give out.</span> <span id="s297">Because if the kids start crying, the SS will hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: You were hiding in the ghetto or before?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: This is the last time, before they, they made those selections, so we were in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: From there they took us, they took you out.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: And that’s from there where they took you.</span> <span id="s304">First they put you all into a ghetto, in order to be easier for the Germans, that we should be all together.</span> <span id="s305">And that’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s306">They took… so we were separated.</span> <span id="s307">My mom went with the… with the younger ones, the ones that had the babies.</span> <span id="s308">And my father went with the older, like me and my brother, that had no children.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Okay, before we go on… I definitely want to hear about that, but I wanted to focus on the time in the ghetto and going into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s310">So just on that early time, right as you were going in, did your whole entire family, beside… go into that same bedroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: You had no alternative.</span> <span id="s312">Now my oldest sister, she was married; she had two children.</span> <span id="s313">So she went with her husband, but not too far.</span> <span id="s314">And my other sister was not with us already.</span> <span id="s315">And neither did my brother, because he was married.</span> <span id="s316">So, it was just the younger ones, that we were all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Five children, five children and your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: In that bedroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: In one bed, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: And when you were in the ghetto, did you work in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No, I never worked, no.</span> <span id="s325">No, I never worked.</span> <span id="s326">I was going… I didn’t go to school already then, because you weren’t allowed to go already.</span> <span id="s327">But I was home with my parents, because I had to watch them.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Do you remember the, the…</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: It was a lot of things on my head.</span> <span id="s330">Let’s put it this way, because I knew my father was sick and they had to get certain things and I had to… I had to be the one to go out and get it.</span> <span id="s331">So, every time you, one of you went out, you wasn’t sure if you were going to come back, but I would never say no.</span> <span id="s332">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: So, you were the main, of the children that were left with your parents…</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: …you were the main caregiver?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Right.</span> <span id="s337">Caregiver.</span> <span id="s338">Not God forbid that it was sick, bedridden.</span> <span id="s339">But as far as providing food, and I remember my sister was having a baby in ghetto.</span> <span id="s340">And at that point already, they wouldn’t take no money, the doctors.</span> <span id="s341">So, I had to go get the doctor.</span> <span id="s342">My mother sent me, so I went, of course.</span> <span id="s343">And he came.</span> <span id="s344">And I had to be the one to, to stay with them in the room.</span> <span id="s345">They chased off my mom, everybody from the room and she was having the baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Which sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Shayna.</span> <span id="s348">That’s the second one.</span> <span id="s349">Daniel, could you bring me a little water, please?</span> <span id="s350">And the tissues, please, if you don’t mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Do you want to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: For just a few minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">End of Tape 1, Side A Tape 1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview with Justine Lerner.</span> <span id="s356">Okay.</span> <span id="s357">You were telling me a little bit more about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s358">Did any of your brothers or sisters do any work in the ghetto, in any of the ghetto industries?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: None of them.</span> <span id="s360">None of them, no.</span> <span id="s361">No.</span> <span id="s362">No.</span> <span id="s363">My brother, like I said, didn’t go out, out of the ghetto, you know.</span> <span id="s364">And of course neither did my father or my mom.</span> <span id="s365">The only one that I went out, and I used to bring in the provisions, whatever, whatever it was able to, mainly potatoes and flour.</span> <span id="s366">Sugar, my mother, she knew that something’s coming up.</span> <span id="s367">So, the main doctors didn’t take, if you needed a doctor, money was no good, because they couldn’t buy nothing for the money.</span> <span id="s368">The main thing was sugar and flour.</span> <span id="s369">And that’s what she saved up a lot of it.</span> <span id="s370">So, she paid the doctor, when my sister was giving birth, that’s what it took, is sugar and flour.</span> <span id="s371">And none of them worked, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Was it frightening to be sneaking in and out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yes, it was, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s374">I had no fear.</span> <span id="s375">I knew I had to do it, because I could not give it over to somebody else.</span> <span id="s376">It was my job and I did it very, very nice.</span> <span id="s377">I went out, like I said before, I wasn’t sure if I’ll ever get back, but that’s it.</span> <span id="s378">You have to do what you have to do.</span> <span id="s379">And I was always successful.</span> <span id="s380">I went in the same way and I came out the same way.</span> <span id="s381">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s382">The family was happy and I was happy that I was able to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Did you have any close calls?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Not in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s385">I was fine.</span> <span id="s386">In the camps, yes, but not in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s387">In the ghetto I was fine.</span> <span id="s388">I went in okay and I came out okay.</span> <span id="s389">And it’s not like… my mother made meals and we ate and… the best she knew how, I mean whatever she had left, you know?</span> <span id="s390">But we never felt hungry or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Were you aware of any organized, underground resistance in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: No, no really don’t… we were, we didn’t, we didn’t… how do I say?</span> <span id="s393">We didn’t mingle with people, you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s394">Because we were a close family, and we were mostly by ourselves.</span> <span id="s395">But I knew that people were working for the Germans, but we didn’t know how could they do it!</span> <span id="s396">You understand what I’m trying…?</span> <span id="s397">How could they do a thing like that?</span> <span id="s398">When I came to the, when I came to the concentration camp, to Auschwitz, then I saw what was going on.</span> <span id="s399">Up till then, I did not know.</span> <span id="s400">Like I said before, my father always used to say the Germans are educated.</span> <span id="s401">They wouldn’t do things like that.</span> <span id="s402">The only thing they could do is to put you to work.</span> <span id="s403">But not to hit or… or do certain things uncalled for.</span> <span id="s404">Those are vicious killers, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Do you remember when, approximately, you entered the ghetto?</span> <span id="s406">What month and year?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: No, I really don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s408">I really don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s410">And do you have a sense of approximately how long you were in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Not too long, I would say.</span> <span id="s412">People remained after they took us away, of course.</span> <span id="s413">Maybe three months, or four months the most.</span> <span id="s414">That’s all.</span> <span id="s415">And of course you couldn’t take nothing with you, because you had to carry it.</span> <span id="s416">Just like a pillow case, that’s where you put some, your belongings into it.</span> <span id="s417">You went.</span> <span id="s418">Because they didn’t give you enough time.</span> <span id="s419">So, you wrapped whatever you could.</span> <span id="s420">And like I said before, I was not with my mother.</span> <span id="s421">I was with my father then and my two sisters, my older sister and my younger one.</span> <span id="s422">My, my younger brother and my older brother and that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Did you witness any actions in the ghetto or any round-ups during the time that you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: No, we just read a bit or, or were told.</span> <span id="s425">But I never witnessed anything like that, no, thank God.</span> <span id="s426">Like I said before, we were lucky at that point, yet.</span> <span id="s427">We were all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: When did you go into hiding and why?</span> <span id="s429">How did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Because they said, I mean they didn’t say, but you heard rumors that’s going be a selection, that they’re going to take people away from… from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s431">And they’re going to ship them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s432">So everybody went in either to a basement or they built something underneath and that’s the way they’re hiding.</span> <span id="s433">You took some water with you or some bread and that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s434">And you were sitting up and waiting that somebody should knock on the door or whatever.</span> <span id="s435">And that’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s436">We heard them walking upstairs, Germans with the boots, and we were underneath.</span> <span id="s437">And from nowheres they found out.</span> <span id="s438">And they knocked on the door and that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s439">They took us out from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: You were in the same building as where you had lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: You were hiding in the same building?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: No, no, this was a different building across the street.</span> <span id="s444">Yeah, my mother and my sisters were in the same building underneath.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: And you, will you repeat who exactly you were with?</span> <span id="s446">You were with your father…</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: My father, my oldest sister, because her children were older, my father and my sister and her two older children and my brother and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Okay, so, four of you, okay, and plus the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Plus the children, yes.</span> <span id="s450">My… what did I want to say, I forgot.</span> <span id="s451">Yeah.</span> <span id="s452">And we got out and they put us on the trains.</span> <span id="s453">And… crowded.</span> <span id="s454">A lot of people.</span> <span id="s455">And we were riding, like I said before, my father kept telling us, you see all the way, close to Auschwitz already.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: And this was taking place in the winter time?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: In January, February, yes, when the snow was falling on us.</span> <span id="s458">And we were sitting.</span> <span id="s459">A lot of… there was no room to go to the bathroom, you should excuse me, a lot of people made on themselves.</span> <span id="s460">It was just like, cattle have a better, better look than we had.</span> <span id="s461">It was just unbearable.</span> <span id="s462">And my brother, the oldest brother jumped the train.</span> <span id="s463">He didn’t want to come into Auschwitz and they were standing there and shooting.</span> <span id="s464">So, I never heard from him, so I don’t know if he got shot or he got killed afterwards.</span> <span id="s465">My father to the last minute still had good ideas, that they’re not going to hurt us, they’re going to put us to work.</span> <span id="s466">But it was not so.</span> <span id="s467">The minute we arrived to Auschwitz, we still saw people standing and digging ditches.</span> <span id="s468">And he said, “What did I tell you children?</span> <span id="s469">They’re more civilized than anything else.</span> <span id="s470">They’re not going to do these things.</span> <span id="s471">They’re not going to kill.”</span> <span id="s472">And as soon as the train stopped it became like a terrible wind.</span> <span id="s473">And they separated us, the women this way and the men that way.</span> <span id="s474">Didn’t see my father anymore.</span> <span id="s475">Didn’t see my sister, she was next to me, but she wouldn’t part with her children, so you pulled her out on this side.</span> <span id="s476">So, I ran out from my side and I went to see… to be with my sister.</span> <span id="s477">And the SS, they had canes.</span> <span id="s478">They took the cane and put around my neck and pulled me out.</span> <span id="s479">They pulled me back to that line.</span> <span id="s480">So, I ran again over to my sister.</span> <span id="s481">I think I was scared, I didn’t know which way.</span> <span id="s482">I wanted to be with her.</span> <span id="s483">So he took me out for the second time and he opened up my head.</span> <span id="s484">Hit me with the cane over the head and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s485">I never saw them afterwards.</span> <span id="s486">So, when you come into Auschwitz, you had to get undressed and of course, I started to cry very much.</span> <span id="s487">I wanted to go to my sister.</span> <span id="s488">I didn’t tell them what, what I was crying.</span> <span id="s489">And an SS woman comes over to me and she says to me, “Why are you crying?”</span> <span id="s490">Disoriented.</span> <span id="s491">Everything… it was unbelievable what they could put people in.</span> <span id="s492">And she says to me, “Why are you crying?”</span> <span id="s493">So I said to her, “I want to go back to my sister.”</span> <span id="s494">And she said, “You are going to see her tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s495">She was a good one.</span> <span id="s496">And then another SS woman came over, said, “Why are you crying?”</span> <span id="s497">I cried harder.</span> <span id="s498">I said, “Because I want to go to your sister… to my sister.”</span> <span id="s499">She said, “You’ll never see her again.”</span> <span id="s500">And since that point, I never cried again.</span> <span id="s501">Because first they, they cut your hair, and then they tattooed, and my hand got swollen like this.</span> <span id="s502">And lonesome, you have nobody.</span> <span id="s503">I was really transport from the same town, but they were no, not related to me.</span> <span id="s504">And I had nobody.</span> <span id="s505">And the following day when they took us to work, we saw the smoke coming out of the chimney and I put two and two together and I knew exactly what was going on, that they not around anymore.</span> <span id="s506">That’s exactly how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Did you have any friends from Białystok outside of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Oh surely, and I met a lot of them.</span> <span id="s509">Not from the first day when we got there, but they had another transport and that’s when I met a lot of people from Białystok, yes.</span> <span id="s510">I knew them.</span> <span id="s511">I went to school with them.</span> <span id="s512">My mother knew their mothers.</span> <span id="s513">They were in business.</span> <span id="s514">And that’s it, we stayed together.</span> <span id="s515">We tried to hold onto one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: So you, did you talk together about what was going on there and try to figure out…?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: We all knew the same things.</span> <span id="s518">You couldn’t figure out anything.</span> <span id="s519">You couldn’t escape as far as this is concerned.</span> <span id="s520">You had to listen, and you had to be strong, and you had to help one another the best you were able to.</span> <span id="s521">And that’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s522">I was always helping and one day, one morning… it was called the block, the place where you were staying.</span> <span id="s523">And every day somebody else had to go to get coffee in the morning.</span> <span id="s524">And… two people, because it looked like a garbage barrel.</span> <span id="s525">With two _______________ and you had to carry.</span> <span id="s526">And that morning was my, my turn to go to get the coffee in the morning.</span> <span id="s527">Had to go to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s528">And sure enough I went and the other girl went and from nowhere a girl came along and she had a, a plate like a… you know, like a… I don’t know what, how to… like she used to get the soup there.</span> <span id="s529">You know?</span> <span id="s530">They used to carry with you all the time.</span> <span id="s531">And she stopped the, the pot to get some coffee.</span> <span id="s532">And an SS woman saw her through the window.</span> <span id="s533">She came running out with the dog, and she poured the hot coffee, boiling coffee on my leg.</span> <span id="s534">And the skin came off right away.</span> <span id="s535">And… and that’s it, and there was nobody to talk to.</span> <span id="s536">Nobody to, nobody to complain.</span> <span id="s537">Because nobody would listen to you.</span> <span id="s538">They would gas you.</span> <span id="s539">So, after being three weeks like that, and without medication.</span> <span id="s540">I used to put on, they had like a little blanket to cover yourself, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s541">And I used to, I ripped up a piece and I made like a, like a bandage.</span> <span id="s542">And it used to get stuck during the night and in the morning I used to take it off and I went to work like that.</span> <span id="s543">And couldn’t go on no more.</span> <span id="s544">And I said, after three weeks, “I can’t go on no more to work.</span> <span id="s545">I cannot carry on.”</span> <span id="s546">I said, “Whatever’s going happen, it’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s547">I’ll remain on the block.”</span> <span id="s548">And you were not allowed to go to… to remain on the, on the block, because they would kill you.</span> <span id="s549">They would gas you the same day.</span> <span id="s550">So, I went to work and we were digging ditches and they moved away from there and I threw myself into the ditches and I figured I’ll let me lay there.</span> <span id="s551">It’s like a grave.</span> <span id="s552">Let me remain there.</span> <span id="s553">But somehow they walked away and I crept out and I went on Revier.</span> <span id="s554">The Revier meant, like a hospital.</span> <span id="s555">And they wouldn’t accept no Jews, of course.</span> <span id="s556">So, I went in there and they accepted me.</span> <span id="s557">They asked me who did it.</span> <span id="s558">I said, “I burned myself.”</span> <span id="s559">I was not allowed to say that the SS woman did it to me.</span> <span id="s560">I says, “I burned myself,” and that’s it.</span> <span id="s561">And they accepted me.</span> <span id="s562">You didn’t get no help or medication or anything like that, but at least you had the rest.</span> <span id="s563">You didn’t have to get up six o’clock in the morning and stand outside for Zahl Appell.</span> <span id="s564">They used to count everyone in the morning.</span> <span id="s565">And this took an hour if it rained or snowed, whatever, they didn’t care, because they were dressed.</span> <span id="s566">And so, I said to myself, at least I don’t have to go through this.</span> <span id="s567">And that’s the way I remained for two, three weeks, and then they had a big selection.</span> <span id="s568">And, and I don’t know if you ever saw it, it’s… the beds were like boards, you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s569">Straight boards.</span> <span id="s570">And you were… it was down and up.</span> <span id="s571">It was two, two layers, the boards.</span> <span id="s572">And I was upstairs.</span> <span id="s573">And they said everybody should go down because they had like a selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Was this in the Revier or in the block?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: No, this was at the Revier.</span> <span id="s576">Revier means a hospital, that’s what they used to call it.</span> <span id="s577">Yes.</span> <span id="s578">This was at the Revier.</span> <span id="s579">And the SS came in and they said, “Everybody come down from the bed.</span> <span id="s580">Used to call it colliers (ph).</span> <span id="s581">And… and everybody should go down.</span> <span id="s582">I touched my next door girl and the other side and they were dead.</span> <span id="s583">They came from Greece and they couldn’t… they couldn’t take the climate, because they were used to warm climate.</span> <span id="s584">And it, at that point it was not warm in, in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s585">It was winter time.</span> <span id="s586">And they just, they used to fly, lay, they fell like flies.</span> <span id="s587">They went to bed and they never got up.</span> <span id="s588">And I said to myself, “I don’t stand a chance.”</span> <span id="s589">This is all your head, you’re talking to yourself.</span> <span id="s590">I don’t stand a chance by going down, because you had to take off whatever you wore and parade through them naked.</span> <span id="s591">And if they like the way you looked, they put you one way and if they didn’t, they gassed you.</span> <span id="s592">So, I said, “I’m not going to give them satisfaction.</span> <span id="s593">I’m not going down.”</span> <span id="s594">And I remained like that on the bed.</span> <span id="s595">Somebody carried on with you, you know, tell you not to do it.</span> <span id="s596">And the Doctor, Doctor Mengele was a very tall fellow.</span> <span id="s597">And he touched one, two, and here I was laying in the middle.</span> <span id="s598">And he didn’t touch me, because I was still warm.</span> <span id="s599">They could have taken me down and killed me.</span> <span id="s600">And I remained like that, so this actually saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: How did you know it was Doctor Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Oh, you could tell.</span> <span id="s603">They announced it, too.</span> <span id="s604">They announced everything.</span> <span id="s605">You knew.</span> <span id="s606">Yeah, you couldn’t do nothing about it, but you knew.</span> <span id="s607">And then somehow, I, I don’t remember it was from Greece or from a different country, that gave them a lot of... I think it was from Greece.</span> <span id="s608">And they shouldn’t gas.</span> <span id="s609">They stopped gassing for a while.</span> <span id="s610">And that’s the way I remained on the… on the Revier.</span> <span id="s611">And it saved me because I didn’t have to get up in the morning, like I said before, to stand outside and wait for the Zahl Appell.</span> <span id="s612">And I got the same, how did we used to call it?</span> <span id="s613">Same amount of food that I would get when I worked outside.</span> <span id="s614">That piece of bread and that soup.</span> <span id="s615">And I was friendly with a girl, she was not far from Auschwitz, we were sleeping together and eating together and between the two of us… she lives in England now.</span> <span id="s616">Between the two of us, we had two slices of bread, so we were rich.</span> <span id="s617">So one slice we have to… we used to save it up for the night meal and for the morning, we took along the other one to work.</span> <span id="s618">We never finished both slices of bread.</span> <span id="s619">One we put away.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Was she in the Revier with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Oh yes, she was all over.</span> <span id="s622">No.</span> <span id="s623">She was not… after.</span> <span id="s624">After.</span> <span id="s625">No, not in the Revier.</span> <span id="s626">She was not with me in the Revier.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Halina.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Halina, what was her last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Oh, what was her last name?</span> <span id="s631">I know, I have to take a look in the book, because… She lives in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Okay, we can check later, if you’d like.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yeah, I have to take a look in the book, so.</span> <span id="s634">You want it now, shall I take a look?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s636">You can say it.</span> <span id="s637">What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Halina Lichtenstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Okay, thank you.</span> <span id="s640">Can you, were you about to say something else or shall I ask a question now?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Ask me a question.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Okay, you mentioned before you got the burn on your leg, that you were working, you were digging ditches.</span> <span id="s643">Were you working outside of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Outside, outside, yes, we used to go from the Zahl Appell from in the morning, they used to take you to work by groups.</span> <span id="s645">I don’t know how many people they needed that day.</span> <span id="s646">So, like they counted off thirty, forty, sixty, whatever they needed, and we marched.</span> <span id="s647">We followed them and whatever they said to do, that’s what you had to do that day.</span> <span id="s648">A lot of times they brought back a lot of girls, back dead ones, because they didn’t like the way they looked, or for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s649">And they brought them back on… on two pieces of wood, actually.</span> <span id="s650">And that’s they put them back, because they had to account, each and everyone they took out from the gate, to bring the same amount back, even if dead.</span> <span id="s651">But they had to bring you back.</span> <span id="s652">And that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Were you living in the… do you remember where your barrack was?</span> <span id="s654">Was it in…</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s656">Twenty-one was the, from there they used to take you to gas.</span> <span id="s657">But this must have been four or five.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: In Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: In Birkenau and then we went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s660">From Birkenau it was a terrible place.</span> <span id="s661">First of all when I arrived there we didn’t have no water yet.</span> <span id="s662">We had a lot of mud and I lost a shoe.</span> <span id="s663">If you put your foot in, you couldn’t take it out, you had to leave the shoe.</span> <span id="s664">And it was horrible.</span> <span id="s665">It was not to be believed that you could do that to people.</span> <span id="s666">And mostly young people, because they never chose elderly, because they didn’t, they only needed you to work.</span> <span id="s667">And the elderly, of course, didn’t have no strength, so they gassed them right away.</span> <span id="s668">But the younger ones, they… as long as they needed you, they used you and then after that they killed you.</span> <span id="s669">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Do you remember the prisoner functionaries, Kapos…?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Oh sure, I remember the Kapos very well, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Will you tell me about, what your experience was with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: I had very bad experience with them.</span> <span id="s674">Like I said, we were in Birkenau and the first thing in the morning, after they, of course, cut my hair, put the number on and did everything else what they had to, separated us, of course, from the loved ones.</span> <span id="s675">And six o’clock in the morning or five o’clock in the morning, these four people from Czechoslovakia, they came before us.</span> <span id="s676">And they were real meanies.</span> <span id="s677">Mean.</span> <span id="s678">They had nothing nice about them.</span> <span id="s679">And the first thing out of their mouth at six o’clock in the morning was “Polska koovi stavach (ph).”</span> <span id="s680">I… I, the first time in my life, by that point, I heard.</span> <span id="s681">It meant, to explain it, “Polish whores, get up.”</span> <span id="s682">And I was so bewildered with that saying, because I didn’t know even what a whore meant at that point.</span> <span id="s683">And that was my first greeting with the Kapos.</span> <span id="s684">And from then on, like I said, there was nobody that told you, but you figured out already what’s going on and, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s685">You cannot go under their nails, you cannot ask for anything, because you’re not going to get it and you have to obey.</span> <span id="s686">You have to leave at a certain time your room and then that’s it.</span> <span id="s687">You couldn’t stay there.</span> <span id="s688">To remain on the bed?</span> <span id="s689">Never, because they would gas you right away.</span> <span id="s690">And like I said, luck was with me, I don’t know if it’s luck, or… I always said, that through my life, through my stories I always feel that somebody carries on with you.</span> <span id="s691">Or whatever it happens in life, that somebody carries on with you.</span> <span id="s692">It’s God will.</span> <span id="s693">I shouldn’t have gotten off the bed.</span> <span id="s694">Had I gotten off the bed, they would have taken me immediately.</span> <span id="s695">But like I said, my brain told me, you’ll never make it.</span> <span id="s696">And don’t get undressed and don’t go through him.</span> <span id="s697">And I remained.</span> <span id="s698">And like I said before, I was in the Revier after a few weeks.</span> <span id="s699">And of course they didn’t treat me, but at least I had the chance to… not to go outside.</span> <span id="s700">And then I got a better job.</span> <span id="s701">So the woman that took care on me, she was a Polish woman—not took care, but she spoke to me, let’s put it this way—on the Revier, was a very nice person.</span> <span id="s702">So one day I approached her after being there maybe three or four months.</span> <span id="s703">So I, I asked her if… she used to come in the morning, she was wearing a white coat.</span> <span id="s704">And she was clean and she had a short hair cut.</span> <span id="s705">She was really pretty woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: She was a Polish… Magda, I think it was.</span> <span id="s708">And I, I approached her one morning.</span> <span id="s709">And I said to her, “What do you do with the water after you finish washing yourself?”</span> <span id="s710">And she looked at me.</span> <span id="s711">She says, “Why?</span> <span id="s712">Do you want to drink it?”</span> <span id="s713">I said, “No, who drinks dirty water?”</span> <span id="s714">I said, “I want to wash myself around the way you do.</span> <span id="s715">I want to be clean.</span> <span id="s716">I want to look good like you do.”</span> <span id="s717">So, something went into her head and she, every day that she came in, in the morning, she brought me a, you know, a basin, a small basin with water with the soap and the dirt and everything when she washed herself.</span> <span id="s718">And I used to wash myself around.</span> <span id="s719">And I felt so good, like a million dollars.</span> <span id="s720">So I said to myself, how could I help the woman?</span> <span id="s721">I had no money.</span> <span id="s722">I can’t give her no money.</span> <span id="s723">I can’t give her nothing that I have of me.</span> <span id="s724">What could I do?</span> <span id="s725">I said, okay, I’m going to help her to clean out.</span> <span id="s726">She was cleaning out under the beds, the walk.</span> <span id="s727">And I said, I have to help her.</span> <span id="s728">Before she gets here, I’m going to do it and when she comes she won’t have so much work.</span> <span id="s729">So, I told her.</span> <span id="s730">But when I went down, I could, I fainted from laying so long on the bed.</span> <span id="s731">That I couldn’t, I couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s732">So I got up, and somebody helped me to go back on the bed.</span> <span id="s733">When she came in that day, I told her what happened.</span> <span id="s734">She says, “If you want to live, you must get off that bed.”</span> <span id="s735">I said, “Sure I want to live.”</span> <span id="s736">So, she said, “But let’s do it…” excuse me.</span> <span id="s737">“You start doing it before the SS comes in, before they change.”</span> <span id="s738">So, I don’t know what time it was, four or five o’clock, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s739">So I climbed down again from the bed and I was able to stand for a minute.</span> <span id="s740">So this was really a big accomplishment.</span> <span id="s741">And I took a chair and I pushed it.</span> <span id="s742">And I was walking, like jumping, I couldn’t put down yet the foot all the way on the bottom, on the floor like.</span> <span id="s743">But every day I tried, until I got stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">End of Tape 1, Side B Tape 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Justine Lerner.</span> <span id="s746">Okay, go ahead with the story about cleaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: About cleaning for that woman.</span> <span id="s748">And she appreciated it very, very much.</span> <span id="s749">And she thought it was very clever of me to do a thing like that.</span> <span id="s750">And she used to give me an extra piece of bread.</span> <span id="s751">And at that point, she told me that I cannot remain on the bed.</span> <span id="s752">I have to get off and they were, they were trying out… there was a period of time that they didn’t gas.</span> <span id="s753">They got a lot of money.</span> <span id="s754">I think it was from Turkey or I can’t remember exactly from where it was.</span> <span id="s755">And this was to, to hold off the, the selections.</span> <span id="s756">And she said they were trying, they were looking for, for nurses.</span> <span id="s757">That pretty soon they were going to ask who wants to become a nurse.</span> <span id="s758">So, she said to me, “I would advise you to volunteer for that.”</span> <span id="s759">So, that’s exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s760">I volunteered and I was transferred from this into a different, a better place, not too far from one another.</span> <span id="s761">And I didn’t get as a nurse, but I got as… when the new arrivals came on, when they took off their clothes, the personal things you had to leave there too, everything.</span> <span id="s762">And you had to go through to look for diamonds, or for money people used to sew in their clothes.</span> <span id="s763">And that’s what was my job.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: This is the Canada commando?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Oh yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s766">You know that.</span> <span id="s767">Yes, yes, Canada, yes, right, right, right.</span> <span id="s768">So that’s where I worked.</span> <span id="s769">And of course the SS stood right by and there was big boxes like, how do you… like piggy banks, but of course it was not a piggy bank, but it was a, big boxes with locks on top.</span> <span id="s770">And they used to… had to put in all the, whatever you got, put it right in there.</span> <span id="s771">And this was my job.</span> <span id="s772">And then you had to bring in the clothes to the zone or whatever they call it.</span> <span id="s773">It’s like a, they used to… like cleaners, they used to clean the clothes.</span> <span id="s774">They went through the heat, and that’s what… I don’t know what they did with it afterwards, but that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s775">And that’s what I was working for.</span> <span id="s776">And this helped me, too, not to get outside with my leg.</span> <span id="s777">And of course, it healed by now, but I… it left me a terrible scar.</span> <span id="s778">It… it grew like wild flesh on it, but I was happy that I could walk on it.</span> <span id="s779">And that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s780">When I came out of there, when people saw me that they knew me, they didn’t believe that I’m alive, because months I was not with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Did you go back to living in the same barrack that you were living in, sleeping in before you went to the Revier?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: No, I didn’t go to that barrack because I was in a different place already.</span> <span id="s783">And… but it was a better place, because there, like I said before, you didn’t have to stand outside in… for the Zahl Appell.</span> <span id="s784">They knew exactly where we are and where we’re working and that’s what it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: So, there was not more Zahl Appell at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: No, no more in the morning, no more Zahl Appells, no.</span> <span id="s787">You didn’t have… they didn’t have to count you already, because they knew there were so many people, so many people are working there and that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s788">My luck that I had the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Is this where you met, you mentioned that you had a friend…?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Halina?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Halina.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes, that’s where I met her.</span> <span id="s793">Halina Lichtenstein, yes, we became very good friends, like sisters.</span> <span id="s794">And like I was telling you before, we never finished the bread and everybody used to be envious.</span> <span id="s795">How could we do it?</span> <span id="s796">I says, that’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s797">We’re not vultures.</span> <span id="s798">We thought tomorrow, we’re going to live maybe till tomorrow, so we’ll have the bread for tomorrow.</span> <span id="s799">A lot of people didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s800">They… whatever they gave them, who knows if they’ll make it to tomorrow?</span> <span id="s801">In the meantime, they ate it up.</span> <span id="s802">And I never cut my bread.</span> <span id="s803">I always gave her, she should do it.</span> <span id="s804">Because thinking, God forbid, maybe I’m taking a bigger slice for myself.</span> <span id="s805">Would never do that.</span> <span id="s806">That was in my mind.</span> <span id="s807">That’s the way I was raised.</span> <span id="s808">And we were wonderful, we were just like family.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Was she from Białystok, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: No, she was from Bendin (ph), that’s near Auschwitz, not too far from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s811">So she was from around there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Do you think it helped you to survive, to have that little bit of humanity and kindness in your life?</span> <span id="s813">Did that help you to have hope for your future?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s815">It has to do… I never changed as far as helping people.</span> <span id="s816">All my life I suffered for that.</span> <span id="s817">I never changed.</span> <span id="s818">I think it has to do with the upbringing, to do, be good, to help.</span> <span id="s819">Even now, all my life I’ve been like that, after the war too.</span> <span id="s820">If somebody… My mother was that way.</span> <span id="s821">If somebody needed a donation, or to marry off a child and they had no money, my mother was always there helping.</span> <span id="s822">She knew already the people, and they always gave her and she always put it in anonymous, not to know or to thank you what you did.</span> <span id="s823">This is a wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s824">And I do it the same way.</span> <span id="s825">All my life I’ve been doing it.</span> <span id="s826">I got… my hair was cut off, but later on towards the end, they allowed you a little hair to grow.</span> <span id="s827">And when the transfers from Białystok came, and like I said before, I had a good job already and I was trying to help.</span> <span id="s828">And they told me that the block elteste (ph), in other words, this was the one that was watching them, the Kapo, she wanted a doll.</span> <span id="s829">Like I said before, we were working, we were working with the clothes and, and so I told somebody else, if they came along, you find a doll, put it away.</span> <span id="s830">Hide it.</span> <span id="s831">I took the doll and I threw it over the, the fence.</span> <span id="s832">And they caught me.</span> <span id="s833">And they pulled me out.</span> <span id="s834">And they cut my hair, again, because at that point already we had, you know, they let you have a little hair already.</span> <span id="s835">And of course, when they take the hair off, they take all the beauty away, especially to a woman.</span> <span id="s836">And they put me on a, on a pail in the middle of everybody, like at Zahl Appell, and they gave me sixteen, uh, with a belt.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Lashes?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Lashes.</span> <span id="s839">And that’s it, you couldn’t cry, and you couldn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s840">And that’s that.</span> <span id="s841">You were guilty.</span> <span id="s842">You took it and that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s843">So you would think I forgot already?</span> <span id="s844">No.</span> <span id="s845">Then somebody else needed something else, but that’s the way I am.</span> <span id="s846">I can’t help myself, always good to people.</span> <span id="s847">I always shared.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Were you injured by that to the point where it was hard to work?</span> <span id="s849">Or did you recover?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: I wasn’t injured.</span> <span id="s851">No, I was not injured, but I was ashamed.</span> <span id="s852">The shame was there, but not the injury.</span> <span id="s853">It hurt for a bit, the backside hurt, of course, but not ashamed.</span> <span id="s854">I was ashamed rather than pain, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Did you have dreams and fantasies, things that you would do to escape in your mind, at least?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: No, I knew I could never make it.</span> <span id="s857">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s858">I was just like a lamb.</span> <span id="s859">I was following whatever they said.</span> <span id="s860">I helped people, yes.</span> <span id="s861">I have a friend, that I saved her.</span> <span id="s862">She lives in Brooklyn yet.</span> <span id="s863">Called me last week.</span> <span id="s864">Sonja Rotenberg (ph) is her name.</span> <span id="s865">She had malaria, and there was a selection going through.</span> <span id="s866">And she, and I was working that time.</span> <span id="s867">She said to me, “Justine, Jospe, Jospele, help me, help me, help me.”</span> <span id="s868">So I took a beet, and I rubbed her cheeks, and I put her on a clean nightgown.</span> <span id="s869">And instead of going through this way and shaking, I put a mattress under her, she could quiet down.</span> <span id="s870">And instead of going this way, she went that way.</span> <span id="s871">And all her life… she’s in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s872">And always, forever, said, “She was the one that saved my life.</span> <span id="s873">She was the one that saved my life.”</span> <span id="s874">And I always did things that seemed possible, let’s put it this way, just to help out somebody.</span> <span id="s875">But that’s my nature, I can’t help it.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: When… what would… do you remember what you would talk about with your friend, like with Halina or any other friends when you weren’t working?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: I remember a lot… you couldn’t talk while you were working.</span> <span id="s878">I’m talking about already after the war we were together in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Did you have a chance to talk together while you weren’t working while you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Here and there a word, but you couldn’t make the conversation, because they were watching and nobody wanted we should get hurt.</span> <span id="s881">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s882">So if it was important you said one word, but otherwise you wouldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s883">You couldn’t have a conversation, especially when they were standing and watching you.</span> <span id="s884">Uh uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Did you work, how many days a week did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Every day.</span> <span id="s887">There was no Sabbath, no Sunday, no, every day you worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: From morning until…</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: From morning until, they had to bring you back at a certain time, five or six o’clock, depends the time of the year.</span> <span id="s890">If the day was longer, you worked longer.</span> <span id="s891">If the day was getting dark, you had to return back.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Did you have any hope that you would survive?</span> <span id="s893">Did you have an idea that it would end sometime?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Not at this point.</span> <span id="s895">Not from the beginning, you had no hope.</span> <span id="s896">Later on you started to have hope.</span> <span id="s897">But not from that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: How did you start to have hope?</span> <span id="s899">Did you get any news from the outside world?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: You didn’t have to get news.</span> <span id="s901">First of all, they were evacuating us from Auschwitz, because the Russians came close and they did not… the Germans did not want to fall into the Russian hands.</span> <span id="s902">So, they evacuated us to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s903">Ravensbrück was another camp, but it was not as bad as Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s904">They didn’t have the gassing chambers.</span> <span id="s905">It was just a concentration camp and there I got a job in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s906">And I was dishing out food and everybody came over, “Jospele, Jospele, give me some food.”</span> <span id="s907">Just pour it in.</span> <span id="s908">You know, because I, it was not mine to begin with, and they were hungry.</span> <span id="s909">So I always did that.</span> <span id="s910">In that respect I was lucky, I always got good jobs.</span> <span id="s911">And then from Ravensbrück they transferred us to Switau.</span> <span id="s912">That’s where we were liberated.</span> <span id="s913">And there, I was already there with nine, nine girls.</span> <span id="s914">All of us were Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s915">And somehow, like I said before, this was not a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s916">They couldn’t gas you there.</span> <span id="s917">It was just working, a camp, a concentration, but without the, without the, what do you call that?</span> <span id="s918">The gas chambers.</span> <span id="s919">So, now we were there nine girls and there were a lot of Polish women that were from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s920">And they exactly knew that we are Jews.</span> <span id="s921">So, one day we spoke among ourselves and we decided that we’re not going to go in, all of us, together to wash in the morning, because we didn’t want to be with anybody that should identify us.</span> <span id="s922">So, we ran in and we washed ourselves, like three of them and three stood outside.</span> <span id="s923">And that’s the way we made it up.</span> <span id="s924">Sure enough, one day all of the Polish, and they were even anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s925">They were very mean.</span> <span id="s926">It’s not that we took anything away, but they had to squeal, they had to tell that we are not, that we are not gentiles, we are Jews.</span> <span id="s927">And sure enough, one day they found out.</span> <span id="s928">And they went and they squealed.</span> <span id="s929">And they called us all out.</span> <span id="s930">These, these, these, you know, the numbers they called and we had to go in the front.</span> <span id="s931">And they said to us, “Are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s932">Are you Jews?”</span> <span id="s933">We said, “No.”</span> <span id="s934">We made it up before, because we felt that it’s the end.</span> <span id="s935">That was what it was trying to come.</span> <span id="s936">We heard the, you know, that’s a battlefield going on.</span> <span id="s937">We heard the shooting.</span> <span id="s938">We heard the cannonen (ph), they used to call it, the… everything, but we didn’t know exactly when it’s going to be the end.</span> <span id="s939">We knew it’s nearby.</span> <span id="s940">So, that’s the way we made up, that we… each one was going to say, “My mother was Jewish, my father was a gentile.”</span> <span id="s941">The other one said, “My father was gentile, my mother was Jewish.”</span> <span id="s942">You know, all of us denying.</span> <span id="s943">And they looked, and they looked, and they looked and thank God, they didn’t kill us.</span> <span id="s944">But… and then from there we went to Switau.</span> <span id="s945">This was the last camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: I’m going to, sorry, I’m going to interrupt you a little bit, because I wanted to hear about how you got from… I don’t want get too far ahead of it, because I wanted to hear about…</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Hmm.</span> <span id="s948">I’m making it already finished.</span> <span id="s949">(Laughter.)</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: …Yeah.</span> <span id="s951">There was a time…</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: You got to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Daniel Lerner (Justine’s grandson): Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Would you tell me about, let’s go back to the time that you were in Auschwitz and you’re getting ready to leave.</span> <span id="s955">Did you leave on a forced march?</span> <span id="s956">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: We left, they put us back on buses, open buses.</span> <span id="s958">And I remember like now it was snowing.</span> <span id="s959">And we all climbed up on the buses.</span> <span id="s960">And they were taking us… we didn’t know where, but we got to Ravensbrück.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: This was winter 1945?</span> <span id="s962">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: ‘45, right.</span> <span id="s964">We stayed in Ravensbrück not too long, maybe six months.</span> <span id="s965">And from there we went to last one, Switau, the Czechs.</span> <span id="s966">And that was, that’s where we were liberated from.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: So, you were, you didn’t have to march out of…?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s969">Some of them from the beginning, they took them by foot.</span> <span id="s970">We went by train, by bus.</span> <span id="s971">Yeah, they loaded us up on the buses and we traveled by bus, because it was a few selections from Auschwitz, two or three, because a lot of them went by foot and they ran away from there.</span> <span id="s972">That my friend’s… her husband did that.</span> <span id="s973">He escaped, because he knew the area.</span> <span id="s974">It was, Bendin was not too far from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s975">And he knew exactly the area, the woods, and that’s where he escaped to.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Who, who… I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s977">Will you repeat who escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: That’s my friend’s husband.</span> <span id="s979">Halina, the one that is England now, her husband did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: She was married at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: She was married before the war, right.</span> <span id="s982">Right.</span> <span id="s983">She was a little older than I was.</span> <span id="s984">She was married before the war.</span> <span id="s985">And that’s what her husband escaped into the woods, because they knew the area very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Were you with Halina on the buses away from…?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s988">I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s989">She had to be together, because we were on the last one.</span> <span id="s990">We were in Switau together.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Were you in Ravensbrück together?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: In Ravensbrück together, too, yeah.</span> <span id="s993">So we were there together, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Do you remember anything about the journey by bus?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: It was not a bus like a bus.</span> <span id="s996">It was like a truck, you know.</span> <span id="s997">The journey was terrible, because it was like unknown, you didn’t know where you were going.</span> <span id="s998">And that’s all I could remember actually from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: What kind of a bus was it?</span> <span id="s1000">Was it closed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Open, open like cattle, you know, like an open big bus.</span> <span id="s1002">A truck better than a bus.</span> <span id="s1003">A truck I would say, an open truck, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: And were you with people who were from the Canada Commando that you worked with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: All women or women and men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: All women.</span> <span id="s1008">There was no men down there, all women.</span> <span id="s1009">Different blocks had men, but no, we were all women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Is there anything else that you can think of to tell me about your time in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1011">Was there anything striking that happened to you?</span> <span id="s1012">Anything you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: The only thing I could remember is like I said, they burned my leg and when they cut my hair off.</span> <span id="s1014">And they hit me.</span> <span id="s1015">Otherwise, oh sure when I came out of the Revier, out of the hospital, people didn’t want to believe that I’m alive, because they, they didn’t see me for months.</span> <span id="s1016">So, this was a shock to a lot of them, even my cousin, but we stayed together.</span> <span id="s1017">And nothing else, I mean I witnessed a lot, but nothing else that I could really say, that unusual, you know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s1018">Everybody else there lived the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: You had a cousin who was in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1021">The only two, my mother and her mother were sisters and she came with the second transport, but she was ten years younger than I was.</span> <span id="s1022">She was, I think, the youngest thing in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1023">She passed away three years ago.</span> <span id="s1024">She had a heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Her name was Leah Weitzenfeld (ph), and she was married in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Weitzenfeld was her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Weitzenfeld was her maiden name, yes, Leah Weitzenfeld, yes.</span> <span id="s1029">And she has two children, a son, who’s a pharmacist and he married a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s1030">And we are in touch.</span> <span id="s1031">They live in Brooklyn, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Did you try, did you have any information at all when you were in Auschwitz about what had happened to your family?</span> <span id="s1033">Was there any way to find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1035">When the second transport came, or the third one it would have to be, they said that they saw my mother coming into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1036">The people from Białystok, interviewed them.</span> <span id="s1037">And they said… and that’s when I got hit, when they wanted a doll for the Block elteste (ph), for the Kapo.</span> <span id="s1038">And that’s when I tried to organize and give it to her.</span> <span id="s1039">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1040">And that’s when they said, in that transport my mother was, but I did not see her.</span> <span id="s1041">I did not see anybody, no.</span> <span id="s1042">That was last time.</span> <span id="s1043">When I met them at, when we arrived in Auschwitz, I never saw them again.</span> <span id="s1044">Always hoping, always searching, always looking, but of course, nothing.</span> <span id="s1045">When I was in Paris, we lived in Paris for a year, after the war, of course.</span> <span id="s1046">And I was always going on the trains, looking.</span> <span id="s1047">In Europe the trains are much better than… you never saw a train, did you?</span> <span id="s1048">Oh, in Washington they have beautiful trains.</span> <span id="s1049">Here, because it was riding in Washington on the train.</span> <span id="s1050">But by us in New York, the trains were horrible.</span> <span id="s1051">And I always used to run from train to train.</span> <span id="s1052">That’s what I did in Paris, looking, the searching.</span> <span id="s1053">From the back, look like my sister, from the back look like my brother.</span> <span id="s1054">Always thinking, looking into their eyes, but of course, it was not them.</span> <span id="s1055">But I always thought, yes, yes, I’m going to find somebody.</span> <span id="s1056">But that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Now, going back again, just a little bit.</span> <span id="s1058">I don’t know whether this question is going to be clear, but you described before you arrived in Auschwitz how, what a close-knit family you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: You were all very close and you were dependent on your parents to a certain degree to kind of tell you what was going on and to give you a sense of how things, like what the future might be.</span> <span id="s1061">And you talked about how you trusted your father and your father always believed that things would turn out all right.</span> <span id="s1062">It must have been a terrible shock to arrive and be suddenly separated from everyone you knew and yet somehow, somehow you survived that.</span> <span id="s1063">Can you say something about how you adjusted to that extreme change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: I always felt, this I told my friends in Paris also, that this was my mother’s and my father’s last wish, that somebody has to remain from the family and carry on.</span> <span id="s1065">And I was the one to survive and that’s what I have to do.</span> <span id="s1066">I have to build back what we lost.</span> <span id="s1067">That’s the way I lived after the war.</span> <span id="s1068">But of course, it’s just like a, like a made up story, but it’s, this helped me a lot in my life.</span> <span id="s1069">Like I’m not doing it, but somebody else tells me to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: That was what kept you going in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: That’s what kept me going.</span> <span id="s1072">My friend told me that, too.</span> <span id="s1073">Halina, the one from England.</span> <span id="s1074">There was a time in my life when I was in Paris, I’m going way ahead.</span> <span id="s1075">This was after the war and we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1076">And the Americans liberated us.</span> <span id="s1077">And each of us from the nine girls that there were, had family in the United States.</span> <span id="s1078">I had an uncle.</span> <span id="s1079">This one had a sister and this one had in South America.</span> <span id="s1080">Every one of us had family and they advised us that we shouldn’t go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1081">They asked us, what do we want to do.</span> <span id="s1082">And we said, we want to go to Poland to look for the family.</span> <span id="s1083">And they advised us not to go back to Poland, because at that point already everything was shared up already, what belongs to whom.</span> <span id="s1084">Poland belonged to Russia already.</span> <span id="s1085">And they told us not to go, because we’ll never get out of there.</span> <span id="s1086">So, the only thing they advised, advised us, excuse me, is we should go back to Paris.</span> <span id="s1087">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1088">So, the Americans, the ones that liberated, advised us not to go back to Paris, uh, not to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1089">We should go to Paris, from there the organizations will take over and we’ll find our family and then we’ll be able to get to them.</span> <span id="s1090">So that’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s1091">They gave us a paper and they put us on, because we had no clothes.</span> <span id="s1092">So, they gave us a paper, and they gave us uniforms that the WACs wore and they put us on the train.</span> <span id="s1093">And we were going to Paris from Switau, from the Czechs, we were going to Paris.</span> <span id="s1094">And on the way they took us off the train one stop and they said that we shouldn’t talk to them, we should just give them the paper.</span> <span id="s1095">And sure enough on the, the next stop they put us back on and we came to Paris.</span> <span id="s1096">And there Rothschild gave us, it was a hotel.</span> <span id="s1097">And they gave us the hotel for the misplaced people.</span> <span id="s1098">And that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s1099">We slept two in a room and downstairs was a kitchen.</span> <span id="s1100">So, and we used to be able to come down and eat.</span> <span id="s1101">Now, I don’t remember how long I was there, but I just couldn’t go down with a dish again and eat.</span> <span id="s1102">So, I cried so much.</span> <span id="s1103">But it was more tears in the dish than it was food.</span> <span id="s1104">And I decide I’m going to cook for myself.</span> <span id="s1105">And each floor, they had like a two burner.</span> <span id="s1106">So, that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1107">I bought some potatoes and that’s what I used to cook.</span> <span id="s1108">But of course, there was like a line.</span> <span id="s1109">You know, you had to wait quite a while, but it was for me better not to go downstairs, but to cook and eat for myself.</span> <span id="s1110">And so, that’s where I got in with my friend.</span> <span id="s1111">I slept with Halina, with my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1112">My cousin and another friend was in the other room.</span> <span id="s1113">We were… we had nine rooms, one after the other.</span> <span id="s1114">And at one point practically everybody found their family already and they were leaving.</span> <span id="s1115">And of course, me, I didn’t find my family, didn’t find my uncle.</span> <span id="s1116">And the only thing is, I said to myself and I said to them too, either he’s very rich, he doesn’t want to identify himself, or he died, one of the two, so many years.</span> <span id="s1117">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: I’m going to, I’m sorry to do this, but I’m going to interrupt you again, because I’m going to forget…</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: We skipped too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Yeah, we need to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: We need to go back, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: And find out a little bit.</span> <span id="s1123">But we’ll remember…</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Where we stopped…</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: …where we left off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Yes, in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: And come back to that, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: You were, we were talking a little while ago about the trip from Auschwitz to Ravensbrück.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Ravensbrück, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: And you had mentioned a little earlier a little bit about Ravensbrück, but would you tell me more about the conditions there and what the living conditions were like, where you slept and so forth?</span> <span id="s1132">And then I’ll ask you a few questions about Ravensbrück.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: The sleeping conditions were practically the same, but the only thing is, there we already had water.</span> <span id="s1134">You could wash yourself whenever you wanted.</span> <span id="s1135">And of course the food was the same, but we didn’t have the… End of Tape 2, Side A Tape 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Tape two, side B of an interview with Justine Lerner.</span> <span id="s1137">You were telling me about arriving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Ravensbrück, yeah.</span> <span id="s1139">And we didn’t have it on our heads that there is gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1140">So you were a little bit more at ease than you were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1141">That’s the only thing.</span> <span id="s1142">That’s the only thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: You were with your cousin at that point, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: My cousin, I don’t remember her being in Ravensbrück, because I think we were not.</span> <span id="s1145">In Auschwitz we were together.</span> <span id="s1146">And then after the war, in the last one we were together.</span> <span id="s1147">In the last one we were, but Ravensbrück, I don’t remember if she was with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: Do you know how long the journey from Auschwitz to Ravensbrück took?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1150">It had to be a few hours, maybe five or six hours for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Did you have the sense at that time that the war was coming close to an end?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Only from, because you were talking among yourself.</span> <span id="s1153">I mean, here and there somebody passed by and they heard a radio.</span> <span id="s1154">So this came the news, but otherwise we were not allowed to have any, any news.</span> <span id="s1155">But like I said, you heard, heard the guns, I mean you had to be deaf not to hear it, because it was nearby.</span> <span id="s1156">But of course, we did not know when we were going to be liberated.</span> <span id="s1157">We knew it was close, but how close we did not know.</span> <span id="s1158">Because at one point like we used to hear “roooh, roooh” all night long and then all of a sudden it got quiet.</span> <span id="s1159">So we figured it out, geniuses, that they pushed them back.</span> <span id="s1160">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s1161">And then again, and then again it was too quiet.</span> <span id="s1162">But we knew that the end is near, but we didn’t know how near it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: You said you got a job in the kitchen?</span> <span id="s1164">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Always the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1166">I love the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1167">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1168">I… how did it happen?</span> <span id="s1169">By luck, like I said before, nothing unusual, just picked, you know.</span> <span id="s1170">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s1171">And like I said before, everybody put in their, their thing and took out some food and of course, I didn’t stop them.</span> <span id="s1172">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s1173">And that’s what people appreciated.</span> <span id="s1174">Always was there for the undertaker, I always let them do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Did people look out for you, too?</span> <span id="s1176">You talk about how you were looking out for other people.</span> <span id="s1177">Do you think people were looking out for you too, as a result?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: I always had belief that they would.</span> <span id="s1179">I always believed that they would.</span> <span id="s1180">I had very dear friends and that’s what actually helped me in actual life, because family we didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1181">And we were like sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s1182">When you first came to the, to the United States and prior to that, we were looking for one another and when we found each other it was like, like you found somebody from the family.</span> <span id="s1183">And don’t forget, it’s over fifty years and we still, the ones that are alive, we are very, very close.</span> <span id="s1184">There is no week that I shouldn’t speak to them.</span> <span id="s1185">And helping in every way that we could, if God forbid somebody’s sick.</span> <span id="s1186">When it happened to me, only my friend from concentration camp helped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: When you were, when you had… when you were attacked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Yes, when I was attacked and left in the house.</span> <span id="s1189">So, I was all alone.</span> <span id="s1190">My husband had passed away and my tenant moved out that day, the one that lived upstairs.</span> <span id="s1191">And there was nobody, nobody.</span> <span id="s1192">And that day I was supposed to go to a funeral, also from, one from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1193">She lost her son of cancer, young fellow.</span> <span id="s1194">And I was going to go to the funeral.</span> <span id="s1195">And I had a ride.</span> <span id="s1196">She didn’t live too far from me, a few blocks.</span> <span id="s1197">And when I came down on the block they told that they just left.</span> <span id="s1198">They didn’t wait for me.</span> <span id="s1199">I was very disappointed and hurt, and unbelievable, how could you not wait?</span> <span id="s1200">I don’t know if up to today, if they forgot or they just didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1201">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1202">Because right after this it happened.</span> <span id="s1203">And I never… I don’t know them so well.</span> <span id="s1204">But being she lives on the block, I was going to go with their neighbor, which they were also survivors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1205">But like I said, I didn’t know them so close.</span> <span id="s1206">So I really don’t know if they did it deliberately or if they forgot, because I never was able to discuss it with them.</span> <span id="s1207">So, when I came there on the block and it was very short for me, maybe two blocks.</span> <span id="s1208">So the neighbor said to me, “Whom you looking for?”</span> <span id="s1209">So, I told her.</span> <span id="s1210">She said, “They just left.</span> <span id="s1211">Everybody left.”</span> <span id="s1212">So, I came home and I got undressed.</span> <span id="s1213">This was on a Friday, and started to prepare for dinner.</span> <span id="s1214">And I opened up the window.</span> <span id="s1215">And the, I had a, a, you know, what they call that?</span> <span id="s1216">For the air to come through.</span> <span id="s1217">Like a shade or whatever it’s called.</span> <span id="s1218">And not thinking, not thinking, that God forbid somebody’s going to climb in through that, open up the window and get in.</span> <span id="s1219">And he hit me in the head, cut my face.</span> <span id="s1220">I don’t know, he broke my arms, they were hanging, both of them.</span> <span id="s1221">He did something terrible.</span> <span id="s1222">And my friend… me and his wife, she passed away, we were the best of friends from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1223">I’m now friends with her daughters, always was.</span> <span id="s1224">They live in New York… he knew that I was supposed to go to the funeral.</span> <span id="s1225">He didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1226">And he kept calling.</span> <span id="s1227">Called in the evening and no answer.</span> <span id="s1228">So he couldn’t figure it out what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1229">Then he thought maybe I went to, the woman that lost her son, to their daughter, to stay with them, help out.</span> <span id="s1230">So, Sunday he came along to the house and I lived on the corner.</span> <span id="s1231">And he walked around, parked the car and he walked around this way.</span> <span id="s1232">“Justine, Justine, where are you?”</span> <span id="s1233">And I don’t know from what and when.</span> <span id="s1234">I yelled out, “Here I am.</span> <span id="s1235">Save me, help me.”</span> <span id="s1236">And that’s when he heard my voice.</span> <span id="s1237">Across the street was sitting women, neighbors.</span> <span id="s1238">So they, he asked the neighbors, “Did you see Justine?”</span> <span id="s1239">And she said “No, but I’m wondering, the light is on.</span> <span id="s1240">She never used to leave the light on.</span> <span id="s1241">The light is on and I haven’t seen her.”</span> <span id="s1242">So, when he heard that, he ran over to them and they climbed through the window, the kitchen window, because I had a porch, like a terrace like this, but higher.</span> <span id="s1243">And they went in, one of them went in through the window and they found me laying on the floor in my bedroom in a puddle of blood.</span> <span id="s1244">And that’s when they called the police.</span> <span id="s1245">And the police called an ambulance and that’s why they put me into a hospital, a trauma hospital.</span> <span id="s1246">And they called my son and that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: How long had you been lying there before somebody found you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Twenty-four hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Twenty-four hours, from Friday, I don’t know what time Friday.</span> <span id="s1251">But from Friday till Sunday.</span> <span id="s1252">It had to be Friday maybe twelve or one o’clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1253">And that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Well, let’s… we’ll come back to that time again later, but let’s again go back to the time that you were in Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s1255">And you, you started working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1256">Was there brutality on the part of the guards?</span> <span id="s1257">Or were things starting to ease off?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: No, no, we didn’t find it so bad.</span> <span id="s1259">It was like a paradise away from Auschwitz in Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s1260">It was much better, much better, different people, different looks.</span> <span id="s1261">And like I said before, the gas chambers were not on top of our heads, on top of it.</span> <span id="s1262">And we had experience already.</span> <span id="s1263">We were about already a few years.</span> <span id="s1264">So, it was much easier than Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: You had enough to eat?</span> <span id="s1266">Did you have enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Like we were… I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1268">We never complained about the food.</span> <span id="s1269">Never.</span> <span id="s1270">We never.</span> <span id="s1271">You, you didn’t have the room to complain, but I think it was much better than in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1272">Auschwitz was the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: How long were you in, do you have any sense of how long you were in Ravensbrück?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: I really don’t, maybe five months at most, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: And then how did it happen that you went from there to Switau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: They used to take people to different camps, so that’s where they took us to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1277">Uh, to Switau.</span> <span id="s1278">That’s in the Czechs, Czechoslovakia, yes, that’s where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: And that was a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: It was a camp, yeah, but they did not have, like I said before, they did not have the gas chambers there.</span> <span id="s1281">Just working camp, you know?</span> <span id="s1282">But no, no gas chambers, no smoke coming out from the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: How many of you were in that transport?</span> <span id="s1284">Was there a large transport from Ravensbrück?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Nine, we were nine girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Only nine girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Only nine girls.</span> <span id="s1288">No, I mean the Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s1289">We stayed together, we were only nine.</span> <span id="s1290">There was a lot of them coming from Ravensbrück to Switau, but we stayed together.</span> <span id="s1291">We were, like I said before, the only nine Jewish girls, Jewish girls that were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: So in Ravensbrück, you nine Jewish girls stuck together there, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1294">We stuck together a long time, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: So when you were deported on the buses from Auschwitz to Ravensbrück, were those buses, were the people on the bus mostly non-Jewish prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: Mostly of them.</span> <span id="s1297">Mostly, but maybe there were a lot of Jews too, that we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1298">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s1299">But we stayed together.</span> <span id="s1300">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1301">Everybody had somebody that, you know, was holding onto somebody.</span> <span id="s1302">And that’s exactly what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: What were you doing in Switau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: The same thing like we did in Auschwitz, nothing worked that you could say that you worked at a machine, you did something, something that you learned a trade or anything... nothing like that.</span> <span id="s1305">We just were working and digging and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1306">And first, one day you digged and the second day you covered it.</span> <span id="s1307">It’s… that was the work, labor, that was nothing special that you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Did you have any idea what the goal was in the labor?</span> <span id="s1309">Was something being built or arranged?</span> <span id="s1310">Or were you in the dark about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: In the dark about everything.</span> <span id="s1312">No.</span> <span id="s1313">You didn’t have a radio, you didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s1314">You only depended on the, on the people that heard news.</span> <span id="s1315">If you passed by, you heard a radio, so you listened in on a word or two.</span> <span id="s1316">That’s what you….</span> <span id="s1317">but you didn’t have no first class news.</span> <span id="s1318">No, you did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: How were the living conditions there in Switau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: The same thing like in Ravensbrück, this was the same thing.</span> <span id="s1321">It was a little more scary like I said because they pulled us out, you know, and we had to tell them.</span> <span id="s1322">But otherwise it was the same conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: So people there…</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: You had more bedrooms maybe.</span> <span id="s1325">It was a little more elaborate than Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1326">You had the water, you had to go to the bathrooms.</span> <span id="s1327">So this was… when we first came to Auschwitz, we didn’t have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: You could clean yourself in Switau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: In Switau, yes, you were able to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: You could… every day could you clean yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Every day, yes, yes, you could clean yourself, yes.</span> <span id="s1332">They had a big washroom maybe three times as big as that room, for the ladies, for the women to go into.</span> <span id="s1333">So they had a basin and they had soap.</span> <span id="s1334">You could wash yourself around, yes.</span> <span id="s1335">Yeah, it meant a lot.</span> <span id="s1336">Because, well, you liked to stay clean, that’s what it’s all about, it means a lot to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Was it all women there in Switau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Yes, all women.</span> <span id="s1339">There was no men there.</span> <span id="s1340">There was no men there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Do you have any sense of how many people were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Oh, thousands, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s1343">Thousands, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s1344">But it was not comparing to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1345">No.</span> <span id="s1346">None of them could you compare to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1347">Mm-mm.</span> <span id="s1348">The men’s camps some of them you could compare, like Dachau or another one, say you could compare to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1349">But Auschwitz was the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: You mentioned a little earlier and I didn’t fully understand... you were talking about how you were trying to conceal your Jewish identity, you and the other girls.</span> <span id="s1351">So when you arrived in Switau, people, the camp authorities didn’t know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Is that right, they didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: No, they did not know.</span> <span id="s1355">But the Poles, of course, they find out and they... they didn’t know what it means, the triangle.</span> <span id="s1356">Because the Jews had a triangle by the number.</span> <span id="s1357">And they knew it.</span> <span id="s1358">And because no matter discreet you could be, but they were always on top of you.</span> <span id="s1359">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1360">And they were very mean.</span> <span id="s1361">I mean, what did it hurt them that somebody else should remain alive?</span> <span id="s1362">But that’s in their upbringing, hate, hate, hate.</span> <span id="s1363">And that’s the way they have to live with them for the rest of their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Did that surprise you, the anti-Semitism that the Poles were showing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: The Poles, everybody knows that they are very anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s1366">They had no love for us and I had no love for them.</span> <span id="s1367">I had love for the ones that my mother used to do business with, but they changed too, during the war.</span> <span id="s1368">They did.</span> <span id="s1369">When I asked for something else like this, “We don’t have it, we don’t have it.”</span> <span id="s1370">They did not go out of their way to help.</span> <span id="s1371">But yes, a lot of them, I heard from stories, my friend for instance, that the people used to leave the children, like infants a few months old.</span> <span id="s1372">And they wanted to place them in a home in… by Poles, when they knew, they gave the money for keeping.</span> <span id="s1373">And the children never returned back to the… I mean the parents didn’t survive, but the kids never returned back to their home, they remained Catholics, the way they raised them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Did you have any sense of faith during the war years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: A sense of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: I would say that I had.</span> <span id="s1378">I always believed that somebody above carries on with you.</span> <span id="s1379">Whatever happens in your life, somebody’s there to, to help you.</span> <span id="s1380">Yeah, faith means a big thing to me, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: And that wasn’t destroyed by what you saw at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: I wouldn’t say that I became more pious, you know, more, but I would say I’m on the same level like I was.</span> <span id="s1383">A lot of people made fun out of me, too.</span> <span id="s1384">Some of them turned out to have no religion at all.</span> <span id="s1385">I always believed.</span> <span id="s1386">I always kept a kosher home, when I was there.</span> <span id="s1387">After the war, up till today, I wouldn’t mix certain foods, like we are not allowed to have cheese and meat.</span> <span id="s1388">I would… I wouldn’t touch that.</span> <span id="s1389">It goes against me.</span> <span id="s1390">I was raised that way.</span> <span id="s1391">I was brought up that way.</span> <span id="s1392">And that’s the way I tried to keep it.</span> <span id="s1393">Now I have my different town.</span> <span id="s1394">It’s very hard to get certain foods.</span> <span id="s1395">So I used to have separate dishes all my life.</span> <span id="s1396">I used to conduct myself very, very nice, didn’t mix up anything.</span> <span id="s1397">Now, I don’t do that.</span> <span id="s1398">To be honest, I don’t do that.</span> <span id="s1399">But I will not, still not eat the meat and the dairy together.</span> <span id="s1400">Goes against me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: You said that people made fun of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: They made fun of you for having faith or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: For having faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: In the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: No.</span> <span id="s1407">No, out of camps.</span> <span id="s1408">When we were… after the war I’m talking.</span> <span id="s1409">In the camp, no, no.</span> <span id="s1410">After the war.</span> <span id="s1411">And those were all, we were all among our own, but some of them, like I said before, lost their faith completely and some of them didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: What would they make fun of you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Not fun exactly, it’s fun… because… “Oh, stop being stupid,” or things like that.</span> <span id="s1414">“It doesn’t mean a thing.”</span> <span id="s1415">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s1416">They had no religion in them at all.</span> <span id="s1417">I couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1418">I like to go to the Temple when a holiday came along or anything that came up.</span> <span id="s1419">I felt that’s my place.</span> <span id="s1420">Even my husband was not a believer and he came out from a very pious family.</span> <span id="s1421">But he saw what’s happening, he lost it completely.</span> <span id="s1422">But I was different, I was holding onto this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: So when you, it was discovered that you were Jews, you and the other girls who were in Switau.</span> <span id="s1424">The Poles told the authorities of the camp that you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: We were hiding that we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1426">And we were hiding and not telling the truth, that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s1427">A day or two later they took us out from the Zahl Appell, there where you stood there to be counted.</span> <span id="s1428">And they called out all the numbers.</span> <span id="s1429">I don’t know how they knew the numbers.</span> <span id="s1430">They must have pointed it out, days.</span> <span id="s1431">And they called us all out.</span> <span id="s1432">And we had made up, we figured something, because once they found us and they started to ask us questions.</span> <span id="s1433">So, we knew right away that they were going to… they not going to keep our secret.</span> <span id="s1434">And they were in Auschwitz the same like we were.</span> <span id="s1435">But those were mostly people that had, either they were, what do you call that, politics or… because they wouldn’t take them Poles just to Auschwitz, or they were prostitutes or whatever, something like that, that’s why they were, stayed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1436">But they had to give out, they had to squeal.</span> <span id="s1437">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1438">They called us all out.</span> <span id="s1439">We were nine people and they started to ask questions.</span> <span id="s1440">I said, you know, “My father was Jewish, my mother was Irish,” whatever.</span> <span id="s1441">And the other one said her mother was Jewish, her father was not.</span> <span id="s1442">Each one, we made up among ourselves that’s what we were going to say.</span> <span id="s1443">And that’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s1444">And they spared us the life.</span> <span id="s1445">They really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: They believed you and they…</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: They believed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Did you, did they do anything…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: That we were mixed, mixed.</span> <span id="s1450">They used to call us mischling, something like that, to that effect.</span> <span id="s1451">Mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s1452">And it was practical because a lot of people did get married, you know, like this.</span> <span id="s1453">But they didn’t touch us.</span> <span id="s1454">They didn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s1455">Of course, we didn’t know, we were shivering.</span> <span id="s1456">But that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s1457">And the minute they spotted us, they started to ask us questions.</span> <span id="s1458">How, how, how come we had the triangle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: Did anything happen to you after that?</span> <span id="s1460">Did they do anything to….</span> <span id="s1461">Was there any more harassment from the Poles in the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: We stayed away from them.</span> <span id="s1463">We tried to stay away from them as far as possible.</span> <span id="s1464">We shouldn’t meet.</span> <span id="s1465">But of course, sometimes you couldn’t help it.</span> <span id="s1466">You had to walk through the same path like they did, but we knew exactly not to say anything, not to talk, you know.</span> <span id="s1467">Be proud and go on and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1468">And that’s right.</span> <span id="s1469">No, they were very mean people, a mean machine.</span> <span id="s1470">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1471">They had no conscience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Do you remember how you found out that they had squealed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: We didn’t find out that they squealed, but we understood.</span> <span id="s1474">Because that’s the only ones that met us.</span> <span id="s1475">Nobody else knew us.</span> <span id="s1476">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1477">We knew right away.</span> <span id="s1478">The minute they started to ask questions about the triangle, we knew that we are finished.</span> <span id="s1479">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1480">Because nobody else would know that Jewish people have a triangle.</span> <span id="s1481">They had numbers just like we did, but of course they didn’t have….</span> <span id="s1482">So they compared right away and they knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1483">Because nobody else would think up a thing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: What were the questions that… you said that during the Zahl Appell they were asking you questions and you responded with talking about how you had…</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Mixed marriages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s1487">What kinds of questions were they asking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s1489">And I said, “Of course, it’s a mixed marriage.</span> <span id="s1490">My mother was gentile and my father was Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1491">And they bought it.</span> <span id="s1492">And all of us said the same thing.</span> <span id="s1493">So, that’s the only way we could get out of it.</span> <span id="s1494">Because of course, Jews they didn’t keep.</span> <span id="s1495">They, they, I don’t know what they did with them.</span> <span id="s1496">Did they kill them back in the… I really can’t say, but that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s1497">And that’s what came to our mind to say, that all mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s1498">And for that they had a little bit more respect, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Do you remember the day of liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1501">I remember like now.</span> <span id="s1502">Everything that happened in my life, I’m always in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1503">Any excitement.</span> <span id="s1504">I’m always ___________.</span> <span id="s1505">And all of a sudden you hear screaming.</span> <span id="s1506">It was a lot of hills, in Switau, I mean in the Czechs, a lot of hills.</span> <span id="s1507">So everybody started to scream, “The Americans are here!</span> <span id="s1508">The Americans are here!”</span> <span id="s1509">What you heard them coming with motorcycles up the hill, you know, up and down, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1510">And they were wearing masks, like to see through, the dust shouldn’t go into their eyes, I guess, and mouth.</span> <span id="s1511">I mean, that’s the way I assumed.</span> <span id="s1512">And they all came to a certain spot.</span> <span id="s1513">Like in the middle of the… and they, and they stopped.</span> <span id="s1514">And they announced that the Americans… that they are the Americans and they came to liberate us.</span> <span id="s1515">And we shouldn’t be afraid.</span> <span id="s1516">And of course, they had the business of picking up the Germans, too, that watched us.</span> <span id="s1517">And I ran out from the bathroom with my pants down and I came to the spot and I pulled it up.</span> <span id="s1518">And it was like a miracle, like, like you see it in the movies.</span> <span id="s1519">You couldn’t, you couldn’t see it otherwise, and unbelievable too, that we are free.</span> <span id="s1520">And they said to us, “We came to liberate you.</span> <span id="s1521">Be very, very careful not…” —this was on the second or on the third day, I remember— “not to pick up any food and conserves.”</span> <span id="s1522">They had a lot of things, the German, in jars.</span> <span id="s1523">And we shouldn’t eat no meat, because our stomachs are not used to it, because a lot of people fell and they died from it.</span> <span id="s1524">And we should be very careful, if possible, we should mostly eat rice and drink water.</span> <span id="s1525">And they were just like, like sisters and brothers we found.</span> <span id="s1526">And among of them was a chaplain and he said to us, not to us, to everybody, to the whole camp, whoever is Jewish should come forward.</span> <span id="s1527">And we were still hesitating, because we didn’t trust anybody already.</span> <span id="s1528">And a few minutes later we stepped out, all of us.</span> <span id="s1529">He said not to be afraid, they’ll try to help us in every way.</span> <span id="s1530">And this was a few days later, about two, three days later, maybe.</span> <span id="s1531">And that we shouldn’t go back to Poland like I said before, because the Russians are there already.</span> <span id="s1532">Everything was already arranged.</span> <span id="s1533">And that they’ll help us and everybody from among the nine of us had family in the United States, so we should come to, go to Paris and from there the organizations will take over.</span> <span id="s1534">And they’ll find the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: What language was he speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: This was a chaplain from the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Did you speak English at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Hello and good-bye.</span> <span id="s1541">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1542">No, I did not.</span> <span id="s1543">I spoke Polish, Hebrew and Yiddish and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1544">I didn’t speak English at that time.</span> <span id="s1545">And they brought us to Paris and like I said before the organizations took over and Rothschild gave us a hotel and that’s where we stayed until we left Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: So how long did you stay in Switau after the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: In Switau maybe three or four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: What was your physical condition like at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1550">The impact in you was driving you, you know, you were healthy, but underneath you were not healthy, because when I came to Paris—this was months later—I used to go and I used to fall, had no strength in my legs.</span> <span id="s1551">But at that point, I was strong like a bull, I didn’t, you know, that drive, that drives you to do, to survive, and to go on.</span> <span id="s1552">And after a while when you find out that’s when it all starts.</span> <span id="s1553">You find out that you have nobody and you get disappointed and it’s harder to take.</span> <span id="s1554">But with a little help from your friends… that’s what it did.</span> <span id="s1555">Like my friend, the one that’s in England, I got very depressed after while when I knew that this one is leaving and that one is leaving and I’m staying, I’m going to remain alone in Paris.</span> <span id="s1556">And I didn’t want to go out.</span> <span id="s1557">I didn’t want to see anybody and… and I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1558">That everything was finished, and there’s nothing more to go… End of Tape 2, Side B Tape 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Continuation of an interview with Justin Lerner.</span> <span id="s1560">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1561">You were talking about being in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1563">And I started to get very depressed and didn’t want to go on.</span> <span id="s1564">There was no use in life already.</span> <span id="s1565">And then my friend, that she’s now in England, said to me, “You know, I’m sure that the mother’s wish was somebody should survive.</span> <span id="s1566">And you are the one that survived and if you don’t want to go on, open up the window and throw yourself out and get it over with.</span> <span id="s1567">But don’t make everybody miserable and yourself.”</span> <span id="s1568">And this few words put so much sense into my mind.</span> <span id="s1569">I took a turn around and I said, “She’s right, I’ve got to go on.</span> <span id="s1570">I’ve got to do it for them.”</span> <span id="s1571">And that’s the way I live all my life.</span> <span id="s1572">That they would want me to be that way.</span> <span id="s1573">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: Did you feel a lot of anger after the war ended, at the Germans?</span> <span id="s1575">Or at the world?</span> <span id="s1576">Or at anybody?</span> <span id="s1577">What did….</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: Anger was not the word for it.</span> <span id="s1579">Disgraced.</span> <span id="s1580">Anger, I knew I can do nothing, but how could people live like that?</span> <span id="s1581">To do that, one to another?</span> <span id="s1582">This was hard to understand.</span> <span id="s1583">And to kill everybody, not to have anybody.</span> <span id="s1584">To be alone in the whole world.</span> <span id="s1585">That’s what bugged.</span> <span id="s1586">But we all of us had the same thing, the same actually lookout on life.</span> <span id="s1587">You got to build, you got to start from scratch and be productive and do what your parents wanted you to do.</span> <span id="s1588">And that’s exactly how I went on all my life like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Do you… go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: The, the will to live and to carry on and to bring a new people into this world, that’s what we tried to.</span> <span id="s1591">And to help one another.</span> <span id="s1592">And we very seldom spoke about anything like that.</span> <span id="s1593">Took us years.</span> <span id="s1594">When they erected the monument in, in Washington, so we went to Washington.</span> <span id="s1595">And we went like eight or nine friends.</span> <span id="s1596">And I remember being at the cemetery, Arlington Cemetery in Washington.</span> <span id="s1597">And… and we had a lot of soldiers down there, came to, interviewed us.</span> <span id="s1598">They had the American flag going around and they had people from the media.</span> <span id="s1599">And in the back of me, they had, they were taking pictures and they were talking, speeches.</span> <span id="s1600">And there was a big, heavy cable.</span> <span id="s1601">And all of a sudden a young gentleman touches me and he says to me, be careful.</span> <span id="s1602">I shouldn’t go back, because the cable, I’ll fall.</span> <span id="s1603">And the answer was I cannot fall anymore.</span> <span id="s1604">I was fallen enough.</span> <span id="s1605">And somehow, that youngster, I will never forget him, did not disappear from us.</span> <span id="s1606">And he started to make conversations.</span> <span id="s1607">And he ask us, where do we go from here?</span> <span id="s1608">From the cemetery?</span> <span id="s1609">And I told him, we are going to the Capital that time.</span> <span id="s1610">And he says, “Could I come along with you?”</span> <span id="s1611">I says, “What are you, you know, hanging around us?</span> <span id="s1612">Somebody send you?”</span> <span id="s1613">And it turned out that… I said, “Do you go to school?</span> <span id="s1614">Do you go to college?</span> <span id="s1615">Do you have to write thesis?”</span> <span id="s1616">I… we couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1617">He took us by train home, because he had a… he had a small car, so we couldn’t go in, all of us, into the car.</span> <span id="s1618">So left the car where it was parked on the cemetery, not far from there and he took us by train to go to the Washington, to the, where the monument is going to be erected.</span> <span id="s1619">Because he asked us, where do we have to go?</span> <span id="s1620">And for the first time we went on a train.</span> <span id="s1621">A beautiful train in Washington.</span> <span id="s1622">And then we went to the Capitol.</span> <span id="s1623">We had lunch there and we paid for his lunch.</span> <span id="s1624">And he wanted to spend with us a whole, a whole evening, but we were going from there on.</span> <span id="s1625">But he found us so interesting.</span> <span id="s1626">And he was in law school and wanted, like you, and he wanted to know more and more about it.</span> <span id="s1627">But he was a very nice gentleman.</span> <span id="s1628">He had company that night coming, so he couldn’t stay with us in the evening, because we had everything set up for us.</span> <span id="s1629">You know we were there for three days.</span> <span id="s1630">But it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1631">And… and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1632">And that… because he wanted to know more and more and more.</span> <span id="s1633">How do we feel out of life?</span> <span id="s1634">How do… our outlook on life.</span> <span id="s1635">I said, “It’s time to cry and it’s time to love, and that’s the way it goes.</span> <span id="s1636">Time for life and time to… and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1637">That’s our motto.</span> <span id="s1638">You got to go on till the end, there’s no alternative.</span> <span id="s1639">You can’t go backwards.</span> <span id="s1640">You got to go forward.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: You mentioned earlier, that you were staying in a hotel in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: Yes, Paris, Rothschild gave us the hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Do you remember the name of the hotel, by any chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: It was on Rue Giparteau (ph).</span> <span id="s1645">That was the address.</span> <span id="s1646">And this was Rothschild gave this to us, without charge, no money, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1647">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Were you still with all of your friends, the girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: All of my friends, yes.</span> <span id="s1650">We were there, yes, but like I said, I remained the last one.</span> <span id="s1651">They all left before me.</span> <span id="s1652">And it was… it was nice, I mean, it was livable.</span> <span id="s1653">We had… everybody had the same.</span> <span id="s1654">You had two beds in every room and a bathroom, which was very nice.</span> <span id="s1655">And of course, no charge, because we had no money to pay them.</span> <span id="s1656">And we got the meals downstairs and… and those were your headquarters.</span> <span id="s1657">If you had to go to… and a lot of times people came, helping you, asking you questions.</span> <span id="s1658">“Where are you from?</span> <span id="s1659">What was your family name?”</span> <span id="s1660">Reporters.</span> <span id="s1661">“How many in your family?”</span> <span id="s1662">You know.</span> <span id="s1663">All kinds of questions till you get tired of answering, too.</span> <span id="s1664">And nothing came out of it.</span> <span id="s1665">And then towards the end, I didn’t want to talk about it, because it brings too much hurt in you.</span> <span id="s1666">And one night, I make… I was sitting in my room and I think it was with Halina, yeah, or maybe she went down, I was alone.</span> <span id="s1667">And all of a sudden I heard screaming on the corridor.</span> <span id="s1668">And I said, “Oh my God, the Germans came back?”</span> <span id="s1669">You didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1670">You were like a lamb.</span> <span id="s1671">I said, “What’s going on?”</span> <span id="s1672">Finally I opened up the door.</span> <span id="s1673">I wanted to see what was going on.</span> <span id="s1674">And there was my husband, at that time I didn’t know him yet, and kissing my two friends, the two sisters.</span> <span id="s1675">And they were crying and screaming and they introduced me to him.</span> <span id="s1676">“This is,” how did they call it?</span> <span id="s1677">“A landsman,” this means from the same town.</span> <span id="s1678">And they met him.</span> <span id="s1679">He came looking for people that survived.</span> <span id="s1680">He heard that there was people there and he was still in the Army and that’s when he came over.</span> <span id="s1681">So, they introduced me to him and I went into the house, to my room and I said “Good night, nice knowing you,” and I left.</span> <span id="s1682">And he used to come to them every single day.</span> <span id="s1683">He used to bring them soap, a piece of chocolate and sardines.</span> <span id="s1684">And if they had too much, they gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1685">They shared with me a little bit, which was very nice of them.</span> <span id="s1686">And that’s when I found out more about it.</span> <span id="s1687">And a short time later, they left.</span> <span id="s1688">They went to South America, to Paraguay, which they had family there.</span> <span id="s1689">And at this point everything was ready and they left.</span> <span id="s1690">And my husband came around a few times, but I didn’t pay no attention to him.</span> <span id="s1691">And then he was discharged from the Army and he went back to the States.</span> <span id="s1692">And he came in twice more.</span> <span id="s1693">And the girls had made up with me, the two sisters, they knew I had nobody.</span> <span id="s1694">At that point I didn’t find my uncle yet… that if I want to come to South America where they are, they have a brother, that is, that is, his wife was left in Poland.</span> <span id="s1695">He left before the war, and the wife didn’t get a chance to go out.</span> <span id="s1696">And that they would want me very much in the family.</span> <span id="s1697">And that’s when all the trouble started.</span> <span id="s1698">And I said, that’s nice, that was very nice of them.</span> <span id="s1699">But of course, they meant more for themselves than for me.</span> <span id="s1700">And then my husband, I told him the story about what happened and after a while he came out and he told me the truth.</span> <span id="s1701">They had mentioned to me that he was married before the war and they had one child.</span> <span id="s1702">And my husband knew that he had two children.</span> <span id="s1703">And he must have been old like my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: I’m sorry, who was married before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: The two friends, the two sisters that left for South America, to Paraguay.</span> <span id="s1706">This was their brother and they wanted me for a sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s1707">And they think I didn’t have anybody and they knew me from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1708">So, they wanted me, I should come out to them.</span> <span id="s1709">And they have a brother that the wife didn’t… did not survive.</span> <span id="s1710">And they wanted me, I should…</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: They thought they could make a match.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: …a match.</span> <span id="s1713">So, I didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s1714">So, I said, “Let him write to me and we’ll see later what’s going to be.”</span> <span id="s1715">But I never got a letter from them.</span> <span id="s1716">I only got telegrams.</span> <span id="s1717">I should come out there.</span> <span id="s1718">And they send, they bought me the passage to go and everything and like a dummy, I didn’t know from nothing.</span> <span id="s1719">I’m going to Paraguay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: What were the names of your friends in Paraguay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Sure, Sonja and what was the other one?</span> <span id="s1722">Sonja Braun (ph), Braun is her name.</span> <span id="s1723">And what was the other one?</span> <span id="s1724">I can’t remember her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: Maybe it’s going to come back to me like before, but right now I can’t think of her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: And that they want me there very, very much.</span> <span id="s1729">And like I said, “Tell him to write to me and we’ll see what’s going to be.</span> <span id="s1730">Or send a picture on top of it.”</span> <span id="s1731">But this never materialized.</span> <span id="s1732">I only got like right away telegrams and telegrams and that they’re making out the papers.</span> <span id="s1733">And they’re going to send me… I have to go and get a visa.</span> <span id="s1734">And they’re going to pay for the fare and everything.</span> <span id="s1735">They knew I had no money.</span> <span id="s1736">And then when my husband came back and he asked me, did I find my uncle.</span> <span id="s1737">And I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1738">“So, what are you going to do?”</span> <span id="s1739">I said, “I’m going to Paraguay, that Sonja and,” oh I can’t think of her name, the other one, “wants me there.</span> <span id="s1740">And they want me, they have a brother for me.”</span> <span id="s1741">And he knew the whole family, what was going on.</span> <span id="s1742">Then it came out a few months later, didn’t tell me right away, the truth.</span> <span id="s1743">That he was married, I said, I knew, but he had two children.</span> <span id="s1744">They only said he had one.</span> <span id="s1745">And the age they didn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s1746">And he was almost the age like my father.</span> <span id="s1747">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1748">And then, so my husband said to me, “Give me the, all the particulars that you knew about your uncle.</span> <span id="s1749">Give it to me.”</span> <span id="s1750">I said, “I’m sick and tired.</span> <span id="s1751">I don’t want it, anything else.”</span> <span id="s1752">The only thing is I could think is he’s very rich, the same speech, or he’s passed away.</span> <span id="s1753">I remembered the children, their names, I remembered his name.</span> <span id="s1754">I remembered his wife’s name.</span> <span id="s1755">But I did not remember the address where he lived.</span> <span id="s1756">This my mother told us just before the war broke, before we were, we were separated, that we should all remember.</span> <span id="s1757">And that’s what happened, the address I forgot where he lived.</span> <span id="s1758">And that’s what it was so hard for him to find me, for me to find him, rather.</span> <span id="s1759">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1760">And the papers that he read, there was a lot of Jewish papers them years.</span> <span id="s1761">So, instead of The Day they called it, you read Good Morning.</span> <span id="s1762">So, I put it in this paper and he read the other paper.</span> <span id="s1763">So, so I gave my husband all the particulars, he went back to the States.</span> <span id="s1764">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s1765">And two days later or three days later, I get a letter, my uncle.</span> <span id="s1766">And he sent me twenty dollars, he put it into the envelope.</span> <span id="s1767">But he just found out from the soldier, Mr. Lerner, that I’m alive and he’s going send out papers for me that I should come to the States here.</span> <span id="s1768">And being nobody survived with me, my cousin, that was his sister, too.</span> <span id="s1769">It was one brother and two sisters, so I was from one sister and my cousin was from the other sister.</span> <span id="s1770">And he wants very, very much I should come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1771">And that’s the way it started.</span> <span id="s1772">So, in the interim I, I sent him a letter.</span> <span id="s1773">That I was mad, because I took it very wrong that he doesn’t want to acknowledge himself.</span> <span id="s1774">This was my pride, but it was not so.</span> <span id="s1775">He was very, you know, devoted and healthy, happy that I’m alive, that somebody’s alive from the family.</span> <span id="s1776">And interested, very, I should come and he’ll try to help in every way.</span> <span id="s1777">And that he’s sending out papers.</span> <span id="s1778">But then from there instead of sending me letters, they sent me telegrams.</span> <span id="s1779">And they bought me already the, the, everything, they paid the fare in for me to go by plane to South America.</span> <span id="s1780">And I started to put… and then he came again, my husband.</span> <span id="s1781">I was over a year in Paris.</span> <span id="s1782">And by that time, he came again, once more.</span> <span id="s1783">He joined the Merchant Marines and he went back and forth.</span> <span id="s1784">And he told me… and I told him what’s on my mind.</span> <span id="s1785">And when he told me that… yeah, a picture came from them.</span> <span id="s1786">And he was in the back.</span> <span id="s1787">Because I wrote them, “I never got a picture, I never got a letter, I don’t understand what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1788">You don’t keep your promise.</span> <span id="s1789">I’m not going to keep my promise.”</span> <span id="s1790">You know, that’s the way I was talking to my… writing to my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: Your friends in Paraguay, you’re talking about now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Right, right, them two, yes.</span> <span id="s1793">And then I got a picture from them all.</span> <span id="s1794">The ones that I knew.</span> <span id="s1795">When my husband came, I showed him the picture and he said that’s not him.</span> <span id="s1796">He was very short.</span> <span id="s1797">But they put a stool in the back, that’s why he was in the back.</span> <span id="s1798">So, that’s when I put two and two together.</span> <span id="s1799">And I went back… yeah and between… I had to go through Spain to go to them, through Spain, I had to stop in Spain.</span> <span id="s1800">So, I had to have a visa from Spain.</span> <span id="s1801">In the interim, Spain and Paris, and France didn’t… had some kind of delay or whatever.</span> <span id="s1802">They had some kind of argument.</span> <span id="s1803">This was right after the war and they wouldn’t allow anybody.</span> <span id="s1804">So, I had to be stuck again in Paris.</span> <span id="s1805">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1806">I went back to ORT, ORT is a Jewish organization that they knew the whole story.</span> <span id="s1807">And I went back to them and I told them, “I’m not going.”</span> <span id="s1808">And the girl said to me, “What are you crazy or something?</span> <span id="s1809">You couldn’t wait to get out of Paris already to go and now all of a sudden you change your mind.”</span> <span id="s1810">And I told her the whole story, what was going on.</span> <span id="s1811">And she said, “I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1812">I cannot help you.</span> <span id="s1813">You’ll have to go from Paraguay, if you don’t like it there, you’ll have to go whatever you want from there.</span> <span id="s1814">But in the interim you must go.”</span> <span id="s1815">I said, “There is no such thing with must.”</span> <span id="s1816">I went… I said, “I want to see somebody higher than you, different authority.</span> <span id="s1817">And there came a gentleman and I told him the story.</span> <span id="s1818">And he says, “Don’t go.”</span> <span id="s1819">And that’s when I… I had a friend in Paris that went with me with all these things.</span> <span id="s1820">Halina’s friend, she came from the same town.</span> <span id="s1821">And she was very nice to us.</span> <span id="s1822">She used to call us in for dinner and whatever we had to go, she went along with us.</span> <span id="s1823">She was very, very helping.</span> <span id="s1824">And then I decided I’m not going to go.</span> <span id="s1825">And I waited in Paris and my husband wanted to marry me.</span> <span id="s1826">And I said, to myself, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1827">It was over a year.</span> <span id="s1828">I couldn’t find anybody.</span> <span id="s1829">And we decided to get married.</span> <span id="s1830">But in order for me and him, go together to the United States, we had to get married in Paris.</span> <span id="s1831">So we had a beautiful wedding in Paris, invited all my friends.</span> <span id="s1832">And after a while we came over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Had you had any feelings for your husband before that point?</span> <span id="s1834">Did you …?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: Oh sure, it took me over a year.</span> <span id="s1836">I didn’t want to… he was coming back and forth, but I didn’t understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s1837">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s1838">He had feelings, and I had feelings, but I wasn’t ready yet, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s1839">Because I was still searching and looking and once I promised, I didn’t want to break my promise on top of it.</span> <span id="s1840">Once I heard what he told me, I believed him and that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1841">They were very nice and very good, but they wanted good for their brother, too, so they wanted me.</span> <span id="s1842">Because they knew I wouldn’t have to go any place else.</span> <span id="s1843">I wouldn’t be able to get out.</span> <span id="s1844">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1845">But I’m happy.</span> <span id="s1846">Got married already after a while and had a child, which I was very happy for the whole story.</span> <span id="s1847">But we got to see them after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1850">We went to South America.</span> <span id="s1851">My husband had a sister in Argentina.</span> <span id="s1852">And from there we went to, to see them.</span> <span id="s1853">I didn’t want to go, but my husband insisted and we went.</span> <span id="s1854">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1855">And after that they came quite a few times to New York, so they came to see me, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: Did you talk to your husband about what had happened to you during the war?</span> <span id="s1857">Did you tell him stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: Oh sure, all along, sure.</span> <span id="s1859">He knew everything, because he only hung out with people that lived through the war, because we were always together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: You mentioned, did he, was he born in the United States or was he born in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: No, he was thirteen years old, that he came to, his father was, left before, five years prior to that.</span> <span id="s1862">And then he came with the rest of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: Where was his family from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: The same place where my girlfriends, my two friends.</span> <span id="s1865">Where was he born?</span> <span id="s1866">Not too far from Białystok.</span> <span id="s1867">Oh God, your mind escapes you.</span> <span id="s1868">Łomża.</span> <span id="s1869">Łomża.</span> <span id="s1870">That’s not too far from Białystok.</span> <span id="s1871">That’s where he was raised and born, down there.</span> <span id="s1872">His mother was still in Europe.</span> <span id="s1873">His father was in the United States.</span> <span id="s1874">So he went to visit her in 1939, just before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1875">And that’s when he met all these people again, because they were from the same town and they were very close.</span> <span id="s1876">So, when the war ended, that’s when he met them in Paris.</span> <span id="s1877">He came searching.</span> <span id="s1878">That’s exactly where he met them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: Was your husband the first man that you had ever dated, or had ever been involved with romantically?</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: I would say we went out in Poland, actually, before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1881">Like I said, I belonged to the Jabotinski, to the… but yes, to be exactly, yes.</span> <span id="s1882">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: Was that difficult for you to be, becoming involved with someone after having gone through what you had just been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: Well, I was not, not like today the girls, they go and they sleep with their men.</span> <span id="s1885">We didn’t do these things.</span> <span id="s1886">I would never do that.</span> <span id="s1887">Had to wait to get married in order to be near each other.</span> <span id="s1888">I stayed at Rue Giparteau (ph) and he was in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1889">But it was, you have to trust somebody in order to, to be honest with somebody, I mean.</span> <span id="s1890">You look nice and you look good and had all kinds of promises, and that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">Q: You had lost so much of your childhood and of your teenage years, that young women are normally, you know…</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: Wild, and… yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: …just learning about each other and having fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: No, we didn’t have that, definitely not.</span> <span id="s1895">We did not have that.</span> <span id="s1896">We had no, a broken childhood, actually.</span> <span id="s1897">That’s what it was.</span> <span id="s1898">Yes, and that’s why when I see a kid of twelve, thirteen years old, including my grand-daughter doing the hair, streaking.</span> <span id="s1899">I say, “Is that necessary?”</span> <span id="s1900">I can’t see it for dust.</span> <span id="s1901">I cannot see it.</span> <span id="s1902">Because we were… I didn’t put on lipstick until my wedding day.</span> <span id="s1903">Did not.</span> <span id="s1904">Now I cover all up all the things.</span> <span id="s1905">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1906">But them years?</span> <span id="s1907">No.</span> <span id="s1908">Never smoked, never did anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Had you had a fantasy of getting married?</span> <span id="s1910">Had you ever thought about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: Yeah, a fantasy, of course.</span> <span id="s1912">But you didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1913">It’s not like over here, you talk to your friends.</span> <span id="s1914">“This happened, that’… no, we didn’t… I was not of that age, you know, to talk about things like that.</span> <span id="s1915">Because like I said, I had younger, older sisters than me.</span> <span id="s1916">But no, I didn’t have such fantasies, no, like the kids today, no.</span> <span id="s1917">My fantasy was just to bring in food in the house and we should have what to eat, and… and we should all be together.</span> <span id="s1918">This was my childhood.</span> <span id="s1919">It’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: What about your hopes and dreams for yourself after the war and you got over your depression and you made the decision that you were going to go on living your life?</span> <span id="s1921">Did you want to continue your education?</span> <span id="s1922">Or did you want to have children?</span> <span id="s1923">What was the thing that was in your…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: The education, at that point, I did not go, because you started to build a life for yourself.</span> <span id="s1925">And of course, I wanted to go have a child.</span> <span id="s1926">And we were just starting out, so it was not actually for me to go to school.</span> <span id="s1927">That’s the way I looked at it.</span> <span id="s1928">I just wanted to help my husband and build a home.</span> <span id="s1929">And I used to go to school at night, night school they had them years.</span> <span id="s1930">And I was helping my husband.</span> <span id="s1931">We were working like hand to hand, and to become somebody, to make something out of yourself.</span> <span id="s1932">And then we wanted to have a baby, so it took me almost seven years until I had my son.</span> <span id="s1933">And this was a big thing, because all my friends had children already.</span> <span id="s1934">So, it’s another thing.</span> <span id="s1935">But thank God, he was born and I was very proud of him.</span> <span id="s1936">And he was the whole life to me and to my husband, both of us.</span> <span id="s1937">And we only saw that he should have a better life than we did.</span> <span id="s1938">And he should go to college and he should be somebody.</span> <span id="s1939">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1940">That was my main thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: Before we go on to that, when you were in Paris and you had the opportunity to come to the U.S., had you had any thoughts before that or any dreams of going to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: No.</span> <span id="s1943">I… my cousin went to Palestine, because she was younger than me, ten years.</span> <span id="s1944">And she went with a child’s transport from Paris.</span> <span id="s1945">And I wanted to go with her very, very much, because once I found her, I didn’t want to let go.</span> <span id="s1946">And especially I was older.</span> <span id="s1947">And, but I couldn’t go, because this was just a child’s transport.</span> <span id="s1948">So, I said to myself, I could always go to Israel later on.</span> <span id="s1949">So, I remained in Paris and she went on to Israel.</span> <span id="s1950">But at the end, I brought her here.</span> <span id="s1951">She finished her schooling.</span> <span id="s1952">She was in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1953">And she finished her schooling, she became a nurse, and then I took her here.</span> <span id="s1954">But she was sick.</span> <span id="s1955">I didn’t even know.</span> <span id="s1956">It was not an easy life, not easy, because she saw her mother gassing.</span> <span id="s1957">They put her in the twenty-fifth block they called it, when they got her.</span> <span id="s1958">And she noticed the smoke coming out right away.</span> <span id="s1959">They gassed her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: In Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: In Auschwitz, and she couldn’t cope with it.</span> <span id="s1962">I didn’t know at that point.</span> <span id="s1963">At that point we were all the same.</span> <span id="s1964">But when she went to Israel, and that’s when it all came out.</span> <span id="s1965">She was lonely, and I brought her to me.</span> <span id="s1966">And she stayed with me a while, but she, she did not listen.</span> <span id="s1967">I thought she was mean, but she was sick already.</span> <span id="s1968">What did I know about mental health?</span> <span id="s1969">I didn’t know about all these things.</span> <span id="s1970">And then I married her off, but she did not stay with me anymore.</span> <span id="s1971">She, she moved out.</span> <span id="s1972">She went to my uncle… End of Tape 3, Side A Tape 3, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: Tape three, side B of an interview with Justine Lerner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: And she went to my aunt, to my uncle’s house, to stay with them for a while.</span> <span id="s1975">But of course I had said to my aunt, “Call me one night.”</span> <span id="s1976">And she came, when I brought her, I was pregnant with my son.</span> <span id="s1977">And like I said before, it took me seven years almost.</span> <span id="s1978">And she… when he was born… I was maybe in my ninth month already when she got over here, and if I said to her, “I want to spend more time with the kids.”</span> <span id="s1979">She came… I got her a job to work in a hospital, but not as a nurse, as a nurse’s aide, because she didn’t have the diploma.</span> <span id="s1980">And they wouldn’t acknowledge it at that time from Israel, all the years, you had to go through a test, which she wasn’t ready for it.</span> <span id="s1981">And no matter what I said, she took it, everything she took wrong.</span> <span id="s1982">If I said day, she said night.</span> <span id="s1983">No matter what, how I tried, no matter what I did.</span> <span id="s1984">If I jumped off the roof, she would keep… but I didn’t know like, she was sick.</span> <span id="s1985">Couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1986">When I slept, she used to come into me in the bed.</span> <span id="s1987">She was scared.</span> <span id="s1988">She used to come in to sleep with us.</span> <span id="s1989">And I said to myself, what’s going on here?</span> <span id="s1990">So, I took her to a doctor, took her to a family doctor, of course.</span> <span id="s1991">Who knew about psychiatrists them years?</span> <span id="s1992">And he prescribed a pill and she took it and that’s it, but it was not enough.</span> <span id="s1993">She needed more than that.</span> <span id="s1994">So I got her a… a room on my block and said, “You could come to eat by me, but not, not sleeping.”</span> <span id="s1995">And that’s exactly how it was.</span> <span id="s1996">And then she, she was keeping company, already she met a nice fellow.</span> <span id="s1997">But she had a hard life, she did not know what….</span> <span id="s1998">She had one, what do they call that?</span> <span id="s1999">One attack after the other.</span> <span id="s2000">She wound up in a mental hospital.</span> <span id="s2001">And she couldn’t deal with life.</span> <span id="s2002">And that was a very big strain on me, punishing myself, what I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2003">I didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s2004">And I couldn’t be to her a mother and I couldn’t be to her the father.</span> <span id="s2005">I could only be like the way I am, warm and, and everything else.</span> <span id="s2006">Caring.</span> <span id="s2007">But she didn’t buy it.</span> <span id="s2008">She didn’t… she didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s2009">She didn’t have a happy life.</span> <span id="s2010">She had a wonderful husband, a good, educated man.</span> <span id="s2011">But she, herself, didn’t live the way it’s supposed to, and she left two children.</span> <span id="s2012">The boy I’m very… very, very nice, and the girl is just like the mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: This is the same cousin that you mentioned earlier, you were in Auschwitz with?</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2017">And that’s the way it went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: How did you get from Paris, how and when did you get from Paris to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: In ‘47, 1947.</span> <span id="s2020">We got married and then we came to, to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: Did you come by ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: No, we came by plane.</span> <span id="s2023">I came by ship.</span> <span id="s2024">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s2025">They, they were transporting the soldiers back home.</span> <span id="s2026">But being I was a G.I. bride, so I had the same privileges, but of course, you had to wait for a boat.</span> <span id="s2027">So one day my husband goes down to get a paper and he comes back and he shows me that the boat that we’re supposed to go—it was Marine Flasher (ph)—I remember it like now, got a… on fire in the, in the dock.</span> <span id="s2028">And I thought he was kidding me.</span> <span id="s2029">I thought he wasn’t telling me the truth.</span> <span id="s2030">So I looked at the picture.</span> <span id="s2031">I didn’t know how to read.</span> <span id="s2032">So I looked at the picture and that’s exactly how it was.</span> <span id="s2033">And then we had to wait three months for another ship, for another boat.</span> <span id="s2034">And on one side I remember was the men, and on the other side was the ladies, gated off, you know.</span> <span id="s2035">And I was not a good, I couldn’t take the ship.</span> <span id="s2036">I was very sick, dizzy and sea sick, couldn’t take the water.</span> <span id="s2037">And I was laying more than I, than I was walking around.</span> <span id="s2038">And he tried to bring me food.</span> <span id="s2039">And there was a matron watching us and she took a look at the tray.</span> <span id="s2040">He put down from everything, this was a joke.</span> <span id="s2041">Put down from everything and the matron took a look at it and she says, “If you bring her so much food, she’s not sick enough to get up and eat.”</span> <span id="s2042">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s2043">So… but instead of going, we were supposed to go like nine days or ten, we went fifteen days.</span> <span id="s2044">It was a broken up ship and was… got filled full of water.</span> <span id="s2045">We thought we going to drown.</span> <span id="s2046">And then they fixed it in Halifax and then we came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: Was it a U.S. military ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: It had to be.</span> <span id="s2049">I don’t think she was in use in the military or they retired her.</span> <span id="s2050">But that’s what they took and that’s what we came back.</span> <span id="s2051">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2052">It was not a luxury ship, that’s for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: What were your expectations of the United States or your ideas about it before you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Before I came, dreaming, just tall buildings, you know, to see, how different would it be?</span> <span id="s2055">How would people accept me?</span> <span id="s2056">My husband had a father, that we lived together.</span> <span id="s2057">And he was very, very nice to me.</span> <span id="s2058">I adored that man.</span> <span id="s2059">He was a very nice, pious man, very lovely and respectful, very respectful.</span> <span id="s2060">And it was just a pleasure to be with him.</span> <span id="s2061">We moved into him.</span> <span id="s2062">And he wanted to give us everything, whatever he had.</span> <span id="s2063">He wanted to give us his room.</span> <span id="s2064">There were two bedrooms.</span> <span id="s2065">I says, “Pa, how could I take your bedroom?</span> <span id="s2066">It’s yours.”</span> <span id="s2067">So, we slept the two of us, his bedroom was big and to the front, ours was like in a driveway.</span> <span id="s2068">But I was happy that somebody accepted us and I was very grateful.</span> <span id="s2069">And you go on with your, whatever you have to do.</span> <span id="s2070">I went down in the morning to get breakfast, it was local, on the same block, a grocery, today you don’t see it.</span> <span id="s2071">Today you have supermarkets, big ones.</span> <span id="s2072">That time everything was, and from the beginning when I went into the store everybody gave me their next.</span> <span id="s2073">And then I figured out why, because they wanted to see if I have horns.</span> <span id="s2074">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s2075">If I… how do I speak.</span> <span id="s2076">It was a pleasure.</span> <span id="s2077">I didn’t have to wait on lines, but it didn’t last long.</span> <span id="s2078">Because after a while they heard that I’m the same like they are, so they let me go to wait in line.</span> <span id="s2079">And I used to shop, and bring home the food, and make three meals a day, and it was just like my mother did, the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: Where did you live?</span> <span id="s2081">Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: On Newport Street, 448 Newport Street in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s2083">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2084">It was a nice area.</span> <span id="s2085">You were able to get a bus and a train.</span> <span id="s2086">You know what I’m saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: They didn’t have so many cars like they have now.</span> <span id="s2089">You must have a car, otherwise you can’t move.</span> <span id="s2090">No such thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: And when you said people wanted to see whether you had horns, were you talking about people who were…</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: American, they were born here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Non-Jews?</span> <span id="s2094">Or…</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">A: They were Jewish, too, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q: They just had stereotypes about Holocaust survivors?</span> <span id="s2097">Or ?</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: They didn’t have a stereo… I don’t know if they have stereotypes.</span> <span id="s2099">I wouldn’t say that.</span> <span id="s2100">But I made up that joke.</span> <span id="s2101">That’s the way it was going on.</span> <span id="s2102">That they wanted to see if I have horns, how do I talk, how do I move myself different than they are.</span> <span id="s2103">Curiosity I would say more than anything else.</span> <span id="s2104">But then when they found out that I’m just like them, they didn’t let me go ahead of them anymore.</span> <span id="s2105">I had to wait in line.</span> <span id="s2106">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: Did you feel that anyone, did anyone discriminate against you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: No, I can’t say that.</span> <span id="s2109">I didn’t find it.</span> <span id="s2110">I never had that feeling, no, no.</span> <span id="s2111">My friends had that feeling, a lot of them, but I never had that feeling.</span> <span id="s2112">I never felt any different than they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: Your friends had the feeling that they were discriminated against because they were survivors or because they were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: Oh, they were Jewish, because they were survivors.</span> <span id="s2115">They mixed with different kind of people.</span> <span id="s2116">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s2117">A lot of them felt that way.</span> <span id="s2118">I never did that.</span> <span id="s2119">I never felt that way.</span> <span id="s2120">I felt I’m the same like them, not any better, not any worse.</span> <span id="s2121">I’m the same platform that they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: When did you start to learn English?</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: A short time, right away, right away I would say, when I came to the States.</span> <span id="s2124">They had at night, the night school.</span> <span id="s2125">Thomas Jefferson was the school, I remember.</span> <span id="s2126">And I said if I want to live here, I have to learn.</span> <span id="s2127">Have to learn to read and write and that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s2128">I went at night.</span> <span id="s2129">And one day I came home and I see the light is on, because my father-in-law’s windows were to the front.</span> <span id="s2130">And as I was walking home, and I see… I got scared.</span> <span id="s2131">I said, I hope he feels all right.</span> <span id="s2132">And I come upstairs.</span> <span id="s2133">We lived on the first floor.</span> <span id="s2134">And I come upstairs and he’s sitting and learning.</span> <span id="s2135">I says, “Pa, what are you doing?</span> <span id="s2136">Do you feel all right?</span> <span id="s2137">What’s the matter?”</span> <span id="s2138">“Well, I’m jealous on you,” he says.</span> <span id="s2139">“You’re here such a short time and you’re learning English.</span> <span id="s2140">I want to learn, too.”</span> <span id="s2141">And that’s when he got one of my books and he was sitting and reading English.</span> <span id="s2142">I thought it was so cute.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: Did you speak Yiddish with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: And with your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2147">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: Did your husband speak Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: Broken up, very broken up, not grammatisch, like they say.</span> <span id="s2150">Not like the… how do you say.</span> <span id="s2151">Like with the ABC.</span> <span id="s2152">I don’t know how to express myself to say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: He didn’t speak fluently.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: Fluent, yeah.</span> <span id="s2155">Not only fluently, but not, if a man, he would say it’s a woman, you know, you use the same phrase.</span> <span id="s2156">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s2157">But very poorly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: Back to your journey, just briefly, do you remember your first impressions?</span> <span id="s2159">Did you see the Statue of Liberty as you were approaching the harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: Oh yes, saw the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s2161">I saw, at that point, was Ellis Island, them years, but of course I didn’t see… the tall buildings amazed me very, very much, just to keep it up.</span> <span id="s2162">And we had somebody picking us up from the, from the boat and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2163">And my husband took me to, to his friends.</span> <span id="s2164">I mean not right away, but days after and we all became like friends.</span> <span id="s2165">I fitted in right away, they did like me very much.</span> <span id="s2166">And that’s the way we remained friends all our lives.</span> <span id="s2167">I had a good life.</span> <span id="s2168">And if it wasn’t good, you have to make it good.</span> <span id="s2169">That’s my motto.</span> <span id="s2170">You got to make good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: Did you talk to people about your experiences during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Did you ever want to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: Uh uh, didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s2175">I didn’t want to be different than anybody else.</span> <span id="s2176">I was always wanted to be like somebody else.</span> <span id="s2177">The number, couldn’t live with it.</span> <span id="s2178">I had to take it out.</span> <span id="s2179">And I did and I was very happy.</span> <span id="s2180">And once I took it out, I’m like everybody else.</span> <span id="s2181">You don’t know what’s in my heart, but on the outside I look alike.</span> <span id="s2182">If I open up my mouth, of course you’ll see I’m a foreigner, but I was never ashamed of being a foreigner.</span> <span id="s2183">But I couldn’t live with the number, because this made me different than everybody else.</span> <span id="s2184">This I couldn’t accept.</span> <span id="s2185">So, when my son started to go to school, I said, that’s when I’ll take it off.</span> <span id="s2186">And exactly I did that.</span> <span id="s2187">And like I said before, I… if you ask me, “Oh that’s what the ___________?”</span> <span id="s2188">No, this is my number and I’m very proud of it.</span> <span id="s2189">In the hospital, whenever I was, that’s my number.</span> <span id="s2190">If somebody rang the bell and it was in the morning, I could open up the door in a house dress or my nightgown, but I could not, would not let you see my number.</span> <span id="s2191">Had to take a dish towel from the kitchen or something to put it on top.</span> <span id="s2192">It was like unacceptable in my, in my life.</span> <span id="s2193">I can’t do it.</span> <span id="s2194">One time a child caught me and she asked me, “What is that?”</span> <span id="s2195">And I told her, “Oh it’s my telephone number.”</span> <span id="s2196">I always found an excuse, I figured how the age, how she’s going to accept it.</span> <span id="s2197">Of course, she didn’t accept that, she understood something.</span> <span id="s2198">She says, “Nobody puts a telephone number,” but I said, “I don’t remember, so I didn’t want to lose it.</span> <span id="s2199">So, that’s why I put it there.”</span> <span id="s2200">But you couldn’t catch me the second time already without anything.</span> <span id="s2201">I used to put on a tape to cover it if I had to go out.</span> <span id="s2202">All the time until I took it off.</span> <span id="s2203">It was like a, I don’t know, it was like a disbelief, a hurt.</span> <span id="s2204">Not everybody felt the same way like me.</span> <span id="s2205">A lot of my friends still have it, but I just couldn’t live with it.</span> <span id="s2206">I took it differently.</span> <span id="s2207">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: Did you talk to your son about your, did you talk to your son about your experiences during the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: I didn’t talk to him directly, let’s put it this way, to sit down like I’m sitting down with you and talking about it.</span> <span id="s2210">Here and there I had the picture together.</span> <span id="s2211">Because he always saw me crying.</span> <span id="s2212">Like a holiday came, any occasion and it hurted him.</span> <span id="s2213">I remember when my son was six, five or six years old.</span> <span id="s2214">And he came into the house and I don’t know, I was sitting and crying.</span> <span id="s2215">It had to be some kind of a holiday, because this was the worst time of my life, not to have family sit at the table, just the three of us.</span> <span id="s2216">It was very hard for me, because like I said before, I was… I had a big family and warm family, and I was missing it a lot.</span> <span id="s2217">And he said to me, “What’s the matter?</span> <span id="s2218">What happened?”</span> <span id="s2219">“Nothing happened, Joel.</span> <span id="s2220">I don’t feel good.</span> <span id="s2221">I’m just crying.</span> <span id="s2222">Everything is okay.”</span> <span id="s2223">And I wouldn’t tell him.</span> <span id="s2224">He took me around and he said to me, “Ma, when I get bigger I’m going to marry you, don’t cry.”</span> <span id="s2225">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s2226">I never forgot that.</span> <span id="s2227">And boys have like protected me then already.</span> <span id="s2228">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s2229">But he knew, I’m sure that he knows everything, what went on.</span> <span id="s2230">Here and there he heard it.</span> <span id="s2231">But I never sat down, like I’m sitting down with you and telling, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: What made you want to tell your story now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: I’m getting on in age.</span> <span id="s2234">Kids are learning in school about it.</span> <span id="s2235">My granddaughter went to Poland.</span> <span id="s2236">The March of the Living, for the March of Living.</span> <span id="s2237">And she preaches in school and college, now.</span> <span id="s2238">She tells everybody the story.</span> <span id="s2239">And she’s very much into it.</span> <span id="s2240">And I said, “What the heck, let me tell my story, too.”</span> <span id="s2241">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s2242">I always said they have enough without me, but I guess each and everyone brings a different story to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: And that’s what it’s all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: Are there certain things, that you, even though you didn’t talk about it, are there things that you… did you think a lot about it over the years in your own mind?</span> <span id="s2246">Were there images…</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: …that haunted you?</span> <span id="s2249">Or did you have nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2251">Nightmares I didn’t have.</span> <span id="s2252">I am blessed, what I think, that a lot of people don’t want to believe me.</span> <span id="s2253">Even when they attacked me.</span> <span id="s2254">I don’t have no nightmares.</span> <span id="s2255">I’m not scared.</span> <span id="s2256">This is something in me, that I have no nightmares.</span> <span id="s2257">My husband used to have nightmares.</span> <span id="s2258">My friends told me that their husbands had nightmares, but I never had nightmares.</span> <span id="s2259">No, I can’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: But you did think a lot about that time in your own mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s2262">Oh, in my own mind, all my life, I live with it.</span> <span id="s2263">Like I said before, mostly holidays was very painful.</span> <span id="s2264">And feeling sorry for myself and hating myself.</span> <span id="s2265">Why did I have to be the one to survive?</span> <span id="s2266">But there’s no answer for me.</span> <span id="s2267">That’s the way God wanted it and that’s what it’s all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: Did you talk to anybody about those feelings?</span> <span id="s2269">Was there any way?</span> <span id="s2270">Any release for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: No.</span> <span id="s2272">no.</span> <span id="s2273">I was always able to solve my problems.</span> <span id="s2274">I never spoke to anybody, no.</span> <span id="s2275">I was a strong woman, very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: Tell me about your, what your husband did as a profession in the years that you spent in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s2277">Initially, how did he build his own life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: My husband was in the real estate, not the big buildings, of course, but multiple dwellings, that they called it.</span> <span id="s2279">It was… we bought a house, an apartment building, four bedrooms, three bedrooms and he held that house.</span> <span id="s2280">He did alterations.</span> <span id="s2281">They fixed it.</span> <span id="s2282">A lot of them were closed up.</span> <span id="s2283">You brought them back to life.</span> <span id="s2284">And not in the best areas, in the… for the poor people, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s2285">Middle class, no, it was lower than middle class.</span> <span id="s2286">And it was working them.</span> <span id="s2287">He went for the plumber, he went for the electrician.</span> <span id="s2288">He brought them back to life, those apartments.</span> <span id="s2289">And that’s the way he used to used to build them up.</span> <span id="s2290">Them years if you put in a new gas range or you put in radiators they had in the walls for the heat, so you got a raise.</span> <span id="s2291">And that’s the way he was working it.</span> <span id="s2292">And from this he made, from one house, then he bought another house, then he bought another house and paid the bank the mortgages, and… and I took care on it.</span> <span id="s2293">And that was his job.</span> <span id="s2294">And I used to take the complaints in the house.</span> <span id="s2295">So, this was my job.</span> <span id="s2296">And that’s the way we built it up.</span> <span id="s2297">He used to come home for lunch and dinner.</span> <span id="s2298">We had a real family life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">Q: Did you feel like, you were talking a little bit earlier about how it was important for you to not feel different than everybody else.</span> <span id="s2300">Did you feel, did you come to feel like you belonged in this country and that you were an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2302">I never had that… I felt I’m just as good as everybody else.</span> <span id="s2303">All my life I felt like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: When did you become an American citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: Right away maybe, I think it was a year, a year and a half after.</span> <span id="s2306">I didn’t have to wait the five years.</span> <span id="s2307">So, I went and I passed the test.</span> <span id="s2308">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: Was it a significant event for you to get your American citizenship?</span> <span id="s2310">Was that important, an important, memorable occasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s2312">I was very proud of myself that I made it.</span> <span id="s2313">And I always felt if you live in a country, you have to be able to know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s2314">Quite a few times I went, they called me for jury duty.</span> <span id="s2315">And I told them, I says, “Can’t you get somebody better, more educated than me?”</span> <span id="s2316">And they said, “No.</span> <span id="s2317">You have a brain, you’re using it, that’s what’s important.</span> <span id="s2318">You know how to read and write?”</span> <span id="s2319">That’s what it is.</span> <span id="s2320">And one time, I was… they picked me on a case about weights and measures, and… and I told them… so, we made… they settled it out of court.</span> <span id="s2321">And they said, “You could go home.”</span> <span id="s2322">I asked the judge, I was there a whole week.</span> <span id="s2323">“The money that we’re going to get, do we have to declare it?”</span> <span id="s2324">And he turned around and he said to me, “Let your conscience be the guidance.”</span> <span id="s2325">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s2326">And I’m still laughing about it.</span> <span id="s2327">Whatever they give you.</span> <span id="s2328">I don’t remember exactly, seven or eight dollars a day.</span> <span id="s2329">But the way he answered it.</span> <span id="s2330">I said, “Do I have to declare it?”</span> <span id="s2331">Like afraid to be good.</span> <span id="s2332">You know what I am saying?</span> <span id="s2333">To do what is the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s2334">That was always me… I was always.</span> <span id="s2335">And I asked him.</span> <span id="s2336">He said, “Let your conscience be the guide.”</span> <span id="s2337">I said thank you, and I went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Q: So, did you report it or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">A: No, I did not, had no conscience.</span> <span id="s2340">I think it was about sixty or seventy dollars I made that week.</span> <span id="s2341">Don’t forget I had to take off transportation, too.</span> <span id="s2342">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s2343">But it was very funny.</span> <span id="s2344">I thought it was very funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">Q: Did you make friends with people who were American Jews…</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">A: Right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">Q: …outside the survivor community?</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">A: Oh yeah, right away.</span> <span id="s2349">My husband introduced me to his friend that he came the same time like he did to the United States.</span> <span id="s2350">And his wife was an American girl.</span> <span id="s2351">And now she’s, poor thing, in a home.</span> <span id="s2352">She has Alzheimer’s.</span> <span id="s2353">And we were the best of friends, all our, through our life.</span> <span id="s2354">We always said we’re going to help each other when we’re going get… she had no mother.</span> <span id="s2355">Her mother passed away.</span> <span id="s2356">Her father had remarried, and she had a hard life, and she had two boys and the sons write to me and they call me all the time.</span> <span id="s2357">And we became like family right away, and helping one another.</span> <span id="s2358">If I didn’t have no children yet, she wanted to go someplace, I babysat.</span> <span id="s2359">We always, always helping ways.</span> <span id="s2360">If I made something and I knew that the kids are going to like, I used to bring over some food, and they enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s2361">Things like European things, but they loved it, certain things that she didn’t know how to make.</span> <span id="s2362">And I had a lot of friends, American born, here, but they were people, they were… I never had a problem.</span> <span id="s2363">Never.</span> <span id="s2364">They were them and I was me, that’s it.</span> <span id="s2365">Maybe because they considered themselves an American and had friends.</span> <span id="s2366">So maybe that’s what it was, but I never, never found any fault.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">Q: When you think back over the eras, the years after the war that you spent in the United States, and you think about the 1950s and the 1960s and the 1970s and some of the movements, the social movements and political movements that were happening at that time, was there anything that touched you directly?</span> <span id="s2368">Like the Civil Rights movement for example, or the McCarthy era or the women’s movement.</span> <span id="s2369">Were any of those interesting to you or did they affect you personally in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: The only thing that I cannot watch here and I cannot agree with them is like, no love for your brother.</span> <span id="s2371">The guns, the killing, the stealing, the… all these things goes against me.</span> <span id="s2372">There is no reason for it.</span> <span id="s2373">There is no reason for it.</span> <span id="s2374">Or you see somebody robbing in the street.</span> <span id="s2375">There’s no… it doesn’t call for it.</span> <span id="s2376">You could work and make a living.</span> <span id="s2377">And I’m very much against these things.</span> <span id="s2378">I feel that everybody is the same, has the same right.</span> <span id="s2379">I have a woman that takes care on me from the day I got here.</span> <span id="s2380">And now it’s almost two years, it’s going to be in June.</span> <span id="s2381">I treat her royally, better than I treat myself.</span> <span id="s2382">She has a chip on her shoulder because she is black.</span> <span id="s2383">And I keep telling her.</span> <span id="s2384">Like she gets excited if somebody looks wrong at her.</span> <span id="s2385">I says, “Teresa, grow up, it’s all in your head.</span> <span id="s2386">It’s no place else but in your head.</span> <span id="s2387">I don’t know why you have that feeling in you.”</span> <span id="s2388">She was persecuted and this and that.</span> <span id="s2389">I said, “I was not sitting on my beautiful chair and watching television all my life, too.</span> <span id="s2390">I was very hurt in my… but you got to let go, you can’t hold on to these things.”</span> <span id="s2391">I don’t agree with a lot of things.</span> <span id="s2392">I personally think they have it too God damn good, they should go out to work better.</span> <span id="s2393">Even those kids, what went on now.</span> <span id="s2394">It’s a terrible thing that doesn’t call for all these things.</span> <span id="s2395">And how did the parents not know about it?</span> <span id="s2396">I will never believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: You talking about the shooting in Colorado?</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: I think it’s a disgrace.</span> <span id="s2399">It’s a disgrace.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">End of Tape 3, Side B Tape 4, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: Continuation of an interview with Justine Lerner.</span> <span id="s2402">This is tape number four, side A. Okay, were you finished?</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: About Bosnia we were talking.</span> <span id="s2404">Yeah, the way they’re throwing them out of their homes.</span> <span id="s2405">It brought back so many memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">Q: And Kosovo.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">A: And Kosovo, yeah.</span> <span id="s2408">I was sitting and crying.</span> <span id="s2409">My son called me, said, “What’s the matter, Ma?”</span> <span id="s2410">I said, “That’s what it is.</span> <span id="s2411">I can’t take these things.</span> <span id="s2412">It doesn’t call for all these things.</span> <span id="s2413">It’s enough is enough.”</span> <span id="s2414">But I guess it’s not enough yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">Q: Did you ever go back and visit Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: No, I would never go back there, never, never in a million years.</span> <span id="s2417">I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s2418">We traveled a lot.</span> <span id="s2419">And we went to South America.</span> <span id="s2420">We went a lot of places, but I would never go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s2421">I feel that I have nothing there but misery.</span> <span id="s2422">I have no graves.</span> <span id="s2423">I have nothing to go to, even to go on the grave, I don’t.</span> <span id="s2424">To say hello, I don’t have no graves.</span> <span id="s2425">I have nothing, so what am I going to go see?</span> <span id="s2426">Never.</span> <span id="s2427">Never, never.</span> <span id="s2428">My husband did go, to see my house where we lived.</span> <span id="s2429">Oh yeah, but I would never do that.</span> <span id="s2430">He went without me.</span> <span id="s2431">We went to Washington that time and he went to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: He went to Poland to see the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s2434">He went on a… on a tour.</span> <span id="s2435">And I would never in a million and one years go.</span> <span id="s2436">I have no… I have no heart for this anymore.</span> <span id="s2437">I cannot make it any better, so.</span> <span id="s2438">I want to remember it the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: You moved to Kentucky after that very horrible event happened to you.</span> <span id="s2440">And I imagine that after what you had already been through in your life… how did you recover emotionally, psychologically?</span> <span id="s2441">I mean, to experience such a tragic, traumatic event again.</span> <span id="s2442">Were you able to recover your hope and your faith in the good of humanity after that?</span> <span id="s2443">Did you feel like it all turned your sense of hope…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: It’s a very funny thing.</span> <span id="s2445">I still have my beliefs and I cannot change it.</span> <span id="s2446">It’s… I take him for a bad boy.</span> <span id="s2447">The child was on dope.</span> <span id="s2448">That’s what the mother says.</span> <span id="s2449">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2450">I didn’t know him and I wish I would have never known him.</span> <span id="s2451">I’m not there to fight the case.</span> <span id="s2452">He only got six and a half years, which is nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: It was one person who had attacked you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">A: One person that did that.</span> <span id="s2455">He robbed me.</span> <span id="s2456">If he would come in and would rob me, he would want my jewelry, I would give it to him gladly.</span> <span id="s2457">He didn’t have to kill me.</span> <span id="s2458">But… and if you ask me, do I remember him?</span> <span id="s2459">No.</span> <span id="s2460">The detectives came when I was in the hospital, I remember, the day I left.</span> <span id="s2461">Showed me pictures of him.</span> <span id="s2462">Never saw him before in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q: How did they catch him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">A: The kids from the area gave him out.</span> <span id="s2465">The police went around, detectives searching what went on, you know, looking.</span> <span id="s2466">And they were the ones that gave him the address and the name.</span> <span id="s2467">And he did two people the same day, me and another woman a block away.</span> <span id="s2468">So, I mean… and it was not a black boy.</span> <span id="s2469">It was a white boy.</span> <span id="s2470">So the mother is there.</span> <span id="s2471">I should say that I feel sorry for the mother?</span> <span id="s2472">No.</span> <span id="s2473">That this would be a lie.</span> <span id="s2474">She goes every day to court when it went on the case.</span> <span id="s2475">I was not there.</span> <span id="s2476">My son was not there.</span> <span id="s2477">So we had a lawyer, but they couldn’t fight it without us.</span> <span id="s2478">He left me a cripple for the rest of my life and all the pain that I have with me, but nothing helped.</span> <span id="s2479">Because he was there, and that’s what he got, six and a half years.</span> <span id="s2480">He’ll come out, he’ll do it again.</span> <span id="s2481">But I can do nothing about it.</span> <span id="s2482">Cannot take a gun and go and kill him, because it’s against me.</span> <span id="s2483">I can’t do that.</span> <span id="s2484">But that’s it.</span> <span id="s2485">But on the other hand I have to take that thing out of my life.</span> <span id="s2486">I could lay down and die?</span> <span id="s2487">No.</span> <span id="s2488">My time wasn’t up yet.</span> <span id="s2489">When my time is going to be up, I’ll go.</span> <span id="s2490">But I have another extension of life, so I have to go and enjoy it.</span> <span id="s2491">And that’s the way I’m doing it.</span> <span id="s2492">I’m enjoying it… I’m not enjoying it, but I’m alive.</span> <span id="s2493">Let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s2494">Like for the holidays, my son belongs to a… the Reform temple, so I went with him.</span> <span id="s2495">And the four doctors that used to take care on me in the hospital were there and they came over to wish me a happy New Year.</span> <span id="s2496">And they couldn’t get over how good you look.</span> <span id="s2497">I said, “Thank God for the make-up.”</span> <span id="s2498">I always have something what to say.</span> <span id="s2499">I said, “Thank God for the make-up, it covers all the sins.”</span> <span id="s2500">I says, “That’s nice.”</span> <span id="s2501">He said, “A lot of people’s make-up cannot do such a good job like this.”</span> <span id="s2502">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s2503">But I always have something I could always make a joke out of it.</span> <span id="s2504">You know what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s2505">But that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: Will you say your son’s name for the record and something about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">A: Would I say something for my son?</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: Just about your son and his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: I was always a good mother.</span> <span id="s2510">I have to… I have to compliment myself.</span> <span id="s2511">I was always a good mother, looking out for the child.</span> <span id="s2512">Always being there for him.</span> <span id="s2513">And I think that’s what he repays me back.</span> <span id="s2514">He’s there for me all the time.</span> <span id="s2515">He cares about me.</span> <span id="s2516">But I understand very much he has his own life and I don’t want to take nothing away from him.</span> <span id="s2517">But he’s a very good boy.</span> <span id="s2518">He’s good.</span> <span id="s2519">And I’m thankful to God that I have him.</span> <span id="s2520">And that’s what it’s all about.</span> <span id="s2521">He takes care on me.</span> <span id="s2522">I was good to him, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">Q: His name is Joel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A: Joel Lerner.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: And your grandchildren, you have how many?</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: I have four grandkids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q: What are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: The oldest one is Shawn.</span> <span id="s2529">Which he was just, in February fourteenth, he was twenty-two.</span> <span id="s2530">He’s in school, college, rather.</span> <span id="s2531">My second one is Lindsay.</span> <span id="s2532">Lindsay is twenty.</span> <span id="s2533">She was twenty, in March twenty-seven, she was twenty.</span> <span id="s2534">And she too is in college.</span> <span id="s2535">The number three is Daniel.</span> <span id="s2536">He’s still in high school.</span> <span id="s2537">Daniel was sixteen, he’s going to be seventeen.</span> <span id="s2538">And my youngest one is thirteen, Ashley.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Q: And they’ve taken, at least Daniel has taken a special interest in your history.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">A: They all do, I would say.</span> <span id="s2541">I would say they all do.</span> <span id="s2542">Now, the youngest one now, wants to go to Israel later on, I guess, when she’s going to be sixteen.</span> <span id="s2543">I said, “I’ll help you every way I can.</span> <span id="s2544">I want you to see your land.</span> <span id="s2545">And I want you, too, like the others did.”</span> <span id="s2546">Ashley went, uh Lindsay went, so did Shawn.</span> <span id="s2547">Daniel’s going to go along maybe later on a little bit.</span> <span id="s2548">And I always visit them, because I lived in Brooklyn and they know I have the love for them and they have their love for me.</span> <span id="s2549">I know they are very busy.</span> <span id="s2550">I would like to see them more often.</span> <span id="s2551">But I understand that not only do they have their life, but I can’t demand anything from them, because I’m not going to get it.</span> <span id="s2552">I should be thankful whatever I got and that’s the way I go on.</span> <span id="s2553">They respect me and I respect them and that’s what it is.</span> <span id="s2554">A lot of people cannot see it, the way I see it.</span> <span id="s2555">I cannot demand from anybody.</span> <span id="s2556">I’ll do myself.</span> <span id="s2557">But my friend just lost her husband not long ago and he used to be, he used to take her all over and help her with every way.</span> <span id="s2558">And she couldn’t walk two blocks.</span> <span id="s2559">Now of course, she finds it very, very hard.</span> <span id="s2560">She has one daughter and the daughter is getting tired of it already.</span> <span id="s2561">She has a family too and she works.</span> <span id="s2562">I said, “Betty, get a hold of yourself.</span> <span id="s2563">She has her life too.</span> <span id="s2564">You can’t demand too much, because you’re not going to get it.</span> <span id="s2565">That’s it.</span> <span id="s2566">It’s nobody’s fault that, you know, you got spoiled all your life.</span> <span id="s2567">And that’s what it’s all about.</span> <span id="s2568">That’s it.</span> <span id="s2569">You, you can work.</span> <span id="s2570">You can’t go, walk?</span> <span id="s2571">Get a cab, go whatever you have to do.</span> <span id="s2572">There’s no alternative.</span> <span id="s2573">If you don’t drive that’s what you have to do.”</span> <span id="s2574">And I cannot lay on anybody… I’m always appreciative whatever you do, it’s good, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s2575">I may think differently, but I’m not going to give it out.</span> <span id="s2576">I can’t do that.</span> <span id="s2577">I still know between right and wrong and I’m a happy bird.</span> <span id="s2578">I’m very happy, all my life, like a stupid… [laughing] I’m a happy-go-lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">Q: You came to Kentucky after your attack, you were attacked in New York.</span> <span id="s2580">And that was 1997?</span> <span id="s2581">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">A: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s2583">Uh huh.</span> <span id="s2584">Yeah, it’s going to be two years in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">Q: What were your ideas and expectations of Kentucky and what were your first impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">A: I had no expectations.</span> <span id="s2587">I didn’t know at that point what was going on in my life.</span> <span id="s2588">I… my husband never wanted to move to Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2589">He didn’t like Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2590">It was not for him.</span> <span id="s2591">But being the neighborhood started to change, so I started to talk to him about it.</span> <span id="s2592">He didn’t want to listen to me.</span> <span id="s2593">“That’s my home and that’s the way I’m going to be there.”</span> <span id="s2594">So, I didn’t have too much expectations.</span> <span id="s2595">I knew what was going on in Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2596">The money talks.</span> <span id="s2597">He found out, he felt like that… if you want to meet somebody, you go out for lunch.</span> <span id="s2598">My husband was from a different era, he knew his wife is going to make lunch and you come to the house.</span> <span id="s2599">And I found it very hard, too with that thing.</span> <span id="s2600">Because they don’t want to cook, everything is going out and he was not used to a life like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">Q: You mean in Kentucky…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">A: In Kentucky, in Kentucky, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2603">So, he was not too much for Kentucky, but after he passed away, I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s2604">I knew I couldn’t stay too long where I was, because the neighborhood was changing.</span> <span id="s2605">A lot of my friends moved away.</span> <span id="s2606">So, where did they go?</span> <span id="s2607">Either they went to Florida or they went to New Jersey.</span> <span id="s2608">And I figured I’ll find out.</span> <span id="s2609">So I went to Florida for the winter for four months, and I… I still was undecided what to do.</span> <span id="s2610">And then this thing came up and… and here I am.</span> <span id="s2611">And that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">Q: What were your first impressions of Kentucky?</span> <span id="s2613">You moved to Louisville, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2615">What was my impression?</span> <span id="s2616">I mean, I knew I’ll never make a friend over here, because that’s my age.</span> <span id="s2617">You make friends when you’re young and you hold onto them.</span> <span id="s2618">When you are an older person, I don’t want to hear their problems and they don’t want to hear my problems.</span> <span id="s2619">You talk about sicknesses.</span> <span id="s2620">Especially if I don’t drive, that’s a disability already.</span> <span id="s2621">I cannot… I have to wait for somebody to take me.</span> <span id="s2622">And I don’t like that.</span> <span id="s2623">I was always used to walk and do my own thing.</span> <span id="s2624">And solve my own problems.</span> <span id="s2625">I was a private person.</span> <span id="s2626">I didn’t like anybody to feel sorry for me or whatever.</span> <span id="s2627">So… but here I have no alternative.</span> <span id="s2628">I have a woman that helps me.</span> <span id="s2629">She takes me all over, wherever I have to go.</span> <span id="s2630">She makes the appointments for me with my doctors and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2631">I do my own cooking, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2632">It’s a lonely life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">Q: Did you make any connections with the Jewish community, the Holocaust survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">A: I never went to the Holocaust… I didn’t even know that they had one over here.</span> <span id="s2635">I would like you to, if you have an address, to leave it and I’ll find out more about it.</span> <span id="s2636">This I would like very much.</span> <span id="s2637">I didn’t even know that they have a Holocaust… the Jewish, JCC, the Jewish…</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: Community Center?</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: …Community Center.</span> <span id="s2640">I went after my husband passed away, and I came down for a holiday over here by myself.</span> <span id="s2641">And my son took me around to show me I should settle over here in Louisville.</span> <span id="s2642">So we made an appointment with the JCC that I should go over there, you know, and they’ll tell me what I could do, what, what kind of facilities they have for senior citizens and all that thing.</span> <span id="s2643">So, he dropped me off at ten o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s2644">This was before I got hurt, before my accident.</span> <span id="s2645">He dropped me off at ten o’clock in the morning and she showed me the building.</span> <span id="s2646">She showed me all the things what they have for senior citizens.</span> <span id="s2647">And he says, “Ma, you’re going to have lunch over here and I’ll pick you up after lunch.”</span> <span id="s2648">I says, fine.</span> <span id="s2649">So, the lady takes me for a walk and shows me the building.</span> <span id="s2650">And then she showed me downstairs where all the senior citizens meet.</span> <span id="s2651">And they were making a journal, because a journal comes out like every month.</span> <span id="s2652">And I was helping them to put the journal together.</span> <span id="s2653">And I was very happy.</span> <span id="s2654">And of course, I was the youngest one, you could imagine.</span> <span id="s2655">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s2656">One didn’t hear, one didn’t see, but I took everything fine, it’s good.</span> <span id="s2657">And I had my pocketbook with me, and I said to the woman that I was working with, I said, where could I, where do you leave your bags?</span> <span id="s2658">Where do you put your pocketbook?</span> <span id="s2659">She says, “Put it next to me on my… at the table.</span> <span id="s2660">I’ll sit over here and you’ll sit next to me.</span> <span id="s2661">We’ll have lunch together.”</span> <span id="s2662">I says, fine, thank you.</span> <span id="s2663">And it must have been maybe about ten to twelve.</span> <span id="s2664">And the lady comes over, “Whose bag is that?</span> <span id="s2665">I said, “It’s mine.</span> <span id="s2666">What’s the matter?”</span> <span id="s2667">“That’s my seat.”</span> <span id="s2668">I said, “I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s2669">I’ll take it away.</span> <span id="s2670">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2671">The other one told me, that lady told me I could sit over here, no big deal.”</span> <span id="s2672">And it threw me off so much, that I just… I wasn’t used to it.</span> <span id="s2673">I said, “Ah, that’s not for me.</span> <span id="s2674">Let them stay with them.</span> <span id="s2675">I’m not going to come back.”</span> <span id="s2676">And since then, I went again.</span> <span id="s2677">I went to a concert there not long ago.</span> <span id="s2678">I try, but somehow, I don’t get… it’s not for me.</span> <span id="s2679">I can’t be like that, them… it’s like anything else, I don’t know them.</span> <span id="s2680">Let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s2681">And to get acquainted at this point and to have their lunches, which I don’t care for, it brings back too many memories.</span> <span id="s2682">So, I’d rather stay home.</span> <span id="s2683">And here they have a pool and maybe I’ll join the pool.</span> <span id="s2684">I’ll go over.</span> <span id="s2685">I’ll take a look.</span> <span id="s2686">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">Q: Are you a member of a synagogue, a temple here in Louisville?</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2689">Yeah, I belong to the Reform and to the Conservative, to both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">Q: Do you go to services?</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">A: Oh sure I go, holidays, not every Saturday.</span> <span id="s2692">Holidays I do go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">Q: So, are mostly the people that you spend time with are Teresa, who’s your caregiver and the members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2695">Right.</span> <span id="s2696">Well, I made friends with a lady over here.</span> <span id="s2697">She’s not Jewish, she’s gentile, but we have a lot in common and we’re very good… so I go with her sometimes to a movie.</span> <span id="s2698">Teresa’s off, Saturday she works a few hours and Sundays she’s off.</span> <span id="s2699">So that’s the days, she took me, that lady, to her daughter’s.</span> <span id="s2700">They had the Derby party.</span> <span id="s2701">So, I brought a bottle of wine.</span> <span id="s2702">I went there, and they were very, very hospitable, very, very nice.</span> <span id="s2703">I had a good time.</span> <span id="s2704">But otherwise, I stick to my family.</span> <span id="s2705">And of course, my friends in New York.</span> <span id="s2706">I talk to them.</span> <span id="s2707">Saturday and Sunday, I’m busy with the telephone.</span> <span id="s2708">I mean during the week, too, but… I keep in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add?</span> <span id="s2710">Any concluding thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">A: Including what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">Q: Concluding thoughts?</span> <span id="s2713">(Laughter.)</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">A: Concluding foxes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">Q: Thoughts, thoughts for…</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">A: I think I’ve had enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">Q: Yeah… I’ve put you through the wringer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">Q: Yeah… well, thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">A: Thank you, I appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">Q: I
