id="s11">Q: I need to begin by having you state your name as it was then, the date of birth and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My name is Icek Baum.</span> <span id="s13">I'm born in Warsaw the first of January, 1925.</span> <span id="s14">And this neighborhood where I was born in Warsaw, it called Powisle, this was just on the river but Poland the big river is Vistula, maybe you know, and that neighborhood was called like that.</span> <span id="s15">And my father was a tailor for the army, and so far my father was not alive.</span> <span id="s16">He was not bad but he died.</span> <span id="s17">I was very young.</span> <span id="s18">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s19">It could be 1934, '33, '34, something like that.</span> <span id="s20">And my mother she was with seven kids.</span> <span id="s21">It was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s22">So that's the beginning of a very, very hard life for all of us.</span> <span id="s23">I was very young at this time, maybe ten-years-old, maybe younger.</span> <span id="s24">Maybe a little bit younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Were you the middle child, older brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s27">I have older brothers.</span> <span id="s28">I was the second youngster, so I have three sisters, it was three sisters and four brothers.</span> <span id="s29">So I was the more youngster, the second youngster.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Now, your life was difficult because your mother had so many of you to take care of, but perhaps you have good memories before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Good memories, yes, good memories, little bit, yes.</span> <span id="s32">And time when my mother couldn't support everything and I was -- it was time to go to school and first time I was in Polish school.</span> <span id="s33">In this neighborhood there was no Jewish school and Polish and I was there but I was maybe lucky, maybe my mother was lucky.</span> <span id="s34">She sent me to Dr. KorczakI was in orphanage by Korczak.</span> <span id="s35">Maybe you know about Korczak, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Now, let me just hear a little bit more about your lifestyle first, and then I do want to talk more about Dr. Korczak.</span> <span id="s37">You went to a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: And many of your friends and neighbors were Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Most of them was Christian, yes.</span> <span id="s41">Perhaps some Jewish too, but just in this neighborhood where we were living there was not many Jews, was most Christians.</span> <span id="s42">And we was living -- like I can remember -- it was good because even I don't know what different between Christian or not Christian so.</span> <span id="s43">I remember just once when it was holidays, Passover, so we 1 Janusz Korczak (1879-1942), physician, writer, and educator.</span> <span id="s44">In 1912 he was appointed director the Jewish orphanage at Krochmalna Street in Warsaw, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">had change and we give them matzos, and they bake beautiful nice cake.</span> <span id="s46">And this was the difference between a Jew and non-Jew and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: So you had a good relations?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: We had a very good relationship, yes.</span> <span id="s49">And I think my father, my mother, she have too good relationship with these peoples.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Did you do anything that was very uniquely Jewish, other than the holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yes, because we went before to go to the public school my parents would send me, send - - us, brothers too, in the Jewish chederMaybe you know.</span> <span id="s52">This is most religion school.</span> <span id="s53">So that's the one that was really different between the Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: So your parents were fairly religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Not very religious, but like maybe more than in this time.</span> <span id="s56">But my father keep always the Sabbath and my mother she prepare always for the Friday, like a Jewish home.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did you experience or were you aware of any antisemitism before Hitler came to power or before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Yes, lot.</span> <span id="s59">Yes.</span> <span id="s60">This would be after my father die, so you know when we becoming older already say we understood more and even on the street “Jew, Jew.”</span> <span id="s61">It was always the young people, they beating us and they make all kinds of stories, all kinds of things, because we was Jews.</span> <span id="s62">I didn't see any difference, but maybe they saw the difference between Jew and non-Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: By these were the same people that you were friendly with?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s65">But when they are coming older maybe they was more antisemitic – that’s one of the reasons.</span> <span id="s66">Maybe the parents teach them like that.</span> <span id="s67">Maybe when in the churches, when they go to the churches the priest say, “Don't buy by Jew.</span> <span id="s68">Don’t….</span> <span id="s69">Kill the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Because they killed our Jesus Christus.”</span> <span id="s71">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: So this was at a time when Hitler had come to power in Germany but before the war?</span> <span id="s73">A: That's when all before the war -- far before the war.</span> <span id="s74">This one, like I say, it was between 1930, '35, ’34, ’33, ’34, ’35.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: And these were the same people that you said a few minutes ago you went to school with?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">2 Orthodox primary school (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yeah, we went to school.</span> <span id="s78">But even in the school when we went the first time and I was in the public school, so it was always that the -- but in Poland the people were very religious and when it’s coming the time to religion -- we don't have to -- but I went out, out from the classroom, and so after “Jew, Jew, Jew,” and if they couldn't, they beat us because look, we was just couple youngsters.</span> <span id="s79">Not so many like them.</span> <span id="s80">We are scared from them and they take advantage of us, that's it.</span> <span id="s81">It was very, very hard this time.</span> <span id="s82">So even like youngster, and believe me I don't know, I couldn't understand why, why?</span> <span id="s83">Because I'm Jew?</span> <span id="s84">And I don't see no difference because I was the same thing.</span> <span id="s85">We don't have no horn.</span> <span id="s86">We don't have nothing.</span> <span id="s87">We took the same language.</span> <span id="s88">We eat the same thing.</span> <span id="s89">And they was so -- they kill.</span> <span id="s90">If they can't kill, they beat us.</span> <span id="s91">They make all kind of trouble.</span> <span id="s92">Sometimes, we saw, they break the windows.</span> <span id="s93">They break all these things.</span> <span id="s94">Why?</span> <span id="s95">Because they were -- they're Jewish family, and believe me at this time we were very, very poor.</span> <span id="s96">I remember mine house.</span> <span id="s97">When my father died we were very, very poor because we had my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">She was with seven kids and support seven kids wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s99">She have a very, very, very hard life.</span> <span id="s100">Very hard life.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">01:08:50</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: What did you know about what was happening in Germany before you were invaded?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Lots of things.</span> <span id="s104">I don't know.</span> <span id="s105">The truth, just what we read sometimes in the paper, you know.</span> <span id="s106">The Nationalsozialistische Parteithey win, you know.</span> <span id="s107">At this time it was Hindenburg-- Hindenburg lose the power and the German took the power.</span> <span id="s108">So when the -- 1939 -- just when it was Rosh Hashanah is decreed the war was starting.</span> <span id="s109">So the Germans start to come into Poland.</span> <span id="s110">I remember when the Pole -- I never want to believe that the Poland going to lose the war.</span> <span id="s111">But at this time I was very young so maybe I don't understood very well, but I remember once my mother told me – she told us, “You know what, you’ll see, when the Germans come in here, I don't think they are going to handle with us very badly because they not the antisemites like the Polacks.</span> <span id="s112">Because,” she say, “I remember in the war in 1914-18 they were very friendly, because we Jews are speaking Jewishand the Jewish is a lot like German so we could understood altogether.”</span> <span id="s113">And it wasn’t -- was like she was saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">01:10:13</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: So, you all knew what was happening in Germany but you thought that it wouldn't happen to you in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: What happen German, I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s117">Because maybe I know what we read in the 3 National Socialist Party (German); Nazi political party in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">4 Paul von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg (1847-1934); German army officer and statesman, president of Germany 1925-1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">5 Yiddish papers, but, you know, we couldn't have no radios, no TV’s and the media was not strong like today.</span> <span id="s120">So we don't know exactly everything.</span> <span id="s121">But one thing I remember is when Hitler is coming on power, they send out most the Jews from Germany.</span> <span id="s122">And the Jews, they come into Poland and lots coming to Warsaw and we was talking with them and they tell us what kind of pogrom was there, you know, with the Kristallnacht and the beating and the -- don't let live the Jews.</span> <span id="s123">The Jews have no right, the Jews was second, even not the second citizen.</span> <span id="s124">They couldn't work.</span> <span id="s125">They couldn't have absolute nothing.</span> <span id="s126">So we know already there is trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Do you remember the first day of the war or when Poland was occupied, do you remember what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: When the -- first of all, the Polish people, the Polack, they keep the fight one month, 30 days.</span> <span id="s129">And this was a very, very badly because we was in Warsaw and I remember it was when shrapnel -- you know what the shrapnel -- it was maybe two, three windows away from our apartment.</span> <span id="s130">So in the house if you run down, all my mother she prepare for everybody, pullover, you know, something to put on clothes.</span> <span id="s131">So we run to the shelters.</span> <span id="s132">So after maybe one or two hours later we go out.</span> <span id="s133">We went back to the apartment and we eat what we have.</span> <span id="s134">We don't have much but we eat everything.</span> <span id="s135">And just the second day, I think, they started again and it was fire bombs that fell in the house where we was living and everything was burned.</span> <span id="s136">And we don't have time to take nothing, nothing, we run out just what we have on our back.</span> <span id="s137">And everybody -- all these houses, all of Warsaw was burning.</span> <span id="s138">So we have nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s139">That's what I remember and it was on the same street it was a bath -- public bath.</span> <span id="s140">So we went there.</span> <span id="s141">We have a little.</span> <span id="s142">We took a little broom and my mother she was living, sleeping in the bath tub.</span> <span id="s143">That's what I remember.</span> <span id="s144">And when the Germans come in, the first thing what they do they start to give food for the peoples, soup and bread.</span> <span id="s145">So it was not bad.</span> <span id="s146">But after they doesn’t – they start with the Jews.</span> <span id="s147">No Jew have right to have bread.</span> <span id="s148">No Jew have nothing.</span> <span id="s149">And sometimes my mother -- she was blond, she wasn't very dark and so it was not so easy to recognize her like a Jew, so she went and have bread.</span> <span id="s150">But sometimes, next day or two days later when she go again, some Polack recognize her and they say, “Ah there’s a Jew, there is a Jew.”</span> <span id="s151">And they throw her out so we didn't have nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: So this was in the bath house?</span> <span id="s153">A: That was in the bath house.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: And there was Polish people and Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: All together, yeah.</span> <span id="s156">But as soon as the German come in, you know, they saw what is all the difference.</span> <span id="s157">We were treated a little bit better because from the Jews, but we were always scared to go out because it was not very, very pleasant.</span> <span id="s158">Not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: How long were you in this facility?</span> <span id="s160">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: I can't tell you exactly how long because-- Q: Days, weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">01:14:50</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: It was couple, maybe one or two weeks until we find a shelter very, very far out from town and there we was maybe the whole time until -- this was 1939, and 1939, '40 the winter was very, very hard winter so we stay there until it makes 1940.</span> <span id="s164">I think 1940.</span> <span id="s165">So, I was, I was by Korczak.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Let me just ask you a question and then I want to ask you about the orphanage.</span> <span id="s167">When you were in this bath house, wasn't there any feeling of -- I don't know -- camaraderie, between the Polish people and the Jewish people because, in fact, you were all being invaded by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Not special, not special.</span> <span id="s169">No.</span> <span id="s170">Because first of all, I don't know, we was scared.</span> <span id="s171">If the Polish people was scared from the Germans, I don't know.</span> <span id="s172">But it was, there was a distance between the Jewish people and the Polish people because the German they start already -- the Jew.</span> <span id="s173">They take away everything from the Jews and they start to talk about the ghetto and they start, you know, every Jew have to have, you know, the Jew shtern So we -- there was a certain distance between the Polish and the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">01:16:22</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Maybe the Polish thought they could protect themselves by separating?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: You know, it's very hard to tell you, because the Polish people -- I going to tell you just once.</span> <span id="s177">The antisemitic by the Polish people -- by the Polish woman there was already inject in the breast of from the woman and they give it to the children.</span> <span id="s178">But the children took the breast from their mothers and start to give them the milk.</span> <span id="s179">They give them the hateness for the Jews.</span> <span id="s180">And it was all over, all over, every time you have always, you know.</span> <span id="s181">There was terrible.</span> <span id="s182">Even sometimes you know this day I remember I stay up about two, three o'clock in the night to make a line to have a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s183">And when one Polack or somebody see a man what is a Jew, they threw him out.</span> <span id="s184">They kicked him out.</span> <span id="s185">They beat him.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And yet your early memories were good.</span> <span id="s187">Early memories everybody was friendly.</span> <span id="s188">It all changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: That doesn't change.</span> <span id="s190">And I think nothing change today.</span> <span id="s191">I don't think something change</span></p> <p><span id="s192">6 star (Yiddish).</span></p> <p><span id="s193">today.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: But what I am saying is when you were young you lived around a lot of Polish people and everybody was friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s196">Because, you know, everybody was friends because we was young, little one.</span> <span id="s197">I was very young.</span> <span id="s198">So we don't see the difference but in the moment when we come just to the reason, the moment when the brain start to work, they change.</span> <span id="s199">They change today because maybe, like I say, maybe the churches, maybe the priest, maybe they put the poison in this brains.</span> <span id="s200">Maybe the brainwash you, I don't know what.</span> <span id="s201">They always know that they pretend always, “The Jews they kill Christus -- Jesus Christus.”</span> <span id="s202">What I have to do with 2000 years with all this thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: At what point were you sent to the orphanage and why were you sent there?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: I was sent to the orphanage because like I say we was poor.</span> <span id="s205">It was very hard and this time, it was time when I have to go to school and it was maybe very hard to my mother, you know.</span> <span id="s206">So somebody give her the address from this orphanage and she put me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Do you remember what year this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: This should be about '35, 1934, '35, maybe '36, in this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Can you tell me in a full sentence what that is 1934, 1935 you were sent to the orphanage and tell me what it was called?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: What you mean it was called?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: What was the name of this orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: This was -- I'm sorry Dom SierotIt was Polish this is orphan home for the orphanages and this was a private -- not private, but we have to pay.</span> <span id="s213">But I think they reach people from Warsaw who support themselves and this was the hope -- the director -- maybe for her was Dr. Janusz Korczak.</span> <span id="s214">His really name is Henry Goldsmith.</span> <span id="s215">He was a doctor and they have the Mrs. Wilczynskashe was the director too because Dr. Korczak doesn’t was always there.</span> <span id="s216">I think he was busy, you know, to collect the money, to collect all the things for us.</span> <span id="s217">And he have always an audition on the radio.</span> <span id="s218">He talk on the radio once a week, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">01:20:40 7 Orphan home (Polish) 8 Stephania Wilczynska (1886-1942), head teacher and co-director of Korczak’s orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: He was well known?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s222">And they call him the starydoctor, the old doctor.</span> <span id="s223">And I remember he took me once with him to the radio and he was -- moment I was I think, in September, October it was cold outside.</span> <span id="s224">He talk about the flu, and there was a moment I have to cough and I forgot to cough and he say “Cough, cough, cough.”</span> <span id="s225">And then I did it.</span> <span id="s226">He was a very, very nice man and we was there 107 children, 56 girls and 51 boys.</span> <span id="s227">My number was 46.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: How old were you?</span> <span id="s229">A: Bitte?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: About how old were you?</span> <span id="s231">A: About six, seven years.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: No, no, how old were you when you went into the orphanage?</span> <span id="s233">A: Seven years, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Oh, you were young?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s236">They don't took old people because when you were 13, 14 years, you have to leave -- to live -- you have to go out because they took somebody else in your place.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Now, did your brothers and sisters go with you to the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: I was alone but sometimes, every Saturday I go home to visit my parents and there, I was there a whole year.</span> <span id="s239">But in summertime we have a camp they call Kolonia Rózyczkaand it was a vacation.</span> <span id="s240">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s241">So when I come in they took me out from the school the Christian school and they send me to the Jewish school, not the Jewish, but it was a public school but it was most Jews was there.</span> <span id="s242">That was there.</span> <span id="s243">So when we have vacation so we went to the koloniafor two months and I have my little brother.</span> <span id="s244">So it was hard for me.</span> <span id="s245">It was so nice.</span> <span id="s246">It was so good that I have food.</span> <span id="s247">I have nice bed I have everything.</span> <span id="s248">He have to stay home, so I ask, I make questions and they allow him.</span> <span id="s249">So I went home and he was in my place for one month.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Was

the orphanage?</span> <span id="s255">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: And the other thing I'm confused about, if you don't mind is -- now, you were born in 1925?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And your father died in, around maybe 1935?</span> <span id="s259">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: You

about life in the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Life in the orphanage, it was very nice.</span> <span id="s273">First of all, we, you know, everybody have his bed.</span> <span id="s274">You have to, like you say, sleeping places for the girls, for the boys, everybody have his own bed.</span> <span id="s275">And I think, like I remember this day, it was six, six-thirty in the morning.</span> <span id="s276">We have to be washed, clothed and we have a breakfast and everybody have to prepare to go to school.</span> <span id="s277">We went to school so we went to different schools.</span> <span id="s278">And the school -- I remember the first couple years when the first I start from the third degree because I was already-- so after school start one o'clock to six afternoon.</span> <span id="s279">So before we have breakfast and everybody have to make his bed and we have to clean the beds.</span> <span id="s280">And the -- we have to make the homeworks, and after we have lunch and then have to be dressed, shoes shined and we went to school.</span> <span id="s281">And we have some people, some children who start the school at eight o'clock in the morning until one o'clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Did you -- was there a certain organization in the orphanage?</span> <span id="s283">Did you each have responsibilities or --</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s285">Everybody have his responsibilities, they have to take care.</span> <span id="s286">First one, the oldest take care the youngsters.</span> <span id="s287">So when you arrive about 10 years, 11 years and when a youngster come in, so you take care of him.</span> <span id="s288">You teach him.</span> <span id="s289">You say the rules for the orphanage, you know.</span> <span id="s290">Until a certain time you was responsible for him.</span> <span id="s291">If he do something that not supposed to be, you be punished.</span> <span id="s292">Not him.</span> <span id="s293">But this guy, what was responsible for the child, he was punished.</span> <span id="s294">But children thinks it was very, very -- but still -- and you know, we have like supper all together.</span> <span id="s295">It was about seven o'clock supper and we could play.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">We have ping pong.</span> <span id="s297">We have a piano and we have lessons every day you could.</span> <span id="s298">They teach us to play mandolin if you want to or the piano.</span> <span id="s299">They teach us Hebrew always when you want to.</span> <span id="s300">Nobody force you to do something.</span> <span id="s301">And you know, they have all kind of -- wintertime, we went out and we play with winter things and we have, we can go ice skating too.</span> <span id="s302">So it was very, very nice, very pleasant.</span> <span id="s303">But Saturday after dinner everybody could go home to the parent or visit the parent or something like that, and sometimes we make a play in the orphanage and we would invite the parents and they come.</span> <span id="s304">We invite the parents and they come to hosee how the play.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Now, were the people -- the kids in the orphanage -- were they Christian or Jewish?</span> <span id="s306">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s307">It was just Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Just Jewish.</span> <span id="s309">What were the ages?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: The ages were from six to 14; 13, 14 years.</span> <span id="s311">Q: And how long did you stay in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: I was until the war, 1939, even I was longer.</span> <span id="s313">When I finished the school they find -- summertime and place I was working in an office.</span> <span id="s314">The office, the factory they make all kind office supplies like pens, like all these things, and I was in the office there and this was summertime because my brother was in kolonia, so it was until 1939, until the Germans come in.</span> <span id="s315">When the German come in, so the owner from this company they give it over to peoples.</span> <span id="s316">I think they was swear in or something like that, and they go in.</span> <span id="s317">And when they swear and they go in, every Jew have to go out.</span> <span id="s318">We – I was laid off from there.</span> <span id="s319">And at this time, like I say, I went back to the kolonia -- to the camp because in the wartime the peoples they steal the beds, and the mattress and the all the extras that we have there.</span> <span id="s320">So we call the police and they went with the police, to the houses, and take all the things back.</span> <span id="s321">So when the all the people, all the children going back to Warsaw because they think the school going to start.</span> <span id="s322">So we was three or five still there in the camp to take care of that because we have -- it was a very, very big place.</span> <span id="s323">So this was until maybe -- ‘til 1941.</span> <span id="s324">I remember it was, I remember it was a winter there to take care, and after the Germans come and they make a ghetto for this camp because there was lots of barracks there.</span> <span id="s325">They have like sleeping block.</span> <span id="s326">Block for the boys, sleeping block for the girls, with a very big dining room.</span> <span id="s327">Have a kitchen.</span> <span id="s328">We have a very big washroom, you know, to take showers and all this thing.</span> <span id="s329">And so Germans come in.</span> <span id="s330">They took this away and they make a ghetto.</span> <span id="s331">Because there was in town is called Wawer, and they took all the Jews to put them, and they make a ghetto.</span> <span id="s332">And they started again with the killing there and with the shooting.</span> <span id="s333">All the things.</span> <span id="s334">So I was there a little time.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">01:29:00</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: I'm sorry to stop you, but I want to talk a little bit more about the orphanage before we talk about the ghetto, if you don't mind.</span> <span id="s337">So in the orphanage it sounds like you had a good time?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Very good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Sounds like you had a good time.</span> <span id="s340">And tell me a little bit more about Dr. Korczak.</span> <span id="s341">What was he like?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Dr. Korczak was a terrific man.</span> <span id="s343">He was good.</span> <span id="s344">This man was, I can't describe you.</span> <span id="s345">He didn't have no hair.</span> <span id="s346">He have a little beard.</span> <span id="s347">He was a beautiful, good man.</span> <span id="s348">He was a doctor.</span> <span id="s349">He was a very, very good man, and he kiss everybody.</span> <span id="s350">He was so warm -- is very hard.</span> <span id="s351">Something wonderful, something terrific about this man and I wonder because nobody talk about him.</span> <span id="s352">They make a movie but is far away from what he was really.</span> <span id="s353">He was a doctor -- really, really, really, really, good.</span> <span id="s354">He was like more than a father.</span> <span id="s355">He was a father to 107 and maybe – what do I say -- yes, 107 children -- but you have some teachers there, about 120 peoples.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: It sounds like he was quite a character.</span> <span id="s357">He was going out and getting money.</span> <span id="s358">He was all over the place.</span> <span id="s359">He had Polish friends and Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s361">First of all, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s362">I don't know exactly, but I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s363">The Polish people, they wouldn't accept him like a Jew because his name is -- Korczak is really Polish name -- but his name is, was Henry Goldsmith.</span> <span id="s364">This was his really, really, really name.</span> <span id="s365">And I think he was from a very nice family and he travel very much before the war.</span> <span id="s366">He was in Berlin, he was in Austria and even the German, lots of German know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: How was he able to accomplish all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s369">I can't tell because unique.</span> <span id="s370">He was very, very nice and every time when somebody was sick or what, he was always there.</span> <span id="s371">When we need him he was always</span></p> <p><span id="s372">there.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">01:33:45</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Do you have any other real distinct memories about him like the radio show?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: He was -- I remember once, like I say, he went once with him out in Poland and he had on always his uniform -- because he was major in the army in the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s376">So you have the uniform and I tell him, “Doctor, please, why you put the uniform?</span> <span id="s377">It's so dangerous, it’s so dangerous.</span> <span id="s378">Why you don't take them out?”</span> <span id="s379">He say, “Oh, no, this is my uniform.</span> <span id="s380">I'm a Polish soldier.</span> <span id="s381">I'm going to keep the uniform.”</span> <span id="s382">And I remember when we was in the camp, some Polish people, women, come in and ask for the Doctor, “Doctor, please, my child is sick,” or something like that.</span> <span id="s383">It doesn't make no question what kind, if it's Jew, if it's not Jew.</span> <span id="s384">What happened?</span> <span id="s385">He took -- I remember he had a little, little bag.</span> <span id="s386">He took his little bag.</span> <span id="s387">He went to the people and doesn't charge, doesn't take any money.</span> <span id="s388">Don't take nothing.</span> <span id="s389">I don't think so, for this man he was any difference.</span> <span id="s390">He was -- he don't think any difference if he’s a Jew, if he’s not a Jew -- a human being, a child.</span> <span id="s391">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: I understand he wouldn't wear the Jewish star?</span> <span id="s393">A: Bitte?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: I understand he wouldn't wear a Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: I don't think so, no.</span> <span id="s396">I don’t think so, I don't know if he speak Jewish.</span> <span id="s397">He never -- with other Jewish, if he speak Jewish, he never speak Jewish.</span> <span id="s398">Something like that, he was a human being.</span> <span id="s399">A 150 percent human being.</span> <span id="s400">I don't think so you can find men like that today.</span> <span id="s401">He was...</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Now, you were there for several years until the war?</span> <span id="s403">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And then you left, and at that point were any of your brothers and sisters also in the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s406">It was just my little brother.</span> <span id="s407">He wasn't in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s408">It was just in the vacation and camp there, but not special.</span> <span id="s409">He don't know his name, so they call him “MalyIcek” -- the “Little Icek”.</span> <span id="s410">Because that's -- he was always one month, because, you know, vacation time, like here, they're vacation took two months and one month I was home and he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">13 Small (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Now, you didn't really have to leave during the war because the orphanage stayed together, but were you at an age where you were ready to leave the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s414">Just in the wartime in 1939 I was age, you know, to live there, but I couldn't come every day or once, twice a week to eat no supper, the meals with the friends all together until 1939, until the war.</span> <span id="s415">That's when the war, yes, 1940, until the war.</span> <span id="s416">So they need help because the camp was empty.</span> <span id="s417">Everything was stolen and the children, they was too young to go.</span> <span id="s418">So they ask me if I would, I would and I say, yes, I -- and there was nothing to do there, the school.</span> <span id="s419">We have no more school because the Jews, you couldn't go nowhere.</span> <span id="s420">So I went and I was there and then -- in the camp until the Germans make a ghetto.</span> <span id="s421">And after when they start with all this shooting and all this thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: So you helped out with the orphanage a little bit when you were older?</span> <span id="s423">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Did you make good friends in the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s426">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s427">I have very good friends I have even, yes, a little girlfriend -- very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">She not survive.</span> <span id="s429">She go over, over with Korczak to the oven.</span> <span id="s430">Q: Do you remember what your duties were in the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: My duty, yes.</span> <span id="s432">My duty was after breakfast I have to go and, you know, we have passages between the beds, and I have, I think, two passages to clean, with the broom and the floor was polished.</span> <span id="s433">That was my job and sometimes we change.</span> <span id="s434">So I have to wash the cups in the morning after breakfast, and there was a girl, Ewa Zylberberg, she is no more there.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: She was your girlfriend in the orphanage?</span> <span id="s436">A: Yes, young love.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">01:39:00</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Did the girls have different jobs than the boys or did everybody --</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s442">It depends.</span> <span id="s443">They have to, but most of the girls were working in the clothes shop.</span> <span id="s444">Not the shop but, you know, like to sew the numbers, and sometimes they have, the socks to repair and to see after our clothes.</span> <span id="s445">Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Everybody had numbers on your clothes?</span> <span id="s447">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s448">Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Because not to mix them, because I say I could have maybe 10, 11, 12 years and there was a little one who was six years who was maybe short, too high, so everybody have his clothes.</span> <span id="s451">So when they come from the washing, everybody knows this one was his.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Everybody know there one was his and there was one was hers -- everybody have a number and my number was 46.</span> <span id="s453">So, you know, if you go to take showers you have to change underwear, so the underwear was there.</span> <span id="s454">So I don't want to take somebody else because I know my number is 46.</span> <span id="s455">So I have to take number 46, the socks were 46.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Everything in the -- everything was marked.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Were there other ways in which the girls and the boys were different in the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: There was girl and boys, yes.</span> <span id="s459">There was difference but, you know, we were -- they handled us exactly the same thing.</span> <span id="s460">They have tables, you know, the table -- I think we was six children, I think.</span> <span id="s461">So there was boys and girls together for the breakfast, for lunch or something like that.</span> <span id="s462">They was all together.</span> <span id="s463">There was no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: You just had different jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: We had different jobs.</span> <span id="s466">Even we went to school together, everything.</span> <span id="s467">Even in the same class together.</span> <span id="s468">We was together but, you know, when it was time to go to bed, that's only difference.</span> <span id="s469">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: It sounds like it was a really nice experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: I think it was one of the nice, this time in young.</span> <span id="s472">It was the nicest time, the best time in my life -- this time, you know, if you don't have no war.</span> <span id="s473">We have everything.</span> <span id="s474">We don't have no war.</span> <span id="s475">We have everything -- and you can’t imagine -- something is coming like holidays.</span> <span id="s476">When I say "holidays" the Christian holidays.</span> <span id="s477">So we have -- we receive oranges.</span> <span id="s478">It was something.</span> <span id="s479">You -- this was something in Poland for the war, an orange was something.</span> <span id="s480">You can't dream about that.</span> <span id="s481">And this coming from Israel, you know, from Palestine.</span> <span id="s482">This time it was market; Jaffa oranges, bananas, all kind of fruit.</span> <span id="s483">Was something.</span> <span id="s484">It was amazing.</span> <span id="s485">Nobody can dream about this, in this time and it's as poor who we was.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: How was Korczak able to get the money to do all of this?</span> <span id="s487">01:42:40</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Like I say, this guy, he doesn't rest.</span> <span id="s489">He run the whole days and like I say -- there was very rich people in Poland, in Warsaw, and poor ones too.</span> <span id="s490">Was Jewish people, and they support and I think the Jewish organization from Israel to help him, lots of them.</span> <span id="s491">Because you know Mrs. Stefa Wilczynska, I think she went to Israel.</span> <span id="s492">This was maybe '36 or '37, I don't remember exactly, and the plan was to take all the orphanages, all the children to Israel.</span> <span id="s493">But no time.</span> <span id="s494">And after, when I was there, you know, when the German come into Warsaw, they make a ghetto.</span> <span id="s495">How we come in it, I don't know.</span> <span id="s496">There I was in kolonia but I know it was very, very big problem.</span> <span id="s497">My brothers, my sisters, my mother, she doesn't have food, she doesn’t – nothing to eat absolute nothing.</span> <span id="s498">So when they make the ghetto in the camp.</span> <span id="s499">So I know a man, he was a butcher.</span> <span id="s500">So he come to me and say, “You know what, if you want to make some money, you can earn some money.</span> <span id="s501">Like you have a face nobody can say you a Jew.</span> <span id="s502">You take meat.</span> <span id="s503">You go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s504">You sell the meat.</span> <span id="s505">I give you the address, everything and you have some money.</span> <span id="s506">You help me, you help yourself.</span> <span id="s507">You can help your family.”</span> <span id="s508">So at certain time every day in the morning, about five o'clock in the morning when the first streetcar pass -- because in the ghetto, Warsaw ghetto, it was a streetcar passing by the ghetto, but nobody can go down.</span> <span id="s509">It pass just the ghetto and it was from one Christian side to the other.</span> <span id="s510">Nobody can see go in, because there was police there and they take care.</span> <span id="s511">So I have every day, every day I have my shoulder -- I have in back, and I have meat.</span> <span id="s512">I don't remember exactly, maybe 25 kilo, 30 kilo, and I have, a band with the -- and this one I took it.</span> <span id="s513">I have it in my pocket.</span> <span id="s514">So, he told me, he teach me, he say, “You know you go there and when the streetcar, it pass, it turn to the second street he slowed down, and this time you go down and you go in the house.</span> <span id="s515">You put on your things and you go, and this and this address.</span> <span id="s516">You said it, you’re going to have it.”</span> <span id="s517">But I say, “but the police!”</span> <span id="s518">“So the police – don't worry, the police going to turn his back with the hand behind and you push in some money and doesn't see, doesn't look at you.”</span> <span id="s519">It was to every day, every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: This was the Jewish police or the German police?</span> <span id="s521">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s522">Polish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Polish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Every day I go down and it was very -- at home -- that was nothing to eat, nothing, and I had to help them.</span> <span id="s525">And this one the of the reasons.</span> <span id="s526">That's why I help them I go over this meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">01:46:12</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: So you got on the streetcar?</span> <span id="s529">You took off your armband and you went out to the Polish side to meet with --</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: No.</span> <span id="s531">I go out from the camp.</span> <span id="s532">I was on the Polish side, so I don't have no band.</span> <span id="s533">Off.</span> <span id="s534">I went to the streetcar.</span> <span id="s535">Off.</span> <span id="s536">I pay my streetcar and I have to take in correspondence and second ticket.</span> <span id="s537">And when I come in the street and I take the streetcar, the same streetcar, it pass the ghetto from the other side of the ghetto to the Polish side.</span> <span id="s538">So I go in and the policeman was there with his hand behind his back, I give him some money.</span> <span id="s539">I jump down.</span> <span id="s540">I put my armband and I was a Jew and nobody see.</span> <span id="s541">And when I sold the meat.</span> <span id="s542">I give the meat, I have some money so I could buy something, potatoes or something like that.</span> <span id="s543">I took it home.</span> <span id="s544">I give them and I go out and I wait exactly the same place.</span> <span id="s545">When the streetcar is coming, take off my band, jump on the -- and I was a Polack again.</span> <span id="s546">One day in this ghetto there was a man, a butcher too, he was killing the cattles so he say, “you know, I going to give you” -- I remember very, very, well, “25 zlotys.”</span> <span id="s547">It was very, very, much money -- “when you bring me my knife.”</span> <span id="s548">You know, the man have a special knife to kill.</span> <span id="s549">So I say, “okay.”</span> <span id="s550">You know, young, no brains, I don't see the danger what I going to do.</span> <span id="s551">So he give me the address and when I go down with my meat, I sold the meat.</span> <span id="s552">I go to my mother, give her the money.</span> <span id="s553">So I go in this place and I think he going give me a little knife.</span> <span id="s554">She give me a knife like that, so I say, “I promise, ‘I’m going to do it, I’m going to do it.”</span> <span id="s555">I put the knife -- it was in box -- I put it in here between my shirt and my body.</span> <span id="s556">I put it there and exactly the same thing.</span> <span id="s557">Jump on the streetcar.</span> <span id="s558">But I don't go in the streetcar.</span> <span id="s559">I was just in the front by the driver and when I was there, two Gestapo come out.</span> <span id="s560">They doesn't talk to me.</span> <span id="s561">I don't talk to them.</span> <span id="s562">I was quiet do nothing and I went ‘til the end on the streetcar until the terminus of the streetcar.</span> <span id="s563">And I bring him the knife.</span> <span id="s564">And he was wondering, “How you do that?”</span> <span id="s565">He give me 25 dollars.</span> <span id="s566">You can imagine what this 25 dollars in this days, lots and lots of money.</span> <span id="s567">And when they start, you know, with the Jews and they start to make trouble, and they start to take the Jews to the concentration camps from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s568">And I say “Stop, I have to go.”</span></p> <p><span id="s569">01:49:25 So I run away and I was marching from Warsaw to Plonsk -- that's about 50 kilometers.</span> <span id="s570">There, my older brother was there, my mother was there, and there it doesn't -- was, you know, Poland was split.</span> <span id="s571">The Generalgouvernementand the annexed territory and there was territory – so I want to go there, and I was walking two days and when I arrived there so.</span> <span id="s572">It was okay the first time.</span> <span id="s573">There was no ghetto there and they was living not so very well, but okay.</span> <span id="s574">We was in little room, like here would be ten peoples, but it was okay and I start to work by turpsYou know what turps?</span> <span id="s575">Turps, that's when they take a piece out from the air and when it was dry the people burn that, like coal.</span> <span id="s576">And I was working very, very, very hard when I was working there and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Can I stop you a moment?</span> <span id="s578">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">14 German established administrative territory encompassing portions of Poland that were not incorportated into the Reich after the German invasion of Poland in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">15 turpentine</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: First of all how are we on tape?</span> <span id="s582">I want to make sure we have enough tape.</span> <span id="s583">I want to just go back to the ghetto a minute.</span> <span id="s584">I'm sort of curious about what it was like in the ghetto and how your life changed and how your family lived and what a day was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Oh, God.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: I know it's not a happy memory.</span> <span id="s587">A: First of all, they took all the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Can you start out by just saying in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: In the ghetto, exactly what happened in the ghetto, I can't tell you.</span> <span id="s590">I was not very long in Warsaw in ghetto, but I know everytime -- when I come there, I see people lying outside starving.</span> <span id="s591">The German come in, they laughing, you know, they make all kind of pictures from the poor peoples and it was is very, very hard to explain you.</span> <span id="s592">It's not a life.</span> <span id="s593">The people you have -- the people are dead, all dead.</span> <span id="s594">You don't have nothing there, nothing there.</span> <span id="s595">No food, cold.</span> <span id="s596">Peoples was outside begging you for pieces of bread and some, they have children they go in the past the wall, you know, to the Polish side to take something, to have some potatoes and when they was chased from the Germans, they kill them, they shoot them, I -- you know, I can't explain to you.</span> <span id="s597">I can't explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">01:52:40</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Did you ever see this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I saw, yes.</span> <span id="s601">I remember once like I said, you know, one time I have my meat on my back and I have to go, and I couldn't go down because they have a German soldier, German gendarme was in the tram.</span> <span id="s602">I couldn't go down.</span> <span id="s603">I have to go ‘til the other side.</span> <span id="s604">When I arrived there it was just in cemetery, in Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s605">To go to the ghetto, I have to pass the cemetery and I arrive in the middle from the cemetery.</span> <span id="s606">They start to shoot.</span> <span id="s607">I hear, you know with the machine gun, and I was there.</span> <span id="s608">So I said, “Now is finished.”</span> <span id="s609">So, you know in this time there was so many dead people, because by the Jews you have no right to make the grave before you have the body at the cemetery and the preparer of the holes.</span> <span id="s610">One thing that I have to do is I have to jump there and I have lie the whole night between two deads -- and I hear what the shooting, what the machine guns around and they was walking over my head.</span> <span id="s611">So you can imagine.</span> <span id="s612">It was the whole night there in this hole.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Should we stop and change tape?</span> <span id="s614">01:54:12</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s616">02:00:39</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s618">So let's just talk a little bit more about the conditions and in the ghetto and the structure of it.</span> <span id="s619">What was going on with the Jewish council and the Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: It was the Jewish police to take care and sometimes they make -- they took the peoples go out from the ghetto, you know, with the Germans to work.</span> <span id="s621">All kind of work.</span> <span id="s622">Like wintertime to clean the snow, clean the highways and all kind of things like that.</span> <span id="s623">And sometimes they took them to work, you know, to make the uniforms for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">But there was nobody have the chance to have something and it was very, very, very, hard in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s625">In the street and every place, you have dead peoples, and peoples begging.</span> <span id="s626">It was, you know, horrible to see.</span> <span id="s627">Really is very, very hard to explain.</span> <span id="s628">It's just -- I can't believe that I passed there.</span> <span id="s629">I saw all this.</span> <span id="s630">It's no human nature can see this.</span> <span id="s631">You know, I saw lots of things but it was, it's really terrible.</span> <span id="s632">I can't understand, you know, because the Germans they are cultivated people and they couldn't do things like that.</span> <span id="s633">I can't understand it.</span> <span id="s634">I can’t, I can't understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">02:02:20</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Were there activities going on?</span> <span id="s637">Was there any semblance of real life in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s638">Was there music?</span> <span id="s639">Was there school?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Yes, school.</span> <span id="s641">Nobody school, you know, when sometimes you have the teachers, the Jewish teachers were teaching in the school before the war.</span> <span id="s642">They're teaching their own children.</span> <span id="s643">They can do that for nothing.</span> <span id="s644">Nobody want to pay.</span> <span id="s645">And every time when the Jewish community, the community when the German make and they’re always -- they ask for money and they ask the peoples to work and they send the peoples, you know, to the different camps to break the stones to make highways, and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s646">Because the Germans, they was the was the worst.</span> <span id="s647">The work -- they need the uniforms.</span> <span id="s648">They need everything, so the Jews was very cheap labor.</span> <span id="s649">So they took the peoples and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Sometimes, I remember, my brother tell me once he was – they took him in school, in a big school, and they give him brush, teeth brush to wash the floors.</span> <span id="s651">And there was the ladies’ room, they have to take off pants and to clean it.</span> <span id="s652">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">02:03:47</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Now, weren't there also more secretive activities going on?</span> <span id="s655">Weren't there youth organization and schools and cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s657">You have sometimes, but you need money for clubs.</span> <span id="s658">We have some clubs.</span> <span id="s659">We have some singers.</span> <span id="s660">We have some players.</span> <span id="s661">But you need money to get in.</span> <span id="s662">Where you going to take the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: So there wasn't so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: There was nothing, most of nothing.</span> <span id="s665">It was very hard for the living, very hard.</span> <span id="s666">And after they start to evacuate the ghetto, to take to Majdanek, to Treblinka, and the peoples they start to know they kill these people.</span> <span id="s667">So it was the ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s668">Maybe you remember.</span> <span id="s669">Maybe you hear about that.</span> <span id="s670">It was too something terrible and this people inside, they begging outside they ask to help.</span> <span id="s671">They ask the Russian, they a and the American, they ask the German.</span> <span id="s672">I think the English to help to send some weapons, send some ammunition.</span> <span id="s673">Nothing is coming, absolute nothing, nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s674">So what they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">They kill out -- they killed everybody and they burn.</span> <span id="s676">The whole ghetto was destroyed.</span> <span id="s677">Everything was destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">02:05:27</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: But there were youth organizations that were involved in the resistance there?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: The youth organizations doesn’t help us with absolute nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: There was --</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: They couldn't help.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: It didn't work, but there was resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: There was Resistance, yes, and the underground too, but the underground was from the Polish people, and some people, some Jews, they was escaped from the ghetto, escape from the uprising.</span> <span id="s685">They went to the partisans, you know.</span> <span id="s686">And that's all, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Well, there was also resistance within the ghetto?</span> <span id="s688">A: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: There was also resistance effort inside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Inside the ghetto, but not in this time.</span> <span id="s691">It was when they start to evacuate this ghetto because nobody, nobody can imagine they going to send peoples -- they going to burn their whole family.</span> <span id="s692">They are going to kill their whole family, and the killing going on and going on and going on, until they come, until to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s693">There was the uprising, but what could they help?</span> <span id="s694">They had nothing, no rifles, no absolute nothing.</span> <span id="s695">They have little bit, but absolute nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Now, I think we were talking about this off camera, so I just want to make sure you say this for the record, that where was your family and where were you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: I just want you to say what you told me for the record, which was essentially, that your family was in the ghetto, you, one of the youngest, were out doing things.</span> <span id="s699">How did all of this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: You know, when we was in shelter after, when the Germans come in, and because the apartment we was living was burned up.</span> <span id="s701">We had absolute nothing.</span> <span id="s702">So we went to the bath house and we find a shelter, but when the Germans come in we have to move from there to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s703">I was with Korczak at this time.</span> <span id="s704">This was in 1940, '41, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: You need to explain to us that you were no longer really in the orphanage at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">You were at --</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: You were at the summer camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: At this time I was -- this was in summer.</span> <span id="s710">I think in summertime they move from Warsaw to the camp.</span> <span id="s711">And they ask me, too, if I want to go to the camp.</span> <span id="s712">I say, “yeah,” because I didn’t have nothing to do there, and they start the ghetto in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s713">All the Jews have to go to the ghetto – towards the ghetto, and this time even my mother say, “What you going to do here?</span> <span id="s714">Go to camp.”</span> <span id="s715">I went to camp and how to come to the ghetto, I don't know.</span> <span id="s716">I know once, you know, they give me the address.</span> <span id="s717">I knew they was in the ghetto and there was very, very bad situation.</span> <span id="s718">Very bad situation.</span> <span id="s719">They was hungry.</span> <span id="s720">They have nothing to eat, and “this,” I decide “this time.”</span> <span id="s721">So I have possibility to help them and this was my opportunity to help them, risk my life to help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: And this was because you were outside of the ghetto?</span> <span id="s723">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: But you moved pretty freely between the ghetto and outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s725">You seemed to get back and forth pretty well.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s727">I have to go and I was feeling very angry because I saw the Polish people, the Polish boys in my age they running free.</span> <span id="s728">They eating.</span> <span id="s729">They have everything, and I have to hiding myself all over.</span> <span id="s730">Take care.</span> <span id="s731">Doesn't talk, doesn't speak, doesn't go nowhere.</span> <span id="s732">You keep yourself.</span> <span id="s733">You just -- you know, because don’t forget one thing, “You a Jew, you a Jew, you don’t have no right to live.”</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Did you pretend you weren't a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">02:10:00</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: I pretend I wasn't a Jew, but one thing I know.</span> <span id="s737">I say to myself, “If this was finished, I don't want to be any more a Jew.</span> <span id="s738">I don't know why they hate me.</span> <span id="s739">I don't do nothing.</span> <span id="s740">I can't understand.</span> <span id="s741">I don't want to -- I want to be free.</span> <span id="s742">I want to eat.</span> <span id="s743">I want a piece of bread like everybody.</span> <span id="s744">I don't want to hate you.”</span> <span id="s745">This was in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: This is while you were still a boy before the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Before the concentration camp -- maybe not.</span> <span id="s748">When I escaped from Warsaw, I went, you know, to my family.</span> <span id="s749">There I know there was Jew.</span> <span id="s750">It was hard for me too, sometimes I think about not to be Jew, but I born a Jew, I couldn't help it.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: So when you were helping your family, they were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s752">You were on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">When you were on the outside, did you talk to people, did you pretend you weren't a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: I don't talk to nobody.</span> <span id="s755">I was scared, very scared, you know.</span> <span id="s756">Each time, if somebody recognize me or what, because first of all, with the meat.</span> <span id="s757">Second, if a Jew, they kill me -- they kill me one hundred per cent.</span> <span id="s758">Not scared – yes, I was scared but it was, I say, look, like what they can do to me?</span> <span id="s759">Kill me, that’s it.</span> <span id="s760">Not kill, but hang me?</span> <span id="s761">That's it, you know.</span> <span id="s762">Because they say if you’re a Jew, a bullet too expensive.</span> <span id="s763">I couldn't help.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Did you ever spend much time in the Warsaw ghetto?</span> <span id="s765">A: Every time a couple hours, but really long time, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Was there any sort of confinement or ghetto up at Rose Camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: No.</span> <span id="s768">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s769">One thing, I was very happy when I went out.</span> <span id="s770">I feel a little bit, I'm free a little bit, but outside.</span> <span id="s771">But inside, you know, my heart was beating very, very -- every time when I was in gendarme -- in the German gendarme I said, “Oh!</span> <span id="s772">You finished, you finished.”</span> <span id="s773">Like the same thing when I have the knife in my back and why I go on this streetcar.</span> <span id="s774">Just the two Gestapo come in, and I don't want to say they followed me, but in the way – they went in the same way that I was.</span> <span id="s775">Believe me, you know, if I'm today alive, I don't have a heart attack this time, oh, I was very, very strong.</span> <span id="s776">So when I come in I give him this knife.</span> <span id="s777">I say to myself, “If I can do that, I can do something else.”</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: I thought you said there was a ghetto up at the camp also.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s780">So I was there and so, you know, they have some peoples in the ghetto, but</span></p> <p><span id="s781">16 Kolonia Rózyczka they have family in Warsaw and they was young peoples, and they ask me if I want to bring them to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s782">And I say, “Look, I can’t go.”</span> <span id="s783">So I go with this peoples.</span> <span id="s784">They pay me but it doesn't pay very much.</span> <span id="s785">They pay me just, you know, they pay me just a dinner or something like just for survival, but nothing special.</span> <span id="s786">I make it because I can help.</span> <span id="s787">But nothing special.</span> <span id="s788">But to understand this, that the shooting and the killing there and my family was already dead.</span> <span id="s789">As I say, “Stop, is enough, you have to run away from here.”</span> <span id="s790">So I go away and, you know, it was about 70 kilometers.</span> <span id="s791">I went there and I was wandering two days without food, because when I come on the border, was -- on one side was the Polish police, and on the other side was the German police and, “Halt, where are you going?”</span> <span id="s792">“I go working to the farm to keep the potatoes,” because it was not me alone, but some Polish people did traveling, too.</span> <span id="s793">So I listen to him.</span> <span id="s794">I say, “I go for the potato.”</span> <span id="s795">So, “I go for the potato” and I was a young boy, so they let me pass.</span> <span id="s796">And I have some couple money.</span> <span id="s797">They took away the money but I don't care.</span> <span id="s798">I went, and we have to pass a bridge and I say, just two Germans gendarmes.</span> <span id="s799">And they go just to me, and I say “Ay, ay, two gendarmes, it’s finished with you.”</span> <span id="s800">But behind me was an old woman with a little boy and they stopped the woman, and I pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">02:15:40 And I come on the road and it was two gendarmes and they threw out a family from this house -- maybe they want to take the house -- and they threw out and they say “Hey, come here.”</span> <span id="s802">And they say, “help,” and I help these people to put on the wagon.</span> <span id="s803">And I remember it, was a bread, a big, big bread and the bread fell down and the hard side fell down.</span> <span id="s804">So I take the hard side, I put it in my jacket and -- because eight days I don’t eat no piece of bread -- and I help them, but this piece I hide for me.</span> <span id="s805">And I sit on the wagon and they bring me to a little point because they turn and I have to go straight and I go straight.</span> <span id="s806">And I go to the farm and I ask, “Maybe you have place to sleep?”</span> <span id="s807">So it's an old farm.</span> <span id="s808">They say, “Look, I have one place but here you can sleep -- there is a lady laying in bed -- if you want.”</span> <span id="s809">So the lady in one side and I was on the other side.</span> <span id="s810">The whole night I eat this bread.</span> <span id="s811">The next day, in the morning, I say, “off.”</span> <span id="s812">I go to the town and I was in the family.</span> <span id="s813">But in certain time the peoples from this town, they need papers.</span> <span id="s814">I don't have no papers and the paper was, you know, the fingerprint and this one is the Bloody Sunday.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">The Gestapo come in, in this town and they throw out -- everybody have to go out, and they start to control the papers.</span> <span id="s816">I don't have no papers.</span> <span id="s817">My brother doesn't have papers.</span> <span id="s818">If he don't have no papers, so they have to start to hit the stakes over the head, over the back, all over.</span> <span id="s819">Because if you don't have paper, you have to go on this side.</span> <span id="s820">If you are going to see my brother – he has here, on his lip, was open from hitting him.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: This is the town of Plonsk,</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Plonsk, yes.</span> <span id="s823">And they put us and they going to ask you for the bloody Sunday.</span> <span id="s824">I'm going to tell you about this.</span> <span id="s825">They put everyone on a field.</span> <span id="s826">I don't know, maybe a thousand peoples, on one field and we stay there two nights, one night or two nights, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s827">And they put us in a camp.</span> <span id="s828">They will call Pomiechówek and this was a really death camp.</span> <span id="s829">And there we was, I think, six week.</span> <span id="s830">I can't explain the trouble what they have there.</span> <span id="s831">It was those barracks, stone barracks and was so many peoples.</span> <span id="s832">We have to lay down on the floors like the herring, you know, in the tins.</span> <span id="s833">If one want to turn, everybody have to turn.</span> <span id="s834">Soon it was dark until morning.</span> <span id="s835">You have to stay there.</span> <span id="s836">It was very, very hard, but one thing it was not German, I think, it was Germans but it was the SA.</span> <span id="s837">Maybe you hear about SA -- Sturmabteilung-- that's when the Germans with war, the brown shirts and with the HakenkreuzIt was very, very bad peoples.</span> <span id="s838">There was, there was Volksdeutscheit was most of the Polacks, but there was maybe Germans, I don't know what kind.</span> <span id="s839">It was very, very bad and they was very bad peoples.</span> <span id="s840">They hit us.</span> <span id="s841">We don't have no food.</span> <span id="s842">And I can't explain what kind of trouble what -- I don't know how we survived there.</span> <span id="s843">There was hundred and hundred of people and, you know, we couldn't have no washroom, nothing.</span> <span id="s844">So they make a grave in hole with a stake and everybody, women, men all together, we have to go there, if we need to go.</span> <span id="s845">And sometimes a passing German push in.</span> <span id="s846">I can't explain.</span> <span id="s847">And was always one, he pass in the barrack and tell, “You stay up!”</span> <span id="s848">When you stay up is okay.</span> <span id="s849">When you kind of stay up so fast, so he have, “You sick.</span> <span id="s850">Take out to kill.”</span> <span id="s851">And they shoot every day, every day, you hear the guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">They shoot these people something terrible.</span> <span id="s853">And my little brother, Erwin he was there, but he escaped.</span> <span id="s854">And how I come out from there, I don't know.</span> <span id="s855">I don't know, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s856">I know once my brother told me I was sick.</span> <span id="s857">I had typhus and all these people that have typhus they have to be killed.</span> <span id="s858">And I remember one time I was laying on the outside to wait until they going to shoot me.</span> <span id="s859">So I know once my brother, the oldest one, come and take me on his shoulder and put me in a wagon.</span> <span id="s860">They run away and they pass, and we have to go, they send us back to Warsaw to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s861">Before coming to Warsaw to the pass the, the front, they make a big fire, and all these people have to pass this fire.</span> <span id="s862">The other side there was the ghetto, the free, but we have to pass this fire.</span> <span id="s863">We have so many -- you feel it.</span> <span id="s864">You pass on the people that first down.</span> <span id="s865">They couldn't survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: You went through the fire?</span> <span id="s867">A: Through the fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: It was a big fire?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Was a big fire and my brother, I don't remember, but my brother told me because we pass.</span> <span id="s870">I know I have smell the burn, smell the burn.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: So you had to walk through this fire to get to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Walk the fire, pass the fire to go in the ghetto, back to the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s873">And when we arrived in the Warsaw ghetto, I don't remember exactly what happened, but once I was 17 storm troopers (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s874">18 Swastika (German) 19 ethnic German (German) laying on the floor, and I was in a hospital and they wash myself and they put me in a bed in the hospital.</span> <span id="s875">And there was maybe one or two days and I start to cry, because they put somebody in the bed with me.</span> <span id="s876">And so there was a nurse come in and she ask me, “Why you crying?”</span> <span id="s877">So I say, “I don't know, they put somebody in maybe he have typhus.</span> <span id="s878">I’m going to have too.”</span> <span id="s879">So she say, “What you think what are?”</span> <span id="s880">and they let me there a couple days.</span> <span id="s881">A couple days, maybe one week, and when I was already health more, so I went out and I remember it was just a wagon come in with stones.</span> <span id="s882">The men, they ask me, “Hey, you want to help me to put down the stones?”</span> <span id="s883">I say, “yes.”</span> <span id="s884">They give me 50 cent and I buy pickle, a sour pickle.</span> <span id="s885">And I found my brother.</span> <span id="s886">We don't have no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">We don't have no place to sleep.</span> <span id="s888">We don't have no money.</span> <span id="s889">Absolute nothing.</span> <span id="s890">So my brother told me, “What you going to do?”</span> <span id="s891">So, you know, in Poland in the houses there was the stoves and they have in the ovens, they have the doors.</span> <span id="s892">There was like a cup and the houses that was destroyed.</span> <span id="s893">So we took that and we sold it.</span> <span id="s894">We have some money.</span> <span id="s895">We pay a guy – and we go out from the ghetto and we have just enough to pay to buy a bread, because we want to go back to the same town where my mother and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: And this is Plonsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s898">And we have just enough money to buy a bread, but from there we have to pass a bridge to the station and from the station we have to take a little train to, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s899">And this town a little bit closer to Plonsk.</span> <span id="s900">So we go to the, into the train.</span> <span id="s901">We have already tickets -- no.</span> <span id="s902">There was -- we was waiting outside because the train -- somebody come I don't know, it was a Polack, I don't remember, a woman or a man – and she say, “Don't go in because they can recognize you, you a Jew and they going to send you back or they going to arrest you.”</span> <span id="s903">So I say, “But we want to go.”</span> <span id="s904">So he or she, I don’t remember, “Give me your money.</span> <span id="s905">I will go buy tickets.”</span> <span id="s906">So we give him the money and he buy tickets for us and we have the tickets.</span> <span id="s907">We go in the train.</span> <span id="s908">We sit on the train and this train start to go.</span> <span id="s909">So he’s coming, the control man for the ticket, so he looks, “Are you Jews?</span> <span id="s910">I going to call the Gestapo.”</span> <span id="s911">So I start to cry, “Why you going to call the Gestapo?</span> <span id="s912">We don't do nothing.</span> <span id="s913">We want to go.”</span> <span id="s914">“No, no, you Jews.</span> <span id="s915">You don't have the right to go.</span> <span id="s916">You don't have the right to be here.”</span> <span id="s917">So I say, “What can I do?”</span> <span id="s918">So he say, “Pay me.”</span> <span id="s919">So I say, “What can I pay you?</span> <span id="s920">We don't have no money.</span> <span id="s921">We don’t have nothing.”</span> <span id="s922">One thing my brother say, “Maybe you going to give him a gown.”</span> <span id="s923">I remember I had a gown for my sister, a nightgown.</span> <span id="s924">So I tell him, “Look, I have a nightgown.</span> <span id="s925">If you want to, I give you the nightgown.”</span> <span id="s926">He said, “yes.”</span> <span id="s927">I have to go to the end train, take out the nightgown and give him the nightgown.</span> <span id="s928">So, he let us go.</span> <span id="s929">So we went a couple miles and we go down.</span> <span id="s930">We don't have no money.</span> <span id="s931">We don't have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s932">We have to live.</span> <span id="s933">We have to do something.</span> <span id="s934">So actually, you know what, we go here we go begging.</span> <span id="s935">So I took to the house and somebody give us some beets.</span> <span id="s936">So we have beets.</span> <span id="s937">We eat the beets and we sleep outside.</span> <span id="s938">And we stay and we go again, and they stay and we go again.</span> <span id="s939">This time we walking again.</span> <span id="s940">We want to go to this town and it's very hard.</span> <span id="s941">It's not so easy, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: You’re walking to this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: How far is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: About 70 kilometers and we was running with the train, maybe 10 or 15 kilometers.</span> <span id="s946">But there was somebody.</span> <span id="s947">He make travel past the peoples.</span> <span id="s948">So we ask him, maybe he want to travel, to help us to travel.</span> <span id="s949">So he say, “Yes, but you have to pay me.”</span> <span id="s950">But we have nothing.</span> <span id="s951">So I remember when I was in camp I receive a pair of boots from UNRRAor the Jewish Committee-- I don't remember.</span> <span id="s952">So I say, “You know, that I have boots.</span> <span id="s953">I can give you -- you take my boots.”</span> <span id="s954">And we past there.</span> <span id="s955">And we was together certain time and after they took us to the concentration camp, so they start there with the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s956">Exactly the same thing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">02:28:07</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Now this Bloody Sunday in Plonsk, going back a little bit.</span> <span id="s959">Did this take place in a lot of towns at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s961">I know it take place -- one second, I think it take in two or three places in Plonsk and it was a couple kilometers was in town, the same thing, the same thing.</span> <span id="s962">That’s the Bloody Sunday.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Is it unusual that you went from ghetto to a camp then back to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s964">Is that unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Because generally when the people leave the ghetto they leave for good, right?</span> <span id="s967">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: You were very resourceful.</span> <span id="s969">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: You were very resourceful.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: What can I do?</span> <span id="s972">I have to.</span> <span id="s973">I can't help.</span> <span id="s974">And then after when we was the last ghetto the last time.</span> <span id="s975">So, you know, the propaganda was from the German and they say, “Don't worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">The oldest people, your old people, you're going to work.”</span> <span id="s977">This was the propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">20 United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration 21 American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee “Took what you can, warm clothes most important.</span> <span id="s979">Took it to a Jew and you're going to work, okay?</span> <span id="s980">The youngest people, they are going to work.</span> <span id="s981">The older people they're going to keep the children and the household.”</span> <span id="s982">So this was the reason.</span> <span id="s983">Most the Jewish people, they go, but nobody can imagine -- but when, you know, they going die it was already too late.</span> <span id="s984">They're already there.</span> <span id="s985">They couldn't help.</span> <span id="s986">So first I know when they start to send tickets.</span> <span id="s987">“This family, this family, this family.”</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s989">Were you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: In Plonsk.</span> <span id="s991">Now, I told you Warsaw was already liquidated.</span> <span id="s992">It wasn't completely liquidated but is started.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: What year do you think this was?</span> <span id="s994">A: This was 1941, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: But was Warsaw ghetto wasn't liquidated that early, I don't think.</span> <span id="s996">A: They start, I think, but the uprising was in, I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: '43.</span> <span id="s999">So they start -- first of all, in Warsaw, there was a big ghetto.</span> <span id="s1000">There was lots of people and there lots of Jews was working for the Germans and the factories, like the tailors for the uniform.</span> <span id="s1001">And so this when they start already to evacuate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">02:31:12</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: To evacuate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: And to evacuate it.</span> <span id="s1005">And first one -- the policy from the Germans they say, “Why do we have to kill them?</span> <span id="s1006">They are going to kill themselves.”</span> <span id="s1007">And that's true.</span> <span id="s1008">The people starving on the streets, no food.</span> <span id="s1009">In the wintertime the people was freezing completely, dead freezing, dead.</span> <span id="s1010">They have nothing.</span> <span id="s1011">So they don't care.</span> <span id="s1012">So they just to help so they evacuated to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1013">And Treblinka, soon they come in and the older people, the woman, the older men and children, they put them on the trucks.</span> <span id="s1014">The trucks come into the crematorium to say, “You go to bath.</span> <span id="s1015">You going to take a shower.”</span> <span id="s1016">But the shower is gas.</span> <span id="s1017">That's it.</span> <span id="s1018">And there in Plonsk they start to send people to get this family and this family and that family.</span> <span id="s1019">They have to be at this time and that time, and that time they have to be at the station.</span> <span id="s1020">On the grand Platzwas the place they have to be there.</span> <span id="s1021">At this time my mother and the younger brother and the two sisters -- my sisters receive the paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">My brother and I were supposed to stay there, but -- and they took them back.</span> <span id="s1023">So after,</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">22 plaza (German) you know, he’s coming, an officer and he say, “Who want to go to have place?</span> <span id="s1025">Who want to go?”</span> <span id="s1026">So, I say to my brother, “What they going to do here?”</span> <span id="s1027">The ghetto was -- this town was three-quarter empty.</span> <span id="s1028">“What we going to do?</span> <span id="s1029">Come, we're going to work.</span> <span id="s1030">Come we're going, too.”</span> <span id="s1031">So we going and this was when the family was together.</span> <span id="s1032">My mother, sister, my little brother was together until they send us to Auschwitz and this took, I think, three or four days just traveling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: What was it like on that train ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: We was packed.</span> <span id="s1035">Peoples was crying, you know, packed.</span> <span id="s1036">No food, no water.</span> <span id="s1037">Absolute nothing.</span> <span id="s1038">But the one chance it was in, I think, in fall, so it doesn’t was very hot.</span> <span id="s1039">So you don't feel this so thirsty like in summertime and that helped, a lot.</span> <span id="s1040">So we arrived, I remember we arrived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1041">It was at night or very early in the morning, and when we go out from the trains they start to beating and to shoot.</span> <span id="s1042">So I say to my brother, I say, “Come, we have to go fast so we don't be beat.”</span> <span id="s1043">So we was all together and he is coming, the German, and they start, “Men, and women on the other side.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">02:34:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: I'm sorry, may I stop you?</span> <span id="s1046">I want to hear a little bit more about the trip on the train.</span> <span id="s1047">It took several days.</span> <span id="s1048">Did you know where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1050">We know we want to go to work.</span> <span id="s1051">And when we went in the train, so, I think, I was young, but I think peoples in mind couldn't imagine this finish.</span> <span id="s1052">We go to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Had you had any information on the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: No, we didn't have -- like I say nothing.</span> <span id="s1055">They say always, “Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1056">Everything be fine.</span> <span id="s1057">You go to work.”</span> <span id="s1058">But when we was on the train, the train was blocked, nobody can open.</span> <span id="s1059">But now it was too late.</span> <span id="s1060">But for me, I don’t know, I couldn't believe, could happen things like that.</span> <span id="s1061">So I say to myself, “They told us, we going to work, okay?</span> <span id="s1062">We're going to work.”</span> <span id="s1063">But who couldn't believe from, we know.</span> <span id="s1064">Every day the German was a very polite people.</span> <span id="s1065">The German was very [unintelligible] people.</span> <span id="s1066">Who couldn't imagine.</span> <span id="s1067">They imagine and kill machine like that.</span> <span id="s1068">It's impossible.</span> <span id="s1069">But then we go to -- when we arrive in Auschwitz and they separate men and women, children with women.</span> <span id="s1070">So I say, “Oh, this smell not good.”</span> <span id="s1071">And coming Mengeleand he come in and he start, “Men” -- all like the young men, like I and my brother, healthy, from the regular to the bigger – so “right.”</span> <span id="s1072">“Left” and my little brother have to go the women.</span> <span id="s1073">And like I say, I was feel like something wrong.</span> <span id="s1074">So we was there and we was the first of the first, because I say, always you have to be careful not to be beaten.</span> <span id="s1075">If not, they kill you with stakes, with pipes, with rubber, with all this thing?</span> <span id="s1076">So I he come and, you know, the German was like that.</span> <span id="s1077">He was tall.</span> <span id="s1078">He jumped between his legs and come in my side, and I was there with a friend - 23 Josef Mengele (1911-1978?)</span> <span id="s1079">, German doctor and SS officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">- my, my friend live today, is in Toronto-- they lift him little bit and he started to look, start to -- it's too late.</span> <span id="s1081">They don't see him and we was together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">02:37:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: So you were able to have your little brother come with you?</span> <span id="s1084">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Now, how did you know this was Dr. Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: I recognize him after because he came to our camp.</span> <span id="s1087">I saw him many time because when I was already in camp, they make selection, you know, about selection.</span> <span id="s1088">Yeah, the one have to die.</span> <span id="s1089">The one have to go to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1090">So we have to unclothed, take out the clothes and we have to pass like in barrack and the barrack was -- it doors.</span> <span id="s1091">There was two doors.</span> <span id="s1092">One there was no the block, the chief block and they have to get the prisoners first in the second, so it was to the -- so we have to go out from one door and down, and Mengele was there and we pass by him and he look at you, and the chief on the block, you have -- a card -- you don't have no names.</span> <span id="s1093">We have just a number and he have the card, you know, and we pass.</span> <span id="s1094">So I know.</span> <span id="s1095">I see him many times and peoples out there, they know him before, “this one is Dr. Mengele,” and so...</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: So you got off the train and there was a lot of shouting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: A lot of shouting and separation and crying and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s1098">And after you pull together and after we went on march to Auschwitz and went into concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1099">From the station in Auschwitz we went to concentration.</span> <span id="s1100">The first thing that we saw, you know, they bring us just on the wires, electrified wire, doubled wires, and we saw some people hanging on, so he say, “You see that?</span> <span id="s1101">In case somebody want to escape, he going to have exactly the same thing.”</span> <span id="s1102">So they put us, you know -- first, there was outside many couple hours.</span> <span id="s1103">After we have to take off our clothes.</span> <span id="s1104">We went to the barber to cut the hair completely, and showers.</span> <span id="s1105">After the showers we have to go to the room.</span> <span id="s1106">And they make the numbers, and they made the numbers, you know, the numbers with little point and they, I don't know what with, a pen or something like that.</span> <span id="s1107">And they make the numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">02:40:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Did it hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1111">But a couple days later it was okay.</span> <span id="s1112">Q: Did you still think you were going to work?</span> <span id="s1113">A: To work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Did you still think the reason you were going there was just to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: At this time, no.</span> <span id="s1116">At this time I thought I was finished.</span> <span id="s1117">This time I was finished and the peoples, you know, because it was -- already people was prisoners in Auschwitz and this I always say, “Don't think you go some place to work.</span> <span id="s1118">Once you can go, you see the chimney there?”</span> <span id="s1119">We saw the chimney -- the smell, the smell.</span> <span id="s1120">“This what I told you.</span> <span id="s1121">See the chimney?</span> <span id="s1122">That's where the crematorium.”</span> <span id="s1123">The first time, I didn't know what he mean and he, “burn the people.”</span> <span id="s1124">And so I ask, “Burn alive?”</span> <span id="s1125">And he said, “No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1126">First, all the people go in the gas chamber and from the gas chamber they go in there.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Now what year was that?</span> <span id="s1128">A: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: What year do you think this was?</span> <span id="s1130">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Do you think this was about 19--</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: What year?</span> <span id="s1133">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1134">It was beginning '42, I think, beginning '42.</span> <span id="s1135">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1137">So after you're showered then you're tattooed and you're with your brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: The two brothers, yes.</span> <span id="s1139">And we still together.</span> <span id="s1140">No food, nothing.</span> <span id="s1141">And we have to go to the tailor room with the numbers and they give us numbers to put on.</span> <span id="s1142">They give us the uniform.</span> <span id="s1143">Some uniform is too long, too short, and they took away the shoes.</span> <span id="s1144">They give you some wood shoes, and here was some stuff, tissue, and wood shoes, they are very, very hard to walk.</span> <span id="s1145">And one moment we lose my brother, the older one.</span> <span id="s1146">The little one is still with me.</span> <span id="s1147">And we was there in Auschwitz about three days, I don't remember exactly how long.</span> <span id="s1148">It

Farben industry they make was at least one million of workers.</span> <span id="s1325">We was in the concentration camp already, I don't know exactly, maybe 12 or 15,000, but you have and -- after this coming all the prisoners from war, from the English people, the American soldiers, the French sol-- you know they -- what was the prisoner from the war.</span> <span id="s1326">There was -- they have on the back marked “PY,” prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s1327">There was two there so, you know, this work, it was already -- I don't want to easy, but it was a little bit easy.</span> <span id="s1328">And at this time I was already an old prisoner so I know the rules.</span> <span id="s1329">So I don't want to work.</span> <span id="s1330">It's too hard and I think sometimes in my mind I say myself, “The world have to finish once.</span> <span id="s1331">Maybe, we going to be free or maybe we going to be dead.”</span> <span id="s1332">So I say, “I have to try to survive long as I can so I try not to work too much.”</span> <span id="s1333">And I become in a KommandoA Kommando, that mean every prisoner was to the Kommando, and Kommando does what kind of work?</span> <span id="s1334">Some people was electricians, painters, was builders, was carpenters and I was younger this time, so I don't have no trade.</span> <span id="s1335">So I have a Kapoyou know, the Kapo.</span> <span id="s1336">That mean it was he organize, not organize but he take care on a certain group of people for the work, like a manager for work.</span> <span id="s1337">So I ask him, “Maybe you want to take me to your job,” because it was not so hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">34 eastern worker (German); forced laborer from Eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">35

specialist, you know, the work was already little bit easy.</span> <span id="s1343">First off all, I don't have to carry nothing but, you know, sometimes we have a pliers.</span> <span id="s1344">Sometimes, you have a case and box with tools or little wire or little cable, and even when we have to pull cables there was a special Kommando, Kommando nine and they pull the cables, and there was that Kommando.</span> <span id="s1345">There the peoples not survive no longer than four, five weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Because it was very hard.</span> <span id="s1348">First, they were big cable and it was hard and they were very big.</span> <span id="s1349">And the Kapo was very bad man.</span> <span id="s1350">He was from Austria.</span> <span id="s1351">But I never want to go.</span> <span id="s1352">I take care always not to fall in, in this Kommando because that finished.</span> <span id="s1353">So I in was Kommando 128.</span> <span id="s1354">It was very -- not easy, but it was easy.</span> <span id="s1355">And one day the chief of -- the German chief come in and I was working with two Polish guys.</span> <span id="s1356">They was in concentration camp too.</span> <span id="s1357">But they was okay.</span> <span id="s1358">So I was the helper.</span> <span id="s1359">I have to help them.</span> <span id="s1360">I was carry tools.</span> <span id="s1361">I was carry the box and they was my chiefs, my managers.</span> <span id="s1362">So the chief come in and say “Look, you have to go in this, this place, you have to connect the cable to 4000 volt.”</span> <span id="s1363">I remember very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">03:06:12 So it was in, Tadek and we have to go there.</span> <span id="s1365">And it was a big cable and there was a box, you know, for the fuses and it was the long fuse.</span> <span id="s1366">And on the top there was power and on the end there was no power, because you have to put the fuse and you have to connect this cable.</span> <span id="s1367">So we put the cable in this box and he say, “You know, what?</span> <span id="s1368">I'm going to push him.</span> <span id="s1369">You push in and you make the screws and we’ll be okay.”</span> <span id="s1370">And so, he was stronger for me, and after the cable I screw a little bit.</span> <span id="s1371">Not so much because I was not so strong like him.</span> <span id="s1372">So he say, “You know what?</span> <span id="s1373">Now, you come lift little bit the cable.</span> <span id="s1374">I’m going to screw.”</span> <span id="s1375">So I have -- the box was big -- I have my face always in the box and I keep this cable.</span> <span id="s1376">And he took a key, a metal key and turned the nuts, you know, to close it very fast.</span> <span id="s1377">And in the middle it turned and placed from down to up and from up to down, and it make a short and there was a flame and I have it all, everything in my face.</span> <span id="s1378">The whole face was burned and he have, you know, split his hand and I think I was burning, so I wipe up and I take out all this meat, all the skin to the bones.</span> <span id="s1379">It was, first of all, it was hell.</span> <span id="s1380">So I look at him.</span> <span id="s1381">So I say, “Tell me, what you do?”</span> <span id="s1382">When he saw me he say, “We have to go some place.”</span> <span id="s1383">So we run to the commanders place where the SS was there and we arrive there.</span> <span id="s1384">So, I remember the SS, they say, “Was hast du -- Icek, was hast du gemacht?”</span> <span id="s1385">What you are doing?</span> <span id="s1386">So I say I was in -- meantime there was no power in the center there.</span> <span id="s1387">So, they call to the -- we have in Krankenbauand like a little hospital, 39 “What have you – Icek, what have you done?”</span> <span id="s1388">(German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">40 Infirmery (German) and they say for me, “He was wounded -- he was burned.</span> <span id="s1390">You have to come and take him.”</span> <span id="s1391">Because I can't see any more, nothing.</span> <span id="s1392">So -- but the SS still, they give me cigarette, maybe they have pity for me, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1393">And it is coming with the table.</span> <span id="s1394">Put me on a table I went to the hospital and I was there.</span> <span id="s1395">So I say -- it was a doctor, it was Polack -- I say “Look, I hope I can go out tomorrow, day after tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s1396">So he say, “You crazy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Even in 15 days, you can't go out.”</span> <span id="s1398">And, you know, every day the doctor come and take out the dry skin.</span> <span id="s1399">But I was so bad burned so they have to put me some place because Mengele come in every time to looking after, and when he find me, he send me to the gas chamber because I was very sick.</span> <span id="s1400">So they hide me at certain time.</span> <span id="s1401">I was covered with all kind of things -- he doesn't see me.</span> <span id="s1402">And I was in the hospital for maybe six weeks.</span> <span id="s1403">After six weeks I come out and we start to work again.</span> <span id="s1404">So no more electrician.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: So they let you stay in the hospital six weeks and not many people they let stay six --</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: Oh, no, oh, no.</span> <span id="s1407">Because every day, every day you have peoples coming in truck and take them out and they send them to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: And these doctors were nice and they hid you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: He didn't see me.</span> <span id="s1410">I don't know how they manage it.</span> <span id="s1411">But they -- because of, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Maybe they like me.</span> <span id="s1413">Maybe I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1414">And it was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s1415">The doctor was very nice.</span> <span

Now where was your brother at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: My brother, he was in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1422">They take him away to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1423">Q: Did he start at Buna with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: He start at Buna with me and this I want to see before my accident.</span> <span id="s1425">The burn accident.</span> <span id="s1426">The transport from the same town when I was in Plonsk is coming, the next transport.</span> <span id="s1427">It was my oldest brother come in and he took the place, the transport took the place from us in the quarantine.</span> <span id="s1428">And in quarantine they find out one or two, they have typhus, and they take the whole transport and they send them to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1429">And they went -- most of them, 80 or 90 percent from this -- they went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1430">And my brother was between them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">03:11:49 So we have to – you know, in column -- we was always -- all this was about four or five o'clock afternoon.</span> <span id="s1432">When the war was finished, the day war was finished, we have to walk to the camp.</span> <span id="s1433">We never walked when it was dark, not in the morning, not at night.</span> <span id="s1434">We have to come into the camp when it was lights.</span> <span id="s1435">So when I come -- when my Kommando come to the camp, so I saw the whole column from my brother and he saw me.</span> <span id="s1436">He say me, he say me “Goodbye.</span> <span id="s1437">We doesn't see you -- We don't see us anymore.”</span> <span id="s1438">And this was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Your brother waved goodbye?</span> <span id="s1440">03:12:40</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: And my little brother was already in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1442">He find, maybe next day he find his clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Now, when you were building over at Buna, what were you building?</span> <span id="s1444">A: Blocks, buildings, all kind of buildings.</span> <span id="s1445">Because like I say --</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Can you just begin that thought with, when we got to Buna we were building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: First of all, we building the camp because it was not camp.</span> <span id="s1448">It was just empty, not empty places, just a couple barracks.</span> <span id="s1449">It was not the wires, the electrified wires.</span> <span id="s1450">We have to build that.</span> <span id="s1451">We put it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: The barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Your own housing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: We have to make that.</span> <span id="s1456">And we made it because -- first of all, we make the holes to put the Betonyou know, around and after we have to pull the wires the, you know – how do you call -- what they make on the prisons, the wires.</span> <span id="s1457">You can't pass there, the wires.</span> <span id="s1458">And after they have the wires electrify with -- I think, 220 volts around, and something we have to put on this one.</span> <span id="s1459">We have to put barracks because every time, every time there was newcomers, newcomers like from all kinds of Jews.</span> <span id="s1460">Most, they coming from all over from Greece, from Yugoslavia, from Belgium, from France, from all over, all over, all over, and we have to build a place for them.</span> <span id="s1461">So this was the building.</span> <span id="s1462">After, when the camp was built, so we went in certain group.</span> <span id="s1463">Went out to the Buna – work -- we start exactly the same thing to build it.</span> <span id="s1464">Carpenters to prepare to make the things for, to make the Beton, the concrete, and some people like electricians to build all this building.</span> <span id="s1465">And we have the masters, the masters -- the chiefs, they was Germans.</span> <span id="s1466">Germans engineers, Germans architect, all the Germans was -- and we was just, we made just the dirty work, the hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">41 concrete (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">03:15:27</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: So you build your part of the camp?</span> <span id="s1470">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: And then after all this was built, did you stay at Buna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: I stay always at Buna, yes.</span> <span id="s1473">Until the end.</span> <span id="s1474">Until the 18th of January, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: Because you were there at the beginning, did you have a good sense of the layout of the camp and how everything was organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: Layout of the camp, no.</span> <span id="s1477">But one thing we know, we don’t going to survive there.</span> <span id="s1478">They have to -- first of all, you know, when you fall sick, was finished.</span> <span id="s1479">And they have to every day, every time, they have to kill in certain number from this prisoners.</span> <span id="s1480">There was this policy, the German policy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Did you work in the German industry as well?</span> <span id="s1482">A: The whole camp was German industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: But in the -- did you work in the coal mines?</span> <span id="s1484">Did you work in the munitions?</span> <span id="s1485">Did you work in the rubber making?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: We make, yes.</span> <span id="s1487">I was working there and in the industry because it was our job.</span> <span id="s1488">Like I say, I was working like electrician and we always have to be ready, because we make sometimes, you know, they have some trouble with the electricity.</span> <span id="s1489">There was the, you know, how can I explain you?</span> <span id="s1490">It was in building 700, and this 700 they make the gasoline for the planes and there was a roll, and under this it was like a carpet, long carpet.</span> <span id="s1491">It was rolling and over there they put some, not coal, but cox.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">03:17:53 You know what cox?</span> <span id="s1493">Cox is coal.</span> <span id="s1494">You take out the coal – you take out the gas from them and from them they took out, they make gasoline and this have to run the whole day.</span> <span id="s1495">You put it in the machine to take out the stuff, and we have to always take care of that, to repair.</span> <span id="s1496">Sometimes it was missing.</span> <span id="s1497">Sometimes it doesn't work.</span> <span id="s1498">Sometimes it was a fuse was burned up or something like that, and we have to be always there.</span> <span id="s1499">They run 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s1500">So this one is the job I was working there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: How long were you in that job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: This was maybe about two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: How many workers were over there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: In this whole company, they all I.G. Farben industry, was about, I can't lie to you, about a million something, a million people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: In the part where you were working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: The part I was working was about, maybe 35 peoples.</span> <span id="s1507">Just my Kommando for me.</span> <span id="s1508">This was just the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Were there women working at Buna?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1511">There was women, yes.</span> <span id="s1512">But there was no prisoners with us.</span> <span id="s1513">There was the civil workers, the Ostworkers from east, from east, from Poland, from Ukraine, from Russian, and sometimes there was even the prisoners from the war, from American prisoners, English prisoners, Australian prisoners.</span> <span id="s1514">They all take part in the war.</span> <span id="s1515">They was there in this I.G. Farben industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: And you're calling all these prisoners of war?</span> <span id="s1517">These civilian workers, even though they were prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: And how was this organized?</span> <span id="s1520">You did certain job and they did certain jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1522">We have -- first of all, we don't have no right to speak with any kind of civil workman.</span> <span id="s1523">When is a German we have like chief German, German chiefs, like architects, like engineers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">03:20:25 When these spoke there was a Kapo, they take care of us.</span> <span id="s1525">So he was talking with him and he give us orders, but personal.</span> <span id="s1526">I don't have no right to talk with any kind of civil worker, any kind of civil business.</span> <span id="s1527">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1528">If they catch me, they hang us, you know.</span> <span id="s1529">We have every day, every day there was before supper, supper what we have.</span> <span id="s1530">We come in, and we saw already the thing was made and today they going to hang one or three or five or something.</span> <span id="s1531">I remember, there was one bombardment and there was a young man -- I don't remember how old he was -- He eat his piece of bread that he receive for breakfast, and the German SS take them and they put him in jail.</span> <span id="s1532">They make a jail, a hole.</span> <span id="s1533">They put him in jail and the next day they hang him, and because they say he was stealing bread.</span> <span id="s1534">And</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">42 East (German) time from the bombardment was not good, and I remember young man was maybe 17, 18-years-old, he begging them officers – Obersturmbannführer -- and they begging him, they kiss his boot, “Please, it’s not true, I don't do nothing.”</span> <span id="s1536">He doesn’t help, absolute nothing.</span> <span id="s1537">They put him on -- they put his cut on his neck and he poor guy, he couldn't die.</span> <span id="s1538">There was a guy -- a Rackersterrible bitch an German, took his feet and pull him so down to die fast.</span> <span id="s1539">And this one was the order for the day was, maybe every day, every second day.</span> <span id="s1540">One day we coming up, we coming to the camp after the work and they saw already, in each place from the Appellplatz was the German with the rifle, with the machine gun, and we say, “Oh, oh, something happen.”</span> <span id="s1541">And three young boys was hanging because he say they want to escape from the camp.</span> <span id="s1542">That wasn't true and they hang him.</span> <span id="s1543">So I remember one scream, “Kopf hoch, Kamerad!”</span> <span id="s1544">-- I'm sorry...”</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">03:23:11</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Take your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1548">He say, “Kopf hoch.</span> <span id="s1549">Kamerad!</span> <span id="s1550">Wir die letzten”-- he say, “up his head” -- “we are the last one.”</span> <span id="s1551">And the last one he say, “Leben die Freiheit!</span> <span id="s1552">”“long life and liberty.”</span> <span id="s1553">They hang three young peoples for what?</span> <span id="s1554">Did exactly the same thing, pull them by the legs because they couldn't die.</span> <span id="s1555">And sometimes even to die, even to hang, you have to know how to hang.</span> <span id="s1556">And sometimes, you know, you have to -- they think, you know, they have to put it here just to break the neck.</span> <span id="s1557">But he just put on the thing and put here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">This guy don't know how the neck, so he pull on the legs to die.</span> <span id="s1559">How did they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: What were you thinking as all of this is happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Every day, every day, every day was the same thing.</span> <span id="s1562">Every day we saw it and sometimes, some days, we talking about it and I have it before my eyes.</span> <span id="s1563">I saw the young boys, and after we have to march, you know.</span> <span id="s1564">You know was about 12 or 15,000 peoples, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1565">We have to pass by them and have to look on them, how they hang dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Something terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">03:25:28</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Did you feel terribly isolated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: You see in a moment there -- sometimes I wake up at night, you see, 50 years after and I say, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s1570">Is dream.</span> <span id="s1571">I dream about that, but it's impossible that things happen in the 20th century and peoples, like Germany, they are cultivated people.</span> <span id="s1572">So organized people doing things like that.</span> <span id="s1573">It is something impossible.</span> <span id="s1574">When the-- you know, 43 SS Technical Sergeant Bernhard Rackers 44 Head high, comerade!</span> <span id="s1575">(German) 45 Head high, comerade!</span> <span id="s1576">We are the last.</span> <span id="s1577">(German) 46 Long live liberty!</span> <span id="s1578">(German) liquidated the ghetto there was the German to go to take out the peoples, took the little children, little babies by their feet and they smash their heads on the wall and -- and the government doesn't know, the United States government don't know, the government from England doesn’t know -- they know everything but nobody lift their little finger, because maybe, because they are Jews, but maybe -- they don't kill not just Jews.</span> <span id="s1579">They have Christian too.</span> <span id="s1580">And nobody, nobody lift.</span> <span id="s1581">Nobody say one word because, you know, and God, where was God?</span> <span id="s1582">God.</span> <span id="s1583">And the Germans have this belt was marked God, God is with us.</span> <span id="s1584">The Germans not with us.</span> <span id="s1585">They kill people.</span> <span id="s1586">They kill rabbis.</span> <span id="s1587">They kill priests.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">They kill everybody.</span> <span id="s1589">Where was God?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Where did you think God was at the time?</span> <span id="s1591">Did you think there was a God?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: No.</span> <span id="s1593">Even not today, no.</span> <span id="s1594">Look at what happened.</span> <span id="s1595">That still, but still is not maybe a Holocaust, but they kill.</span> <span id="s1596">They still kill all those people.</span> <span id="s1597">Why?</span> <span id="s1598">Why did they kill?</span> <span id="s1599">Okay.</span> <span id="s1600">I going to say they kill the oldest people, maybe they going to do something, but the young babies, the old men -- I had an uncle he was over 100 years.</span> <span id="s1601">They kill him.</span> <span id="s1602">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">03:27:54</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: Do you remember if you prayed at all when you were in the camp?</span> <span id="s1605">Did you pray?</span> <span id="s1606">A: Did I pray?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Did you pray?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Pray to who?</span> <span id="s1609">No, no.</span> <span id="s1610">Even not today, no!</span> <span id="s1611">Because to who I going to pray?</span> <span id="s1612">To kill me a little bit faster?</span> <span id="s1613">I like to believe – I like to believe, I'm a Jew 100 percent.</span> <span id="s1614">There is no question.</span> <span id="s1615">But pray for who?</span> <span id="s1616">For who?</span> <span id="s1617">Where is he?</span> <span id="s1618">What to do?</span> <span id="s1619">God, I see with my eyes.</span> <span id="s1620">We was wondering there was a priest, an older priest and he fall on his knees by the Saint Maria in Poland.</span> <span id="s1621">You know, there was the Christ and all these things, and a German come in, a young German kill him on the spot.</span> <span id="s1622">And there is nothing there.</span> <span id="s1623">Even this guy should -- his hand should be paralyzed and, you going to tell me there is a God?</span> <span id="s1624">There is a priest.</span> <span id="s1625">There is a Pope, all these things, but, nothing is not true.</span> <span id="s1626">Is nothing there.</span> <span id="s1627">Even today in the 21st century we believe, make such a thing as murders, killing little babies, little children.</span> <span id="s1628">Why?</span> <span id="s1629">What difference?</span> <span id="s1630">Jew, not Jew?</span> <span id="s1631">We all the same.</span> <span id="s1632">They have the same blood.</span> <span id="s1633">Why?</span> <span id="s1634">Who you going to ask?</span> <span id="s1635">Who you going to ask?</span> <span id="s1636">Who we going to ask?</span> <span id="s1637">Stop it.</span> <span id="s1638">What are you going to say?</span> <span id="s1639">I have the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: Let me ask you, was there -- did you ever feel like you would get out of there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1642">I know once in 1945 in 18 of January.</span> <span id="s1643">So we don't go out no day before.</span> <span id="s1644">Two days before, we don't go out to work.</span> <span id="s1645">The Kommandos were a little, you know, some no problem, but the Germans was very hard, so I say, “Uh-oh, something happen.”</span> <span id="s1646">And this time they start to make the bombardment on the camp.</span> <span id="s1647">You know, the I.G. Farben was bombarded.</span> <span id="s1648">The repair was bombarded.</span> <span id="s1649">It was something.</span> <span id="s1650">So on the 18 of January there was an order, we have to go together and we was out.</span> <span id="s1651">The camp was liquidated and the Buna.</span> <span id="s1652">We have to go out.</span> <span id="s1653">So we was walking the whole night until a certain camp, Gleiwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">03:31:03 So we was in camp.</span> <span id="s1655">We went to the camp.</span> <span id="s1656">We stay over night and the next day they come in.</span> <span id="s1657">We have to go to the train station.</span> <span id="s1658">And in this gruppeI was most of the last one.</span> <span id="s1659">And we have to take out the peoples what was first in the Krankenhausin hospital there.</span> <span id="s1660">So we have peoples.</span> <span id="s1661">There was a little, not all young.</span> <span id="s1662">They was a little sick, you know, and we have to take them out, and they sit outside the place.</span> <span id="s1663">It was -- I saw was one or two SS, they shoot them, they shoot all those people.</span> <span id="s1664">There was a river from blood.</span> <span id="s1665">I couldn't -- we go to the station and they put us in trains, you know that.</span> <span id="s1666">They put in the beast, you know, the cows.</span> <span id="s1667">They put us in the trains, and it was maybe eight days long.</span> <span id="s1668">It was a ride maybe eight kilometers up and down, up and down, and everything was closed.</span> <span id="s1669">We don't have no water.</span> <span id="s1670">It was wintertime, no water, no food, nothing, but in the trains, in the wagons there was a -- you know, between the wood was little bit open.</span> <span id="s1671">So we have the air.</span> <span id="s1672">So we coming back to Gleiwitz and I was hearing an order is coming from the Germans, and they say, “SS abrücken, Häftlinge stehenlassen.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">03:33:03 So the SS have to go away but they have to leave the prisoners in the wagons.</span> <span id="s1674">So one officer say, “No, we have to take the prisoners with us.</span> <span id="s1675">They was a -- they going to protect us.”</span> <span id="s1676">And they open the wagon with the machine rifle they start to shoot them.</span> <span id="s1677">I have just one.</span> <span id="s1678">I received here.</span> <span id="s1679">I don't know if you can see.</span> <span id="s1680">(Indicating.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: So I fell down and have to roll.</span> <span id="s1683">I don't know how long.</span> <span id="s1684">I don't remember because it was just shooting and lots of dead, and we was walking in the bushes, and from both sides the SS with machine rifles they shoot.</span> <span id="s1685">It was lots of people run away, run to the bushes.</span> <span id="s1686">I don't know if they catch them or kill them.</span> <span id="s1687">And we are were wandering the whole night.</span> <span id="s1688">We were walking until the next day.</span> <span id="s1689">We come in the morning.</span> <span id="s1690">We come in the prison, and we fell on the floors, and we sleep on the floor until next day.</span> <span id="s1691">Next day we have to walk.</span> <span id="s1692">And we walk 2000 kilometers from 18 of January until ninth of May, 1945.</span> <span id="s1693">And we was by streets, all kind of towns, and sometimes we have a place to stay, in place one day.</span> <span id="s1694">One day -- it was in March -- we come in a place.</span> <span id="s1695">I don't remember anymore the place, and there it was, a camp just for the Polish people.</span> <span id="s1696">I don't know if it was 47 Group (German); military term for basic unit of 10 men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">48 Hospital (German) 49 SS go away, prisoners stay (German) concentration, if it was a work camp.</span> <span id="s1698">And so the SS, I hear what they say, “We going put the prisoners there and we going to have a rest for one or two days.”</span> <span id="s1699">Because, I think, they was tired, too.</span> <span id="s1700">But the chief in the camp, he doesn’t want to let us in.</span> <span id="s1701">And in this town it was a mountain, a little mountain and they make a tunnel -- you know what a tunnel is -- in case the fliers come in to bomb.</span> <span id="s1702">And so the people from this town can go in and to be safe, but it doesn't make it right through.</span> <span id="s1703">And the chief say, “Okay, we going to put the prisoners over there.”</span> <span id="s1704">They put us there and it was not so very high and so it was cold.</span> <span id="s1705">Everybody go on the end but it was closed.</span> <span id="s1706">You couldn't go nowhere because it was not finished, it was not finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">03:36:27 The compress us.</span> <span id="s1708">All the things was outside, so I went there too, and it was a little warm but after I say, “Is little bit but no air.</span> <span id="s1709">I want to go in the front.”</span> <span id="s1710">And they wanting the chief, the commandant in this camp.</span> <span id="s1711">They make soup, you know, liquid soup.</span> <span id="s1712">So I have it was a part with me, and I say I going to go in the front every time and I going to take a little bit.</span> <span id="s1713">I have to eat, so I take one and I say I going to take one, and I have a nice time.</span> <span id="s1714">In meantime we start to missing air in the end, no air, no air, and everybody want to go in the front.</span> <span id="s1715">So like here, you have the door.</span> <span id="s1716">When you open the door, it was a place -- “This one for me -- a good place, I gonna go there, I go to hide there.</span> <span id="s1717">Nobody going to see me and I have the fresh air.”</span> <span id="s1718">And the front was two SS and every time when the peoples want to go to the front, they shoot them.</span> <span id="s1719">They kill them and they kill lots of peoples.</span> <span id="s1720">And they put in -- there was a wagon outside and they put a wagon in front so nobody can go in.</span> <span id="s1721">What I going to tell you?</span> <span id="s1722">I can't describe it.</span> <span id="s1723">There was screaming and crying and the peoples, they running to the walls.</span> <span id="s1724">They licked the walls because it was wet from the no air, and you see the oxide coming out.</span> <span id="s1725">It was there in March.</span> <span id="s1726">It was about six o'clock.</span> <span id="s1727">It was dark and the front was the SS.</span> <span id="s1728">They let nobody out.</span> <span id="s1729">We have to stay inside until the next day in the morning, and the morning was lights come in, maybe eight o'clock and they called all the SS to come in, and they let out the people that was still alive, and the firework was coming.</span> <span id="s1730">They couldn't go in.</span> <span id="s1731">They had to take the gas mask, they couldn’t go in the end and from the end they took out peoples there.</span> <span id="s1732">Dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Maybe 100, 150 people was dead.</span> <span id="s1734">And some peoples could survive on the end, coming out after five, six minutes they outside, they fell down and die because the lungs, they couldn't support.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">03:39:26 And I was there maybe couple days, and they took the dead peoples put between the barracks outside, they all frozen.</span> <span id="s1736">Food, no question about food for us there.</span> <span id="s1737">And about eight days later we have to go away.</span> <span id="s1738">And we start again to walk, and the order was to shoot the people, to kill us.</span> <span id="s1739">But they couldn't kill us in town because it civil people there and they couldn't -- they doesn't want to give us to deliver to the Russian, because the Russians coming from the other side.</span> <span id="s1740">And they don't want to give us to the American soldier, but the American was too far.</span> <span id="s1741">So we was between and we was walking every day.</span> <span id="s1742">Every day we was walking.</span> <span id="s1743">It was a couple SS and they pull out peoples and they shoot.</span> <span id="s1744">So I say, “God, something happen.</span> <span id="s1745">I won't survive.”</span> <span id="s1746">So I have -- on my side it was a little SS.</span> <span id="s1747">He was -- I don't know if he was from Yugoslavia, an older man, maybe 60, maybe more, and he have on backsack.</span> <span id="s1748">So I say to him, “Look, you not a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">You know what?</span> <span id="s1750">Give me your back.</span> <span id="s1751">I going to carry them.”</span> <span id="s1752">So he say, “Why you want to do that?”</span> <span id="s1753">“I want to help you.</span> <span id="s1754">You tired.</span> <span id="s1755">I want to help you.</span> <span id="s1756">I think that's good.”</span> <span id="s1757">So he take out -- he give me the thing he was walking just on the side from me.</span> <span id="s1758">So every time they eat, they have food, they have bread, so he give me just a piece of bread for me.</span> <span id="s1759">It was good and I can walk, first of all.</span> <span id="s1760">Second, I was sure no SS going to come and grab me to kill me because I have his things, and he going to take care of it because he want already – I have – SS they want to come in and grab me he say, “Uh-oh, don't touch it’s mine.”</span> <span id="s1761">So I was already okay, and when I was doing that so many peoples, not many have prisoners like me to do that.</span> <span id="s1762">There was about five, six that we carried the SS sack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">And in summertime, so we find a wagon.</span> <span id="s1764">We put all these goods from the Germans, from the SS, on the wagon, and we was pushing the wagon.</span> <span id="s1765">And we was okay.</span> <span id="s1766">We didn't have food, but at least I was sure -- I was not sure -- but I was sure I was going to live until night.</span> <span id="s1767">I don't know what going to be next day.</span> <span id="s1768">So they put us in all kind of place to sleep, and in the morning we see one dead on one side, one dead on other side – the people dying like nothing.</span> <span id="s1769">And it coming May 9, 1945 about seven, eight o'clock in the morning, and it was not far from Friedland in Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s1770">There was still a little SS come into me and took me by the arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">03:42:45 He say to me in German, “Go hinwhere you wolltaber lasst euch ja nicht erwischen bei unsere Brüder.</span> <span id="s1772">”“Go where you want, but take care the Germans doesn't catch you.”</span> <span id="s1773">And this was my liberation.</span> <span id="s1774">The Russian come in there and this was May 1945, and I was with my friend from Holland.</span> <span id="s1775">My friend and we was running, running, and we saw already, you know, the Germans was sitting the rifles and all these things, all on the side.</span> <span id="s1776">No more.</span> <span id="s1777">And one moment everybody who running -- the Germans was running, all the soldiers was running.</span> <span id="s1778">So I was on the highway and I stay and I wasn't German, and I say, “Hey, why you running so fast?”</span> <span id="s1779">So he say, “Fast, fast, Ivan come!”</span> <span id="s1780">And the Russian coming, this was the liberation.</span> <span id="s1781">He was lucky he was the first officer that I saw.</span> <span id="s1782">It was a Jew, Russian, Jew, Russian, and this when was the liberation.</span> <span id="s1783">So you can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: Could you believe this was really true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: No, and the first thing that he say, “You go back about five or 10 kilometers because here we have to find, it still the Hitlerjugend” -- was still in the bushes was hiding and – “we have to clean it up.”</span> <span id="s1786">But this was impossible -- I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1787">I was at this time, I</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">50 there (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">51 want (German) 52 but don’t let yourself be caught by our brothers (German) 53 Hitler youth (German); Nazi youth organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">was maybe 30 kilos, about 60 pounds and eating -- I don't have eat maybe, one or two weeks and it was very hard not to eat, but in this time, you know, the snow, there, it was melted, it was blackened, and this is what we ate.</span> <span id="s1791">This was our nourishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: You ate the snow?</span> <span id="s1793">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Now, did the Russians then come back and take care of you?</span> <span id="s1795">03:45:28</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1797">The Russian was there and we going back, and I was -- we went to Ringelshain in this one -- in Sudetenland, you know, and Czechoslovakia and I was there.</span> <span id="s1798">I was there a little time and I don't know nothing about my brothers.</span> <span id="s1799">Because all this time I think maybe they are all dead.</span> <span id="s1800">So one thing that happened, you know, there was lots of people, watch us passing in this town, and so there was boy.</span> <span id="s1801">He was passing and I was talking with him.</span> <span id="s1802">So I told, I ask him, “Where you going?’</span> <span id="s1803">So he say “Oh, I don't want to stay here.</span> <span id="s1804">I go to Germany.</span> <span id="s1805">From Germany I go to Belgium.”</span> <span id="s1806">And I say, “Maybe, maybe, you saw my brother.”</span> <span id="s1807">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1808">But this guy he went like say, he say, he went to Germany and from Germany he went to Belgium and he go exactly the same place where my brother was.</span> <span id="s1809">So the same thing I ask him and so he say, “I saw your brother.</span> <span id="s1810">Yes, your brother is dead.”</span> <span id="s1811">So, I receive a letter from him.</span> <span id="s1812">I receive a letter, I say, “I don't have nothing to do here.”</span> <span id="s1813">So from Czechoslovakia I went to Germany and I go to Munich, to Germany, and when I arrive there so, you know, we have all over friend.</span> <span id="s1814">I have all over people I know from camp.</span> <span id="s1815">So I saw one, he say “Aye, look, your brother is looking after you.”</span> <span id="s1816">“My brother is looking after me?”</span> <span id="s1817">He say, “yes.”</span> <span id="s1818">“How is looking, my brother?”</span> <span id="s1819">He describe me completely like my older brother is -- he went to gas chambers – so I say, “Look, I think you made a mistake.”</span> <span id="s1820">And he say, “No, I don't make a mistake, I think he’s younger from you.”</span> <span id="s1821">He told me, “and is that and that and that.”</span> <span id="s1822">“You have the address?”</span> <span id="s1823">And he say “No, I don't have the address.”</span> <span id="s1824">So we took a taxi.</span> <span id="s1825">We run the whole day over all Munich and that night I find him, and he doesn’t know from me, and he doesn’t know from me from my brother -- that was in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1826">And I said “Look, Aaron is alive and is there and there.”</span> <span id="s1827">And we send him a telegram.</span> <span id="s1828">He went from Belgium.</span> <span id="s1829">He come to Munich, to Germany and from Germany went to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1830">We were all three together, and after my two brothers, they went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1831">From Israel they went to Belgium and from Belgium to Canada and here I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">03:48:24</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: So the three of you were together?</span> <span id="s1834">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: And they went to Israel?</span> <span id="s1836">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: They went to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: No, they, went my brother went to Israel in 1947, or '48.</span> <span id="s1839">After '48, you know by Israel was country received the independence.</span> <span id="s1840">They went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: And how come you didn't go with them?</span> <span id="s1842">A: Because I was married in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: Did you have a difficult time getting to Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: I don't have no difficult in Canada, but I have very much difficult in Belgium, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Because they ask me always papers – and we don’t have no papers -- you couldn't stay in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1846">And we want to stay in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1847">We don't have no right to work, no have to right to make business, and every three months we have to go to the police.</span> <span id="s1848">And, you know, to present, to say, “I'm here,” and always was the same question.</span> <span id="s1849">“What you doing here?</span> <span id="s1850">And why you stay here?”</span> <span id="s1851">So the one thing I say is, “for the moment I want to here, but we want to go to Israel, to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s1852">And he gave me, you know, for three months and again for three months and -- but before, when we arrived in Belgium, we was in a home for old peoples, like an orphan house, but it is not for young but was already old, 17, 18 years.</span> <span id="s1853">But before that we have was maybe, you know, Namur.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">03:50:23 Namur was a priest, a very, very good man, a very fine man, and have trouble with the police because they doesn't want to let us be there.</span> <span id="s1855">So the gendarmes, the Belgium gendarmes they want to take out to pass the border.</span> <span id="s1856">So they took one, they put on the truck, and time they want to take someone else.</span> <span id="s1857">They escaped.</span> <span id="s1858">It was the priest.</span> <span id="s1859">He say, “Stop.</span> <span id="s1860">I going to take all.”</span> <span id="s1861">So he took all the peoples in the church.</span> <span id="s1862">Jewish people went all there until a Jewish chaplain from the American Army, he know about that, and he took the – all this people, Brux-- Linkebeek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">03:51:25 And it was a home there.</span> <span id="s1864">It was in Linkebeek in this home, and we was support by the Jewish committee until a certain time.</span> <span id="s1865">After they liquidate this home and everybody have to go to work, but we have some trouble with the work and we need an carte d’identité a card.</span> <span id="s1866">Some people have a white card, some people have an Model “C” this one with 54 identity card (French) just use fingerprints.</span> <span id="s1867">And we have trouble to stay there.</span> <span id="s1868">We never could be a Belgium citizen.</span> <span id="s1869">So the best way is to go out.</span> <span id="s1870">And we start, you know, to make the registration to Australia, to New Zealand, and to Canada.</span> <span id="s1871">So the first thing my brother, the younger brother, went to Canada here and after we come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: But I thought he was already in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: No.</span> <span id="s1874">From Israel he come, you know, he make his service, military service.</span> <span id="s1875">Q: He came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: Came back from Belgium.</span> <span id="s1877">He come here to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: So you applied to various countries and Canada accepted you first?</span> <span id="s1879">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1880">Now Canada is my home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Were you in the DP camp in Czechoslovakia long?</span> <span id="s1882">A: There was no camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: There wasn't a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: No, I was not in camp.</span> <span id="s1885">I was in private home.</span> <span id="s1886">I was in Czechoslovakia, about a year, a year and a half because I have to find somebody.</span> <span id="s1887">I couldn't imagine the whole family, nobody dead.</span> <span id="s1888">So I travel.</span> <span id="s1889">I want to go to Poland but when I come to Polish, on the border, Polish-Czechoslovakia they start to take us to the army.</span> <span id="s1890">So I say, “Hold it, stop.</span> <span id="s1891">First of all, I can't kill nobody.</span> <span id="s1892">Second, I am no good for the army.</span> <span id="s1893">I was already five year in the concentration camp.”</span> <span id="s1894">Not for me, the army.</span> <span id="s1895">So, I remember very well.</span> <span id="s1896">It was the German prisoners, the sick, wounded prisoners that was from the war.</span> <span id="s1897">They was in train this pass from Poland and Poland Czechoslovakia and most of prisoners from the Russian front from the German.</span> <span id="s1898">They pass Czechoslovakia, Poland, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1899">So the first thing at night there was a train.</span> <span id="s1900">I jump on the train and I went in Czechoslovakia because Czechoslovakia was the maybe, is today I don't know, it was the one civilized country from the old eastern country.</span> <span id="s1901">First of all, no antisemite is there.</span> <span id="s1902">There are very, very fine people.</span> <span id="s1903">There are today very fine people, very good, and they help lot, they help.</span> <span id="s1904">Red Cross, they help me and after I went to UNRRA and I was very good there.</span> <span id="s1905">But soon I receive a letter from my brothers.</span> <span id="s1906">I say and the same thing and this time, you know, I don't know if you know, Masarykwas the president from Czechoslovakia, he kill himself and this started the trouble with the Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">03:54:54 55 Jan Masaryk (1886-1948); Czech statesman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">And I say, “I'm not a Communist.</span> <span id="s1909">I was in diktaturealready long enough.</span> <span id="s1910">I want to be free.</span> <span id="s1911">I want to freedom so nobody can tell me what I do, what I -- nobody can do what I have to say.</span> <span id="s1912">What I have to do, what I have to say.</span> <span id="s1913">I want out.”</span> <span id="s1914">So, the first thing that I do, I take my friend and we went to Prague and in Prague was just -- you know, I listen by the radio.</span> <span id="s1915">It was the Nuremberg process.</span> <span id="s1916">So they make the process and the next day we smuggle the border, and we arrive to Germany and then München, you know -- not München, but it was in West Germany.</span> <span id="s1917">And from the West Germany I say, “Now I am in a democratic country.”</span> <span id="s1918">The American was there.</span> <span id="s1919">I don't care but I don't stay not long, because we went to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1920">Belgium we have trouble but the government doesn’t let us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: You're with your brother at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: I was always with my brothers, yes.</span> <span id="s1923">And that's the way was.</span> <span id="s1924">Look, we go to United States -- not to United States -- we went to Canada then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: Did the Russians treat you well when they liberated you?</span> <span id="s1926">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1927">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1928">At first you know we cry.</span> <span id="s1929">We cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: You know what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: They was very, fine.</span> <span id="s1932">Very good.</span> <span id="s1933">03:56:50</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">56 dictatorship (Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">04:00:55</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: I'd just like to finish up what we were talking about earlier, which was I was asking you how the Russians who liberated you, how they treated you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: Very, very good.</span> <span id="s1939">First of all, they know already because before they coming to us, they pass already Auschwitz and Buna there, and the whole way that they make from the Russian country ‘til us.</span> <span id="s1940">They liberated 100 different prisons and they saw all of that, and they saw the crematoriums, they saw all these things.</span> <span id="s1941">So when they arrived on us, they saw this.</span> <span id="s1942">They know about us.</span> <span id="s1943">They know, and I remember when the Russian arrived, the officer, the first thing what he gave me a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1944">And he have a motorcycle and he told me, “You know what?</span> <span id="s1945">You sit on the side car.</span> <span id="s1946">You going show me all the Germans that kill, that was bad.”</span> <span id="s1947">And, you know, it was the first soldier that coming and it was always with motorcycle and on this motorcycle was a machine gun.</span> <span id="s1948">And, you know, they was in the middle and all the soldiers, the German soldiers have to be on the side because, you know, they was the Russian soldiers come in, and they took them all to the camp.</span> <span id="s1949">And I, so far I remember, I was – gun -- I saw a gun and I start to play with it and the gun start to shoot, and maybe I kill some Germans.</span> <span id="s1950">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: Did you want to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: No.</span> <span id="s1953">I can't watch them.</span> <span id="s1954">I know it was and I say, “Hey, hey, stop it.</span> <span id="s1955">I don't know how to stop it.”</span> <span id="s1956">But it doesn’t take time, it was so fast.</span> <span id="s1957">And I remember we coming back, I don’t know if he was talking Russian.</span> <span id="s1958">Meantime, they take away all the Germans, all the SS with the Germans, they took to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: What camp did they take them to?</span> <span id="s1960">04:03:45</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: The prisoner camp, and after they separate them, SS one camp the Wehrmachtin second camp, and the women was to the SS women was… and I remember it was an officer with a motorcycle come in.</span> <span id="s1962">He want to pass, and on his motorcycle have a machine gun.</span> <span id="s1963">So the Russians, the Russian officer, he say, “hey stop, go down and come in.”</span> <span id="s1964">And the officer was saying -- and he talk to his soldiers, “Take him, bring him there.”</span> <span id="s1965">He doesn't want to.</span> <span id="s1966">He stay up.</span> <span id="s1967">He want to take the gun, so they kill him.</span> <span id="s1968">They shoot him and the first thing that I do -- I have no shoes -- so I take his boots.</span> <span id="s1969">They were beautiful, nice boots, and I take his boots and I look in his pocket.</span> <span id="s1970">Maybe he have bread or something like that.</span> <span id="s1971">So I take -- and I find a piece of bread and a piece of soap.</span> <span id="s1972">The first 57 General title of German armed forces from 1935 to 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">time.</span> <span id="s1974">So the Germans, they give us, you know, machorkait was the tabek-- to things -- and bread, and we have some meat.</span> <span id="s1975">Not meat, but salami, the Russian salami.</span> <span id="s1976">And they say, “go back” and we went back.</span> <span id="s1977">So we went back maybe about 10 kilometers, back.</span> <span id="s1978">We have meantime, I have a car.</span> <span id="s1979">I have a horse.</span> <span id="s1980">I have a bicycle.</span> <span id="s1981">I have a car.</span> <span id="s1982">I don't know how to drive, but I drive a car a little bit.</span> <span id="s1983">But so far, so long we have gasoline.</span> <span id="s1984">We don't have no gasoline, and after I have a horse, but the horse was more tired than me so I leave it there, until I have a bicycle.</span> <span id="s1985">And we went to a town, a town called Ringelshain and I saw a little house on the mountain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">04:05:48 And I say to my friend Jackie, I say, “You know what, Jackie, we are going up there.</span> <span id="s1987">We are going to try to pass the night over there, but here on the road is going to be very noisy because the army pass.”</span> <span id="s1988">And so he say, “okay.”</span> <span id="s1989">So we go up the little hill and it was a little house, and we knocked.</span> <span id="s1990">There was two old, one man and one woman and I was maybe crazy, not crazy but I very polite, and they were German too.</span> <span id="s1991">And I say, “I'm sorry, we coming from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1992">We’re very tired -- so, maybe we can pass the night here?</span> <span id="s1993">I don't want to stay here, but maybe you have a shed or something like that?”</span> <span id="s1994">So he told us, “Look, we are not farmers.</span> <span id="s1995">We don't have nothing.</span> <span id="s1996">But there” -- he show me over there -- “is a big farm, over there you can go and you can pass.”</span> <span id="s1997">In meantime there was a young lady stick out her head and she say, “Hey, hey, come here.</span> <span id="s1998">How you talk?</span> <span id="s1999">You speak Russian?”</span> <span id="s2000">So, I say, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s2001">But you believe me, at this time believe me or not, but at this time I was talking about -- speaking about seven language.</span> <span id="s2002">But I was with all kind of people.</span> <span id="s2003">We have French -- not English -- French and Russian and Yugoslav.</span> <span id="s2004">All kind of the slavish tongue, and we have Hungarian.</span> <span id="s2005">We have Greek.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">And this all you have to understood all together, so for each language you take a couple words and you learn.</span> <span id="s2007">So I say, “yes.”</span> <span id="s2008">So she say, “You want to come in because some Russian come in and they make us some trouble, and we can't speak with them.</span> <span id="s2009">Maybe you can speak with them.”</span> <span id="s2010">So we go in and first of all, we was so dirty.</span> <span id="s2011">So we have to go and wash up and they give us, I remember she start to cut bread, but little slices.</span> <span id="s2012">So I say, “Oh, no.</span> <span id="s2013">That’s not for us.”</span> <span id="s2014">I took a big slice of bread.</span> <span id="s2015">And the first time after so many years, I sleep in a good bed.</span> <span id="s2016">And the next day we go out and we were looking for brother, maybe a sister.</span> <span id="s2017">Maybe was and we went to the Russian commandant too, and they give us all kind of things too and it was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s2018">Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">04:08:45</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: Let me just go back a minute to the camp and ask you a few questions.</span> <span id="s2021">One is, when you were in Buna, did you have much connection with or much knowledge about was happening in the rest of the complex?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">58 Tobacco (Polish)</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">59 Snuff (Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: In Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2027">We have all the news.</span> <span id="s2028">We have all the news because it was every day, every day was the same thing.</span> <span id="s2029">Because first, you know, Mengele was, most of time, he was in he was camp in the morning, when we was marching out from camp to work he was there.</span> <span id="s2030">He was there with a little stick, you know, and when he showing somebody, “this guy have to be take out,” and he went, you know, in a special block and they put them, they put all of them.</span> <span id="s2031">There was the bed, three beds, but they took out the wood between and they close them like a box.</span> <span id="s2032">Inside they put in these people and the next day they come, you know, with the truck and to put all these people in that.</span> <span id="s2033">They want to send to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s2034">So we know that because we knew every day, every day.</span> <span id="s2035">It is not just sick people.</span> <span id="s2036">Even the healthy peoples.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: But did you know sort of what the structure of the other camps were or did people come from those camps to you and tell you what it was like at the different camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">04:10:44</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2040">My brother, when he was taken away from Auschwitz they send him to Jawischowitz, and Jawischowitz was a coal mine.</span> <span id="s2041">Now, in Buna, if somebody have a bad record, like in Kapo, you know, a Kapo he went to the jail, to the SS, and say “look, this guy is not a good worker,” or something like that.</span> <span id="s2042">So he doesn't kill him, but they send him to a very hard job and in the coal mines.</span> <span id="s2043">They have, you know, it was punishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">So they send him for eight days -- not eight days, maybe three weeks, four weeks in coal mine.</span> <span id="s2045">In coal mine like my brother told me, he was there, he was working on his belly, so deep, they have to shovel the coals it was so deep.</span> <span id="s2046">So it was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s2047">And how I know?</span> <span id="s2048">Because this guy, he was strong, so he survive.</span> <span id="s2049">And after surviving he come back to us and he give me news.</span> <span id="s2050">He say, “Look, I saw your brother.</span> <span id="s2051">Your brother is in Jawischowitz.</span> <span id="s2052">He work there.”</span> <span id="s2053">So I make all my possible.</span> <span id="s2054">He was a guy, he was Erwin, called him -- he was an AltreichJew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">04:12:07 He was an Rapport-SchreiberHe was working in the office with the German for the worker.</span> <span id="s2056">If somebody change the commander or somebody go from one block -- the first thing, I was in block four.</span> <span id="s2057">After they send me to block 14.</span> <span id="s2058">After from block 14 they send me to block 51.</span> <span id="s2059">And this was the, like I say, an accountant.</span> <span id="s2060">And they make all the paperwork.</span> <span id="s2061">So I was talking with him, and I tell him -- I beg him, “Look, I have my brother.</span> <span id="s2062">He was working there and there and maybe you can do something.</span> <span id="s2063">Maybe try.”</span> <span id="s2064">60 Old empire (German); term used for regions within Germany’s pre-1938 borders.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">61 Report writer (German) So he promised me.</span> <span id="s2066">I say, “My brother’s a barber.</span> <span id="s2067">He, you know, he going to shave you.”</span> <span id="s2068">I promise all kind of thing, so he say “I going to try to do that.”</span> <span id="s2069">So he so that, So he make him like an electrician, special electrician, special.</span> <span id="s2070">So, I think it was end of 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">My brother come to my camp in Buna camp.</span> <span id="s2072">I was in Buna and he was the same electrician.</span> <span id="s2073">I was electrician.</span> <span id="s2074">He was electrician, so you can imagine what kind of electrician we was there.</span> <span id="s2075">So these people they told us everything that happened there, like some people coming from Birkenau, they took every time to put is called a SonderkommandoThat mean, I don't remember exactly how many, but these people, they took out when the people was gassed dead in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s2076">They took out these people, put them on the wagon and push them to the oven.</span> <span id="s2077">But these people don't do long time because -- I'm sorry -- they put out the dead peoples and they put on the wagon.</span> <span id="s2078">And most of them, they put two men and one women because the women, they burn faster and better for men.</span> <span id="s2079">And they put them off a little wagon and they push them in the oven to be burned.</span> <span id="s2080">And these people doesn’t work long.</span> <span id="s2081">Maybe after two weeks, they are gassed, killed, because they don't want nobody to have to live.</span> <span id="s2082">Can't tell nobody what happened, so they kill them.</span> <span id="s2083">And we know that.</span> <span id="s2084">Then they have special peoples.</span> <span id="s2085">They was very good traitor.</span> <span id="s2086">They received very good food, but eight days later, two weeks later, they have to go, and they took somebody else.</span> <span id="s2087">And we know that.</span> <span id="s2088">Exactly the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">They took the Russian prisoners, the women prisoners.</span> <span id="s2090">They took out the marrow from the bones to put to inject the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s2091">We know that.</span> <span id="s2092">The experiments, because something the doctors tell us the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">04:15:52</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">Q: The doctors told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">A: They talk together and they have peoples, like I say, they go into this camp to take the clothes from the dead, because they don't have so many.</span> <span id="s2096">But in the end, like 1945, beginning -- not '45 but middle '44, so before the end '44, we don't have any uniforms, like with the stripes.</span> <span id="s2097">They don't have anymore.</span> <span id="s2098">So we have civilian clothes, but we have to put a patch on the back so you know yellow or other kind of patch.</span> <span id="s2099">So they know they are prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: You were in the hospital for a long time.</span> <span id="s2101">Were you aware of any medical experimentation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: No.</span> <span id="s2103">In Buna there was no medical experiments because the hospital was not very big.</span> <span id="s2104">But once I remember, I was passing there, and I saw it was a very special place where they put the dead peoples there, and I saw two doctors.</span> <span id="s2105">I can say it was Mengele and somebody else and they was playing with human brains.</span> <span id="s2106">The door was open, there was human brains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">62 Special commando (German); A commando of Jewish prisoners in the six extermination camp selected to work in the gas chambers and crematoria.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: You saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: I saw it with my eyes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: Could you hear what they were talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: I have to run away because I was scared for them.</span> <span id="s2112">They was looking for pistol or for gun or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">04:17:47 And once when my brother come in camp, you know, from Jawischowitz into my camp -- he was a muselmanHe was very skinny, and so I try to help him.</span> <span id="s2114">So he was working for the Kommando, for the Luftgaukommando-- that mean they make the graves and the holes in the special machine guns against the planes, and they receive very good food, the Germans -- but he was in the commander and they have a couple men with him.</span> <span id="s2115">And the Germans received this food.</span> <span id="s2116">But always in the cans they leave a little bit of soup and before these cans have to go back to the camp they have to be washed.</span> <span id="s2117">So they give him, they say, “Hey, you, you come here.</span> <span id="s2118">Take the soup but wash the cans.”</span> <span id="s2119">But the cans was washed with iron brushes, and he was always hungry, he doesn't see -- so ate the soup and he swallowed a piece of wire.</span> <span id="s2120">One Sunday he come to me and he say he was -- it was after, so you have to be a barber and so he shave this guy and somebody else and he say, “I have such a pains in my stomach.</span> <span id="s2121">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s2122">I have lots of pains.”</span> <span id="s2123">So I say, “You know what, come, I go with you to the hospital.”</span> <span id="s2124">But I know this chief of the doctors for the hospital.</span> <span id="s2125">So, I say “Stefan” -- he was a Polack -- “Stefan, look, my brother have pains.</span> <span id="s2126">You come see something.”</span> <span id="s2127">So he put him on a bench like that there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Was many doctors coming in and he was saying appendix.</span> <span id="s2129">He had such big pains, so they put him at night -- not at night -- to operate him and I was on the other side.</span> <span id="s2130">I was hiding but I saw everything that happened.</span> <span id="s2131">So it was Dr. Mengele's, because even between the prisoners, there was some good doctors and they worked in this hospital.</span> <span id="s2132">And they want to operate him, so they open the belly.</span> <span id="s2133">In meantime everything was open.</span> <span id="s2134">There was an alarm, you know, the planes.</span> <span id="s2135">I don't know if English or Russian planes come in.</span> <span id="s2136">No lights.</span> <span id="s2137">He was laying down with open stomach.</span> <span id="s2138">It just take I don't know, very long but the lights coming back.</span> <span id="s2139">And the doctors coming back.</span> <span id="s2140">I was behind.</span> <span id="s2141">I saw that.</span> <span id="s2142">I saw Dr. Mengele come into him and say on his shoulder, “Jude, when you live now, you going to live long time.”</span> <span id="s2143">And they operate on him.</span> <span id="s2144">But they pull out all the intestine together very badly and he have very big trouble today, and they can do absolute nothing.</span> <span id="s2145">Even when eat a little bit too much, they have to put him to the hospital, they have to take out everything.</span> <span id="s2146">He was very, very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">63 Muslim (German); camp term used to refer to prisoners who had lost the will to live and were near death.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">64 Air defense administration (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">04:21:19</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: But were you aware of any other weird medical experimentation in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: By us, I can't say, no.</span> <span id="s2152">And I was scared.</span> <span id="s2153">I never want to go there because I have enough, and I was burned because everything was gone.</span> <span id="s2154">So I don't want to know.</span> <span id="s2155">I don't want to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Q: So you really didn't know that there was much medical --</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A: I know that they make some but I don't think so that they make by us, no.</span> <span id="s2158">But I know they make with the Gypsies.</span> <span id="s2159">I know because -- and I know they make with the Russians ladies, the prisoners.</span> <span id="s2160">I know from the Jewish people, Jewish woman, they was sterilized.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: How did you know this?</span> <span id="s2162">A: They told me after the war.</span> <span id="s2163">Q: How did they know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: The Jewish women, they alive today.</span> <span id="s2165">They have in Canada and Montreal.</span> <span id="s2166">I have one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">They can't have no children and -- .</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: So this was information you got later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: In camp.</span> <span id="s2170">I have from people that coming from Auschwitz, and Birkenau and the other camp because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: Did anyone say, “I have had some injections?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2173">Like I say, I have an injection in my breast.</span> <span id="s2174">It was so thick.</span> <span id="s2175">What that mean this time, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2176">What kind of injection and I have experience with my tooth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">What this means, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2178">Q: You don't know what it means?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: It was take a little time and it was gone.</span> <span id="s2180">Maybe some people have a reaction, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s2181">I don't know because there was so many peoples.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: So they gave you an injection.</span> <span id="s2183">You don't know what it was?</span> <span id="s2184">And a few days later you were okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: I couldn't -- and because if I ask, I have a slap in the face.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">Q: They didn't say, “We're giving you a shot for the flu?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2188">They never, never say for what.</span> <span id="s2189">But we know, we have an injection and maybe one or two days we going to die.</span> <span id="s2190">If not, lucky for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: So they just said, “Come, we're going to give you a shot?”</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: They say, “Juden have to go there and there and wait.”</span> <span id="s2193">Or sometimes they say, “Kommando this number and this number Kommando, have to go there.”</span> <span id="s2194">Because, like I say, there was maybe 12 or 13,000 people.</span> <span id="s2195">So they couldn't give in one day the injection for everybody, so they take a certain number of people.</span> <span id="s2196">Like a block.</span> <span id="s2197">Like I was in block 51, it was maybe a 100 people, 120 peoples and other block was exactly 220.</span> <span id="s2198">So they take about 200 peoples and, or 150 peoples, and this where you go there, and this was if an experiments, it's possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">04:24:34</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: Were you aware of any significant attempts in the camp to resist or sabotage the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: I remember once, it was short before the end.</span> <span id="s2202">They threw out everybody from the barracks and it was a block resistor.</span> <span id="s2203">There was a guy, he was responsible for the block.</span> <span id="s2204">He was a Holland man, Bernard I think -- and they took him away.</span> <span id="s2205">And they look in every bed, under the bed, every barrack, supposed to have some weapon in camp.</span> <span id="s2206">This I know, positive.</span> <span id="s2207">If they find something, maybe.</span> <span id="s2208">I can't say because we don't see this guy anymore.</span> <span id="s2209">Not just him.</span> <span id="s2210">Some people, couple peoples, but he was in Holland.</span> <span id="s2211">I think he was somebody.</span> <span id="s2212">He was from the army and big man, but was in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2213">But why, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2214">And he was, you know, already in block he was something special.</span> <span id="s2215">And they took him away.</span> <span id="s2216">I'm sure they took him away to Auschwitz and the Gestapo, and over there they make some questions and pop -- that's it!</span> <span id="s2217">Because I know in Auschwitz it was in block 14, block 14 was, and in that block everybody would have to – be shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">They took him to the block 14, and from block 14 was finished.</span> <span id="s2219">Nobody can go out.</span> <span id="s2220">Because by us in Buna, they doesn’t shot -- they shot, sure -- but no somebody wasn't tried to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2221">Maybe tried to hang.</span> <span id="s2222">This was most of time, almost every day -- it was not news.</span> <span id="s2223">So we know when we come into the camp, we saw in Appellplatz, Appellplatz, we saw soldiers come in, in every corner, soldiers with machine gun and, “Oh, somebody is free today.</span> <span id="s2224">He going to have his freedom.”</span> <span id="s2225">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">04:27:20</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: You weren't aware really of a lot of efforts for people to try to sabotage the Germans in the factory or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: In the factory, special work we didn't have.</span> <span id="s2229">They don't trust us.</span> <span id="s2230">We make -- like I say, we make all the dirty jobs, the hard jobs, but special jobs they don't trust.</span> <span id="s2231">They have their own peoples.</span> <span id="s2232">Like they have the Hitlerjugend, they have the old people, the chiefs, the engineers, the architects were all the foreign German peoples, even the women --</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: How do you think you lasted so long?</span> <span id="s2234">How did you last so long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: I was young.</span> <span id="s2236">And, you know, this one was maybe my luck because we don't see the danger and we try to keep -- the first thing what I know, I remember when we arrived to camp after the quarantine and we went outside, we were waiting because there was a table.</span> <span id="s2237">There was all the Gestapo and they marking down what kind of trade you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">What you can do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">04:28:58 So there was a guy -- he's already dead a long time -- he said -- Chaim Komslowski -- and he come to me, he say, “Look, I can't understand why you are here.”</span> <span id="s2240">I say, “Why I here?</span> <span id="s2241">The same thing why you are here -- I'm a Jew.”</span> <span id="s2242">But he say, “But nobody can say you are a Jew.”</span> <span id="s2243">But the first thing he say, “Look, if you are -- I give you a little advice -- if you want to live, try to avoid any beating.</span> <span id="s2244">Try to avoid not to drink water, and if they going to ask you what you can do, what kind of trade you have, you say you are a carpenter.”</span> <span id="s2245">I never was a carpenter in my life.</span> <span id="s2246">I was 14 years.</span> <span id="s2247">How could I be carpenter?</span> <span id="s2248">So it coming my time, you know, to go before Gestapo, and, “Your number, name?”</span> <span id="s2249">“No name,” I say, “79630.”</span> <span id="s2250">“What is your trade?”</span> <span id="s2251">So I say,
