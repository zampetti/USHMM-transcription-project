interview was conducted with him.]</span> <span id="s4">We're speaking with Mrs. Lonia Fishman and the date is March 29, 1992.</span> <span id="s5">We're in Malden, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s6">Mrs. Fishman can you tell us about yourself, what was your name before you were married?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">My name before I married was Lonia Goldman.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Wegrow Pooluski</span></p> <p><span id="s10">in Poland</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Poland And your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">My date of birth is May 3, 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">What can you tell us about your childhood?</span> <span id="s14">What was your family like?</span> <span id="s15">Did you have brothers and sisters?</span> <span id="s16">What did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Yes, we were four sisters and one brother.</span> <span id="s18">We had a factory from cotton.</span> <span id="s19">My mother was a housewife.</span> <span id="s20">This was very nice.</span> <span id="s21">We went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">In Poland, in *?</span> <span id="s24">[13] In a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Did you have a Jewish education, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Yes.</span> <span id="s28">We do not have over there private schools.</span> <span id="s29">We have just one private school.</span> <span id="s30">In separate we went to a Hebrew school *Bais Yakov [ph15] they called it, as a child.</span> <span id="s31">When the child doesn't want to go to the Beis Yaakov we have a man, a rabbi, coming into the house and teach us Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">The Beis Yaakov was just for the girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">And the boys went to a Cheder?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">That's right.</span> <span id="s36">This was nice.</span> <span id="s37">We lived a very nice life, quiet, nice.</span> <span id="s38">We loved each other, all the four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Did you have anything that you liked to do in particular, any hobbies, any interests?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Hobbies, yes.</span> <span id="s41">Everybody had a different hobby.</span> <span id="s42">The hobby most was like you make shawls from the yarn.</span> <span id="s43">That's what we liked to do, knitting a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">How did you learn how to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">We learned from people, from school.</span> <span id="s46">And it was a very, very happy house.</span> <span id="s47">It was not like here.</span> <span id="s48">You get married, one lives here and one lives there.</span> <span id="s49">Everybody lives close to each other.</span> <span id="s50">That makes a very, very nice family, a close family.</span> <span id="s51">Here in this country it's different.</span> <span id="s52">When they get married one goes to California, the other, goes to Florida, you don't see each other.</span> <span id="s53">You see just one thing, on wedding or by death.</span> <span id="s54">It's the truth.</span> <span id="s55">We were very happy, happy and healthy kids.</span> <span id="s56">By us my mother never worked.</span> <span id="s57">My father just worked.</span> <span id="s58">My mother was a housewife, cooking very nice, cleaning the house was the girls.</span> <span id="s59">And this was every day.</span> <span id="s60">We were very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Did you go to high school or gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">No.</span> <span id="s63">Over there is just high schools, seven years high school.</span> <span id="s64">Over there it was very hard for the Jewish people to attend college, like gymnasium.</span> <span id="s65">Here they call a college, by us it's gymnasium.</span> <span id="s66">Some maybe they went - very, very, very little.</span> <span id="s67">When we grow up, finish the high school, everybody was learning a trade.</span> <span id="s68">The man was shoemakers, the other was a ?</span> <span id="s69">[42] and the third one was how to sew dresses.</span> <span id="s70">Everybody when they liked it they made, they had a trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">What about the girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">They had a trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">What did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">We made quilts, because we had the cotton.</span> <span id="s75">Me and my sister, the older sister, we made quilts.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">And you sold them?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Yes, a lot.</span> <span id="s78">And we went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s79">The last couple of years we moved to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">The whole family?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Yes, the whole family.</span> <span id="s82">And I was making over there, too, the quilts.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">(Voice of her husband asking to interrupt) Her mother in the ghetto when she was cooking, she cooked up a meal and she put in six potatoes in a big pot of water and we had to share.</span> <span id="s84">She shared out the meal and she remembered Shloime the shoemaker didn't have a wife and doesn't have nothing to eat, she took him a plate and brought it in to *Schleuma.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">That was in Europe, not in this country.</span> <span id="s86">Everybody knows about this.</span> <span id="s87">In this country a lot of people came from Europe, too, not now today, maybe 50 years ago, they remember a lot of good things too.</span> <span id="s88">But the new generation today is different.</span> <span id="s89">Like I spoke with my granddaughter, God bless her, she's eighteen.</span> <span id="s90">Ah, she says, bubby, here it's different when you were in Europe, everything the world changes.</span> <span id="s91">I told her the world doesn't change, the people is changing.</span> <span id="s92">And it's the truth, it's the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">How old were you when you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Eighteen.</span> <span id="s95">My mother was alive, my father was alive.</span> <span id="s96">His family was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">But the ghetto already existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Yes, existed, in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s99">We married in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">But it was permitted?</span> <span id="s101">I know at a certain point it wasn't permitted.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">It was permitted.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">(Mr. Fishman speaks) It was in the forty.</span> <span id="s104">It was only a few months till the Germans come in.</span> <span id="s105">You were staying in the line when the Germans came in for a loaf of bread and a Polish guy saw you and said a Jew.</span> <span id="s106">The Germans took you out and wouldn't let you get a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s107">I happened to say, I don't know what it was in me, I was not afraid for anything.</span> <span id="s108">I was staying in line.</span> <span id="s109">If they give bread, it wasn't written down here I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s110">I took off my arm band, I took off the star and just put it in the pocket.</span> <span id="s111">In my city I couldn't do this.</span> <span id="s112">Everybody knew me.</span> <span id="s113">But when I was staying where nobody knew me and when they shared out bread to the Poles I was right in the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">So you moved out of your family's home when you got married, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">That's right.</span> <span id="s116">We lived together in an apartment.</span> <span id="s117">They say they gonna make an *upshtong[ph82] how do they say this in English, an uprising.</span> <span id="s118">We went to the small city, to Wegrow, to our city, and we lived with our parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Did you speak Yiddish at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Yes.</span> <span id="s121">We speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s122">We don't use Polish.</span> <span id="s123">We use Polish when we went to school, with our pupil, with the kids, and the boys you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s124">Polish school, Polish talking.</span> <span id="s125">But Jewish we speak in the house.</span> <span id="s126">We wrote Jewish letters.</span> <span id="s127">And I can write Polish letters.</span> <span id="s128">Like here, you can write English.</span> <span id="s129">When we went to the fourth grade, to the fifth grade they told us we can pick a foreign language.</span> <span id="s130">Who wants German or who wants French?</span> <span id="s131">But for us, the Jewish people, we took German because it was easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Close to Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">That's why.</span> <span id="s134">That's all.</span> <span id="s135">It was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">We heard a lot from your husband about what was going through his mind, his determination and whatever.</span> <span id="s137">What was going through your mind at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">At the time where?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">During the war, at the time when these things were going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">I'll tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s141">To my mind was like this - yes, yes, no, no.</span> <span id="s142">You gonna be alive, its okay, no, is I going to be in between the six million.</span> <span id="s143">It was miracles.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">(Husband) What she told me, your heart tells you to go, you go, you leave me here.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Because I was afraid.</span> <span id="s146">I was thinking soon I go out from this house, I give you an example, the Germans were after me and they're going to shoot me.</span> <span id="s147">It's not better than they going to come in here and let them shoot me here.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">(Husband) No, when I have to go, you have to come with me as a company.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s150">From the Polish man when he told you we went out from him he told us we were hiding over there but he came from the little city when he said would be better when you poison yourself ....</span></p> <p><span id="s151">(Husband) He was a friend.</span> <span id="s152">He tried how to say look it's easier how to say to get the poison and get it over with.</span> <span id="s153">My mind is a different mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">And we were thinking it's better for us just to leave them.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">(Husband) It is the truth.</span> <span id="s156">When you fight and you get killed, it's all right.</span> <span id="s157">But to go the way I saw the people went, how to say, it's a shame to repeat like going like cows to the slaughterhouses.</span> <span id="s158">It was not in my vocabulary.</span> <span id="s159">It was not in my dictionary.</span> <span id="s160">You kill me or I'll kill you.</span> <span id="s161">No, it's not in my philosophy, maybe in my father's philosophy.</span> <span id="s162">Maybe he understood if he hits you on one side you'll put up the other side, not me.</span> <span id="s163">You lift an arm and I'll break it.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">But the first thing nobody believed, you know what I mean, that it's going to be something like this.</span> <span id="s165">They believed just one thing.</span> <span id="s166">The war is a war.</span> <span id="s167">It's going to be maybe a week, two weeks, three weeks and then it's going to get over.</span> <span id="s168">Who believed that's it going to be like a slaughterhouse.</span> <span id="s169">You see what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">(Husband) The first thing my father didn't believe for this weapon.</span> <span id="s171">He remembered the World War I and he said the German is a cultured nation.</span> <span id="s172">Would never do anything like this.</span> <span id="s173">Everything is propaganda.</span> <span id="s174">But when the major was in our house and he said to my mother.</span> <span id="s175">He stood in the light.</span> <span id="s176">He felt sorry because it's such a nice family.</span> <span id="s177">He knew that they're going to be eliminated.</span> <span id="s178">But it was too late.</span> <span id="s179">You couldn't go no place.</span> <span id="s180">We have now a different generation in Israel and I'm proud of it.</span> <span id="s181">When it was the war, the six day war, I have a passport.</span> <span id="s182">I still have a passport.</span> <span id="s183">I flew down over there to Israel and I was with my friends in the jeeps.</span> <span id="s184">I took my daughter, too, with me, Eva, the oldest.</span> <span id="s185">I was over there in the jeeps when they took *El Arish[ph134] and where King Hussein had his palace, Ramala.</span> <span id="s186">I was there.</span> <span id="s187">I was there when they hung out the sheets in the window, they're giving up, they're blowing them apart.</span> <span id="s188">Oh no, not me.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">What about your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">(Husband) She is different.</span> <span id="s191">In me is still the ache what they did to our people.</span> <span id="s192">No nation in the world tried to stop this murderers.</span> <span id="s193">Our blood was swimming up in rivers.</span> <span id="s194">The world tried to forget.</span> <span id="s195">Not me.</span> <span id="s196">How old I am, I wouldn't mind to go.</span> <span id="s197">Now we have a country.</span> <span id="s198">We have something to stand in our own land.</span> <span id="s199">No more.</span> <span id="s200">I taught this to my kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Not a lot of people thinks like he thinks.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Did you want to add anything to the story.</span> <span id="s203">We know what happened to you during the war period but is there anything from your perspective that you would like to tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">About your experiences.</span> <span id="s206">Even though you were together the whole time, you're a still different individual.</span> <span id="s207">Obviously you have a different idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">No the same, we lived through exactly the same....</span></p> <p><span id="s209">(Husband) Listen you can tell when I went into the ghetto and I got shot through the collar.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">(wife) I'll tell you just one thing.</span> <span id="s211">How much you say, they're going to put in just one third.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">(Husband) No, it's in the tape.</span> <span id="s213">Tell them the way I went in the night and when we decided to go into the cellar and take out the *?</span> <span id="s214">leather[ph 170] and when we're going to share out in the morning....</span></p> <p><span id="s215">(wife) You said it, you said it.</span> <span id="s216">Finish up.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">(Husband) When we was in the colony, when I give you the address *Lofa[ph174].</span> <span id="s218">We were the whole family, six or seven people.</span> <span id="s219">They were producing *?</span> <span id="s220">leather.</span> <span id="s221">One time the father came over to me and said to me *Vascha[177] would you like to go with my sons, hide it, bury it, some leather?</span> <span id="s222">See the agreement was between us they will stay *?</span> <span id="s223">all secure-------------the city from-------[179].</span> <span id="s224">He'll give me two sons for this, *Libel and?</span> <span id="s225">[181].</span> <span id="s226">If I'll take out three sacks of *?</span> <span id="s227">leather, one sack will be mine and two, this is his stuff.</span> <span id="s228">So the two brothers was outside the city.</span> <span id="s229">I went in the city but when it's no people in the city, when you go in with the shoes, it makes an echo.</span> <span id="s230">What I did, I took off the shoes and I took off the shoelaces, make a knot and put it around my neck and I went in the stockings.</span> <span id="s231">I brought it out.</span> <span id="s232">Before I brought it out, the *leather, the reflector, it was going around, cut me.</span> <span id="s233">A series of bullets went in my direction.</span> <span id="s234">One bullet went through the collar.</span> <span id="s235">The collar of cotton, the cotton was sticking out from the other side.</span> <span id="s236">The bullets went through.</span> <span id="s237">I didn't get hurt because I dropped on the ground.</span> <span id="s238">But I went into the cellar.</span> <span id="s239">I took it out three sacks of *leather because I didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s240">I couldn't trade with a promise.</span> <span id="s241">I didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s242">I had to have a half a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s243">The farmer is not going to give you anything if you don't give him something in exchange.</span> <span id="s244">So when I brought out the *leather from the cellar and we come back to the village, I was very tired.</span> <span id="s245">I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s246">We climbed into the hay.</span> <span id="s247">When we got up, it was noontime my sack was a half.</span> <span id="s248">They took it off, a half a sack.</span> <span id="s249">It was over there the tops of the *leather.</span> <span id="s250">When I have this I could trade with the farmers, give them a piece of *leather they could give me a loaf of bread, a pot of water, some milk.</span> <span id="s251">The father, like I told you there were six or seven people, I think there were four brothers...I went over to the father and I told him look I went down to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s252">I took out the *leather.</span> <span id="s253">Now you stole from me half a sack.</span> <span id="s254">Let me tell you something.</span> <span id="s255">I'm not afraid for you all of them.</span> <span id="s256">The only thing what I have to do is grab your hat.</span> <span id="s257">He was wearing a hat.</span> <span id="s258">In his hat he had a lot of gold, he had dollars, he had a lot of things.</span> <span id="s259">I come from the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s260">I didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s261">I said the only thing I have to do when you sit down shitting - in the morning everybody used go down and gather around the barn, let down the pants and make your duty.</span> <span id="s262">I said when you do your duty the only thing what I have to do, grab your hat and run away.</span> <span id="s263">I don't need anything.</span> <span id="s264">I come around better than you and I'm not afraid of your family.</span> <span id="s265">Finally he decided to put it back in and he put it back in, everything.</span> <span id="s266">I didn't have to fight with him.</span> <span id="s267">I just said look, the only thing that I have to do is just grab your hat and that's it.</span> <span id="s268">They're alive, the whole family.</span> <span id="s269">Only I think the mother passed away after the war.</span> <span id="s270">But they're all alive.</span> <span id="s271">I think two sons.</span> <span id="s272">They're in New York.</span> <span id="s273">One brother had a son.</span> <span id="s274">He's a rabbi like I told you in Rhode Island, in Providence.</span> <span id="s275">One brother is here in Boston.</span> <span id="s276">He was working in a factory where they're making sausages.</span> <span id="s277">He comes from a family of butchers.</span> <span id="s278">So he was working over there until he retired.</span> <span id="s279">He got married with a German girl, in Germany, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s280">He paid for it.</span> <span id="s281">He came over here.</span> <span id="s282">He saved up some money.</span> <span id="s283">She took the bank book, took out the money, left him, and she went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s284">He paid for it.</span> <span id="s285">So I don't feel sorry for him.</span> <span id="s286">A lot of Jews did it this way.</span> <span id="s287">I'm a nationalist.</span> <span id="s288">You can call me a fascist.</span> <span id="s289">You can call me anything you want.</span> <span id="s290">The Jewish people are my people.</span> <span id="s291">We paid for it.</span> <span id="s292">We paid for it very dear with our blood.</span> <span id="s293">I can't help it.</span> <span id="s294">I am what I am, like me or hate me.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">You have all these pictures of your family members.</span> <span id="s296">Maybe to preserve their memory just a little bit we could talk about individuals, at least your parents.</span> <span id="s297">Could we do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">(Husband) I told you my parents were wonderful people.</span> <span id="s299">They're charitable people.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Can we do is specifically, like your father.</span> <span id="s301">Tell me your father's name.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">(Husband) His name was Lazar.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Do you know the year he was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">(Husband) I know when I was twenty years old, he was forty-three.</span> <span id="s305">He was a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">And you were born in.</span> <span id="s307">.</span> <span id="s308">?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">(Husband) 1918.</span> <span id="s310">You will be able to figure it out for yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Where was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">(Husband) Poland Do you know the name of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">(Husband) He must have been born in Poland, in Katuszyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Do you know anything about his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">(Husband) I remember my zaida, his father.</span> <span id="s316">I remember the way he had brothers.</span> <span id="s317">He had sisters.</span> <span id="s318">My zaida took me to his father, the elter zaida.</span> <span id="s319">He was a hundred and twelve years old.</span> <span id="s320">He was white.</span> <span id="s321">The kids were taking care of him, I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s322">I remember the kids the way they were taking care of him, washing his stockings.</span> <span id="s323">He was like a prince in bed.</span> <span id="s324">When the Germans came in it's unfortunate how they took a man like this and they shot him.</span> <span id="s325">A hundred and twelve years old and blind.</span> <span id="s326">I remember when my zaida took me, he shall bless me.</span> <span id="s327">They used to tell me stories.</span> <span id="s328">I used to be the oldest from the whole *eineklas[ph274] from all the grandchildren and naturally I was the oldest and I tried to be, I run the group.</span> <span id="s329">I was how to say the leader, the bully.</span> <span id="s330">So my grandfather took me to his father.</span> <span id="s331">We used to sit around his bed.</span> <span id="s332">After his blessing he used to tell me Shaye you're the oldest of my grandchildren, great grandchildren.</span> <span id="s333">I know you're the strongest, you can beat them all up.</span> <span id="s334">And you're doing it, pretty good.</span> <span id="s335">I says look, I want to give you a test.</span> <span id="s336">Look how are you going to do it.</span> <span id="s337">He had a box of matches, wooden matches in Europe.</span> <span id="s338">Let me see the way you break them.</span> <span id="s339">You take them between the fingers like this and break them.</span> <span id="s340">So he took a match and I took it and I broke it.</span> <span id="s341">Oh he says to me, you're strong.</span> <span id="s342">So he gives me two matches.</span> <span id="s343">I broke them.</span> <span id="s344">And he said to me, I'll give you three matches.</span> <span id="s345">What is the three matches?</span> <span id="s346">You're taking them and you're breaking them.</span> <span id="s347">He says to me you know you're very strong.</span> <span id="s348">He says how many grandchildren do we have here right now?</span> <span id="s349">He counted them up.</span> <span id="s350">He says, what?</span> <span id="s351">twelve.</span> <span id="s352">He says I want to see how strong you are.</span> <span id="s353">He took the twelve matches and put them together and he took a little thread and he wind them around.</span> <span id="s354">And he says, now you break them.</span> <span id="s355">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s356">The knowledge what he taught me he says you see if these twelve children will unite they weld them together no strong man will break them.</span> <span id="s357">But when they're single, divided, even a weak man can break them.</span> <span id="s358">Did you learn something from it?</span> <span id="s359">So from now on don't you pick on the children, because if they'll be united, they'll break you.</span> <span id="s360">I'll never forget this.</span> <span id="s361">It's a very good example.</span> <span id="s362">He showed it to me, are you strong, you break one, you break two, you break three, you're breaking them, single.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">What did your grandfather do?</span> <span id="s364">What was his occupation, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">(Husband) He was in business.</span> <span id="s366">He had a stand like a market, like a booth.</span> <span id="s367">He was selling fish and he was selling cherries, corn, vegetables.</span> <span id="s368">This was my grandfather.</span> <span id="s369">Then when he retired he gave it up he used to go lay down in the field and he used to give me a Jewish newspaper and used to say, keep away the flies, I can sleep.</span> <span id="s370">It was not a bad life.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Do you know about your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">(Husband) It was in Europe usually the Jewish women were housewives.</span> <span id="s373">My mother used to be a businesswoman because we had a business.</span> <span id="s374">We had to do it.</span> <span id="s375">You know Friday you come in the house, if you had four plates, all four plates was cooking.</span> <span id="s376">Everything was for Saturday.</span> <span id="s377">You never know how many people you have to bring home for supper.</span> <span id="s378">You know always was enough.</span> <span id="s379">When it was not enough she gave away a plate because she can have later on another plate.</span> <span id="s380">Doesn't mean anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Do you know about your father's education?</span> <span id="s382">Did he go to high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">(Husband) Cheder.</span> <span id="s384">Everybody goes to Cheder.</span> <span id="s385">In Europe they used to say do you know where the days going away.</span> <span id="s386">The Yeshiva Bugherim, every Jewish boy what went to the Yeshiva used to go to a merchant's house to eat over.</span> <span id="s387">To us there used to come Jewish boys two days a week.</span> <span id="s388">Every merchant what he was well off, you take them for two days, the other take them for two days and that's the way they were sitting and learning.</span> <span id="s389">Till they got married and he had the smicha the paper what he can be a rabbi.</span> <span id="s390">In Europe we had three million Jews and we had all kinds of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">We had ...</span></p> <p><span id="s392">There were more than three million, there were many million.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">No in Poland there were three million.</span> <span id="s394">And we had people what they were driving horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s395">We had people who were carrying on their back, what do you call this *traigas[ph347] you know what they're carrying - they had special when it comes to a transport - goods - their job was to take off in the tray and bring this to the stores.</span> <span id="s396">They had like a little union.</span> <span id="s397">It was not a luxury life, but everybody was making a living, an honest living.</span> <span id="s398">We had Jews we used to say were *Jokers[ph355] You know what *Jokers[ph356] is?</span> <span id="s399">I give you an example.</span> <span id="s400">The farmer brought into the city once a week chicken to sell.</span> <span id="s401">You take a Jewish man he wanted to see if the chicken is fat.</span> <span id="s402">He used to put it in his finger in the side, from the chicken is always fat.</span> <span id="s403">He used to talk to the farmer and he says look you wanted so much money take a look the chicken doesn't weigh enough.</span> <span id="s404">The meat you let the chicken run away and the farmer used to chase the chicken.</span> <span id="s405">There was a couple and the man couldn't make a living.</span> <span id="s406">He was not a craftsman, he was not a businessman and the wife used to say to the man, look why don't you go out and grab anything to bring home a loaf of bread, anything.</span> <span id="s407">So he went out to the city and saw that a farmer was carrying a big tree.</span> <span id="s408">They had to put a pole to put on the electric lights and the horse was pulling the tree.</span> <span id="s409">The horse had to pull the wagon with the tree.</span> <span id="s410">So the farmer said hey Jew get off.</span> <span id="s411">Oh he said no my wife told me I had to grab anything so he took the whip and whipped him up and then he come home.</span> <span id="s412">He was whipped up and his wife says to him how come you're whipped up.</span> <span id="s413">He said to the wife you told me to grab anything so I grabbed myself the tree and the farmer beat me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Will you tell me a little bit more about your father now?</span> <span id="s415">When your family went into Warsaw ghetto in 1940 do you know what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">(Husband): Yeah, still in the ghetto Jews used to trade.</span> <span id="s417">They used to have some cigarettes.</span> <span id="s418">They used to go out and sell it.</span> <span id="s419">They used to have thread, they used to have things when the ghetto was still open, the Polish people used to come in and buy it or trade.</span> <span id="s420">They used to take it out to the other side and sell it.</span> <span id="s421">Till they closed the ghetto.</span> <span id="s422">Once they closed the ghetto you couldn't go in, you couldn't go out.</span> <span id="s423">Jews used to trade between themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">So what did your family do?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">We had to stock up things.</span> <span id="s426">We used to go to market and trade, same as the others.</span> <span id="s427">Used to be people like me they used to smuggle out.</span> <span id="s428">They used to go outside, they need things to bring it in.</span> <span id="s429">Like I want to bring in a horse and wagon with some food I had to trade outside with some farmer.</span> <span id="s430">I used to give him boots, I didn't have boots I went down to market I used to trade with him.</span> <span id="s431">In the late thing they used to make Jewish money.</span> <span id="s432">You couldn't do nothing outside with it.</span> <span id="s433">Just the Jews used to do between themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Was your family deported or did they die in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">I don't know.</span> <span id="s436">I think from the Warsaw ghetto they went to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">You don't know how long your family stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">When I went out from the family I supplied them with food as much as I could.</span> <span id="s439">Then my father said take your wife and try to leave.</span> <span id="s440">See if you can survive.</span> <span id="s441">I said to the family, how about you?</span> <span id="s442">In our family they believe we don't want to live anyway without each other.</span> <span id="s443">It was a very tight family.</span> <span id="s444">Or we live together or we die together.</span> <span id="s445">Instead of saying to the kids run, try to survive, split.</span> <span id="s446">No, or we live together or we die together.</span> <span id="s447">Nobody wants to live without each other anyway.</span> <span id="s448">Because I was married my father pushed me out and said take your wife and try to survive.</span> <span id="s449">And I managed.</span> <span id="s450">I don't know how, I survived.</span> <span id="s451">I can tell the story about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Do you want to talk a little bit about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">My mother was from Kaluszyn.</span> <span id="s454">You know over there the Jews they knew each other and they married to the grade.</span> <span id="s455">Rich are married to the rich, the poor are married to the poor.</span> <span id="s456">Sometimes you fall in love, a poor could marry to a rich.</span> <span id="s457">You know love is a very strong weapon.</span> <span id="s458">It breaks all the weapons in the world.</span> <span id="s459">The king of England gave up his throne for the woman he loved so I think the strongest power in the world is love.</span> <span id="s460">I'm surprised about the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s461">Even today Israel, I thought Israel would be the mirror for the world, what we went through, how we can show an example to the world, how we can live like a family.</span> <span id="s462">When I was in Israel, I was riding in a taxi I had an argument with my own.</span> <span id="s463">Not a born Israeli, she was emigrated to Israel.</span> <span id="s464">Why I emigrated to America is because my wife she had her father's sister was here in Massachusetts they had shoe factories.</span> <span id="s465">He was from Europe a shoe maker and he managed to be a rich man even he couldn't sign his name - he made three crosses - but he had 1200 people working for him.</span> <span id="s466">*Rattenubriport[ph472] he was under the name the Root Shoe Company.</span> <span id="s467">He sent me papers to Berlin, Germany.</span> <span id="s468">I come to America through his papers.</span> <span id="s469">Even in Germany from 1946 through 1948 I was a translator for General Clay.</span> <span id="s470">I had a motorcycle and I was bringing (because I was speaking several languages).</span> <span id="s471">I was from *Schloktenzei[ph484] to the airport over there I had to bring the papers from one camp to the other and I had papers, not the MP, not the CNC, when they stopped me, when I produce the papers they salute me and I was going with my ...*?</span> <span id="s472">[495] They were driving a *Zindup[ph496] the English motorcycle, I was driving a BMW.</span> <span id="s473">The difference is a BMW a shaft, their motorcycle had a chain.</span> <span id="s474">They couldn't catch me when I was driving.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Before this tape runs out I want to talk a little bit more about your parents.</span> <span id="s476">Do you know how old your mother was?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">She must have been two years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Than your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Could you tell me about their personalities a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">They have the personalities from my wife, very, very nice.</span> <span id="s482">Not me.</span> <span id="s483">I'm tough.</span> <span id="s484">Even today in my business, the customers when they look in and I'm alone they're not going to come in.</span> <span id="s485">I deal with the people difference and my wife deals difference.</span> <span id="s486">She's more business.</span> <span id="s487">When I have a customer and he gives me a time I ask him what do you want?</span> <span id="s488">You don't want to pay don't come here no more.</span> <span id="s489">Find yourself another victim.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Your parents wouldn't have been tough?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">I don't know.</span> <span id="s492">When I was in the Warsaw ghetto and we had Jewish police and we had a *Chernoska[529].</span> <span id="s493">The *Chernoska[ph529] was the more intelligent type of police.</span> <span id="s494">The one time I was working with my father in the street and they grabbed my father by the arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">They had to deliver 5000 people to the Germans and they come out to the street and they grabbed everybody.</span> <span id="s496">They grabbed my father and I said to this guy leave him be, let him go.</span> <span id="s497">He said to me no he'll go with me.</span> <span id="s498">He didn't go with him.</span> <span id="s499">He was laying on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s500">With one bang he was gone.</span> <span id="s501">I said to myself so long as I'm alive nobody will put a hand to my father.</span> <span id="s502">I was difference.</span> <span id="s503">Even in the store I'm difference.</span> <span id="s504">I'm not going out and say move back against nobody, he'll have to kill me.</span> <span id="s505">That's right, my wife is difference.</span> <span id="s506">Maybe she is bright, she is better.</span> <span id="s507">My father taught me one thing.</span> <span id="s508">A tree what waves with the wind will never get ripped out with the roots.</span> <span id="s509">A tree what is stubborn in a hurricane this is the first tree what will fall.</span> <span id="s510">He taught me right.</span> <span id="s511">Every person has his own personality.</span> <span id="s512">Every person is difference.</span> <span id="s513">I cannot change, that's the way I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Well, you've been through a lot and your experiences certainly influenced...</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Yes, but as I said it's better to be like my wife.</span> <span id="s516">I don't know by miracles I'm still alive, I don't know why because I'm not going to move back for nobody.</span> <span id="s517">I hope I'm going to die in a peaceful way because you never can tell in these days some nut could come into the store and he's not going to ask you.</span> <span id="s518">He'll give it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">(Wife does the speaking again at this point unless otherwise indicated) My sister came before me here in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">What is her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Edith.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Edith Goldman?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Goldman.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">(Husband) Bielawski, she's married to a Bielawski.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">[Husband starts to spell, wife says I can spell that.]</span> <span id="s526">(Wife) He calls himself not Biloski, I'm sorry Bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">But I'll use the Polish name.</span> <span id="s528">Was she married in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">To Bielawski?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Is she older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Yes, older.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">You said five years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">She has three children, two boys and one daughter.</span> <span id="s535">They are all married.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Actually I'd rather talk about her when you were children.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Oh, children, yes, it was in the house very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Did she like to do knitting like you?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Knitting, yes, even maybe the quilts like I told you.</span> <span id="s540">I can't explain it.</span> <span id="s541">The children lived very happy in the house.</span> <span id="s542">We fight, I don't even know if we fight there.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Do you remember anything special about any time you spent with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">I spent all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">She went to Beis Yaakov?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">All the children with us went to Beis Yaakov[22].</span></p> <p><span id="s547">(Husband) Every child has a different nature.</span> <span id="s548">She happened to be not to my liking.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">(Wife) Why he don't like her is a reason.</span> <span id="s550">When the Germans come in and she was married....</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Do you remember what year she got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">(Husband) I told you '40, I think she got married in '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">(Wife) After us.</span> <span id="s554">I don't want to go to this, what it was, why he's mad, it was a wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">(Husband) [says something in Yiddish] She was always apologizing.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">(Wife) To me she was a very good sister, very smart, smart in Hebrew, smart in Polish, smart in English.</span> <span id="s557">She came here to this country she worked very very hard.</span> <span id="s558">Now she was sick, she got cancer.</span> <span id="s559">Now one thing I don't like here in America is different (Husband) She passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">What happened to her, was she in the Warsaw ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Yes, she was the same hiding.</span> <span id="s562">Like he told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Was she in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">(Husband) the same, Wegrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">So they never got to the Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">(Husband) Oh yeah, she was in the Warsaw ghetto too, she was in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">So when was she in the Warsaw ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">(Wife) the same as me.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">(Husband) In 1940, 1940, then back to Wegrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">And then she went into hiding with her husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">(Husband) Yeah when the ghetto was liquidated.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">She didn't have any kids or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">So she and her husband survived hidden by a Polish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">(Wife) The whole family survived, my mother survived, two brothers survived and a sister survived.</span> <span id="s576">His.....</span></p> <p><span id="s577">(Husband)She was the only one from his family that survived.</span> <span id="s578">She was an outcast in his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Did you have any contact with her during the war period?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">No.</span> <span id="s581">(Husband) She didn't know from us and we didn't know from her.</span> <span id="s582">She knew one thing, that we got killed.</span> <span id="s583">Remember there was a rumor how the tailor got killed.</span> <span id="s584">She was in another colony about seven kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">So she spent like eighteen months also in.</span> <span id="s586">.</span> <span id="s587">?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Did you ever talk to her afterwards about that time like what happened to them during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">(Wife) Oh yes, you know she told me she was hiding, the same what we was.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">(Husband) And they were sharing the food, but her husband was a good man.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">When you were in the grave did you talk to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">(Wife) No, to my sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">You couldn't talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">(Wife) No, with my sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">No to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Oh yeah, we were both together laying.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">If you didn't want anyone to hear you or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Nobody would.</span> <span id="s600">.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">(Husband) Like I told you 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s602">When I was asleep she was up, when I was up she was asleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">(Wife) Anyone could walk in.</span> <span id="s604">When it comes a Sunday all the Polish people come in.....</span></p> <p><span id="s605">(Husband) They used to come in to the guy.</span> <span id="s606">A good Polish guy would say like this, I'm not going to kill a Jew.</span> <span id="s607">If I'm not going to feed him, if I'm not going to give him water he'll drop dead by himself.</span> <span id="s608">But he wouldn't kill him.</span> <span id="s609">This was the good one what he believed in Jesus or something.</span> <span id="s610">The bad one was going around and kill them.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">So your sister and her husband that was the way they survived, the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Exactly the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">So about her personality you think she was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">(Wife) To me she was a very very good sister.</span> <span id="s615">I like her, she was my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Was she close with the other children in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Yes, but the other children was dead.</span> <span id="s618">Everybody was close.</span> <span id="s619">In Europe children, everybody was one.</span> <span id="s620">Here in this country is different, not in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">You'll promise that you'll send me her picture and I'll make a copy of it and we'll include her in our project.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">(Wife) My pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">I'm going to turn off the tape unless you have anything else to add.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">(Wife) Thank you very much for coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Well, thank you.</span></p></body></html>
