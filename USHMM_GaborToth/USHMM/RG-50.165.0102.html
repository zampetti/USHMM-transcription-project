SCHIMEL</span></p> <p><span id="s11">December 13, 1989</span></p> <p><span id="s12">WH: Were you always interested in music?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">AS: I was interested from childhood.</span> <span id="s14">My father played the fiddle and he started me out.</span> <span id="s15">I wanted to be a musician.</span> <span id="s16">I was born in 1911.</span> <span id="s17">I went to the Vienna Conservatory when I was eleven.</span> <span id="s18">By eighteen I played professionally.</span> <span id="s19">I studied for the baccalaureate.</span> <span id="s20">I finished school at 22.</span> <span id="s21">My parents were furriers.</span> <span id="s22">At age 24, I went to Vienna University to study musicology.</span> <span id="s23">I realized you needed more than just being able to play music.</span> <span id="s24">There were so many musicians in Vienna.</span> <span id="s25">I wanted a teaching position but all this was interrupted by 1938.</span> <span id="s26">I then went to Luxembourg and worked in a radio orchestra.</span> <span id="s27">I was then able to bring my parents out of Vienna and they eventually went to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s28">In 1940 I joined my family in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s29">My father died in 1940.</span> <span id="s30">I went into the fur industry.</span> <span id="s31">From there my mother and I went to Brussels.</span> <span id="s32">From Belgium we went to Nice, France.</span> <span id="s33">I hid out in a Rome monastery.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">WH: Do you ever discuss the theological reasons for the Holocaust together, as a couple?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">HS: No.</span> <span id="s36">There’s nothing to talk about.</span> <span id="s37">I believe that whatever God did, He had His reasons.</span> <span id="s38">Either you believe or you don’t.</span> <span id="s39">Jewish people before this era were</span></p> <p><span id="s40">also slaughtered.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">WH: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">HS: In Germany.</span> <span id="s43">My parents were from Poland.</span> <span id="s44">My mother was from Rzeswow (Jeshuv).</span> <span id="s45">I was taken from Germany to Poland by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s46">I was put on a train to Broiten near the border.</span> <span id="s47">It was in 1938.</span> <span id="s48">I was born in 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">WH: Did you continue your musical career here in the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">AS: No, because I couldn’t keep Shabbos if I played in an orchestra.</span> <span id="s51">I went into the fur business.</span> <span id="s52">I learned gradually.</span> <span id="s53">I never went back to music.</span> <span id="s54">I play, but only with friends as a hobby.</span> <span id="s55">Also when I got married I couldn’t travel because I wanted to have a family and bring the kids up religious.</span> <span id="s56">(compare with Petrushka</span></p> <p><span id="s57">#154)</span></p> <p><span id="s58">WH: Have you ever run into any survivors who played in concentration camp</span></p> <p><span id="s59">orchestras?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">AS: No.</span> <span id="s61">Very few of those survived.</span> <span id="s62">I only met a professional player who is a survivor once and he actually was a refugee who came before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">WH: Could a Holocaust happen here?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">HS: Yes, if you have a person like Jesse Jackson as President.</span> <span id="s65">He makes me very nervous.</span> <span id="s66">He reminds me of Hitler’s voice with his screaming.</span> <span id="s67">He speaks like Hitler used to speak, his angry way of speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">WH: What kind of work did you do here?</span> <span id="s69">HS: I worked for Time magazine for nineteen years as manager of (the) book purchasing department.</span> <span id="s70">But I only went to work there after the children were older.</span> <span id="s71">And I always identified as a Jew even during the time when most didn’t.</span> <span id="s72">I didn’t even realize Henry Grunewald was Jewish until after several years when he happened to say something about it.</span> <span id="s73">But they respected me.</span> <span id="s74">At first they said: “You know, because of you we have to change the rules here about holidays.”</span> <span id="s75">But later on they took in some other religious people and when I retired, they made a big catered party and they had a table for me with food from Lou G.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Siegels.</span> <span id="s77">When other Jews saw that I got so much respect for being identified from the gentiles that they, too, began to admit openly that they were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">WH: So how did you get to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">AS: We went first to Oswego from Italy.</span> <span id="s80">The idea was we would go there until the war ended and then go back to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: How has the war affected you in the long run?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">HS: What I would like to do is have some money or something somewhere where nobody can touch it…in case.</span> <span id="s83">I’m scared…in that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">WH: How did the war affect you in the long term?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">AS: It’s very difficult to speak about it because, as Dr. Hillel Seidman once said, “There’s no beginning and no end.”</span> <span id="s86">American Jews can’t understand it.</span> <span id="s87">I never spoke about it to my children.</span> <span id="s88">David once asked me and I said, “Where shall I start?</span> <span id="s89">How can you condense it into a tape?”</span></p> <p><span id="s90">WH: Do you dream about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">AS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">HS: Not any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">WH: What happens when you go back to visit Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">AS: When I visited Nice, I felt fear again.</span> <span id="s95">But Vienna, where I was raised, is to me the strangest city.</span> <span id="s96">It is so different now because there are no Jews.</span> <span id="s97">I only went back to go to the cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">WH: You love music, don’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">AS: For me, playing the fiddle is more than a hobby.</span> <span id="s100">It’s a passion.</span> <span id="s101">I must play several hours a day.</span> <span id="s102">I practice as often as I can.</span> <span id="s103">But I couldn’t make a career if it because I was too afraid of losing my Yiddishkeit.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s105">PAGE USHMM
