<p><span id="s41">A: I was in concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: We were in phases...we started with a ghetto and then the removal of the greater part of the people from the ghetto to the extermination camp, and then another phrase again, the Germans had a very good plan and the plans were more or less the same, but they were not identical.</span> <span id="s44">And in almost every city again, they did it a little differently.</span> <span id="s45">You see, our city had two ghettos.</span> <span id="s46">They couldn’t put all the Jews in one ghetto in one place, okay, so there was a ghetto, (inaudible) big ghetto, in the area of the greater Jewish concentration (inaudible) and that was the worst part of the city...(inaudible)...Jewish life was very vibrant and very active and very big...</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: So you were in the ghetto in Radom?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: ...the ghetto was closed in Radom April 15, 1941.</span> <span id="s49">So I lived in a big ghetto, and I worked in a small ghetto (inaudible).</span> <span id="s50">And, we could go out to work from the ghetto and we had to go in columns in groups.</span> <span id="s51">Unless you had a pass, you could go out and walk in the streets.</span> <span id="s52">Not on the sidewalk mind you, on the street, next to the curb...</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: You were also in a concentration camp – which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Dachau, and prior to that (inaudible) Baihingen/enz...</span></p> <p><span

work...</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: What about your parents, were they in the ghetto with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s59">My friends were till the liquidation

id="s61">Q: Did she survive the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: She survived the war...this was the first step to survive the war.</span> <span id="s63">You were not sent away.</span> <span id="s64">(inaudible) but that, there was no guarantee that you’re going to survive...she made it through the war.</span> <span id="s65">She’s not alive any more...she lived in Israel from 1948 to 1960.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: And where were you?</span> <span id="s67">You were here?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I was here...</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: ...at any point, were you in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Not individually, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did you ever have occasion where you had to try to pass yourself off as a gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s73">But that was even before really, things started going (inaudible)...there were certain occasions you know, we had to wear arm bands, okay, that was a little later maybe in December, November, 1939 but prior to that...I didn’t look very much Jewish then, and...I pretended I wasn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: After the war, were you in a D.P. camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: You were liberated from Dachau...?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Nothing is simple.</span> <span id="s78">If I tell you I was in Dachau last, doesn’t mean that I was liberated in Dachau...fortunately, I was not sick enough, I mean not – I’m not saying this facetiously, I was not sick enough to stay in Dachau when the Americans, American Army was closing in and the Germans took us out, I don’t know – two, three thousand Jews (inaudible).</span> <span id="s79">They put us on trains.</span> <span id="s80">On beautiful first-class trains, and the rumor had it that we were going to Switzerland and as an exchange, that Himmler had some kind of idea that he could save himself and others.</span> <span id="s81">So Switzerland supposedly, that was a rumor, that Switzerland agreed to allow a certain number of survivors in (inaudible) ‘cause they saw the hand-writing on the wall, the war was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s82">But the fact that they put us on – not on cattle trains, but in passenger – trains.</span> <span id="s83">In Dachau, outside Dachau, they gave us (inaudible-coals?)</span> <span id="s84">to put on our stripes.</span> <span id="s85">They gave us for the first time ever, a Red Cross box, a shoe (inaudible) box with some goodies inside, we hadn’t seen for five years, you know, or more.</span> <span id="s86">That sort of strengthen the rumor, you know, that maybe we were going.</span> <span id="s87">Well, as it turned out, we didn’t go to Switzerland, but we went closer to them.</span> <span id="s88">We went to Austria, believe it or not...the end of it is, they took us to Austria, and then in Austria, they were really on the run.</span> <span id="s89">They left us, they put us in a corner, in a place in the middle of nowhere.</span> <span id="s90">Between the mountains, alps, and some creek and water, a triangle, and we thought that the end, because it looked really bad.</span> <span id="s91">As it happened, this was the 29th of April...the guards ran away and they left us alone so we started marching north...we decided to go back...</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And eventually you wound up in a D.P. camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: ...I didn’t right away...we (hid in the mountains)...the next day was May 1st...we were liberated by the Americans...we said, ‘No more camps for us.’</span> <span id="s94">So we settled in a room behind some cleaning establishment...we went to work for American army units, American army mess for officers...</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: This was after the war, but when did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: ...in ’50...</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: ...I’m interested in knowing in what D.P. camp you were, and who helped you get to the United States, which organizations, and what it was like coming over here, I assumed you went by boat, right?</span> <span id="s98">...</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Right...</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: ...I want to skip a little bit ahead...</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: ...that maybe what you’re looking for, but if I don’t give you the back – what happened between ’45 and ’50, then you’ll miss something, I think.’</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Okay, tell me what you think is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: ...I wound up in a D.P. camp in Stuttgart...I started going to school again...(inaudible)...I could have come to the United States in ’47, ’48, ’49, but instead I went through the school, and my wife started to go to school...(inaudible)...they had a program for Economics for the first two years (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Did you meet her there?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No.</span> <span id="s106">We were married in Poland, in the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: In the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: ...each person has a different story to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: ...you met her in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I didn’t meet her in the camps.</span> <span id="s111">I knew her in Radom...we were neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: So you were already married by the time the war ended in effect.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Right.</span> <span id="s114">– I didn’t know whether she survived or not, she didn’t know I survived...</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: ...You did mention something very interesting just a moment ago.</span> <span id="s116">You said to me that you could have come to the United States but you didn’t.</span> <span id="s117">You chose to finish ?</span> <span id="s118">Hofshueller?</span> <span id="s119">What was behind that decision?</span> <span id="s120">When you say, you could have come here...</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: People went to Israel, too.</span> <span id="s122">Palestine then, before aliyah back...</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Did you think after the war of going to Israel at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Tell me about that.</span> <span id="s126">What went through your mind.</span> <span id="s127">In other words, what were you thinking about, why didn’t you go ultimately?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Well that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s129">My mother eventually, she survived the war, I told you that.</span> <span id="s130">She eventually went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: In ’48.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Right.</span> <span id="s133">And I did not want to go prior to finishing school.</span> <span id="s134">‘Cause I lost enough years during the war.</span> <span id="s135">From the time I graduated from high school and the whole thing, and I wanted to do something concrete for myself, so that’s when – now I’ll start a new life, I want to be something.</span> <span id="s136">(inaudible)...my education, so that was my aim, and then what happened was the (inaudible) had representatives in Stuttgart...they were pressuring young people to go to Palestine...so I said, ‘Okay, but first I want to finish school.’</span> <span id="s137">...they understood, they knew they’d need engineers, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: ...you were studying engineering...(needs translation)...technical advanced school...</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: ...recognized it’s someplace between a bachelor’s and a master’s</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: ...when you finished...in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: ...I got a degree...they call it ‘Diplom Engineer.’</span> <span id="s142">...and I finished in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Your mother had gone to Israel in ’48.</span> <span id="s144">Was the plan that you would join her there?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yes, my wife and I.</span> <span id="s146">But in the meantime, my wife’s father and brother went to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: So you had to make a choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: We had to make a choice.</span> <span id="s149">And what happened, is that the situation in Israel was very, very bad.</span> <span id="s150">And, -</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Economically - .</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Economic situation, there were no apartments, food was a (?</span> <span id="s153">meyerdink?)</span> <span id="s154">I mean, you can live we found out on little, but...we had no money...the D.P. camp was liquidated because most people left for...the United States...Canada...Palestine...we kind of struggled, but went to school.</span> <span id="s155">We decided we wanted to go on and we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: How did you get to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: So, then, once her father and brother were here...I said, ‘Let’s go to America, first, and then we can decide later on wanting to go to Israel.’</span> <span id="s158">Well once we came here, and you know, in America here I got a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: ...you got here by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: I got here by boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Where did you leave, Bremerhaven?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Right.</span> <span id="s163">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: And what was the name of the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: General Hersy...I was even a Room Leader on the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: What is meant by a ‘Room Leader’ on the boat?</span> <span id="s167">...First, let’s start from the beginning.</span> <span id="s168">The boat was an army boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: It was an army boat, they converted for transporting D.Ps.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: I assume that your father-in-law got you the visa through the help of HIAS.</span> <span id="s171">That he went to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Well, they were looking for people who wanted to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s173">– Actually the HIAS and the JDC (Joint Distribution Committee)...</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Who paid for the transportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: They paid.</span> <span id="s176">And the United States.</span> <span id="s177">That was the D.P. laws.</span> <span id="s178">That’s where the General Hersy comes in.</span> <span id="s179">They didn’t pay, I’m sure they didn’t pay for the transportation.</span> <span id="s180">The United States under the D.P. Act provided probable the cost for the transporting these D.Ps.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Where did you sleep on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: ...it wasn’t that bad.</span> <span id="s183">I can’t remember now.</span> <span id="s184">It was a medium size.</span> <span id="s185">So that was the room I was the leader of that.</span> <span id="s186">Supervise them, was cleaned up, and the beds were made.</span> <span id="s187">–</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: You were appointed as a leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: I was appointed as a leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: To make sure that everybody else kept it clean and –</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Right...a friend...said, ‘if you can, just volunteer that you want to be a Room Leader, you get some privileges.</span> <span id="s192">Small ones.</span> <span id="s193">And then of course, you would not have to do so much the work as the rest of the people.’</span> <span id="s194">It was much work.</span> <span id="s195">Cleaning up, and seeing that, you know, that everything - .</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Was this a common practice, that on each boat, as far as you know, there were Room Leaders?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: And the Captain appointed them?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: No...under the auspices of the (?</span> <span id="s200">Unrath?)</span> <span id="s201">...so (?</span> <span id="s202">Unrath?)</span> <span id="s203">people were on the boat.</span> <span id="s204">And there was a hierarchy of some kind, you know, two, three, four, I don’t know how many they were.</span> <span id="s205">So somebody was in charge of establishing this system of Room Leaders, or Compartment Leaders, they called them.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Do you remember how many people were on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Between 12 and 14 hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Your wife was in a separate section?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: The women’s section was separate...</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: How many days did the voyage take?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Twelve days.</span> <span id="s212">We started about, it’s kind of ironic, you might say, well, it’s kind of coincidentally, it’s a better word.</span> <span id="s213">On September 1st, that’s the date when the war started for us in Poland.</span> <span id="s214">In 1939 the war started, in 1950, eleven years later we were leaving Europe for the United States – and we arrived on the 12th of September.</span> <span id="s215">We arrived actually, the 11th, to be accurate about it.</span> <span id="s216">The rules, they don’t let you disembark in darkness, and so forth, and it was also pretty stormy.</span> <span id="s217">We had some stormy days.</span> <span id="s218">That was a - .</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Did you get seasick?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: I got seasick.</span> <span id="s221">That was a stormy season in September...by the way, it was Rosh Hashanah, too.</span> <span id="s222">So we left on the first day of Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s223">Well, we disembarked.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Wasn’t this a problem, I mean for those who were really religious on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">AL: ...well.</span> <span id="s226">I don’t know if anybody who was religious then...number one, only the portion of people who came over were Jewish.</span> <span id="s227">The great majority was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s230">The D.P. act says, ‘All D.Ps so there were more Poles, and Ukranians...and Lithuanians, and...Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: If this is the case...on some boats, most of them were Jewish, and on other boats, most of them were not.</span> <span id="s232">Now, in your case, most of them were not.</span> <span id="s233">Didn’t you think, and I’m sure it must have crossed your mind, that maybe this guy you’re looking at was some guy who killed Jews during the war?</span> <span id="s234">This Ukranian - .</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: ...but you had no way of knowing.</span> <span id="s236">I didn’t like them, but I was certainly very skeptical about the whole group of Ukranians.</span> <span id="s237">They could have been bastards in the commandos for the Germans where were killing Jews – executioners.</span> <span id="s238">But - .</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: But you had to sleep in the same room with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Well...I had no choice...I went to school this was a question that some people ask, ‘How-how-how can you be in the same room, and sitting on the same bench with Germans who could have been executioners.’</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: I went to a German school in Stuttgart...</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: What do you say to them when they ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I said, ‘You can’t tell.’</span> <span id="s245">Okay you walk the street, you live in an apartment or something, you don’t know, unless you have some proof, and in the meantime, you behave, well, you can’t avoid them.</span> <span id="s246">Some were nice and some were staying away.</span> <span id="s247">Even professors were bastards.</span> <span id="s248">Anti-Semites (inaudible) you felt it in their talking...</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: When you were on the boat, did you have any interaction with the Ukranians?</span> <span id="s250">Did you talk to them, or you just kept to yourself, and - .</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: If they were in my compartment, and I was responsible for the cleanliness or whatever, I’d say, ‘Hey, can you do this and that,’ (inaudible)...that what (inaudible) our contract was.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: What did you do all day on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Nothing special.</span> <span id="s254">If you were sick, you were in trouble.</span> <span id="s255">If you went out I mean, there were several days I was sick.</span> <span id="s256">But my wife wasn’t.</span> <span id="s257">She was one of the few on the boat because the majority on the boat were sick in certain areas, and then we got over with, so...we have pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: ...what did you eat on the boat?</span> <span id="s259">What did they serve?</span> <span id="s260">Good food?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yeh, oh, yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: It was pretty decent.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: As a matter of fact, on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, before we arrived in New York, they gave us a nice dinner for Jewish, kosher dinner, you see, I don’t know if there was any Jewish person on this boat with the ?</span> <span id="s264">Unger?</span> <span id="s265">people.</span> <span id="s266">Apparently there might have been.</span> <span id="s267">But sometimes, many times, they would identify themselves as Jewish, and sometimes they wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s268">But I would assume, they did ask now who’s Jewish and they set up tables for us.</span> <span id="s269">That was a good number of Jews on the boat.</span> <span id="s270">And we ate a dinner with – even gefilte fish, you know from cans, but that’s alright.</span> <span id="s271">You know, they gave us a very nice dinner.</span> <span id="s272">This was on the eve of Rosh Hashanah,,,</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Was anybody davening?</span> <span id="s274">Did they have any services?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: ...yes, there were...we were sitting and the boat was going like this, because the sea was pretty stormy, and the tables had those little barriers around them, so that when the boat will move sideways, if we didn’t hold on to our plate, the plate would slide down to one side.</span> <span id="s276">(inaudible) asked, ‘Did you have a good dinner?’</span> <span id="s277">‘Yah, we had a good dinner,’ this time and we ate you know, I like anybody else...</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Did anything unusual happen to you during those 12 days while you were on the boat as you think back about it?</span> <span id="s279">...did you meet anybody special on the boat?</span> <span id="s280">Did you meet anybody on the boat that you later had contact with in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Well, it’s funny you asked that.</span> <span id="s282">We met two sisters and they were coming from Italy, okay, and while we talked with them, and we just said, ‘Where are you going?’</span> <span id="s283">and it turned out that they were going to Minneapolis...now...we were not going to Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s284">My wife and I were not assigned to Minneapolis...</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: These sisters, were they Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: They were Jewish...one of them was coming to Minneapolis because her boyfriend...she was coming here to marry him, which she did.</span> <span id="s287">And she lives in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s288">We see them.</span> <span id="s289">And the sister, we see less...</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: What were you thinking about?</span> <span id="s291">When you were on the boat, I assume you spent most of the time with your wife.</span> <span id="s292">Were you thinking about your plans, like that you’d want to work as an engineer when you came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: That was my desire.</span> <span id="s294">And you don’t make plans.</span> <span id="s295">I mean, how can you make plans?</span> <span id="s296">And, if you don’t know what (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: But you knew that you had a family.</span> <span id="s298">You had a father-in-law - .</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yah, my wife’s father and brother, they worked here.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: They are also survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: They came after the war to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s304">My brother-in-law I mentioned to you was in camp with me all the time.</span> <span id="s305">We were together.</span> <span id="s306">He was the younger.</span> <span id="s307">My father-in-law has a story of his own.</span> <span id="s308">He is, or was rather, he was a survivor of Auschwitz for a very long time...(needs translation – also inaudible)...</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: So now, when you came, what port did you come in to, New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: We came to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Do you remember the first thing you saw when you came into the harbor?</span> <span id="s312">What did you see?</span> <span id="s313">How did it strike you?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: ...number one.</span> <span id="s315">(inaudible) I remember when we got off the boat, and we went through the medical checks several times...before they let us off the boat, that I remembered.</span> <span id="s316">We went through our x-rays again.</span> <span id="s317">Medical check again.</span> <span id="s318">The last time, you still were not sure whether you were going to – you (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Did you have any injuries?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: We had no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: You didn’t have any injuries during the war that were permanent?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: I didn’t have any injuries in that sense.</span> <span id="s323">No.</span> <span id="s324">But you never knew what was underlying.</span> <span id="s325">What was on your – we knew our hearts were damaged in that sense.</span> <span id="s326">But otherwise, we were hoping we were okay, but you never know.</span> <span id="s327">So we got through, ‘Oh, Thank G-d we are here!’</span> <span id="s328">So we stepped off the boat, we are in America.</span> <span id="s329">And - .</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: They were pretty nice to you, the examining offices, the immigration officials?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Oh, yeh.</span> <span id="s332">Very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Did you go to Ellis Island first?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: No.</span> <span id="s335">Ellis Island was closed up...so, once we got off, we were off.</span> <span id="s336">And at that time, we knew a lady from the J.D.C. from the Joint Distribution Committee, or maybe that was from the HIAS.</span> <span id="s337">Once we are here, the HIAS took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Met you at the pier?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: (illegible in original transcript copy).</span> <span id="s340">They met the group, and I think that we had to have some bags...so she helped us (inaudible) she got us a hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Do you remember which hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: ...it was a very run down...dumpy place.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: So, you were there for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I don’t remember because then they moved us from the hotel and they took us to the HIAS shelter on - .</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: 425 Lafayette Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: ...yes.</span> <span id="s347">That was miserable!</span> <span id="s348">Uch.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s350">Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Because you were in a room with about 400 other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: 400 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I don’t remember now, but there were many, many people...men separate from the women, so my wife didn’t want to be together.</span> <span id="s354">I’m exaggerating probably , but there were a lot of people in the same room, you know and the noise, and you were just sort of – it was all impersonal.</span> <span id="s355">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s356">But we really - .</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Tell me a little more, like the people didn’t care about you, or did you feel that they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: I didn’t know the people...</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: The HIAS.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: By that time, I felt that they didn’t really care very much – you know, because if you are part of a big group, they just couldn’t handle probably...(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Do you think that they were well-meaning, but they were just overwhelmed?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: They could have been well-meaning, but I would say that they were overwhelmed and you know, it gets a little bit indifferent after a while.</span> <span id="s363">We were not the first group.</span> <span id="s364">They probably had been working with groups like that since 1947 maybe, you know, since 1950, so for three years already, so you know, you get a little bit careless...</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Your father-in-law was where?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: He was in Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: ...you said you didn’t intend to come to Minneapolis, but you - .</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: ...I didn’t say that...HIAS assigned not here, not in the United States.</span> <span id="s369">They assigned before you left...</span></p> <p><span id="s370">END OF TAPE ONE—SIDE ONE.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">TAPE ONE---SIDE TWO.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: ...I know in Stuttgart, Mrs. Levine, that was her name, Laura Levine, she had been there for some time, well, we knew her very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: An American?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: An American woman.</span> <span id="s375">She spoke Yiddish too, very well.</span> <span id="s376">So, she was the one who was working on our cases, and visas, and that’s one thing that I will never forget.</span> <span id="s377">Her-her-her attitude about my finishing school.</span> <span id="s378">And she said something, ‘I don’t care interest in that.’</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: She was very negative about it because she wanted us to leave Germany at a certain time and I said, ‘I can’t because I have to get my diploma.’</span> <span id="s381">It so happened I was all done, but the Rector was gone, I don’t know where he was at the time...I said, ‘I have to wait for him, he has to sign it and he has to go through the whole thing.’</span> <span id="s382">She said, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s383">It won’t mean anything in America anyway.’</span> <span id="s384">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Dismissed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: She dismissed it in a very direct and very rude way.</span> <span id="s387">And here I worked my head and my tail off, you know, for all these years.</span> <span id="s388">I was not in the Black Market.</span> <span id="s389">I was not doing anything – except working hard you know, and trying to come to something and she said, [It’s a bunch of nothing, you know, what you are doing, you know, so might as well forget about it.’</span> <span id="s390">And I said, ‘No, I’m not.</span> <span id="s391">If you want to - .’</span> <span id="s392">‘Oh, then you won’t get a visa!’</span> <span id="s393">she says.</span> <span id="s394">‘So, I won’t have a visa.’</span> <span id="s395">(inaudible) If I can’t get a visa, I’m not going to go.</span> <span id="s396">So she kind of, she saw that I meant it.</span> <span id="s397">She was really, she was a - .</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Pretty nasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: She’s (inaudible) now.</span> <span id="s400">She’s not alive any more so I know, but you tell, the Latin saying is about a dead person, you speak either well, or nothing at all.</span> <span id="s401">Well, I - .</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: You can’t help it...(inaudible)...but you know something, Jules, it is important to know how the people were treated.</span> <span id="s403">Good and bad...</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: She might have treated other people well.</span> <span id="s405">And in this particular case we were very disappointed there.</span> <span id="s406">But she was doing her job.</span> <span id="s407">And you would assume – we ourselves wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s408">That was the time when the Korean War was going on and we had enough war, so we didn’t know what was going to happen, how the Russians will react, and what for.</span> <span id="s409">And just being in Germany was enough for five years.</span> <span id="s410">We didn’t want to stay any longer, you know, than we had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: So, how did you get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Well there was no problem getting out, I just told you.</span> <span id="s413">The only problem we had is to wait a little longer until I got everything tied up.</span> <span id="s414">So, once I got my diploma, I got all the medical, all the (illegible in original transcription)....</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: The affidavit had been sent and made out?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: The affidavit had been made out.</span> <span id="s417">See, that was the thing.</span> <span id="s418">That Jewish organizations, the HIAS, or the JDC, or whoever, they were making out affidavits, as the philanthropic organizations.</span> <span id="s419">You could have gotten an affidavit from a private person, a relative or whoever, non-Jews were getting them from churches - .</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Did you get one from your father-in-law or from HIAS?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: No, my father-in-law had nothing.</span> <span id="s422">He came to America just like we did – first of all, he couldn’t get an affidavit for a non-citizen.</span> <span id="s423">You had to be a citizen to be able to (inaudible).</span> <span id="s424">You had to prove that you are financially capable of supporting – naming a person that you wanted to come</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: ...so you went under a group.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: I was under a part of the group, and this was Mrs. Levine’s job in Stuttgart, to do.</span> <span id="s427">And she did.</span> <span id="s428">She did a good job in general.</span> <span id="s429">But, her personality is another story.</span> <span id="s430">(inaudible).</span> <span id="s431">Maybe she had so many problems, troubles, and we joked, you know, she was a single person, maybe she had - .</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Needed a husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Whether she was ever married or not but she was like an old maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Spinster.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Spinster, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: So, how did this relate to Minneapolis?</span> <span id="s437">They put you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s439">Now let me finish.</span> <span id="s440">So, we were assigned...she said, ‘You are going to New York.’</span> <span id="s441">I said, ‘Well, we want to go to Minneapolis.’</span> <span id="s442">‘I can’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s443">Once you are in America, I’ll see what you can do.’</span> <span id="s444">Whatever, I don’t remember the exact words...okay, so let’s get to America first.</span> <span id="s445">So we did get to America, and we got through the formalities, and they established us in this little hotel for a while, and then we got to Lafayette Street.</span> <span id="s446">Then, we started working on it.</span> <span id="s447">We wanted to go to Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s448">And they were not very out-going, so, ‘Okay, we’ll help you.</span> <span id="s449">We want people to leave New York.’</span> <span id="s450">Instead, they said, ‘Look, those crazy.’</span> <span id="s451">‘Cause everybody wants to come to New York.</span> <span id="s452">We send to Baltimore, we send here, we send there, they want to come to New York, you are in New York and you want to leave here and go to Minneapolis?</span> <span id="s453">(inaudible-?</span> <span id="s454">G-d knows where the Indians were?)</span> <span id="s455">.</span> <span id="s456">So, we said, ‘Yah, we want to go there.’</span> <span id="s457">So, it took some several weeks.</span> <span id="s458">First we didn’t mind being in New York.</span> <span id="s459">After all, you know, you come to New York, and you are supported in a way, you know, and it was very, very, very limited, naturally, you know, but still, no, but then we got to know a little bit New York with the friends who at that time they lived in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s460">They helped us, they took us out, we didn’t speak any English...</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Who took you around?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Our friends the ones who had come before...after about 5, 6 weeks, they said, ‘Okay, now you are getting out of Lafayette.</span> <span id="s463">I don’t remember how much time we spend...but they said, ‘Okay, you can go find yourself an apartment.’</span> <span id="s464">So we did.</span> <span id="s465">We lived in – 94th Street near Riverside Drive...</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: ...nice area.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yah, the area was very – at that time we could even go out in the night and walk around.</span> <span id="s468">It was 1950, mind you, that’s not bad.</span> <span id="s469">This was...the end of October...it was great - .</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: A loving room, a kitchenette, and at least we had privacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: What was the rent?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s474">They paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: ...in other words, they found you the room?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Either they found us the room or they gave us the privilege of finding the room ourselves.</span> <span id="s477">And these people, Lipson’s lived not far, and they say, ‘Look around here, there are rooms for rent, maybe you can find – it’s okay with the authorities.’</span> <span id="s478">So that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Where did Lipson live?</span> <span id="s480">What Street?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: 93rd – I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: On West Avenue and Riverside Drive you had big fancy buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Well the buildings maybe fancy, but some of them are kind of, you couldn’t see the Sound anymore out of the window (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: You couldn’t see the Sound especially if you had a back apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s486">That’s what I had...we could walk down Broadway ourselves, just from 93rd...between Broadway and West End...we could walk at night and we could meet people.</span> <span id="s487">All the stores were open, it was really (inaudible).</span> <span id="s488">Today you wouldn’t probably dare.</span> <span id="s489">It’s - .</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Was this in general an area where HIAS found places for survivors to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I’m not sure because – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s492">You asked me the question whether HIAS found a place for us.</span> <span id="s493">They could have suggested or we ourselves found it, and they had to approve it, I don’t remember now.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: When you got this apartment, you then decided that you were going to look for work in your field?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: No, not in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: You still wanted to go - .</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: This was the point.</span> <span id="s498">They said it will take time.</span> <span id="s499">That’s why they allowed us to go get this apartment.</span> <span id="s500">So then they started working on it.</span> <span id="s501">And - .</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: You had to go to their office once in a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Oh, yeh!</span> <span id="s504">Not only this, we had to give them reports, I think, what we are doing, whatever.</span> <span id="s505">Anyway, we kept after them too, because we didn’t know whether they were working on it or not.</span> <span id="s506">So they’d say, ‘Yah, we are.’</span> <span id="s507">And, so, eventually, they let us know that they got permission.</span> <span id="s508">Now, according to them, and I believe it, since we were – assigned to New York, they probably had to make some changes in reporting to the (?</span> <span id="s509">I.N.S.?)</span> <span id="s510">perhaps, alright, that we’ll be leaving and going to another place.</span> <span id="s511">Not that we would have been prevented from it, you know, by law or something, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s512">But maybe it was in their interest to do something.</span> <span id="s513">So, it took a while.</span> <span id="s514">It took us 7 weeks, really, to leave New York.</span> <span id="s515">On the 50th day we left New York and went to Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Did you ever hear of an organization called, ‘USNA?’</span> <span id="s517">(United Service for New Americans).</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: No...NYANA (New York Association for New Arrivals)...</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: What did you have dealings with NYANA about?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: NYANA was part of HIAS...I think we probably dealt with them rather than HIAS directly, because we were in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Did you feel that when you talked to the HIAS people that they understood what you had gone through during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: No.</span> <span id="s523">They were not very friendly, they were not very forthcoming.</span> <span id="s524">Frankly, it is bad to say it, because eventually, (inaudible) they could have done it with more grace, more understanding, more – I don’t know – I wouldn’t ask for sympathy but at least more (needs translation – menschlekite?)</span> <span id="s525">you know?</span> <span id="s526">A little warmth.</span> <span id="s527">Softness.</span> <span id="s528">Many times they were rude because we were these – first we couldn’t communicate with them in English, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: And they didn’t know Yiddish?</span> <span id="s530">.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Some who worked did know Yiddish.</span> <span id="s532">They had to because that’s the only communication unless they had somebody who translated for them.</span> <span id="s533">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s534">And they kind of looked down on us, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Greener?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Not only ‘greener’ but you know here’s the lowest of the lowest, you know.</span> <span id="s537">And we were very, very offended by it because we were probably higher in our own environment than some of these people were.</span> <span id="s538">I’m not saying this but some of them certainly, but we were very, very hurt by them, by this attitude.</span> <span id="s539">I don’t know whether they, they became so as I said before...insensitive, because – maybe even callous because they had to do with different kinds of people for the last three, four, five years maybe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s540">– But I would say, if I remember, we did not like their attitude and their, their, their whole total behavior towards us.</span> <span id="s541">Maybe we felt that we should-not that we didn’t expect anything special, just, you know, a little smile, and a few good words would have done a lot - .</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: In what way did they show themselves to be insensitive when you think back, was there any particular incidence or - &gt;</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: No, I don’t remember now.</span> <span id="s544">If you asked for something that needs to be done, ‘Okay, it’s all done,” you know, this kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Leave us alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Leave us alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: How did you communicate in your neighborhood.</span> <span id="s548">Let’s say you had to go to the grocery store, and buy some food or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: ...(parts inaudible)...you’re not kidding.</span> <span id="s550">We didn’t know what we are picking from the cart to eat.</span> <span id="s551">You know, the number one today, number two tomorrow.</span> <span id="s552">And that happened, really.</span> <span id="s553">My wife, she was a little better in English.</span> <span id="s554">She had taken some during the war.</span> <span id="s555">I didn’t have time in Germany to spend on anything except studying, and here, you know, so I didn’t have any time to learn English.</span> <span id="s556">When I came, I was completely ‘green.’</span> <span id="s557">Literally, as far as the language was concerned.</span> <span id="s558">But little by little you pick up a few words (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s559">not?)</span> <span id="s560">too many.</span> <span id="s561">You go to a grocery store, you just point what you want, and you know - .</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: What did you think of America when you first came in?</span> <span id="s563">What was your first impression?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: New York – is a cute city and very interesting, but doesn’t give you the best impression.</span> <span id="s565">We were used to (inaudible) cleanliness in Germany.</span> <span id="s566">You know – even the buildings you know, here you come to New York, first we live in this crummy hotel (short laughs), and we stayed in Lafayette, you know in this huge rooms and all, and the noise which, - I don’t want to present myself as something special, I mean, but you stay with people, right, and they all Jewish people (inaudible) Lafayette, but not all people would have been my friends before the war, during the war, we just happened to go through the same problems, but some of them were not my type of people, so – but you are kind of pushed into a situation where you find yourself not very willingly.</span> <span id="s567">That’s alright.</span> <span id="s568">I didn’t have any problems with anybody - .</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: But what about the black people?</span> <span id="s570">You had never seen them before?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: ...yah, we saw some in Germany, soldiers...I worked for Americans...for a while...this was the occupation...it was only a few weeks after Germany was occupied...</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: ...so you got your first impression of Americans, really, from these soldiers in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Oh, yah.</span> <span id="s574">That was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: So, you had a positive view.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yah, it was positive.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Do you remember, when you came in, you came in, in the daytime?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: ...the boat anchored outside the harbor.</span> <span id="s579">That’s where had our dinner, and so on...it was erev Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s580">But the next day we got off the boat...it took several hours...</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Did you see the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s583">We saw it - .</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: What did you think of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: ...we were very excited, naturally (inaudible).</span> <span id="s586">‘Where’s – where’s,’ they ask, ‘Where is it?</span> <span id="s587">Where is it?’</span> <span id="s588">You know, everybody want to see it.</span> <span id="s589">It’s early morning, it’s in a fog and maybe on the other side - .</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: People were crowding the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: People were crowding the boat.</span> <span id="s592">I remember 34th Street...this friend...who wrote to me about getting a function as a Compartment Leader.</span> <span id="s593">He came to see us.</span> <span id="s594">And then he took me to New Jersey – the same day or the next day...we went to synagogue, you see because we came on Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s595">Here we are.</span> <span id="s596">You know, just happened to be.</span> <span id="s597">So, those people – who brought - .</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: That was kind of bad, because you know, you felt after all, it’s Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s600">I don’t remember – you see, there was not enough time because the boat was anchored outside the port and when they came in early morning and they started going through the last questionnaires and how things checks and everything, I suspect that people from INS – from the offices in New York came on the boat and they must have done the last checks.</span> <span id="s601">– So, you go through all this, I don’t think anybody was think of davening or anything for Rosh Hashanah.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: But you walked into a shul on Rosh Hashanah?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: ...I think this friend took me to New Jersey to his uncle...I don’t remember...maybe the next day, probably he took me to a shul...he lived in Washington Heights...</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: And he took you to shul there?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: He took me to shul there, that I remember, yah.</span> <span id="s606">The next day I asked him and then, when we went with him out in the middle of Manhattan,...people were standing in line.</span> <span id="s607">I don’t if that was Rosh Hashanah or maybe it was on Succot.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Standing in line to get in?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Standing in line.</span> <span id="s610">I said, ‘What’s this line for?</span> <span id="s611">[ He said, ‘Well, that’s a synagogue and people are waiting to get in.’</span> <span id="s612">I said, ‘Waiting to get in?’</span> <span id="s613">He said, ‘Yah, they come, they work, and they probably come for Yizkor or something.</span> <span id="s614">So they come in and then (illegible in original transcription) .</span> <span id="s615">I said, ‘Really?’</span> <span id="s616">I said, ‘This America, (inaudible – needs translation?)</span> <span id="s617">.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: What shocked you about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Well, it was very unnatural, you know.</span> <span id="s620">We were not used to anything like - .</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: What were you used to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: You went to shul, you stayed in shul, you had Yizkor, you finished all the services, you go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: You mean, not that you just come for one service and then you leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Come for a piece of the service, and then go back to work, that was very, very unusual...</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: So, you’re there, and you’re there for 7 weeks.</span> <span id="s626">Did you find that the average American in the street was the friendly type, or not the friendly type?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Yah, they were very – if you asked for - .</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: They tried to help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: I would say yes.</span> <span id="s630">We were asking directions, or something, obviously, if I asked, my English was so limited and so non-existent almost – so when I was with my wife, - ‘Hey, you ask.</span> <span id="s631">You can ask better than me.’</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: So, now you got ready to go after 7 weeks, you went to Minneapolis, I guess you went to the train at Grand Central Station?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: ...friends...escorted us...we went on the Pennsylvania...34th Street...we got to Chicago the next morning and transferred in Chicago to Minneapolis and (inaudible) about 24 hour ride.</span> <span id="s634">In the meantime we found that they stole our things from us.</span> <span id="s635">Because what happened is our friends, unbeknown to them, they packed for us certain things, and apparently it was too big for the train.</span> <span id="s636">So on the train they said, ‘You can’t take it!’</span> <span id="s637">And here we are, we have to leave the train station.</span> <span id="s638">We couldn’t go back.</span> <span id="s639">And the ticket, I don’t know couldn’t be changed and they would be waiting for us, so with all this, so they said, ‘We’ll replace it.</span> <span id="s640">We’ll pack and repack it for you.’</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Who said ‘We?’</span> <span id="s642">The porters?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I don’t know who at the time.</span> <span id="s644">Somebody at the train station.</span> <span id="s645">So we hoped.</span> <span id="s646">We paid something for it.</span> <span id="s647">And we trusted these nice people who wanted to help us (laughs) – How disappointed we were –that they stole things.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: This was your luggage?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: ...yah, one of the suitcases...so, they repacked it but certain things were missing, you know, when they arrived in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s650">But that, so that was again a bad impression - .</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: - we were dumb that – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s653">We just trusted, that’s all.</span> <span id="s654">We didn’t figure anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: What was the train ride itself?</span> <span id="s656">I mean, here you were seeing the rest of America, now.</span> <span id="s657">Not New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Well, yes and no.</span> <span id="s659">It was interesting, but then we got – the train in Chicago, transferred from one train to another because the train only went from New York to Chicago...this was November 2nd, already, you see we left New York November 1st, 1950, the next day.</span> <span id="s660">We were tired, you know, I mean the train and whatever, so here we go, and from Chicago as we go further west...the area was so desolate to us.</span> <span id="s661">It’s the time of the year when there’s no greenery, nothing, no leaves on the trees and we go to see the Mississippi River which we never DREAMT in our lives that we’ll see, you know, here we are in America, seeing this river, but the scenery was just foreboding.</span> <span id="s662">And you – we thought, ‘My G-d, where are we going?</span> <span id="s663">It looked like Siberia outside - .’</span> <span id="s664">Well, we arrived, and I see those little houses and farms, and so, but we didn’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s665">So, that was the orientation.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: ...you were going at night so you really couldn’t see much...</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: That’s right...</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Did you meet anybody on the train, or you just sat by yourselves?</span> <span id="s669">Who met you when you got to Minneapolis?</span> <span id="s670">Relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: (inaudible) my brother-in-law (?)</span> <span id="s672">.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: What was your first impression of Minneapolis?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: We wanted to rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: You were exhausted...you didn’t ride in a Pullman car?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: HIAS paid for the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: I would assume – yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: So, now, when you were greeted there, what was that like?</span> <span id="s680">There must have been a tremendously emotional reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Well there was a year and a half, even, less then since they had left Europe, you know.</span> <span id="s682">They were only here about a year - .</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: They had also gotten in through HIAS on a group affidavit?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yes...but they were sent to Minneapolis...you don’t argue unless people had some relatives, or friends, or something, then they say, ‘No, I don’t want to go to Minneapolis, I want to go to New York.’</span> <span id="s685">It didn’t really matter whether it was Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: ...do you know why they sent people to Kansas City, Minneapolis...</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: ...they had to distribute the numbers of people to where they would be supported by your local communities...the Federations of the different cities, here it is called, ‘Minneapolis Federation for Jewish Service.’</span> <span id="s688">In St. Paul, it is called, ‘United Council in Service,’...</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: did they give you any money for support?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">QW: ...how much?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s693">Once we got here...they said, ‘You have a father and brother, they got a job, they are able to support you,’...for a short time if it’s a medical cost or something they did – (give money).</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: ...American Jews here felt that the immigrants would be better received in America if they weren’t all concentrated in one large city...and they felt that the immigrants would be force to become ‘Americans’ more quickly if they went to small communities.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: That’s true.</span> <span id="s696">I’m there are people who have lived in New York all their lives and –</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: And still speak Yiddish all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: ...but they hardly speak any English.</span> <span id="s699">And then, you know, they did not get out of this old – country.</span> <span id="s700">So I would say, it’s probably true.</span> <span id="s701">We probably learned English faster here because we were forced into it.</span> <span id="s702">It’s true.</span> <span id="s703">If you live in your own environment you don’t care so much.</span> <span id="s704">But we were living in a (inaudible) environment, and we had to go find jobs that commensurate with our abilities and our education.</span> <span id="s705">And little by little, we became more Americanized.</span> <span id="s706">True.</span> <span id="s707">In that respect, I believe it...but they couldn’t have sent so many people here, so many people there...if the local people would not support.</span> <span id="s708">I mean, you need it...</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Were you offered any psychological counseling?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: No, no, never.</span> <span id="s711">Not one thing.</span> <span id="s712">And I don’t think we needed it from them, but the psychological – unless your talking about getting used to the United States and getting to understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s713">Maybe they said something in Lafayette.</span> <span id="s714">I don’t even remember that.</span> <span id="s715">If they did...without trying to brag or something, we were a little more sophisticated (inaudible) than the average.</span> <span id="s716">We were educated, both my wife and I, and, you know, we had some sense of what we wanted to do.</span> <span id="s717">And, even though I didn’t speak the language, but, you know, as far as our backgrounds go, so, I don’t think that we needed that much of psychology.</span> <span id="s718">It would have been okay to get some kind of education, what’s its all about.</span> <span id="s719">And we might have something.</span> <span id="s720">I don’t even remember that.</span> <span id="s721">Maybe we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Sometimes they sent people to night school to learn English.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: (inaudible) that I did....but that’s again, because...the Jewish Family and Children’s Service did – I suppose if some day we needed psychological help, if they would have determined, they sent to doctor’s, and whatever – but as far as English, yes, they had.</span> <span id="s724">They had for New Americans, English classes in the city too and I went.</span> <span id="s725">Sure I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Here in Minneapolis?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s728">But not the HIAS, not the JC, not the Federation established these classes.</span> <span id="s729">The classes were in a Junior High School, and a lady teacher taught English, and I went as long as I thought it did me some good, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: What was that like?</span> <span id="s731">Did you meet other survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Yah, I met other survivors.</span> <span id="s733">And I remember when I arrived in Minneapolis – in November, and I meet a couple three weeks later and I started going to these classes and – after Christmas time I went, and I think I continued on through the end of that school year.</span> <span id="s734">And then that was it.</span> <span id="s735">I didn’t go any further, because I felt that I didn’t get anything more out of it then was possible.</span> <span id="s736">So I – by then I was learning as I worked, (inaudible) in the meantime of course, I started to work right in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: ...again, with the Jewish Family Children’s Service had also, well, they had the caseworkers.</span> <span id="s739">They were looking for work for you.</span> <span id="s740">They ask for your background and so on, right, so I told them what my background was.</span> <span id="s741">I had a degree, ‘Oh, but you do know the language?</span> <span id="s742">And, ‘I don’t know the language, but I want to learn the language.</span> <span id="s743">And I don’t expect to become a full – fledged engineer right away,’ but so, whatever.</span> <span id="s744">Well, they found a job that had to do as much with engineering as whatever – putting up television antennas on roofs.</span> <span id="s745">That was my first job in Minneapolis.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: ...you worked here...as an engineer?</span> <span id="s747">...</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: ...working at different jobs, it didn’t take me that long.</span> <span id="s749">In December, - 1951, which is just a little over a year after I came to Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s750">I came November 2nd, and this was December 27th, 1951, I was hired by the utility here.</span> <span id="s751">The Northern State Power Company, on a probationary basis, because you know, my language, my background, and so they didn’t know, so they said, ‘We’ll hire you to try for six months.’</span> <span id="s752">Well, I stayed there 33 years and 2 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Wow!</span> <span id="s754">.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: That’s was when I retired.</span> <span id="s756">So, I kind of proved myself somewhat (inaudible).</span> <span id="s757">Obviously, I got up in my status and so on.</span> <span id="s758">My wife, on the other hand, she went back to school here, because when she came, she was not completed – she had not completed her studies.</span> <span id="s759">So she went back for a master’s degree at the University of Minnesota and got her master’s degree in Economics.</span> <span id="s760">Political Science and Economics.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: ...what did she do with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: But then she went as a, she couldn’t get a job.</span> <span id="s763">Because this was something that the international companies – at the time, they were really not hiring Jews.</span> <span id="s764">And they not wanting women.</span> <span id="s765">Jews maybe, but she was a woman and then a married one.</span> <span id="s766">So they told her.</span> <span id="s767">‘We can’t hire you.’</span> <span id="s768">Now, they wouldn’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Your main language now, when you speak, when you read.</span> <span id="s770">You read in English everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Oh, yah, that’s (inaudible) many years.</span> <span id="s772">Even if I write letters to my friends in Israel in Polish, I have to use the dictionary, you know – yah, my Polish has gotten so poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Did you belong to any organizations...here.</span> <span id="s774">.</span> <span id="s775">and which ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: There was a Newcomer’s Organization...lasted very long, a few years.</span> <span id="s777">I was a member.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: ...what was it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: ‘New Home Club.’</span> <span id="s780">I think that was what it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: What did they do?</span> <span id="s782">They had parties?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: They just got together, and talked and that time probably talked more Yiddish than – there were some people.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Had any activities?</span> <span id="s785">Any dinners, any parties?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: ...I wasn’t really active.</span> <span id="s787">I just came to a few meetings.</span> <span id="s788">I wasn’t – my father-in-law, I remember, was more active, but he’s gone...what other organizations do I belong?</span> <span id="s789">Well, there was in our synagogue, Married Couples League.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: You belonged to a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: We’ve been members for many years...</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: It’s a Conservative synagogue, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Yah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: And how often do you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Very often...</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Every Shabbas?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Almost every Shabbas.</span> <span id="s798">Not ‘almost’ but every Shabbas, every Yom Tov.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Your name in Europe was a religious one...</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: (illegible in original transcription).</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: I assumed you believed in G-d throughout.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Uh – umm (indicates a yes).</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Do you think that your belief in G-d played any kind of role in your own survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: (long pause) I think so.</span> <span id="s805">It’s, ahh, kind of a hard question, as you said, because it was a dichotomy to not believe in G-d, you know, here you see those terrible things happening, you know, and yet you hang on to this little thin thread of hope and hoping that G-d will help me, you know, that’s, will it?</span> <span id="s806">You know that’s very – so it’s a who deserves that, you know, how can you believe in G-d when you see all these terrible things right in front of your eyes.</span> <span id="s807">Including your family, relatives, friends, everybody going.</span> <span id="s808">So you sort of – and yet you hang in with this idea that maybe not that you hope that you’ll be the only one, but maybe things will change.</span> <span id="s809">You waiting more for to be a witness of the enemies damage – demise.</span> <span id="s810">Then you hope that you survive, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: But how do you explain that the Holocaust took place, if you do believe in G-d?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s813">Nobody can explain.</span> <span id="s814">The very religious have an answer that’s.</span> <span id="s815">you know, we sinned, and we – don’t know what’s happening.</span> <span id="s816">G-d has some, I don’t know, his own designs in the Universe and this is a part of it, so.</span> <span id="s817">If you want to explain it this way, maybe it’s true, maybe it isn’t true, maybe this is a good explanation, who knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Do you accept that?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: I really don’t know whether I’ll accept that because it’s – what will happen a thousand years from now, in the long term design, is not (illegible in original transcription).</span> <span id="s820">But, it is a very, very difficult problem, you know, to - .</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Do you think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: - to reconcile the things that one went through with the fact that well, I’m here, you know, but everybody else may not be, but I am, and you know, gone through in spite of everything.</span> <span id="s823">How do you take it?</span> <span id="s824">It’s – it’s – it’s must be something – higher power, so you believe in G-d’s design.</span> <span id="s825">But what, what am I?</span> <span id="s826">A little tiny bit and G-d designed that I am here.</span> <span id="s827">This is, you see, this is the part of the guilt feeling too, that you know, that I am the only one from the family.</span> <span id="s828">It’s very, very difficult – but you hang on to it, - .</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Why feel guilty, if you didn’t do anything actively to have it turn out this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Well, you know very well, you know that a person even in normal times, that a member of the family dies, you know, and the rest of the family sort of feels guilty, (inaudible) maybe we should have done this, or that, or else you know, if a younger person goes, and an older is alive, they see he’s gone, or she’s gone, and I am still around, whether it’s a mother or a grandmother, it happens.</span> <span id="s831">So this is the same – well, it’s even more so, because I’m the only one.</span> <span id="s832">The only one from my father’s family to (inaudible).</span> <span id="s833">There’s nobody that I know, (inaudible) that anybody from my father’s side.</span> <span id="s834">From my mother’s family - .</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q:

didn’t know, it didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s893">But I could have felt maybe certain things, you know.</span> <span id="s894">It was more a matter maybe of jealousy that here you know, here’s this newcomer who doesn’t speak perfect English, you know, this kind of thing, and maybe their responses could have been a little different.</span> <span id="s895">But, not really, I can’t complain about that.</span> <span id="s896">If anything, you know, some people would come after years that I had been here, my English was not too bad, and I knew how to spell much better than some of the people.</span> <span id="s897">They would come and say, ‘Hey, is that alright?’</span> <span id="s898">and ask me in a sentence, and so on, so in that respect, that improved.</span></p> <p><span

matter of coincidences, and the matter of survival was luck, that’s – you know, there was no – nothing that you could co, no matter how you used your wits and be smart, and you know figure out all in ahead of time, on occasions you could, but as a whole, you never knew.</span> <span id="s987">You could 99% of the time you could do all the right things.</span> <span id="s988">But this one time you didn’t.</span> <span id="s989">You couldn’t, because it was not in your control.</span> <span id="s990">In other words, our lives were not directed by ourselves, and whatever you did, (inaudible) see, if I do this and this okay, I can probably survive.</span> <span id="s991">There was no such guarantee.</span> <span id="s992">I’ll give you one example.</span> <span id="s993">It doesn’t mean anything as far as life is concerned, but you could outwit somebody and I went (inaudible)...having photographs of your nearest – your parents, your sister and so forth, was a great thing to have, because many people just walked out of the houses, or things were taken away from them, in camps and they had none.</span> <span id="s994">I had a few photographs, alright.</span> <span id="s995">And

tried to steal the shoes in Dachau...at night...the shoes were under my head...as I slept...a Ukranian tried to pull out the shoes and I screamed...the shoes were there, but the pictures disappeared...</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: You never found them again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: I did.</span> <span id="s1008">This is the beauty of the story.</span> <span

words, they had big steel grates, you know you couldn’t communicate – you weren’t suppose to.</span> <span id="s1011">‘Hey, did you lose something?’</span> <span id="s1012">And I said, before I had a chance to even say ‘Yes, yes!’</span> <span id="s1013">A package flies out from there.</span> <span id="s1014">I never knew how the package got there.</span> <span id="s1015">I didn’t know who the

now, as a result of all these Holocaust films and everything that American Jews have a better understanding of what the survivors went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Oh, yah, they

a less of a possibility because people are of course imbued with other things and only chauvinism.</span> <span id="s1063">And you see those anti-Semitic groups, and the white power party, and - .</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: What do you think of them?</span> <span id="s1065">Do they scare you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: It scares me by a lot...they showed them on television.</span> <span id="s1067">I would rather object even though, you know I am for freedom of the press and so on and so forth, but I would rather see that they don’t give these the publicity,
