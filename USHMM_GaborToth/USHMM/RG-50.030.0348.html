D-a-v-i-s.</span> <span id="s21">I was born in Lodz, Poland on November 12, 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">01:01:47</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: We were just two children at home when we grow up.</span> <span id="s25">My self, I was the older one, the oldest and my brother who is a few years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s26">My brother is still alive.</span> <span id="s27">We come from a very caring family.</span> <span id="s28">My father was the sole supporter of the family at this time, and my mother was - He was a textile designer.</span> <span id="s29">He managed a textile mill with 300 people.</span> <span id="s30">My mother was a housewife.</span> <span id="s31">And they're very loving and very devoted to the family, my parents.</span> <span id="s32">So, I grew up, they were very charitable, you know, orthodox people but at the same time they were interested what's going on in the world.</span> <span id="s33">They read papers, they spoke a few languages, except Yiddish, we spoke at home Yiddish.</span> <span id="s34">That's why I know to speak Yiddish very well.</span> <span id="s35">Never forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">01:03:23 Just, you know, middle income people.</span> <span id="s37">At the summer, when I was younger, my mother used to go -- the climate is like, winters are very cold in Europe, in this part of Europe, and summers are hot but dry, so she used to go when we were small, she used to go to the country.</span> <span id="s38">So, I remember that time in the woods and it was very nice.</span> <span id="s39">Later on when I was older and I went to high school, I loved to travel so I just traveled the whole Poland with groups, with students and things like that.</span> <span id="s40">Later on I didn't want to go with my mother.</span> <span id="s41">So, what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">01:04:13</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What about your schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: First I went to public school and then they sent me to private, one of the best private schools in town.</span> <span id="s45">I'll tell you about the city a little bit, Lodz.</span> <span id="s46">Lodz is called the Polish Manchester.</span> <span id="s47">That's the city of fabrics.</span> <span id="s48">It's just they make fabrics, not, like lining, linen fabrics.</span> <span id="s49">Not very expensive fabrics like woolens, there were other cities in Poland.</span> <span id="s50">It was mostly, in, maybe one third of the population, about 100,000 at that time, maybe a few years before the war, there were 100,000 Germans living in Lodz.</span> <span id="s51">They were mostly professionals working in the textile business.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">01:05:14 My father was a very reputable man in the community; they used to ask him all the time when people had a dispute, to, according he was learned in, little in the Talmud and they didn't want to go to court, they would ask, I'm talking about Jewish people.</span> <span id="s53">They would ask; he, Raul would know what means, "Beit Din"(?)</span> <span id="s54">[court of Jewish law] --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: No, talk to me please.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: O.k.</span> <span id="s57">He would know, he would understand what means -- to make a judgment, he'd listen to both sides and they will obey for that what, my husband think, he has to be a very respectable person.</span> <span id="s58">Sometimes he did that just for no money, just to help out people.</span> <span id="s59">He always tried that he get, you know, it was at the times the government in Poland was not anti-semitic, but the people were.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">01:06:26 See, it's different, and you live with the people, right?</span> <span id="s61">So he tried to see that some Jewish people will be employed in the factory; it would depend on my father.</span> <span id="s62">He tried.</span> <span id="s63">Even the owners didn't, they were our family, the name of the factory was Prechegubski(ph.).</span> <span id="s64">It was cousins that he worked for.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">01:06:51 So, we were very comfortable before the war.</span> <span id="s66">They sent me to high school, the best high school in town.</span> <span id="s67">When you graduated high school you had to take five years Hebrew, five years a foreign language, I took German, five years Latin.</span> <span id="s68">So, you can imagine when you graduated school it's like two years college in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">01:07:18</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: This was a Jewish high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: I mean, it's not, it's not, it hasn't anything to do about religion.</span> <span id="s72">It's not like a shiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: But the students were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Mostly, yes, mostly.</span> <span id="s75">Anybody else could go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of the Jewish community in Lodz and whether you mixed with Gentiles that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: We mix with Gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">01:07:50 Yes, if we had some neighbors, mostly where we lived, it were like, we had about three addresses where we lived a long time in Lodz.</span> <span id="s79">Mostly were Jewish people, but some we had very good relations with people.</span> <span id="s80">My parents were respected and loved in the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">01:08:16</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Was there sort of a rich Jewish community culturally and politically that you were part of?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: I tell you, this I tell you, we had a really Jewish observant home.</span> <span id="s84">All the holidays, all the Saturdays and everything was really observed.</span> <span id="s85">When I became a teenager, I belonged to a Zionist organization, the Herzlia.</span> <span id="s86">I never did anything that will, most my, my parents didn't know that I belonged to that organization.</span> <span id="s87">Because either they were for it that a Jewish state should be established, that we'd have a place to go like we used to have a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">01:09:24 Girls were raised at that time not to have special, that they get independent, that they get a trade to make for the future.</span> <span id="s89">Not always stay with parents, stay 20 years with the parents and then you live by yourself and get married and have a family and children.</span> <span id="s90">Well, I had different ideas.</span> <span id="s91">I wanted to first, I don't know where I got the idea, but I had my idea, I wanted to be independent.</span> <span id="s92">Wherever I go and whatever I'm going to be; that was before the war.</span> <span id="s93">That I can make a living somehow and not be dependent on anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">01:10:09</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: So, what was the value of this Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s96">Why were you doing it and what did they teach?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: The goal is to bring the youth, everybody that wanted to go to Israel had to go as a pioneer and it was called the Aliyah Bet.</span> <span id="s98">That means illegal immigration.</span> <span id="s99">Because it was the English mandate, you know.</span> <span id="s100">First before were the Turks, then the English came and they didn't let anybody in.</span> <span id="s101">People had to smuggle in the boats and things.</span> <span id="s102">So, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">01:10:45 It was to bring up now like we want to bring up the Jewish youth will remember the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s104">At that time, it was that the Jewish youth for the future they will come and settle in Palestine, that was Palestine, right, and build a land and politically, that we can, what happened after the war, but had to be a Hitler first, to bring a Jewish state.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">01:11:16</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: So, before the war you felt strongly about Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Right, about the Jewish state, yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">01:11:24</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Now, you had a large German community.</span> <span id="s110">What did you know about Hitler and Nazism in Germany proper at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Ah, we, we watched that.</span> <span id="s112">And in 1933, when Hitler was first legally voted and became the chancellor and he made the -- he burned the Reichstag and the [authors] and the books, so we were very well informed what's going on.</span> <span id="s113">We couldn't imagine what a magnitude and what it's going to be.</span> <span id="s114">A lot of people who had a lot of money could make plans and go elsewhere.</span> <span id="s115">The border's open if you have a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">01:12:12 But if you're middle income people and you have no, you live, maybe you have some savings, you can't just afford to escape, even before the war, some years before you can even plan about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">01:12:26 I remember one incident and that lasts for me forever.</span> <span id="s118">I was home by myself and came at the door a vendor.</span> <span id="s119">He was a German, and he wanted to sell me something.</span> <span id="s120">I didn't have no idea and nothing on my mother wanted it, I said I'm sorry, I just don't need anything, nobody's home and I won't buy anything from you, and thank you.</span> <span id="s121">And you know what he told me.</span> <span id="s122">He told me I, this with angry and with such a hate, he told me now wait until Hitler will come and you see what happen to you Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">01:13:19</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Did you take that threat seriously?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: You know, it made a, because it happened and because of the outcome, I've never forget this.</span> <span id="s126">That's why so many years -- That was maybe two years before the war.</span> <span id="s127">So, you know how the Germans were very, and a lot of Poles collaborated with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">01:13:44</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: At the time '38, '39, were you finished with school?</span> <span id="s130">Were you working?</span> <span id="s131">What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: I was going part time to college, what Lodz had to offer, it was called Wszechnica(ph.).</span> <span id="s133">That was like free university.</span> <span id="s134">I always took classes in art.</span> <span id="s135">I was interested in fashion design and always wanted to paint.</span> <span id="s136">I never had time.</span> <span id="s137">I was designing clothes and I was taking courses in fashion design.</span> <span id="s138">I was very good at it.</span> <span id="s139">What other people took in two years, I made in one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">01:14;30 The teacher that was there she said, there were some students that were with me in the high school, she said, well this one must be an apprentice somewhere.</span> <span id="s141">Because how did she know, in Poland at that time you just didn't go to school and learn a trade.</span> <span id="s142">You were sitting for a couple of years in a, with a dressmaker, a good one and you learned the trade that way.</span> <span id="s143">Didn't get paid anything, beginning.</span> <span id="s144">That was apprenticeship.</span> <span id="s145">So, she said, she must have been -- and there was one that went to me to school, she said no, no, we just graduated school last year and she never went to, she wasn't apprentice, no place.</span> <span id="s146">She couldn't understand; and you know what, I envy that teacher of mine, I remember her name, that I want to be once and do what she does.</span> <span id="s147">And that realize, I was teaching the same way she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">01:15:37</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: How did all this change and when did it change?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well then, in 1939 the war came.</span> <span id="s151">Lodz was not far from the German border.</span> <span id="s152">By September 8, the city of Lodz was occupied without any opposition.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">01:16:02 There was no -- Warsaw it took them to take, six weeks it took them, until they take that part of Poland, but Lodz they took without a shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">01:16:11 So, the Germans came with a big parade with the tanks and with the airplanes on top, and people, when the day would, people come, there was a, I remember, was like an exodus.</span> <span id="s155">People were, whatever they could, they put, you know, bundles and things.</span> <span id="s156">Whoever had cars had the car in, had horse with a buggy, whoever buy food; and people try escape the city towards Warsaw.</span> <span id="s157">On that road, so many people got killed because the Germans flew over their heads and they were throwing, you know, shooting.</span> <span id="s158">And the screaming was, like -- A lot of people never made the destination where they wanted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">01:16:56 Some wanted to run away to Russia.</span> <span id="s160">Russia later on was no picnic either because what they did to one they escaped, they put them to jail, sent them to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">01:17:10 So, and then they came in September.</span> <span id="s162">We know the things, but we couldn't imagine what is waiting for us.</span> <span id="s163">We just couldn't.</span> <span id="s164">Slowly they started to, with the Jewish star, with the thing, and then, by January 1940, they had, they chased all the Jewish population to the ghetto, an old dilapidated section of the town near the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s165">There was a round thing with barbed wire and little bridges to pass for people to go out and in, overpasses, and towers, watch towers.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">01:18:13</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Let me just interrupt you a moment because there's a lot I want you to explain about the ghetto, but there were a few months in between and I'm trying to get a sense of what your life was like and what happened to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s168">Were there orders and restrictions, and what was going on in the city before the ghetto was formed in those few months.</span> <span id="s169">Was it scary?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: It was very scary and we know that we had no other choice, I mean, I'm talking about my family.</span> <span id="s171">We had no other choice, even from my family the young people, cousins like, my mother came from a family of four; they were all were married, so there were cousins about my age, a little younger.</span> <span id="s172">So, they escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">01:19:08 They were, and some, this one, my cousin from my mother's side, just disappeared.</span> <span id="s174">We never heard from him anymore.</span> <span id="s175">He run away toward Warsaw, what happened to him nobody knows.</span> <span id="s176">We couldn't find a person that would know or heard of him or anything.</span> <span id="s177">To organizations, nobody could find what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">01:19:37 My mother's youngest brother -- people went to different towns, and they thought maybe they escaped because Lodz was called as the Reich, that means the main thing.</span> <span id="s179">The other parts like where David come from, I don't think was the Reich, was just like a next territories.</span> <span id="s180">So, here they want to put all the rules that go for their own country, and that was industrial city and they had a lot of support because there was a lot of German population.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">01:20:19 There was about at least 300,000 Jews in Lodz.</span> <span id="s182">It was a very cultural city.</span> <span id="s183">All the concerts, Jewish theater, used to come Maurice Schwartz, biggest singers and players.</span> <span id="s184">Used to come first to the Philharmonic in Lodz.</span> <span id="s185">I used to go.</span> <span id="s186">I loved the theater; and it was a very cultural city.</span> <span id="s187">Libraries and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">01:20:57 So, we knew that something dreadful, but we could not imagine in our wildest imagination that something like this would happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">01:21:11</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Did you family have plans?</span> <span id="s191">Do you remember what you talked about, what you should do?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: No, I don't think we had any choice what to do, because that required a lot of money.</span> <span id="s193">My parents didn't have that kind of money.</span> <span id="s194">You know, to lend in a different-- you know you need a passport for that, and you need a passport, well you could buy it, let's, you know how it is.</span> <span id="s195">For money you could get everywhere.</span> <span id="s196">You could get to the United States.</span> <span id="s197">People didn't know;</span></p> <p><span id="s198">01:21:45 there were people that came back in '39, back when they went for a tourist trip to the United States and they came back, to share our goal, I mean, all the things what happened to the people; because they didn't know what happened, what's going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: So in this period between September --</span></p> <p><span id="s200">01:22:11</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Uncertainty, uncertainty and very, waiting, just waiting what everyday used to bring something else.</span> <span id="s202">First they were kind, friendly.</span> <span id="s203">We shouldn't be afraid of them, you know, when they marched in.</span> <span id="s204">And then they started with the business and the local people started, the Germans they raised their heads.</span> <span id="s205">They said not to buy from the Jews.</span> <span id="s206">They took away everything what we lived.</span> <span id="s207">The population, our neighbors, they took over our homes, our furniture, everything what they had.</span> <span id="s208">You could take only what you -- when we went to the ghetto, you could only take with you what you can move.</span> <span id="s209">That's all you could take with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">01:23:05</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: So there was no real normal life left?</span> <span id="s212">After the Germans came?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Could you go to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">01:23:20</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: I was asking if there was any part of your regular life left?</span> <span id="s217">Did you continue to go to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s219">My father used to go for the high holidays.</span> <span id="s220">They used to take a sitter and leave it open I should say my prayers.</span> <span id="s221">Put something between the pages.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: So, you were still allowed to do this after the Germans arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">01:23:54</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Well, after they arrived -- it doesn't come over night, you know.</span> <span id="s225">They have to slowly, slowly, it get worse and worse, then every day comes a loud "Achtung!"</span> <span id="s226">, that's take care, look, what kind of rule they're going to put.</span> <span id="s227">And everything was special directed against the Jewish population, you understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">01:24:23 So, then we started to wear the star of David.</span> <span id="s229">We had to wear it on the left side, on the chest, right here.</span> <span id="s230">So, we knew that -- I tell you Lodz knew because when they had crystal night, that was in November 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">01:24:59</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: From Germany, they chased out all the Jewish people, just they broke the windows, that's why it's called crystal night.</span> <span id="s234">They broke the business windows and the glass and they chased all the people out.</span> <span id="s235">They just ran out to the boarder.</span> <span id="s236">They came to Lodz, and the Jewish community in Lodz took care of them.</span> <span id="s237">That I remember and it really hurt me.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">01:25:29 I knew how to speak German and you walked on the -- that was before the war, after this happened, the crystal night, there came a lot of German people.</span> <span id="s239">They considered themselves better than the Polish people.</span> <span id="s240">They always said they were more educated, more intelligent, more assimilated; that for sure they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">01:25:54 And they used to say, I tell you in German and then translate: "in unser Vaterland."</span> <span id="s242">They used to go on the main thing, it was a beautiful Petegauer Strasse(ph.) in Lodz, beautiful stores, with, you know, like Fifth Avenue in New York, and they used to say, "Oh, in unser Vaterland!"</span> <span id="s243">They chased them out to where they were and they still said, "in unser Vaterland," that means, in our country; the German, it's their country.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">01:26:34 So, people were stupid.</span> <span id="s245">They all ended up anyway, going to Auschwitz and you know what Auschwitz was.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">01:26:46 So, I'm just telling you the atmosphere wasn't any good, even before the war; and when the Germans came we knew that the Poles, they could never defend themself and just against, because they had -- they prepared for that, for the annexation of, you know, without one shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">01:27:18</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: These "Aktions" in the first few months, were any people beaten or killed?</span> <span id="s249">Were people sent away anywhere?</span> <span id="s250">What were some of these before the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Before the ghetto?</span> <span id="s252">That, I, to tell you the truth, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s253">The whole hell started when we went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s254">We knew, we expected the ghetto, you're going to be rationed food.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: You knew this before you went in?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s257">We knew.</span> <span id="s258">We expected this, but not to such a degree, how life became.</span> <span id="s259">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">01:28:09 Now he had to determine, where he put the Jews to the ghetto, he had to determine a Jewish management of the Jewish people, so the German Jews, his name was -- he was a man that was 72 years old at the time and he ran an orphanage in that part of the city, before.</span> <span id="s261">So, they chose him as the Judenälteste, as the commander and chief, he was responsible for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s262">Chaim Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s263">I'm sure you heard that name.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">01:28:54 So, you want me to tell how was, because he had to organize the ghetto like a separate identity, has nothing to do with the city where the general public lived.</span> <span id="s265">So, he had everything separate.</span> <span id="s266">They had, they have working place --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">01:29:17</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Let me just stop you because we only have a couple minutes left on this tape.</span> <span id="s269">How did you get to the ghetto, what did you take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: We walked to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s271">A car we didn't have at the time, so we walked and we took bundles that everybody could just take.</span> <span id="s272">My mother, my father, myself, I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">01:29:43 My brother was a counselor and he worked in a place, I think he worked in the orphanage, in that part, that's called Marishin(ph.), that's out of town, that was, the ghetto was there.</span> <span id="s274">He worked there.</span> <span id="s275">He lived there.</span> <span id="s276">He didn't come home.</span> <span id="s277">It was -- that was a job that sometimes he couldn't home for a couple weeks.</span> <span id="s278">Sometimes on the weekend he would come home.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">02:00:45</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: We were talking about your moving to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: We had a place to go in the ghetto because my mother's, my uncle, one of my uncles, his business was -- he lived in that part of the, because he made a living from giving out to women; you know, they manufacture, in Poland, the women wore, Polish women wore big, black shawls, woolen shawls with big fringes.</span> <span id="s282">When the shawls were made in the factory, woven, then they had to be given out to people, to women who made some money on the side.</span> <span id="s283">And made, the fringes had to be, you know, you get the threads, to cut, and to make it and to put it on on the thing, black fringes.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">02:01:55 So, the women used to come to him, he'd give them a bundle and they bring it back, and that was his job.</span> <span id="s285">And because these people, that did that job lived in that section, so he lived in that section.</span> <span id="s286">My mother's, next from my mother's, her brother.</span> <span id="s287">So he lived there, so he got for us an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">02:02:20 There was a room and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s289">I remember that place.</span> <span id="s290">He lived on the other side.</span> <span id="s291">I remember the address, and it was just on the border; it was Mimanoskigo(ph.) 19.</span> <span id="s292">On the top, when you go out on the street, there was the overpass to go out, outside the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">02:02:52 Then we had, our grandfather, my maternal grandfather, grandmother had passed away some time ago.</span> <span id="s294">So he, before the war he lived by for himself.</span> <span id="s295">Then he lived for a while with us, and when the ghetto came he lived in the same building with the uncle, with us.</span> <span id="s296">He had a room for himself.</span> <span id="s297">He wasn't so easy, you know, people get older; they're not easy in some bad circumstances.</span> <span id="s298">He wasn't so easy.</span> <span id="s299">I think by the time we went to the ghetto he passed away; uncle Heinrich Novomirst(ph.).</span> <span id="s300">Grandfather -- Then, so,</span></p> <p><span id="s301">02:03:46 so, my father, from malnutrition my father got sick.</span> <span id="s302">He had diabetes and I used to -- he was very well, working and everything, and when I was in high school, it was before the war, I used to make him insulin injections, for my father, in the arm, all the time, everyday.</span> <span id="s303">We came in the ghetto, was no, he died away of malnutrition in 1942, in April 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">02:04:27 So, we have a -- then and there's a place we put a stone, on the cemetery, the old Jewish cemetery in Lodz.</span> <span id="s305">And I, I wasn't there, but sometime, my cousins from Israel came there and I know because we got some money through some friends that lived in Poland, not Jewish friends, and they put up a stone, they sent a picture us.</span> <span id="s306">So, we have a picture of my father's stone.</span> <span id="s307">Anyway, I come now to '42 --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">02:05:00</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: No, you don't want to go so fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: No, don't go so fast.</span> <span id="s312">I want to know more about life in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">02:05:10</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: The life in the ghetto -- Now, at that point we knew that conditions, everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s315">You know, it was a rationed bread; and the rest we got some every week or every month, we got that many supplies on the Karte [card] and that was it.</span> <span id="s316">Then you can buy everything on the black market, but for you need the money.</span> <span id="s317">Now, how long the money that last.</span> <span id="s318">People would sell their jewelries and diamonds and whatever they have, and some people have dollars.</span> <span id="s319">Anything that had value, to live, to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">02:06:00 Well, it looked like, really hopeless.</span> <span id="s321">Conditions about health, forget about it.</span> <span id="s322">First of all, there were places to work.</span> <span id="s323">We worked for the employer or the German government.</span> <span id="s324">They had factories there they made.</span> <span id="s325">Factories from clothing.</span> <span id="s326">I worked in one.</span> <span id="s327">They took people that could -- they were trained in certain things and they, it was, that's why I think I survived, because I always worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">02:06:42</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: What kind of work did you do in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: I worked in the factory, that they manufactured women's housedresses, very plain dresses.</span> <span id="s331">From shiny fabric you know, and very plain dresses.</span> <span id="s332">At the beginning I used to work in the, I was responsible for the cutting room.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">02:07:15 If you, we cut 300 pieces, 300 dresses at one time, the layout, to make the front and the back and the collars and the cuffs and the sleeves and everything, what you need, and you have to make the layout, that you use the least fabric.</span> <span id="s334">Then you had, they had machines that they cut, and men was mostly employed.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">02;07:48 You had to watch them that when it goes, and then they make bundles when it's cut up.</span> <span id="s336">For each, let's say, the one that stitches on the machine and then Then the white dress has a front and a back and whatever, and two sleeves and a double collar and cuffs and pockets and whatever it needs for a dress, so in neat bundles; let's say, she got 10 or 12 dresses, so she made.</span> <span id="s337">It was like section work.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">02:08:20 One used to make let's say sleeves and the other used to make collars and the other, until a whole bunch we got ready.</span> <span id="s339">How they work in the garment industry today.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Who were these dresses for?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: For the German government.</span> <span id="s342">Went to Germany it went.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Did you work hard?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">02:08:42</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s346">I'm telling you I was responsible for the cutting room.</span> <span id="s347">It was, if something would go wrong, and the cutters would get, let's say, I wouldn't have a good relationship with them, talk to them nice or whatever, or criticize them too much, or whatever, they had a way to get back at me, like cutting in.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">02:09:11 If you cut in, let's say, in the collar, where you have to have a round, and you cut in straight, you can't use that part ever, so you need more fabric.</span> <span id="s349">So, the Germans come and say hey, you need more fabric.</span> <span id="s350">What's the matter?</span> <span id="s351">You doing sabotage?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">02:09:29 So, it was like you had to use a lot of diplomacy.</span> <span id="s353">I was young then.</span> <span id="s354">That was a matter of survival.</span> <span id="s355">Because I worked there, I got a little better ration than other people.</span> <span id="s356">It was a responsible job.</span> <span id="s357">I work at that factory all the time.</span> <span id="s358">Then they changed.</span> <span id="s359">They stopped the, later, when they stopped the dresses, they gave me another job in the same factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">02:10:03 They started working on women's bras and intimate things, the pieces.</span> <span id="s361">So, I was then.</span> <span id="s362">But I never had any problem with the cutters, so, because I knew that I could be responsible with my head, if something went wrong and they spoil some pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">02:10:28</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: You mentioned sabotage, was there sabotage in these factories in the Lodz ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Some people tried of course.</span> <span id="s366">But if you made and you got caught, you risked your life.</span> <span id="s367">They shot you right on the spot.</span> <span id="s368">There is, there is no mercy.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">02:10:53 Oh, if you want to know how the German behaved, when they saw the Jewish people, you know they could recognize the Jewish people in Poland, the religious.</span> <span id="s370">They wore a flat hat, and they had beards, and the locks.</span> <span id="s371">No, my folks didn't wear this, no.</span> <span id="s372">So, if they saw on the street people like that, the SS men or the SA, they grab them, and they were the laugh of the whole public, and they cut the beards and cut the locks.</span> <span id="s373">It was such a horror, and they beat these people up, no matter how old the men were or children.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Did you see this?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">02:11:36</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Oh sure, that I see, yes.</span> <span id="s377">That was before the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Did the Germans come into the ghetto much, or was it run by itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">02:11:47</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: No, they just gave directives and things to the Judenälteste, to the commander.</span> <span id="s381">Sometimes they came in to inspect things.</span> <span id="s382">We didn't like when they came in.</span> <span id="s383">The Judenälteste was bad enough.</span> <span id="s384">He had, like Dave talk about kapos, we had twenty kapos,</span></p> <p><span id="s385">02:12:11 that mean Jews, who were against their own brothers.</span> <span id="s386">Who were collaborating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s387">It was that they were good, that you should be law and order and stuff, but they were really bad people.</span> <span id="s388">You had to have no heart to have a job like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">02:12:38 That there was the same thing in all cities, they had the same, that the Jewish people, the German picked, not the German, but the Judenälteste, the commander, picked some people and that was his police, the kapos.</span> <span id="s390">Called them the kapos.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">02:12:58</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: How extensive was this Jewish administration?</span> <span id="s393">What kinds of roles did they --?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Well, their role mostly were, in the beginning, life was so bad, we just didn't know what happened the next day, because they grabbed people from the streets sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">02:13:19 Sometimes they just came in, knocked at the home, took off the father, and left the children, and if somebody protested at the thing, either the kids or something, they cry, or they make an alarm or stuff, they shoot a few people right away, because they couldn't stand that somebody was against their will, protested.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">02:13:49 So, we know, a lot of people just got, we lost a lot of people this way.</span> <span id="s397">That they came to homes and they just took away people, at random.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: This was a constant threat?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s400">Constant, constant.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">02:14:02 And then, when they established a way, how to get rid of people, the crematoria, then they wanted people, it says that the people register for work.</span> <span id="s402">So, at the beginning, because the conditions, the food was terrible.</span> <span id="s403">You know what we ate?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">02:14:27 We got a ration of bread.</span> <span id="s405">Then we would buy, not potatoes, potatoes would be very good.</span> <span id="s406">We used to buy potatoes peels, wash them, scrub them that they should be sandy and grind them and make potato pancakes, Latkes(ph.).</span> <span id="s407">That was -- and we got some oil, it was a ration, if you want this oil for a month or whatever, and so we used that, and kollrabi, that was the vegetable that you get.</span> <span id="s408">Everything you could buy on the black market.</span> <span id="s409">But that was, was skyhigh.</span> <span id="s410">It was just affordable to people who had a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">02:15:23</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Who was running this black market?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Who's running the black market?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Within the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Within the ghetto?</span> <span id="s416">Oh, within the ghetto.</span> <span id="s417">Sure, within the ghetto.</span> <span id="s418">It was always some private.</span> <span id="s419">You go there and you know one who knows this, and this, and you go there and could buy eggs.</span> <span id="s420">You could buy a chicken, but you need the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">02:15:48 Then the health conditions were very, very bad.</span> <span id="s422">Sanitation was bad.</span> <span id="s423">Old people were dying.</span> <span id="s424">There was no medication.</span> <span id="s425">There were very few doctors.</span> <span id="s426">Life was hopeless.</span> <span id="s427">Sanitation was terrible.</span> <span id="s428">There was no sewage, so they had to, you know, cesspools, so all the time they haul wagons to clean, the thing would run all day to the city back and forth and then something else.</span> <span id="s429">Those little wagons that they picked up the dead people every day, how many people died in the ghetto every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">02:16:40 From malnutrition, from disease, and people got sick, there was no hope.</span> <span id="s431">If you got sick and you work and you didn't come to work, then that was the worst thing.</span> <span id="s432">I learned this in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s433">If you get sick and you don't come to work, in a few days they come after you to find out why.</span> <span id="s434">The deportation was the worst thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">02:17:14 At the beginning, people who wanted, thought that they go in, the German said that they sending the people to labor camp.</span> <span id="s436">They're going to work.</span> <span id="s437">They're going to be fed better, better conditions, better living conditions, so a lot of people, men, young people, volunteered, and they wanted to go.</span> <span id="s438">Never heard anybody came back, never, until, first we knew what happened to these people is, see the Germans kept everything secret.</span> <span id="s439">They tried to, everything to be hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">02:17:56 In 1942, somebody escaped from Chelmno.</span> <span id="s441">You know, when they shoot, what they did with the people before they had the, how you call it, the crematoria, is, they took the men and they told them to dig, like graves, but one big grave.</span> <span id="s442">When we dug the grave, they, when they were ready, they figure out, it's enough for a pile for that many people, they start the thing, and they say, face in and they shoot from the back and the bodies fell in and they pile up and that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">02:18:41 So, one guy was shot, but he wasn't shot dead.</span> <span id="s444">So, he crawled out from that after they left and somebody helped him out, and he came back to the ghetto, and he told the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">02:19:01 So, then he knew that they're building a crematoria and they going be much faster.</span> <span id="s446">That all, they mostly think, that they selected people that able bodies go to work, and women with children and invalids, everything goes; they liquidate.</span> <span id="s447">That was called the final solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">02:19:31 So, in 1942, so the whole ghetto was very panicky, after this, because they never knew.</span> <span id="s449">First, they gave that Judenälteste, Chaim Rumkowski, they gave him like an order that they need 500 able bodies.</span> <span id="s450">So, he had to select.</span> <span id="s451">His friends and his acquaintances he wouldn't select, so he took people just at random, whoever bad luck was, you went.</span> <span id="s452">And people didn't want to go, so there was a, they opposed him, and then it came to a point in the ghetto that people just didn't want to go voluntarily, so he went to the Germans and he told them, that he can't deliver because people didn't want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">02:20:34 So, they made their way that they're going take themselves.</span> <span id="s454">Sometimes they came with dogs and people couldn't go out from the homes.</span> <span id="s455">They came, you know, those big dogs, and they smell out people and if there was a person inside hidden the dog will start barking and they will break the door and find that person and drag them down and they will shot it in front of everybody.</span> <span id="s456">So, anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s457">02:21:12</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Were there certain categories of people that went first?</span> <span id="s459">I mean were there people that they decided to deport first or was it just everyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: People with families with small children and things.</span> <span id="s461">Well, like I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">02:21:37 Now we come back closer to 1942, because I told you the conditions and how was, how the ghetto, the streets of the ghetto were looking, and what was the most thing you could see driving there.</span> <span id="s463">The dead bodies and cleaning the cesspools.</span> <span id="s464">That's what you saw in the ghetto, on the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Let me just ask you were there --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">02:22:20</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: I'll tell you about the culture.</span> <span id="s468">There was an underground too.</span> <span id="s469">They tried to, there was an underground.</span> <span id="s470">There was, when the ghetto was finally, in 1944, liquidated, there was underground left 800 people.</span> <span id="s471">They lived under the ghetto and at night they would go out for products and stuff.</span> <span id="s472">They had friends that helped them out.</span> <span id="s473">They remained, when we were sent to Auschwitz, they remained and were liberated later by the Russians by the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Did you know any of these people?</span> <span id="s475">Did you know about it at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">02:23:01</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: We know there was an underground, yes, but I didn't have contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Did they help you at all in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: No.</span> <span id="s480">They were Poles who helped out with the -- but they tried to be very inconspicuous.</span> <span id="s481">They couldn't be visible, because the German would; they wanted, these people mostly lived through the war, because who ever survived healthwise.</span> <span id="s482">They wasn't, when the ghetto was --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">02:23:44 they came out and they mixed with the other neighbors.</span> <span id="s484">If the neighbors didn't just tell them that they Jewish, they wouldn't know.</span> <span id="s485">But anyway, that was the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">02:24:04 Now, I'll tell you how I lost my mother.</span> <span id="s487">Do you want to hear that?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Yes, I still want to ask a few more question.</span> <span id="s489">Whether there were efforts to help the people in the ghetto, whether there were welfare organization or educational, trying to help the children or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">O2:24:24</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yes, there were, I myself had a group of young children, maybe eight, ten, girls and boys, mostly girls, that I teach them dressmaking, sewing.</span> <span id="s492">Once a week, there was a class, that was volunteer work.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: It was permitted?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">02:24:47</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: This was permitted.</span> <span id="s496">Like Jewish status(?)</span> <span id="s497">would not permit it.</span> <span id="s498">But there were, they were hidden.</span> <span id="s499">There's a lot of things that were hidden in the ghetto, because Jewish people don't give up their culture and their stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Were there cultural activities that you went to that were hidden or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">02:25:14</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Cultural activities?</span> <span id="s503">I tell you, we had so much tzures, you know, troubles, our own, health, nutrition, family, that besides that what happening with our neighbors, our immediate family, that wasn't even the will to participate in anything, all the time.</span> <span id="s504">In the evening we wouldn't go out, no place.</span> <span id="s505">At day time, I work.</span> <span id="s506">Then I had my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">02:25:56 In six months my mother, you know I lost my mother she was only 48 years old, and my father died at 54.</span> <span id="s508">That's the hardest story to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">02:26:45 Once there were, the German came and they made, that was in 1942, was six months after, about five six months after my father passed away.</span> <span id="s510">It was about August, September at the time of the Jewish holidays, and the German came and they want a transport.</span> <span id="s511">At that time Rumkowski could not make it, so he said to the German, you come in the ghetto and do it.</span> <span id="s512">So, they came.</span> <span id="s513">You know how brutal they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">02:27:27 So, they came and they ordered everybody "Raus!</span> <span id="s515">," out, from the houses.</span> <span id="s516">At that time, my mother was my responsibility.</span> <span id="s517">In six months she became -- her hair became white, grey.</span> <span id="s518">She was a young woman, after she lost her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">02:27:58 So, my brother worked as a counselor and at least he had better food than we had, the two that were still there.</span> <span id="s520">So, he worked with the orphans there.</span> <span id="s521">So, I didn't see him, it was maybe ten miles away.</span> <span id="s522">So, how could I see him.</span> <span id="s523">No telephone, nothing.</span> <span id="s524">It was like I was one, alone, and my mother was my responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">02:28:26 So, I figured do I go down or not go down.</span> <span id="s526">Then people said, if you don't go out, on the streets, they'll come with dogs and it's going to be even worse.</span> <span id="s527">So, I went down, and from my side, they took away my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">02:28:54 They grabbed her, and I couldn't do anything, I wanted to go with her.</span> <span id="s529">That was the last time I saw my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">02:29:05 I knew the place where they had the gathering place of all the people that they took, so at night, and the next day they took just a few days until they organized and they have wagons on the side, a train to put them in, to a different -- But from Lodz, the first time they put people to Chelmno, it was in the woods and they made this thing that I told you.</span> <span id="s531">I think they had the first chimneys over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s533">03:00:48</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: I left at that point, that next day they took my mother, I got a note from her, somebody came from there and brought me her wedding band and a note; and so I felt that I want to see her.</span> <span id="s535">So, it came to evening.</span> <span id="s536">I got dressed, dark.</span> <span id="s537">I took my ration of bread, and when it came dusk, I went out in the direction where that building was where the people were gathered.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">03:01:43 It was like between, you still could see but it was, the night was coming in.</span> <span id="s539">And far of the thing -- It was just across to go a big field.</span> <span id="s540">Like from here, over there, to the, you know, twice the golf course.</span> <span id="s541">And you could see, on top you could see the light from the guard, on the tower.</span> <span id="s542">I was a distance, when I came close, and I crawled, just like this, like this on the ground.</span> <span id="s543">All of the sudden, from the direction where the tower was, they start shooting at me.</span> <span id="s544">So I stopped, then, when they stopped, I crawl closer, then they start shooting again more.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">03:02:44 So, I stopped and I was thinking, the instinct of survival in a human being, in anything that's alive, is so strong, that you think, what I'm going to achieve, if I'm going go and they going shoot me and I'm not going to see my mother anyway.</span> <span id="s546">I should go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">03:03:18 So, while I thought, the light came in, and I start crawling a little more and they start shooting after me, I change my direction, then I figure out that I'll never make it and I went back to the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">03:03:41 You know what?</span> <span id="s549">My mother's ring I still have, how I have it, I don't know.</span> <span id="s550">It's just a puzzle to me, because you couldn't have a photograph, you couldn't have anything that you own, except your body.</span> <span id="s551">If you remain alive, nothing.</span> <span id="s552">From one place to the other.</span> <span id="s553">So, I had really no idea how I got that ring.</span> <span id="s554">Sometimes I think about it and I don't know; have no idea.</span> <span id="s555">That haunts me.</span> <span id="s556">03:04:46 See, with my father I could make peace.</span> <span id="s557">He died, natural death.</span> <span id="s558">The war was the villain, malnutrition.</span> <span id="s559">But with my mother, I can't make peace.</span> <span id="s560">I could never tell this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">03:05:28 When my first grandchild was born, my daughter-in-law sent me a book, a grandchild book, to write down my background, my, everything.</span> <span id="s562">When I came to the war, to that point in life, I just stopped and I never put any word, and I couldn't.</span> <span id="s563">And they couldn't understand why.</span> <span id="s564">They said, what's the matter, are you guilty about that your mother is not alive, that she was taken away.</span> <span id="s565">I just couldn't put this on paper.</span> <span id="s566">So, you can understand why.</span> <span id="s567">It's 52 years, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">03:06:23 My kids say, mother you are strong [knot/not], hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">03:06:50</span></p> <p><span id="s570">O.k., let's go.</span> <span id="s571">So, when I lost my mother, I just didn't want to live anymore in this house.</span> <span id="s572">I didn't.</span> <span id="s573">What happened?</span> <span id="s574">One day, that was before that, I came to class, there were no children.</span> <span id="s575">The children went to heaven.</span> <span id="s576">We knew that's going to happen.</span> <span id="s577">The same thing happen with the orphanage, with my brother's orphanage where he worked, so he came back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">03:07:37 So, he lived with me until the ghetto was destroyed, unil, maybe 1942.</span> <span id="s579">Yes, we lived about two years together.</span> <span id="s580">So, we changed the address, we moved to a different place.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">03:08:00 One time, I don't remember that, I remember I was sick, I was once so sick that they didn't think I would survive.</span> <span id="s582">I had very high temperature, so high that they just didn't know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s583">I was home because I would never go to a hospital, because if you go to a hospital, you never, they take you out from the hospital and they finish you off.</span> <span id="s584">They don't want people to get well.</span> <span id="s585">They want to get sick and they get rid of them.</span> <span id="s586">That was the best solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">03:08:39 Alright, so, but I recovered, so, obviously, I had some years to live.</span> <span id="s588">Then I was still working, then I was working in the same factory, but on a different job because they took away that, so.</span> <span id="s589">I was responsible for the final product.</span> <span id="s590">I inspected the product, that it's one hundred percent o.k., each piece.</span> <span id="s591">That was, I had the title, like I'm the instructress; all the time I had that title.</span> <span id="s592">So, I told you, so I got a little better ration, something a little more.</span> <span id="s593">But it wasn't much, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">03:09:28</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Let me just ask you, because you had this position of responsibility and you got a little bit extra, do you think the other workers resented you?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: No.</span> <span id="s597">They didn't resent me, no.</span> <span id="s598">Maybe they did, but not on my -- there was no reason to -- there was one, there were above me, like the manager from the factory, or things like that.</span> <span id="s599">I was just a little person.</span> <span id="s600">I just, I wasn't sewing on the machine because that wasn't my job.</span> <span id="s601">The other women, they were sewing on the machines, and I had nothing to do with that because I knew how to manage certain things.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">03:10:18</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Do you think within the ghetto life was any different for women and men?</span> <span id="s604">Was it more difficult being a woman, were you treated differently, were you taken advantage of?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">03:10:43</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Let me tell you.</span> <span id="s607">It was bad for men and women.</span> <span id="s608">It was uncertain for everybody.</span> <span id="s609">The first victims were little children.</span> <span id="s610">Then, if a woman got pregnant it's hopeless; a small child --</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: What would happen to a woman who got pregnant?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">03:11:14</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Listen, is better if they shot her instead to taking her.</span> <span id="s614">They were making like they make research of animals, they used to make research on Jewish people, all kinds of research and they learn on this and they crippled a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: In the ghetto, or are you talking about later?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">03:11:39</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Not later, in the time of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: In the ghetto, though, in the Lodz ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: I don't know on the Lodz ghetto, but the German did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: So, if a woman in the Lodz ghetto got pregnant, could she have her child?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">03:11:56</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Well, she had her child but when she went to the camp, they say a woman with a child they took her away right away.</span> <span id="s623">Even the kapos, they were grabbing little children like, without mercy, the Jewish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">03:12:18 So, you understand, it's the uncertainty, the misery and that life has no value and what happens with your family was so terrible that it was meaningless, it was no hope, no hope whatsoever.</span> <span id="s625">No hope for survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">03:12:45</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: So there wasn't a real difference between the way men and women dealt with this, or the way they were treated?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: No, not that I remember.</span> <span id="s629">They were a different between class, the one, the ruling class.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">03:13:05 You see, Rumkowski was, like I told you, was an old man.</span> <span id="s631">He was 72 years old that time, that time people didn't live that long.</span> <span id="s632">He married a young woman of 38, and he had a brother, and the brother had a wife and she was like, they say here, Miss America -- Helen of Troy they used to call her.</span> <span id="s633">And they all thought they were the elite.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">03:13:39 They thought they make themself rich.</span> <span id="s635">People left diamonds, they left, they just took it, take people away, whatever was left and had value, they took it away, the kapos took, the Judenälteste; I mean Rumkowski himself was a, maybe, an honest man.</span> <span id="s636">But, the trend was like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">03:14:04 So, they thought that they're going to survive the war, for sure.</span> <span id="s638">I tell you what, shall I tell you the end, what it was.</span> <span id="s639">When the ghetto was, they dissolved the ghetto in 1944; they came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s640">They sent them to Auschwitz, the whole Rumkowski family and kapos, over there, that waited for him, they all were shot on the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: By whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">03:14:44</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: The old men and the women, everybody, the whole family.</span> <span id="s644">They thought they going to survive.</span> <span id="s645">Not with the Germans.</span> <span id="s646">First they shot the people and then they shot the helpers, the one that work.</span> <span id="s647">There should be no witnessess.</span> <span id="s648">They always did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">03:15:08</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Was Rumkowski on your transport?</span> <span id="s651">Same group?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: No, I was told no.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: So this was something you learned later?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s655">Sure, no, I wasn't in the same transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">03:15:21</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: So, you still had a few more years in the ghetto with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: You must have been very close?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yes, we were very close.</span> <span id="s661">He worked, he worked, he had friends and these people were managing a, what kind shop was this -- they used to make from rags things.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">03:15:55 Because over there, in the war, they make everything, that's recycling, because there is no, everything is very tight and you can make whatever you can make from old [dinkerydoo], and make something useful.</span> <span id="s663">He work at, I don't remember what they used to make from that material, but it was like, they were doing something from rags.</span> <span id="s664">I think they were collecting them, old clothing and stuff and either renwed them, or something that somebody can use it -- for the inmates, I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">03:16:33 But, he worked and he went with them, like he was sent, we were separated then, when the ghetto was dissolved.</span> <span id="s666">We were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">03:16:47 He wound up in Bergen-Belsen, from Auschwitz, and I came to another place, to South German, that was the part that used to be the Russian part, the East German, Hainichen.</span> <span id="s668">That was where I worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: You're talking about a little bit later, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">03:17:17</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s672">That was the other half of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Let me ask you also, in the Lodz ghetto, all the people who were living there, not just people from Lodz, were they bringing other people in?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">03:17:37</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yes, I worked in my place, I worked with a German women, Frau Gerz(ph.), that she came, they sent her in, from, she came from Cologne, from Germany.</span> <span id="s676">A lot of people came from Germany that they sent.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Did they need more workers or why?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">03:18:05</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: They need some people that would work, yes.</span> <span id="s680">They got rid of, you know, the natives here, so they needed, until, in 1944 they figure out, it's final, they're going to liquidate the ghetto, and the war changed their whole picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">03:18:28 They were surrounded and they didn't think they going to loose the war.</span> <span id="s682">But, it was different, the Russian came closer and the Allies, the places that I were, on the way from Hainichen, then we went on a trip.</span> <span id="s683">When they sent us out, six weeks we were walking.</span> <span id="s684">You know, six weeks!</span></p> <p><span id="s685">03:18:57</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: I want you to tell me about that, but in time.</span> <span id="s687">Tell me about the last days of the ghetto and what happened.</span> <span id="s688">As time went on from 1940 to '44 did the ghetto change?</span> <span id="s689">Were there noticeable changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">03:19:17</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s692">People got very desperate.</span> <span id="s693">We lost so many people, families.</span> <span id="s694">I lost, my father had a sister, another sister, they, I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s695">They went on a transport, and they're gone, little children.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">03:19:43 My mother, one cousin, my mother's brother, one died, the one that had this business I told you, where we lived, they have five kids.</span> <span id="s697">So, the oldest went, escaped when the German came and we never heard of him.</span> <span id="s698">The rest of the children, I think, he sent with the younger, his younger brother, to another town.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">03:20:14 The younger brother had two boys, and they moved out from, they moved, I think there was a Polish city, Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s700">They went there.</span> <span id="s701">I mean, we had no communication with them, we don't know.</span> <span id="s702">We couldn't write letters.</span> <span id="s703">There was no telephone.</span> <span id="s704">There wasn't any communication.</span> <span id="s705">And anyway, I think they were some, they were hiding out, and some Polish people tried to, I think, help them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">03:20:52 Anyway, they didn't survive either.</span> <span id="s707">One boy survived, the older one.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">03:21:01 After the war, by accident I met him.</span> <span id="s709">I just want to tell you this.</span> <span id="s710">He was tall, he was 18 or 17 years old when I met him.</span> <span id="s711">And I came in the place, that was after the liberation, we were in Landsberg, and I went into a place that woman sells some stuff, a private house, fabrics or whatever she sells, or food, I don't know what.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">03:21:25 Anyway, I went over there and I know the woman and that was a young man in a uniform, very young and handsome and I looked at him and I looked at him and I walked at him and I said, are you Kubanawonya(ph.), that was my cousin, my uncle's son, the one that I said the one.</span> <span id="s713">He looks at me, he says, how do you know my name?</span> <span id="s714">I said, you're my cousin, and I told him who I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">03:22:07 I hadn't seen him maybe the whole time of the war, he grew up, but there was something that I recognize him.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">03:22:15 Well, he went to Israel, to Palestine.</span> <span id="s717">He told me that he goes on the Aliyah Bet, and in 1948 he was killed in the Negev, in the war of liberation.</span> <span id="s718">So,</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Tell me what the last days of the ghetto were like?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: That was after the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: I know, but you haven't finished that story.</span> <span id="s722">Tell me how things were in the last days, and what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">03:23:02</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: We figured out, life was hopeless in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s725">Was worse and worse and worse.</span> <span id="s726">People were dying, and there is not help, no food, people were dying of malnutrition, disease, cripples and things.</span> <span id="s727">We know that the final solution, that they have to finish off all the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s728">So, whatever is going to be we're just resigned, hopeless.</span> <span id="s729">That was in that train that they put us, cattle train --</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s731">How did you get to the train?</span> <span id="s732">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">03:23:50</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: How did we get to the train?</span> <span id="s735">We walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: No, no, but you haven't explained to me, while you were in the ghetto, how this came about.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Well, they gave an order, "Aussiedlung," deportation, whole ghetto, liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s738">So, that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: When was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">03:24:10</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: In August or September of 1944.</span> <span id="s742">That was the last, one of the last transport of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s743">So, my brother went with one, I went with one.</span> <span id="s744">Mostly went with the places where you worked.</span> <span id="s745">You went with these people, and then, together with all the people, and then they select.</span> <span id="s746">So, from ghetto Lodz we went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: What was a train ride like?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">03:24:44</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: The train like?</span> <span id="s750">It was a cattle train that they transport cows, horses.</span> <span id="s751">So, you can imagine.</span> <span id="s752">They stuffed, how many people, they didn't care, we can sit down, we can stand.</span> <span id="s753">Men, women, children, everything got stuffed in, locked the doors.</span> <span id="s754">It was summer.</span> <span id="s755">It was hot.</span> <span id="s756">People died of lack of air, oxygen, of thirst.</span> <span id="s757">In the morning, we looked around and there were dead bodies.</span> <span id="s758">So, there was no hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">03:25:38</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: How long were you on this train?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: We traveled the whole night, from Lodz to Auschwitz is about, the train went slow, takes about 12 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Were you with any friends or anyone, or were you totally alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">03:26:00</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Well, let me tell you how didn't help to be with friends or with, because people got pushed in just, just shoved in the wagons.</span> <span id="s765">If you didn't, you just get hit with the left side of the weapon and you know that's hard, and they didn't care, or they hit your head or your leg, or they hit a child.</span> <span id="s766">It was merciless.</span> <span id="s767">No mercy.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Did they tell you where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">03:26:34</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No.</span> <span id="s771">We knew that we going to Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span> <span id="s772">That's the place where you come and there's a big sign on top in German: "Arbeit Macht Frei," "Work Makes You Free."</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: How did you know you were going there?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">03:26:57</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: I told you that in 1942 we knew the destination where people were going.</span> <span id="s776">Before that, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s777">And we knew that that might be our last ride.</span> <span id="s778">The shower, first was Mengele.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: What happened when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">03:27:21</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: We arrived when they chased us out from the thing, there was a band and music was playing.</span> <span id="s782">You know, they didn't want any panic, because people would panic.</span> <span id="s783">So, they made music, can you imagine, from a place like this.</span> <span id="s784">It's a farce.</span> <span id="s785">So, we couldn't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">03:27:50 Then Mengele, he was tall.</span> <span id="s787">That devil, they called him the "Angel of Death," and he said, one point with the finger, right, alright.</span> <span id="s788">So, he segregated, left was destruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">03:28:13 Women with children were first to go, anybody that has some kind of ailment that he could see, they won't be able to work, had to go, on one side.</span> <span id="s790">Women separate, men separate and able bodies also separate.</span> <span id="s791">So, we were young, the one that, we went to able bodied.</span> <span id="s792">So, it got a whole different group of people.</span> <span id="s793">So, they put us on, get disrobed --</span></p> <p><span id="s794">04:00:44</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: So, you arrived at Auschwitz, you were selected with the able bodied people.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: The able bodied people.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: I want to tell you, we stood before, we were disrobed before.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: You were taken someplace?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: No, just what you wore, you had to throw away and put it on a big -- they had a pile of shoes, a pile of women's clothing.</span> <span id="s801">You had to throw your garment on the pile.</span> <span id="s802">They say for desinfection because you shouldn't bring any disease.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">04:01:29 From then, after the selection, we went to get a shower.</span> <span id="s804">And the shower, that we know already, that instead water, in the thing, they want to get rid of the people, they put gas, in the shower comes gas and the people get it.</span> <span id="s805">It takes a while and they all passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: How did you know this?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">04:02:02</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: We know this.</span> <span id="s809">We know this, but after that, people would, we know, we were afraid for that shower.</span> <span id="s810">We said the Shema(ph.), the last prayer, and that was it, we said.</span> <span id="s811">Then they shaved off our hair.</span> <span id="s812">We came out from the shower, we didn't recognize each other.</span> <span id="s813">You know, how a woman looks when she has no hair any more.</span> <span id="s814">Can't recognize, I didn't recognize my friends, that I went together with them to school.</span> <span id="s815">I never see them anymore after this.</span> <span id="s816">Until today, I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s817">We were very good friends, went the same transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">04:02:54 So, somehow when it came water, there was a scream.</span> <span id="s819">That's not the end yet.</span> <span id="s820">We're going to live.</span> <span id="s821">So, when we came out, we had to pick at random some piece of clothing from the pile.</span> <span id="s822">You got another, or it fit you or didn't fit you it didn't matter, from a different pile, something for the feet, wooden shoes or whatever, and then you went to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">04:03:37 Those barracks, I was only about ten days or two weeks in Auschwitz, but that was the worst part that anyplace that I was.</span> <span id="s824">They were so merciless that people that could survive Auschwitz must have been some, must have been, had some, they had to do something, have some function, that they survived in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">04:04:11 Because that was the worst place that you can, just the psychology of that.</span> <span id="s826">We were up all night and talking and what was going on, how people were sick and the sick and the able bodies and the sick one were in the same one, the place was huge.</span> <span id="s827">The kapos were there, women kapos and they were commandeering and showing their power, what they can do, what to obey, and how they, the rules, and they were so rude.</span> <span id="s828">Just our own fate!</span></p> <p><span id="s829">04:04:53 It was just unbelievable; and I figure out, if I have to stay, and I just prayed that they send me as soon as possible to a labor camp; that we're going to work.</span> <span id="s830">You know people got in Auschwitz, Auschwitz was surrounded by an electric fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">04:05:19 Some people got so mad in their mind that they run to the fence.</span> <span id="s832">They want to run away, and they got killed, electrocuted.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Intentionally?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s835">A lot of people died this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">04:05:40</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: The people who were there, did you talk to them to get a sense of what life was like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Yes, you got the sense of it, because you saw what's going on, how they talk to you, other women.</span> <span id="s839">No respect for life, nothing.</span> <span id="s840">Just to survival of the fittest.</span> <span id="s841">They were the fittest, you understand, and we couldn't survive there.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">04:06:14 If we just had to eat and to sleep and to live there, no, there was no way of survival, not physically, not morally, just no way.</span> <span id="s843">So, I just prayed -- I knew that I wouldn't be able to survive over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Who were these kapos?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">04:06:36</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Some nights, we were afraid to sleep at night.</span> <span id="s847">Just fall asleep, somebody watch it, because they know what going happen at night.</span> <span id="s848">It was a big place and there's so many women, and the, the beds, up and down, up and down, and they're supposed to be nurses and they took care on the sick, and they talk and they talk too much and they told the stories and everything, you have to obey here, there's no revolt.</span> <span id="s849">You can't think because this is a death place.</span> <span id="s850">They said, this is a dead place.</span> <span id="s851">Nobody goes out here alive, even if you weren't gassed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">04:07:21 They tell you this.</span> <span id="s853">They told us, the one that were a long time there.</span> <span id="s854">And they worked there on different, very unpleasant missions, they work.</span> <span id="s855">The other people.</span> <span id="s856">We weren't assigned, see I have no number, and the folks that were with me had no numbers.</span> <span id="s857">They were in a hurry, the Germans, that time, and they didn't make any numbers, because all the forces came closing in and in and in.</span> <span id="s858">The Russians came closer and closer, so they wanted the most what they wanted, get rid of us, the most of they could.</span> <span id="s859">And the one that were capable to work, they sent to work.</span> <span id="s860">Well, after some time, about ten days I think I was there in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s861">04:08:19</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Did you do anything in those ten days?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: No, we just talked and were miserable and listened to the stories and what they commandeer with us and then in the morning we could hear what happened to other people, how people got killed at the fence and all kind of things, about life, what is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">04:08:45 So, they told us that we're going to be sent away, with a transport to work.</span> <span id="s865">So, one day it came that they sent us to, that was not far from a industrial city of Essen, Essen in Solingen.</span> <span id="s866">That's famous for steel work, so they worked at that time of the war, they built airplanes there.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">04:09:14 And I worked, Framo-Werke was called, the shop we work.</span> <span id="s868">I was a welder in the camp.</span> <span id="s869">I was working with the mask and with fire, in a tub like in my bathroom, but the top was open and the bottom was open, because the "Halle" was very big, the hall, and there were all kinds of different machines.</span> <span id="s870">The big women worked on "Bohrers," [drills] that made hole in iron.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">04:09:50 We worked on the, we made Anti-Luftwaffen, to shoot down airplanes, the V-2 was called.</span> <span id="s872">So, I was welding big pieces, huge pieces.</span> <span id="s873">They used to come, they had Russian and French prisoners of war over there, at camp, so they used to come and bring, so they worked, they had a different camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">04:10:22 Maybe they were treated better than we were, because prisoners of war, that is, but the Germans didn't care very much about the Geneva convention, that they should be treated like human beings.</span> <span id="s875">But maybe they were treated a little better than us.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">04:10:43 So, they used to bring parts to be welded.</span> <span id="s877">So that fire shouldn't disturb the order, I had a cabin.</span> <span id="s878">There were just three women for the whole thing.</span> <span id="s879">There was three of us that were welders.</span> <span id="s880">God forbid if I burn something.</span> <span id="s881">How do I know to weld?</span> <span id="s882">Do I know to weld?</span> <span id="s883">I had no idea, I never did this kind of work.</span> <span id="s884">04:11:10 They gave me a torch.</span> <span id="s885">They showed you how to do, don't press too much because if you put too much fire, too hot, then the whole iron burns, and you can't do nothing with it.</span> <span id="s886">You had to just join it together and not to burn, so I tried.</span> <span id="s887">And we did, like big cannons, big cannons I was welding, the rings on the cannon, so they are not welded round.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">04:11:48 They welded like round, they welded a piece then a piece, space, then another and another, in pieces, and it lies on a row and the man that came, would turn it.</span> <span id="s889">That could be turned, that, each time on a different place.</span> <span id="s890">Because, they explain, if you weld around, that piece is not strong enough, you have to be weld in parts, round and round.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: How did you know to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">04:12:24</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Well, I did all right.</span> <span id="s894">I never burned anything.</span> <span id="s895">Sometimes, but you know.</span> <span id="s896">If you burned, then you were accused of sabotage.</span> <span id="s897">One of the girls made ["Bohrers"], big tall machines, they took big strong girls, and they make holes in pieces of iron.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Let me just ask you a few questions, you were near Essen, was there a name to this labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">04:12:55</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s901">It's called Hainichen, the town was called Hainichen.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: How large was this labor camp?</span> <span id="s903">Who was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Who was there?</span> <span id="s905">There was, I don't know how many women.</span> <span id="s906">That was, I was, most the camp was some people from Poland and a whole group of Hungarian women.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: A couple hundred, a couple thousand?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">04:13:22</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: A couple hundred, I think.</span> <span id="s910">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s911">We start counting, counting; sometimes we stood on "Achtung," until they count, you could stand for two hours until they counted us.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Where did you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: On bunk beds, straw bunk beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Was it crowded?</span> <span id="s915">Was it a big barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">04:13:48</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Long big barracks and somebody slept on the bottom and somebody slept on top.</span> <span id="s918">I slept on top.</span> <span id="s919">And on the bottom I had a woman that she survived because of me.</span> <span id="s920">Because she always wanted, she said she's sick, she said she couldn't work, young woman, my age, and she said, I'm sick, I can't work, I go to the "Krankenstube," the sickroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">04:14:20 I said, Anne, if you go, and in Polish they call it Hanka, Anne is Hanka, if you don't go to work, you know, in a few days what happens to you - this happened, you see, I gave her an example, this happened to somebody else; this way you have a chance to survive and see your family.</span> <span id="s922">I think she was married.</span> <span id="s923">And see your husband maybe.</span> <span id="s924">Go, we are going to protect you, cause we all working, it's going to be that you work too.</span> <span id="s925">Just go.</span> <span id="s926">She can't.</span> <span id="s927">She went; because, if she would go to the "Krankenstube" --</span></p> <p><span id="s928">04:15:03 She met me after the war, she lives now in Chicago, I hope she's still alive, and I met her in Landsberg am Lech.</span> <span id="s929">She came to me and she said, you know, I thank you that I'm alive; she knew that.</span> <span id="s930">I did a few times risk my life by trying to find out how far the war was.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">04:15:30 We know at that time, where was the San Francisco meeting in January '45.</span> <span id="s932">You know in San Francisco they met for the, to put, in the United Nations, that help to settle the war.</span> <span id="s933">You know about that meeting, so we know, I'll tell you how it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">04:15:55 At one spot from the big barracks, that a hole, was tremendous big hole; in the walks between, there was, at the end was a room where they had their office and the SS women they slept there, all night.</span> <span id="s935">They had a radio, and we could understand German, so the one that slept closest, would listen.</span> <span id="s936">They made believe they went to sleep, by time they were supposed to and then they listen and they knew things.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">04:16:37 Then was another source, the people there would come sometimes to me, and to other people and they bring things to do a part for you for them.</span> <span id="s938">You tried to communicate with them.</span> <span id="s939">Well, I don't speak French.</span> <span id="s940">I can speak Polish.</span> <span id="s941">I understand Czech.</span> <span id="s942">So if was a Czech, there came different, they were prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s943">They or, they bring a piece of newspaper, we could read.</span> <span id="s944">They knew that we wanted, survival, is, if you have hope, you be able to survive.</span> <span id="s945">So, they tried to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">04:17:25 Once I had, I had a very close, very close thing.</span> <span id="s947">The woman, that she stood by my, when I had somebody inside, and I was welding inside, she would stay by the door and, obviously, and watch.</span> <span id="s948">I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s949">So, once, I think I had a French guy, or, and I tried to communicate with him, he should tell me something, or explain how the war was.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">04:18:06 Anyway, when he finished, she called me out, and she slapped me over the face.</span> <span id="s951">She was a husky, strong women with the SS, you know, the black band, SS, there were those zig-zag star.</span> <span id="s952">And she said, in German, she knew that I understand, and she said, you spoke with the guy and she hit me over the face, that I saw stars; boy, that I didn't [fell down].</span> <span id="s953">And she said, like this, and the whole place where they were working was so quiet, like a pin it would drop, the machines stopped and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">04:18:48 And she said, when you come home I'll report you to the Oberscharführer.</span> <span id="s955">That's the commander of the German commander of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">04:19:01 Well, when you get reported to the Oberscharführer, give you such a beating that you have to go to the sickroom.</span> <span id="s957">When you go to the sick room, you don't go to work, forget about life.</span> <span id="s958">O.k., so, look, it was nothing that you could do.</span> <span id="s959">I just shook myself off and I just told her, that I don't speak his language, how do I could communicate with him?</span> <span id="s960">That I told her in German; it wasn't, and it's no use.</span> <span id="s961">Alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">04:19:37 Now, how I survived, I tell you, after I was told, all the women that knew me, they, in their heart they pray that she should forget, they shouldn't remember to, to report me to the Oberscharführer.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">04:19:56 When we came home, we start counting and counting, that was in the evening, and counting, how many, and first we missed two, then we missed three, and we were standing maybe, maybe three quarters of an hour or an hour.</span> <span id="s964">She forgot to report me.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">04:20:17 And that was, that story I called the power of prayer.</span> <span id="s966">They told me later that, that they all prayed that I, that they shouldn't remember, she should forget to report me, that what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">04:20:36</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: You said there were a lot of Hungarian women.</span> <span id="s969">Did everybody get along pretty well, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Did everybody get along?</span> <span id="s971">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Did you help each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Help each other?</span> <span id="s974">Well, I tell you.</span> <span id="s975">It doesn't have to be Hungarian women.</span> <span id="s976">They, all people were hungry.</span> <span id="s977">And people lost their dignity, do you know, they were stealing bread, from each other, at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">04:21:06 There was one woman, that we know, from, other people know, from home, comes, you know, a very fine person, and she, she stole the bread from, from her neighbor, the ration.</span> <span id="s979">I tell you, people lost their dignity.</span> <span id="s980">People what lost everything that was humane, left.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">04:21:44</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Would you say the conditions there were, okay?</span> <span id="s983">That you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Oh, the conditions, oh, I'm telling you, you have to, I had a person that was very close, and she got sick, and she went to the "Krankenstube," to the sickroom, and we never saw her anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">04:22:08</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Were a lot of people sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: She got sick.</span> <span id="s988">She couldn't go to work, and she never came out from there.</span> <span id="s989">You know what they said, they would transport off to, to; just to finish her off, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Were there many sick people?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">04:22:27</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Sure, always sick, in the ghetto were sick people and the thing, you could, you couldn't, and, you know how it was.</span> <span id="s993">They made themselves a show, the Germans.</span> <span id="s994">The rationed bread we got, everybody got the ration bread, right.</span> <span id="s995">The soup, they came with the soup, with a kettle, outside, and we used to run, with the, you know, the plate.</span> <span id="s996">It was such a thing that we had on the belt here, and with the spoon, that's what we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">04:22:59 So, when you eat up, there was still there, a lot of people were hungry, was a watery soup.</span> <span id="s998">They run the second time.</span> <span id="s999">Well, the second time, if you run, they made themself a show.</span> <span id="s1000">They hurt, with a, with a "Peitsche" [whip], they hit you, you got hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">04:23:17 I got once hit, until today I have a mark.</span> <span id="s1002">It's, the skin is not straight, smooth; it became like a, like a [grater/grey] there.</span> <span id="s1003">Sometimes I, I wear something, a nightgown, and I wear it, on the same spot, if I wear it long, it will make out a hole, so rough the skin is from, from that hit, that he hit me.</span> <span id="s1004">Was bleeding and then it healed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">04:23:47 So, since then, I knew, I told myself, Frances, you don't go anymore for any seconds, because this is a death sentence.</span> <span id="s1006">It's better to be hungry, and sit in your bed; I was sitting upstairs and I was watching through the window, how they, how they make the show.</span> <span id="s1007">So, people were still running for the thing, and they got hit.</span> <span id="s1008">And they got hit, was no good.</span> <span id="s1009">So I didn't want that.</span> <span id="s1010">04:24:14</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Now, you had mentioned, that the Germans were concerned about sabotage in their factory.</span> <span id="s1012">Did that happen?</span> <span id="s1013">Did you guys do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">04:24:31</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Well, if we tried, and I told you, and get caught, there was one way only, very cruel sentence.</span> <span id="s1016">So, sometimes the people did, yes.</span> <span id="s1017">Sometimes people did; of course, they, you know, you had to make something, in spite, they were so cruel to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Did you ever try to do anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">04:25:03</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: No.</span> <span id="s1021">If, if I, if I tried it, I do it in such a way that I thought I could never get caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: Can you give me an example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Yes, well, I,</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">04:25:20 like, when I worked in the, in the factory with the, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1025">If somebody did this, and I was the one that were responsible for this, I didn't want to have that, because it would cost me my life.</span> <span id="s1026">And here at, the things, so, I saw even if they -- it was very difficult, but I know that people did.</span> <span id="s1027">I, I, I, I can't tell you how, it came about, but I know that people tried.</span> <span id="s1028">And a lot of people lost thier life because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">04:26:01</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Who were the guards in this camp, where did they come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: The guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Your kapos or, and the guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: The kapos came from within.</span> <span id="s1034">They selected, women they were stronger, and they, they felt that they were the kapos,

id="s1041">This woman that hit me, she was, she was strong, and cheeks like this, red cheeks, and not like us, that we, we just had no food, to eat, nothing, starving, and had to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">04:26:54 At, five days we worked in the factory.</span> <span id="s1043">On, on the weekend, they sent us in the woods.</span> <span id="s1044">We worked in the woods, we gathered wood, caught little things and picked it together up, and make it in piles, and bring it to thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">04:27:14 In the middle of the week, we walked like a, walk a mile, in the morning.</span> <span id="s1046">It was dark, still, and at night, when we came home, was dark.</span> <span id="s1047">The five days we didn't see the sunshine.</span> <span id="s1048">Just on the weekend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">04:27:28 But that was the winter, it was cold.</span> <span id="s1050">And, and, and that's Niedersachsen, that's cold over there.</span> <span id="s1051">And I have wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1052">See, my, this part of the legs, I have very thin legs, and this got frozen, and right after the war they were all purple, just purple, from, because it was frozen, and swollen.</span> <span id="s1053">But in the years, it got a little better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">04:28:00 They say that after what the work I did in, in the camp, that I'm going to get TB and I would have to go to Switzerland to a sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1055">But I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">04:28:15</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: How long were you at Essen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: In, ah, in Hainichen?</span> <span id="s1059">We were from August to mid March.</span> <span id="s1060">Enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">05:00:44</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: So, you were at Essen until March of '45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Not, not Essen.</span> <span id="s1065">Essen was about 20 kilometers from, from the camp.</span> <span id="s1066">When they bombarded Essen, because it was, so, we could, we could, we could hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: What were you thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">05:01:02</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: We were, we were, we were thinking that, ah, things, that there is a hope, that maybe we survive.</span> <span id="s1070">I always hoped.</span> <span id="s1071">I had such a strong will, to see Hitler's demise.</span> <span id="s1072">You have no idea.</span> <span id="s1073">I, I just wished so, that I say, I just want to live and see him finished off, and I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">05:01:34</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: So, what happened next?</span> <span id="s1076">How did you come to leave Essen, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Well, one day they said, the, the German saw that they, they were surrounded, closer and closer and closer.</span> <span id="s1078">The Russian came in, that's not, was not the Allies, the Russian.</span> <span id="s1079">Maybe the, the Allies and the Russian at that part, from the air, and then, they, they, the closest place was to send us was Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1080">That's Sudetenland, between Austria and Germany and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1081">It's about, Theresienstadt is not far from Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: How did they send you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">05:02:32</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: We walked!</span> <span id="s1085">Six weeks!</span> <span id="s1086">Six weeks!</span> <span id="s1087">The, ah, we walked along the river Elbe; it's a very long river, and it goes -- we went so many cities by; at night they put us in wagons.</span> <span id="s1088">I think they were on the, standing there, and we went over there to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">05:03:11 In the day time, we marched, and whoever couldn't walk, either was left, behind, or was shot on the spot; it depend on the, and some, the, the Germans start running away, the one they were for the permanent, they were watching us.</span> <span id="s1090">One day the Oberscharführer disappeared; the head of the camp.</span> <span id="s1091">And, about, what we have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Did you eat?</span> <span id="s1093">Did they give you food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">05:03:53</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: They gave us some watery soup, and mostly we, we picked, there was spring already, and we learn how to pick what, what work, was edible, like some berries, and spinach.</span> <span id="s1096">So, we supplement that diet from this.</span> <span id="s1097">We washed in the Elbe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">05:04:17 We took off the dresses and looked for, all kinds of, dresses should be clean, cause you wear it so long and you can't wash.</span> <span id="s1099">By the, I tell you, all the time that I was in, in the, in the camp we just had cold water, never any warm water, to bathe.</span> <span id="s1100">very cold, ice cold water, was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">05:04:48</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Let me aks you something else.</span> <span id="s1103">On this six week march, did you go by German people or the local population, did they see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: No.</span> <span id="s1105">We saw, we came on a city that's called Aussig an der Elbe [Ústí nad Labem] and that was after a bombardment, and you should see what was swimming on top of the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">05:05:15 All kind of things, [live/light] things, were swimming on the river; was bombarded out from homes and it was, it fell in the river and was swimming on top, so we know.</span> <span id="s1107">And then, sometimes when on the road, it came airplanes, either Russian or the Allies and they bombard and the German would hide under the trains.</span> <span id="s1108">There.</span> <span id="s1109">Now we were walking.</span> <span id="s1110">We were walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">05:05:46</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: You would just continue walking, with the bombings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Weren't you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: We, we were happy when they come.</span> <span id="s1116">We were happy then they came.</span> <span id="s1117">Because they know something is going on, that some, some hope there is.</span> <span id="s1118">But for us, even when the war was finished, the war wasn't finished for us; for us, it wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">05:06:11</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: We'll get to that.</span> <span id="s1121">So, after you were walking for six weeks --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: We came to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1123">We came to Theresienstadt about, about end of April.</span> <span id="s1124">Yes, about, I think about two or three weeks we were until the liberation came in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: What were your impressions of Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: What were your impressions of this particular place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">05:06:41</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: They were, you felt the smell of the chimneys in Theresienstadt, but that time they, they, they didn't have, they didn't have time to, to gas us.</span> <span id="s1130">Look, they were busy with their own troubles, the Germans, you understand, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: So you were allowed --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">05:07:08</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: And then it was very difficult to survive, because was no food and we, we lived in a big place what we talking about, the "Kaserne," [barrack] remember?</span> <span id="s1134">There wasn't a barrack.</span> <span id="s1135">It was strong houses, that this house, this building that I was, was housing five thousand people, in one building, can you imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">05:07:39</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: In one building, five thousand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: All women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Women.</span> <span id="s1141">Yes, well, in this room; I don't know what they all were women.</span> <span id="s1142">In this room, we had a big room, was a very --</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">05:07:58</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: You were telling me about Theresienstadt and this large building you were living in.</span> <span id="s1145">What did you do all day?</span> <span id="s1146">Did they feed you?</span> <span id="s1147">Did they do anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: They, they, they, first was the Germans, and we didn't know how things, how long this going to take.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">05:08:23 In Theresienstadt we didn't work, we just, we loaf around.</span> <span id="s1150">We thought that something has to happen, something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s1151">We didn't know what, and who's going come from, we knew just that the Russians are closer and closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">05:08:41 We were liberated by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: So you just wandered around the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1155">Sure, how, how to, how to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">05:08:53</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: And they gave you a little food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Well, they give you - their first words along the German, were, they, they had to give us some ration of bread and a watery soup.</span> <span id="s1159">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Now, could you tell, that the conditions in this camp were any different from other places you had seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">05:09:14</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yes, each place about has the same.</span> <span id="s1163">You know, we know that there were designed, just to, to finish people's live, that's what they all were designed these, all camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: So, this didn't seem any better than the other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: No.</span> <span id="s1166">Better than Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: What?</span> <span id="s1168">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">05:09:49</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: I told you, Auschwitz was just a despair.</span> <span id="s1171">It was, Auschwitz was so terrible emotional.</span> <span id="s1172">You came in, and you felt, from there, nobody goes out.</span> <span id="s1173">Couldn't sleep at nights!</span> <span id="s1174">This was a very hopeless place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">05:10:14 Here, we just thought, well, hope, hopefully they not going to finish us off, that we going see the end of the war; we just hoped.</span> <span id="s1176">In Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Was this place where they had you sleep, was this part of the main camp or was it a little separate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">05:10:32</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: No, there was like a room, and I don't know how many of us slept in that room, but that when, then I tell you when, the thing, when the Russian came what we had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: So you weren't aware of, you know, in Theresienstadt, we learned later on, it was, conditions actually were a little better and they had cultural programs and all kinds of things but at the end, none of this was noticeable?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">05:11:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Well, nobody thought about, we thought about survival.</span> <span id="s1183">If people are hungry, they don't think about any cultural things.</span> <span id="s1184">If the stomach calls for food, you can't think about culture, or reading, or anything, or art, or whatever, or whatever your profession is to do.</span> <span id="s1185">You just think, that without food you can't exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">05:11:26 So, that's, there was no any need for that, because, there was one, one, one object, one thing, goal, to survive.</span> <span id="s1187">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">05:11:40</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Did the Germans who were in charge there, stay there until the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Well, the most, they, a lot run away, that became like a chaos, later, towards the end.</span> <span id="s1191">They threw away the uniforms, and they find some, you know, if they weren't from there, and put on civil clothes, there was plenty clothing over there, and they just, make belief, like, you know, then they fished them out to find out who was who, and some escaped.</span> <span id="s1192">You know, South America helped a lot of them to, to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">05:12:20</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: So, tell me about the last week there and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Well, what happened?</span> <span id="s1196">We were liberated the last day of the war, that was V-day, May 8, 1945.</span> <span id="s1197">That was the day of our liberation.</span> <span id="s1198">But for us, it wasn't a day of liberation, anyway.</span> <span id="s1199">I explain you why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">05:12:46 First of all, at the beginning, in the camp, a, a young girl was so excited, and we knew that the Russians are coming, the Russians are coming, and she run, and wanted to greet a Russian soldier in a tank, and she got killed.</span> <span id="s1201">She was runned over by, by the tank.</span> <span id="s1202">That was the first thing, with the first Russian thing, so that was one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">05:13:16 And then, when the Russian came, they spoke, I could understand what they talk to us, they used to say, well we liberated you, we did liberate you, they said in Russian, and you don't want to love us, so we knew it's going to come for us, so it came at night;</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">05:13:41 we used to barricade all the doors and windows; all the furniture, there were benches over there, and chairs, you know, the furniture heavy, like oak, heavy oak furniture was the, so we put it against, and we didn't go to sleep first, until the barricade was up the ceiling, that they couldn't open the door.</span> <span id="s1205">We were afraid for raping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">05:14:05</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: And that was happening?</span> <span id="s1208">Right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Well, these people came, they didn't see a woman for, I don't know for how long.</span> <span id="s1210">They came from those, you know, oh, far parts from Russia, Asiatic, Asian parts Russia, and they were women crazy.</span> <span id="s1211">So, wasn't - and each invader, if you would think, soldiers come, come on a foreign territory, [that, no kid ourself], they do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">05:14:42</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: So, did you know people who were raped?</span> <span id="s1214">Did you know of circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: We, we, we, we just tried to prevent that it shouldn't happen to us.</span> <span id="s1216">We were afraid of this.</span> <span id="s1217">Of course, to begin the captain, the one that run the Russians, he didn't know about that;</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">05:15:06 so the first few days we had to, with the food was, who was stronger would run three times for the soup, and the one, of --.</span> <span id="s1219">So many people were, looked like, we called them "Muselmanns," just skeletons, nothing, flesh and bone, you know, nothing left.</span> <span id="s1220">05:15:29 So, they didn't have the strength even run for the soup.</span> <span id="s1221">They couldn't get the soup because the stronger one ran before them and it was finished, with the kettle soup.</span> <span id="s1222">So people got sick, after the liberation, people died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">05:15:49 You know, that they died, first of all, they brought, they didn't know how to feed people like us.</span> <span id="s1224">They brought sacks of sugar.</span> <span id="s1225">They distribute the sugar.</span> <span id="s1226">If you give people on a hungry, on a empty stomach sugar, from sugar you get diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1227">And you get diarrhea when people are so, you know, there is nothing left, they die.</span> <span id="s1228">No medication for it, or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">05:16:19 People die from the diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1230">You know, dehydration.</span> <span id="s1231">So, people died from diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1232">Then it came, no hygenic, no sanitation, no things, so it came, typhus.</span> <span id="s1233">You know that 5,000 people after the liberation died on typhus, in Theresienstadt, 5,000 people!</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">05:16:48 So, then it came to the commander, the Russian commander, and he was the boss, he was a nice man, he understood the situation, and he told them, he said that these soldiers, they're going to do things like that.</span> <span id="s1235">They gone, if the woman doesn't want to go with them, they going to be very severe punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">05:17:11 So, at least, if the commander knew, we were, we had a little security.</span> <span id="s1237">And then they, but it took time to organize that everything, and organized that everybody would get food.</span> <span id="s1238">So, that's what I wrote in my story, that the war didn't end for us.</span> <span id="s1239">No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">05:17:35</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Did they bring in doctors to take care of all of the sick people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: They had Czech doctors over there.</span> <span id="s1243">They had a hospital, they had Czech doctors, but look, it was also everything very primitive, what they had, aspirin and stuff, I think some; eh, it took me, it could go away, very fast, but it, life has no, where should I go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">05:18:02 No home, no parents, no family, where to go?</span> <span id="s1245">What was the, what's the destiny?</span> <span id="s1246">Where do I go.</span> <span id="s1247">So, you had to get settled in some way, your mind.</span> <span id="s1248">That, you had to organize somehow your life, and this is not so simple, after so many years, that somebody told you what to do, not that you could do what you want to do.</span> <span id="s1249">That's difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">05:18:40 So, first I think, sometimes, yes, then I find out that, then we start looking for, if somebody's alive from the family, so I start looking for.</span> <span id="s1251">I knew, my father was, died, my mother wasn't there anymore.</span> <span id="s1252">I was looking for my brother.</span> <span id="s1253">So somebody said, the people coming in, because it was an open border already, but traveling was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">05:19:07 Even with travel, we had to travel with the same cars, not such a crowded condition and stuff like this, but same cattle cars, still if you want to go.</span> <span id="s1255">Because Germany was, most cities were, bombarded and ruined.</span> <span id="s1256">So, that my brother is in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: How long did you stay in --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">05:19:34</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: About July; I went to, we register to go; we, we, I, I figure out, they register us either to go to, whoever we had a choice, either to go to Israel, or to Palestine, or, or to the United States.</span> <span id="s1260">At that time you had, they open, they open the doors for, for refugees, the United States.</span> <span id="s1261">So, I sign up for the United States.</span> <span id="s1262">So we went to, they sent us to Landsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: O.k.</span> <span id="s1264">You were in Theresienstadt from May, April really, but from May to July, what were you doing there for those months?</span> <span id="s1265">What was the life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">05:20:30</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: We just, I, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1268">I don't remember, or I worked there, or I did something.</span> <span id="s1269">I just, oh, I know, I know what I did.</span> <span id="s1270">Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1271">O.k.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">05:20:44 Somebody organized a sewing machine, and I tried to help the women, so they should look a little more presentable, so they, we, they got the dress, I would help them to make it that would fit a little better, to make from one dress, take something, make a trim, or something; that we look, the hair grew a little bit that March, because, you know, where they got bald, cut to zero, so, we try to look like, like women.</span> <span id="s1273">So, that's what I did.</span> <span id="s1274">I sew a lot at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">05:21:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Was it difficult to, kind of, resurrect yourself, after all of this time, to feel human again, feel normal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Of course, that's why I couldn't go, like I told you, the feeling was, where to go?</span> <span

the young people, to convince young people; life has no, had no meaning, and the young people had no parents or anybody to direct them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">06:17:30 So, it was important, so that was a goal, to go there and to fight for your own country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: So, they gave them military training?</span> <span id="s1567">Is that what you're saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s1569">Ja, I'm talking about military training.</span> <span id="s1570">Obviously they did, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">06:17:48 Well, at that time, at that time there was still was boats.</span> <span id="s1572">They couldn't, they came to the shores of Israel, they didn't let them in.</span> <span id="s1573">You know this, from history, right.</span> <span id="s1574">So, it was a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1575">Until, until they declare, that the Jewish state, what's his name, President Truman was, he was instrumental in this, that this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">06:18:31</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: When you were working in Landsberg, did you get paid, did people get paid to work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: So when you had to buy tickets for theater or whatever, how did you pay for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">06:18:45</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: I, I, for my work in Germany, I didn't get paid anything.</span> <span id="s1582">When we came, that was like this, when we came to the United States, I think I got some, I got a certificate and they sent me to a bank, and I got some.</span> <span id="s1583">For all the years of work, just got --</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: You got it after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: After, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">06:19:11</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: Did you kind of see a rebirth of Jewish life in Landsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: Well, let me explain you something; we, the way we thought, a lot of people thought, very few people had in mind to remain in Germany, because that country was, or Poland, was soaken with Jewish blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">06:19:44 So nobody has decent mind and think, does, does, didn't want to stay there.</span> <span id="s1590">They want, immigrated elsewhere; a lot of people went to Australia, to Canada, to the United States, and of course, with Aliyah Bet, to Israel.</span> <span id="s1591">So that's what I'm telling you, and that was just building a new life;</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">06:20:07 you think we thought -- My brother went a year before me, so, oh, they thought I thought when we come, God knows what's waiting for me in the United States.</span> <span id="s1593">It wasn't so rosy, believe me.</span> <span id="s1594">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">06:20:24</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Was the morale fairly good in the camp in Landsberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: I didn't follow you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: The morale.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Oh, the morale?</span> <span id="s1600">The morale was good, yes.</span> <span id="s1601">Morale was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Anything else you can remember that might be important, interesting about the life in Landsberg, and how people lived and what they were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">06:20:51</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: Oh, I tell you.</span> <span id="s1605">A lot of people had different, had different goals in life.</span> <span id="s1606">A lot of people, especial men, they, they went to Poland and they brought some articles and they could make -- they make money.</span> <span id="s1607">They bought for such a price and sold for more.</span> <span id="s1608">They sold for the demand; people wanted those items.</span> <span id="s1609">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">06:21:19 It was always kind of risky, traveling back and forth and stuff, but some, a lot of young people did that.</span> <span id="s1611">But this is nothing for permanent, for to settle, wife; so, it depends.</span> <span id="s1612">Some people that could work with their mind or with their hands and some people just different, feel different like making a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">06:21:54</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: So, you decided to come to the United States, why, instead of Palestine, Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Well, I didn't, I didn't think, we just didn't think that, over there at that time you had to be a pioneer.</span> <span id="s1616">That after the war, and after what we went through, how much I was for Israel, I didn't think that I can go and go through the hardship in build a new land.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">06:22:24 Just, just honestly, I didn't feel that I was capable to do that; and that's why well, we figured out, we come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1618">it's not that it's going to be -- Manna doesn't come from heaven.</span> <span id="s1619">It's going to be a struggle; but every beginning is hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">06:22:50</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: Was it difficult to get a Visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: No, you have to have an affidavit that you're not going to fall to, you not going to get, that you be independent, that you're willing to go to work, and you have somebody that will offer you the job and you're not going to fall, I say, think that you be, must pay you for welfare, stuff like this, that the other citizen will have to support you, no.</span> <span id="s1623">So, if you had an affidavit like that, they would give you a visa.</span> <span id="s1624">At that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">06:23:32</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: So, it didn't take too long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: No.</span> <span id="s1628">No, didn't take much long.</span> <span id="s1629">Well, we were just that, and that was, you know who helped then, the HIAS.</span> <span id="s1630">You know the HIAS?</span> <span id="s1631">The organization?</span> <span id="s1632">Yes.</span> <span id="s1633">And the HIAS helped solve stuff in the United States, and when we came, we had a, first we live in Brooklyn on the third floor with, a little girl that was, what, maybe 18 months old and the room was, this size, no smaller,</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">06:24:15 and the carriage had no place, to, it stay in the hall, by the lady, we lived with, the, as a, tenant, with the lady that has the house, she gave us a room, just a room, pay, so it wasn't so easy.</span> <span id="s1635">I had to look for work; I had a small child, I couldn't go to work, so just my husband had to go, to work, find work and that wasn't easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">06:24:43 Look, I just start working, you know when?</span> <span id="s1637">When my kid could get the key from the house, they were ten, twelve years old, and I could depend that they can open the door and stay by themself, and they don't, I can trust them they won't let anybody in, then I, you know, there were no parents, no family close by that could just do the thing there.</span> <span id="s1638">And then I looked, I looked, I looked for a job.</span> <span id="s1639">I wanted to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">07:00:44</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: When you arrived in New York, what were your first impressions, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: First thing, we thought, that we have to learn the language, because to be in a country, and without, not knowing the language, it's a big handicap.</span> <span id="s1644">So Dave went to school and I went to school.</span> <span id="s1645">And, like, he, we managed somehow and sometimes we take from a neighbor a kid, they were watching, you know, we had a -- one kid and then, my son, the kids are two years apart.</span> <span id="s1646">That's what I had - a daughter and a son, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">07:01:39 So, we went to school and went to school, and I was just keeping house and watching the children and raising the kids.</span> <span id="s1648">When the kids start growing up, we lived in a section where the school, we didn't like the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">07:02:07 So, we figure out, when the chil-, when my daughter is going to be five years old, we have to move from that neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1650">We did, we made an effort, and we moved the neighborhood that she be able to go to a different school, public school.</span> <span id="s1651">So we did, we moved from - that was in Brooklyn, we moved to Astoria, that's Long Island.</span> <span id="s1652">I mean, it was, the school was a nice school, an old school, a public school.</span> <span id="s1653">And then, when we, look, I told you-</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">07:02:41 I told you, I first, my thing, I wanted to work in my field and accomplish something.</span> <span id="s1655">It gives me a good feeling when I work in my field;
