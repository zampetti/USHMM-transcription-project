id="s17">I was born July 31st, 1921 in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And because there were several questions that I have after watching the videotaped interview, I thought several things were not discussed in detail enough, I would like to go back, actually, to the beginning, even before you born and just ask a few follow up questions.</span> <span id="s19">The first would be, until -- before you were born, actually, until 1921, your family was in -- in this country, in the U.S..</span> <span id="s20">Where did they live and what did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Yes, my parents come to this country i -- before first World War.</span> <span id="s22">And they were married o -- here in this country, North Adams, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s23">And they had three sons, and in 1921, after the first World War, my mother decided to go Poland.</span> <span id="s24">I don’t know whether she go for a visit, or she go for steady -- to stay in Poland.</span> <span id="s25">And at that time, 1921, she was pregnant with me.</span> <span id="s26">Soon she arrived to Poland, two months after that, I was born in Poland.</span> <span id="s27">So otherwise, my three brothers was born here, and my father stay in this country, just my mother and my three brothers, and she was pregnant with me, she come t -- t -- to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: But you never quite knew why that happened, why was your father still here?</span> <span id="s29">Was the idea to go back eventually, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: I think that was little bit differences in their marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Okay, let’s le -- we can le -- we can leave it at that.</span> <span id="s32">Now, when you were back, or when your mother was back in Poland, did you have a little bit of land there?</span> <span id="s33">Where did you go to and how did she make a living, how did she care for the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes, my mother had a few acres land, and I was grow up there on the country, by Tarnów, wa -- quite a ways from Tarnów, their name is Byshutshin, and the village was [indecipherable] what is hard to pronounce, right, for you?</span> <span id="s35">Okay, and I go school there, and soon I finished the school, I myself go to the big city, Tarnów, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Let’s go back -- let’s go back just a little bit to -- to the first village.</span> <span id="s37">How lo -- how many years of schooling did you -- did you get?</span> <span id="s38">For how many years did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Well, that was seven years.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And what does the -- can you describe a little bit more about the situation in the village?</span> <span id="s41">Was there, for instance, some kind of Jewish community?</span> <span id="s42">Did you have contact with Jewish neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Oh yes, we go out with the Jewish people, we had some people, Jewish people in our village, and also there was a -- a little city by the name Struchin, and that was, I should say, 50 percent Jewish population, in that city, and we was very close with the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Now, when you went to Tarnów, that was a larger city, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: And you became a dishwasher in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: I started as a di-dishwasher.</span> <span id="s48">See, you gotta start somehow, somewhere.</span> <span id="s49">And I started, but I didn’t stay too long ba -- in a elegant, Jewish restaurant, there was a club, 300 members they had, and had all rich Jewish people belong as members there.</span> <span id="s50">But I didn’t stay too long there, and my idea was to learn something, and I go to the bakery and I become a bakery apprentice.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: And you stayed there for about two years and then the German invaded Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: And the bakery was closed, and you had to go back to the village and to your mother, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: You said in the -- in the videotaped interview that the Germans started pretty much right away arresting and executing Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: You mention an incident there where Jewish people that you know were also rounded up and -- and -- and shot.</span> <span id="s58">Did you witness that yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: No, I didn’t witness, but I was there close, I was -- matter of fact, I was in that Struchin, that was Struchin.</span> <span id="s60">On a videotape they put a drawing, you know, [indecipherable] no, this is -- that was in Struchin, was just a two, three kilometer away, you know, little city.</span> <span id="s61">And that was a -- quite a -- quite a Jewish population, and those Jewish, we used to do business, we used to buy from those Jewish people, they have businesses, and we know those Jewish -- those Jewish people, see?</span> <span id="s62">Like for instance, one cabinet maker, and o-other -- the other one was -- sa -- had a tobacco business.</span> <span id="s63">And another one was photog -- photographer.</span> <span id="s64">I remember his name, he was-- name was Plushnik.</span> <span id="s65">And that was a day when the Germans come to that town.</span> <span id="s66">There was a special outfit, German outfit, SS, and they rounded up those Jewish people, just pull them out, you know, they would -- whoever they can catch them.</span> <span id="s67">And I believe that was 20 sener -- seven, 27 Jewish people.</span> <span id="s68">They -- they bring them to the park there, not far away from that church, they give them the shovels, picks -- picks and shovels, they dig out the graves for themself, and they shot them.</span> <span id="s69">And that was awful scare and the Germans told u -- told us -- told the Polish people, you gonna be the next.</span> <span id="s70">And that was very scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: But this particular incident you did not see it, just of -- you heard about it, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: I di -- I didn’t see it on own -- in my own eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Did you see anything that was directed against the Polish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Oh -- oh yes, oh yes, there was quite a few Polish people arrested, same time.</span> <span id="s75">First they go a-after intelligentsia, like teachers, you know.</span> <span id="s76">And they was arrested, many fact from Tarnów.</span> <span id="s77">That was their first transport to Auschwitz, to the concentration camp, first transport.</span> <span id="s78">That was strictly Polish people, professors, teachers, you know, all kind of intelligentsia, you know.</span> <span id="s79">That was -- I believe that was 170 some the intelligentsia.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: I just have to get the microphone a little bit further away, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: -- yeah, that should do.</span> <span id="s83">Do you know when that was, roughly, with the first transport with Polish people?</span> <span id="s84">A: I believe this is right after they build out that concentration camp, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s85">So the Jewish people who come to the concentration camp Auschwitz come later, but the first prisoner was the Polish teachers and professionals, you know, and priests.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Did you -- did you and your mother talk about the situation, what to do, or did you just kind of wait?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: We just wait, and gosh, you know, we were scared and you didn’t know what’s going to happen to you, see?</span> <span id="s88">Because we didn't know -- we didn’t know what the Germans going to do to us, see?</span> <span id="s89">That was pretty rough, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And when the Polish army receded, drew ba -- withdrew while the Germans came in, there was -- weaponry was left?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And you happened to -- to find a gun and you decided to keep it, although at that time the German orders were pretty clear about what would happen.</span> <span id="s93">I mean, Polish citizens were supposed to deliver all the weapons to the Germans, or there was a death sentence if they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: My -- my question would be, why did you decide to keep it?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Oh my gosh, I was going through the woods, and I see something on the side, you know, a -- a fresh leafs, you know, and this some -- you know something is there.</span> <span id="s97">So I go there and I -- I -- I move the leafs you know, and I see beautiful, brand new rifle.</span> <span id="s98">So, I take it.</span> <span id="s99">I took it and I bring it home, and I put him in a -- in a barn.</span> <span id="s100">I hide him in a -- in a hay.</span> <span id="s101">But, same time, somebody saw me.</span> <span id="s102">And you know, people are people.</span> <span id="s103">People talk.</span> <span id="s104">And somebody make a denunciation on me to the chief of police, and he was a -- he was a German.</span> <span id="s105">Eventually, you know, they called me, and they told me to bring the rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: So you kept it, di -- why -- but actually why did you keep it?</span> <span id="s107">Because, I mean, you were young, you were a young --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: -- boy, a young man at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Foolish.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Did you -- but did you think it would be useful for you to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: I didn't think really about that, but just to ha-have an beautiful rifle, you know.</span> <span id="s113">Maybe go hunting.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Was -- was that sort of -- how did you feel about a Polish -- a fellow Polish person going to the Germans, though, and denouncing you?</span> <span id="s115">I mean, was that something --</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: I don’t know how this happened, that I can answer these questions, see, because you know, you never know, you never know.</span> <span id="s117">But I know that was how they find out, see?</span> <span id="s118">Somebody must say something.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: So and then you were brought to the Gestapo in Linz, and you were interrogated?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: No, first --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Oh, no, no, no, I’m sorry, you were what -- but you were brought to the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: -- fir --</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: -- the Gestapo</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: -- first their chief, his name was Vanline.</span> <span id="s125">Many people know that name from my area where I come from, you know.</span> <span id="s126">He was -- he was a tough guy.</span> <span id="s127">He speak fluently Polish.</span> <span id="s128">Matter of fact, before the war, he was a engineer there, from the bridge there -- they was build up the bridge.</span> <span id="s129">He was a engineer, but at the same time he was a spy, he was working for Germans.</span> <span id="s130">And then, after the Germans come, he become the commandant of that police station there.</span> <span id="s131">So he questioned me.</span> <span id="s132">Did you bring your rifle?</span> <span id="s133">Which -- and I says, no, I haven’t got no rifle.</span> <span id="s134">Yes, you have.</span> <span id="s135">You know, and this, and this, and this and then they beat me pretty bad, you know.</span> <span id="s136">Yeah.</span> <span id="s137">Himself, you know, gave me 25 on my rear end, and there was two other guys, you know, they beat me too.</span> <span id="s138">Then I was lucky because the people from the village come to him and they say I am innocent.</span> <span id="s139">I was working in a bakery and I had a good record, you know, I was clean.</span> <span id="s140">And he changed the mind, and he says, yeah, on one condition.</span> <span id="s141">We let you go, but Wednesday we gonna recruit in some young people for Germany to work.</span> <span id="s142">Now, why don’t you be there, and you go Germany, and you be -- going to be more safe in Germany than here.</span> <span id="s143">He told me so.</span> <span id="s144">So me and friend of mine and few others, we go Wednesday there, we registered there, and they put us on a train and we go, who knows where we go, what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s145">That was very hard for me, that early in the morning, to say good-bye to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: But then you did not go to Germany after all, you were brought to Austria --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: -- at this time to Linz.</span> <span id="s149">Did you ever find out why that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, at that time they needed young people on the farms, in the -- in the factories, and happen our transport, that was -- they pick up some more in Tarnów, in Kraków, they pick up more, more people, young people.</span> <span id="s151">And happened that -- that this transport go to Austria [indecipherable] Czechoslovakia, and -- at that time, and Vienna, and from Vienna, Linz [indecipherable] yeah, and from Linz we go to the farms, say -- me, and friend of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: And so, at the unemployment office then, there were farmers waiting for the help to come, and one of them waiting was your wife-to-be, your future wife, Frieda, and you went to her parent’s farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: This is a -- a really coincident, and a good coincident, I should say.</span> <span id="s154">Good and bad and good.</span> <span id="s155">Yes.</span> <span id="s156">So we was pick up by the young, blonde lady.</span> <span id="s157">She was that time what, 18 - 19 years old.</span> <span id="s158">Because, actually, her father’s supposed to come.</span> <span id="s159">Her father was a big farmer there.</span> <span id="s160">But he catch cold, for some reason he couldn’t go, so he sent Frieda.</span> <span id="s161">Frieda was his favorite daughter, you know, he love her.</span> <span id="s162">And Frieda pick us up, me and friend of mine by the name Frank.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: And then at that farm you had to work very hard, but apparently you had meals at the table with the family, the food was plentiful, the food was good.</span> <span id="s164">How did you feel though, towards the situation?</span> <span id="s165">I mean, it was forced labor after all.</span> <span id="s166">Did you feel resentment towards -- towards the -- the parents in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Oh, oh, I -- I can’t complain, because number one, they treat us very, very good.</span> <span id="s168">They -- Greinegger, that’s the name of the -- of that -- her father, Greinegger family, they treat us good.</span> <span id="s169">They feed us -- we eat by the same table with the whole family.</span> <span id="s170">Would you believe we had five meals every day?</span> <span id="s171">And we had meat every day.</span> <span id="s172">And when you figure th-that was a war time, people in the city was living on a -- on a -- what you call?</span> <span id="s173">On a cards, you know?</span> <span id="s174">Just so much.</span> <span id="s175">We had plenty food.</span> <span id="s176">But also we work, on a farm you know, that was a hard work, but we don’t mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: And then you grew -- because you also worked with Frieda on the -- on the -- on the fields, and whatever had to be done there, you grew a little closer.</span> <span id="s178">You got to know each other just a little bit, I mean, under very difficult conditions.</span> <span id="s179">And then one day you said that you asked her whether you could listen to the radio --</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: -- on -- actually, it’s not in your story, but I think it is in -- it -- it’s definitely in your wife’s story, that you asked her whether you could listen to the radio because you didn’t know much was happening in the world, and that was also very forbidden, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Her father had a special room that he had a little office over there, and on the wall you can see all those rifles, you know, and that is because he was a -- he had this hunting area there.</span> <span id="s183">For a hundred years there was the hunting license in that house.</span> <span id="s184">And there was a radio in that time, yeah.</span> <span id="s185">And when everybody goes sleep, you know, Frieda opened the door, you know, and let me listen to the radio.</span> <span id="s186">So 10 o’clock in the evening there was a very interesting news in Poland -- in Polish from England.</span> <span id="s187">And that was very interesting.</span> <span id="s188">And somebody hear this, somebody find out that -- I don’t know how the Gestapo find out about that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s189">That was one reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Somebody must have seen you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Could be, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: But that did not -- but -- but -- but you still could stay on the farm, or -- you -- you were not immediately brought to -- to the Gestapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: But then after awhile you got a little too close with Frieda for father’s taste, because it was a dangerous situation, so he gave you an ultimatum basically.</span> <span id="s195">He brought you into the room and he said that one of you would have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Oh that -- that happened after -- now tha -- we gotta go back little bit, see, like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s197">So, we was working altogether.</span> <span id="s198">There was four daughters, you know, he -- Mr. Greinegger had four daughters and one son.</span> <span id="s199">And one of the daughter, by the name Frieda, that’s the same Frieda pick us up in the -- you know, when we come from the transport.</span> <span id="s200">And happen that winter we was working in the woods, because they had -- they had, I don’t know, about 20 acres woods, so we got the woods for the -- for the use -- for the house use, and they had for sale, okay.</span> <span id="s201">And it happened we work in the -- we work in the woods, then we work on the farm.</span> <span id="s202">And it happened we -- we come -- me and Frieda, we come closer and closer.</span> <span id="s203">We was very friendly to each other, see?</span> <span id="s204">She was a beautiful, beautiful blonde.</span> <span id="s205">And they say I was good looking too, I don’t know, I’m not sure about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: You still are, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s208">So, it gets closer and closer til agains -- that was too much.</span> <span id="s209">So the father that time called Frieda and he had a speech with her.</span> <span id="s210">And he says, “You come too close with Julian, and you know this is against the law.</span> <span id="s211">You know what’s going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s212">You know what’s going to happen to him.</span> <span id="s213">And who knows what a g -- what’s going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s214">This is against the law to have anything to do with a foreigner.”</span> <span id="s215">And he was right.</span> <span id="s216">Yeah.</span> <span id="s217">So he was pretty tough, first time as she can remember, and she slap her over the -- on her face, you know, slapped her, yeah.</span> <span id="s218">And she was crying.</span> <span id="s219">Then after that he called me.</span> <span id="s220">And he had a speech to me, yeah.</span> <span id="s221">And he told me absolutely this is against the law.</span> <span id="s222">You -- you can -- you can’t have anything to do with my daughter anyway.</span> <span id="s223">So one of you gotta go.</span> <span id="s224">Which one?</span> <span id="s225">And for some reason Frieda want to go.</span> <span id="s226">And she want to -- she want me to stay on the -- on the farm.</span> <span id="s227">He says, that’s up to you.</span> <span id="s228">You want to go, okay, and Julian stay on this farm.</span> <span id="s229">And that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Wh-When -- when we talk about being close, what -- what did that really mean?</span> <span id="s231">I mean, you did not speak Austrian -- German -- Austrian in -- very much, she didn’t speak Polish.</span> <span id="s232">What did you talk about?</span> <span id="s233">I mean, closeness, what did -- what did that really mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Oh, you’d be surprised when you -- when you like somebody how fast you learn -- how fast you learn that language.</span> <span id="s235">And I -- I knew some words from -- from the school, you know, and didn’t take me long.</span> <span id="s236">Matter of fact, in a -- in a -- in a year I pick up about oh, I should say 70 percent German language.</span> <span id="s237">What is -- Austrian language is German language, just a different -- different dialect, you see.</span> <span id="s238">So we a -- we like each other, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Was it surprising to you though, that Frieda decided to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Frieda, yeah.</span> <span id="s241">She decided, yeah.</span> <span id="s242">And she went.</span> <span id="s243">And that was -- that was unusual see, because there was a such a big farm, so many acres land and everything, you know, was plenty work, you know, but one of us gotta go.</span> <span id="s244">They want to split us.</span> <span id="s245">Doesn’t matter who goes, who stays.</span> <span id="s246">So happened she goes to another farm, quite a ways from that place.</span> <span id="s247">But we make a promise, you know, the first Sunday we’re going to meet by the church there in that town where she was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Let -- let me -- let me just ask you a little -- little tiny thing here.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: I think in your story I realized that you seemed to indicate a little bit that Frieda asked you, and in Frieda’s story, in your wife’s story, I always had a little feeling that -- that you asked her.</span> <span id="s251">So, who -- who asked -- wh-who made that -- who made the decision to -- you kind of agreed that you would see each other, or who --</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Well, this happened -- we -- really, that’s a tough question, you know.</span> <span id="s253">We don’t know how this happened, see?</span> <span id="s254">You can’t tell with the friendshi -- where -- where the friendship begin, where that ends and where the love starts, you know?</span> <span id="s255">It’s hard to -- to say it, see?</span> <span id="s256">But we like -- we like each other so much, so we don’t want to be split.</span> <span id="s257">We want to meet each other and we want to continue.</span> <span id="s258">And that’s probably what we’re falling in love, that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: So you stayed on -- on her f -- on the large -- on the big farm with Frieda’s parents and she went to another, smaller farm -- I don’t quite remember, about 15 kilometers, or sort of not too far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: And you decided to see each other.</span> <span id="s262">But then somebody found out about it and denounced you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Do you know who -- what kind of person that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: We had pretty close i-idea, but we -- we can’t be assure for 100 percent, but anyway, anyway, again, you got some people, they say everything, you know, and they make a denunciation.</span> <span id="s266">So one s -- that was Saturday evening, I drive -- I go see Frieda and I -- I thi -- finding in that place where we should meet.</span> <span id="s267">Then after that I find out she was arrested, after.</span> <span id="s268">So they come in and ar-arrest me -- Gestapo -- police, you know, and the police delivered me to the Gestapo in Linz.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Before you go one from there, let me just ask you one more question.</span> <span id="s270">How long, roughly, did you stay at her parent’s farm?</span> <span id="s271">How -- how long -- wh-what kind of time are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Til November.</span> <span id="s273">November 1940, I think.</span> <span id="s274">We was arrested first time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: So that was about what, like a half a year or a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: No, that was almost a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Almost a year, now?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: And then you were interrogated again, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: 11 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: 11 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: But they decided to -- to let you go, and to send you to a different -- to different --</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: They interrogate me and Frieda, and Frieda says no, there was nothing between us, just friendship, and same thing I -- I -- I was saying.</span> <span id="s285">See, because we agree, you know, in case we got caught, you know, we should say there was nothing.</span> <span id="s286">Actually was nothing, see, besides you know, we lo -- we love each other, you know, and -- and -- a-and this.</span> <span id="s287">And so they, after 11 days they let me go.</span> <span id="s288">That was on Friday, November 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: But [indecipherable] I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: That was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: And they didn't lay a hand on me, they -- they -- they were tough, you know, they ask tough question you know, and they look at me straight in eyes, you know, and then the chief says, well, I think he tell us the truth.</span> <span id="s293">Okay, we let him go.</span> <span id="s294">But, before you go, here is the paper and you read this.</span> <span id="s295">That was in German on one side, and that was in Polish, for anything to do, the bottom line, anything to do with German or Austrian women for the Auslander -- for the foreigner, death sentence, to hanging.</span> <span id="s296">And he says, okay, sign your name.</span> <span id="s297">So I did sign my name.</span> <span id="s298">And they gave -- and then they let me go back to Frieda’s father to pick up my belongings, and they already sent -- they had a address, and they send me to another farmer.</span> <span id="s299">Little smaller, but also nice people.</span> <span id="s300">Different direction.</span> <span id="s301">So on Monday, okay, on Monday in the morning they call Frieda and they tell her, okay, you free, but you sign some paper.</span> <span id="s302">And the same paper, she signed what I signed Friday, okay?</span> <span id="s303">Tha -- but they say -- I don’t know what this says on -- on -- on that.</span> <span id="s304">Well, she read the same thing, you know, death sentence, you know, for anything to have -- to do with a German woman.</span> <span id="s305">So you wouldn’t believe, you know, by coincident I go Friday there to Frieda’s father, the farm, pick up my belonging and stay over Saturday and Sunday, and Monday morning I take the train and come back to Linz.</span> <span id="s306">And that Monday morning Frieda was going free.</span> <span id="s307">And you wouldn’t believe, I was waiting for my train going in a direction and I walk, I don’t know what I was thinking, and come head on to Frieda.</span> <span id="s308">I thought this is impossible, but I was very happy to see.</span> <span id="s309">So we go on the side quick, we exchanged the addresses.</span> <span id="s310">She go for another farm.</span> <span id="s311">They didn’t send her home, no, another farm.</span> <span id="s312">A small -- really small farm, they needed her, and she go there.</span> <span id="s313">And again we make a agreement that we -- that first Sunday [indecipherable] first Sunday, we gonna meet there somewhere halfway between li -- Velz and Gunskiha -- oh, Velz and Linz on the Auterstrassen.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: I think this is a good time to change the cassette here.</span> <span id="s315">This is the end of tape one, side A interview with Julian Noga.</span> <span id="s316">This is a -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Julian Noga.</span> <span id="s318">This is tape number one, side B. So, you both worked on different farms now, but you still decided to see each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: But once again you got, eventually, denounced by the farmer.</span> <span id="s321">Frieda’s farmer at first knew about it but decided not to say anything, but when she decided to give up the job on that farm to take another job, he decided to -- to announce you to the -- to the SS, to the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Exactly, that’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s324">And so this time what -- then what happened?</span> <span id="s325">You were -- both of -- both of you were arrested, and you had to stay in -- in jail for quite a long time this time, wasn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s327">First Frieda was arrested, and when I went there and she didn’t show up wher -- where she’s supposed to show up, you know, where we meet.</span> <span id="s328">Then I had a bad conscience or how shou -- bad feeling something might happen, because we were supposed to meet.</span> <span id="s329">Then on September 19, on that farm where I was working, their name was Prosmueller, that was on either side of Linz between Linz and Vienna, just a -- oh, about four or five kilometer from the very well known concentration camp Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s330">And that day, on that day, that was again Friday.</span> <span id="s331">Friday is a bad day for me.</span> <span id="s332">Was, at least.</span> <span id="s333">And we was -- before noon we was digging potatoes there on that farm, and I was working with that -- with the horses, yeah, and we come for lunch, and as we was eating lunch, from the -- the other side of the kitchen, somebody walk in, see?</span> <span id="s334">Then we hear the conversation.</span> <span id="s335">And what I hear, oh he’s very good, he’s very hard working, yeah, he is nice man, oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s336">That’s what they say.</span> <span id="s337">And that was a policeman.</span> <span id="s338">So after he questioned -- because the -- the -- the farmer, and the -- and the parents, they was eating in the kitchen, we was eating in the dining room, see?</span> <span id="s339">Then, after awhile, we just almost finished lunch, and that policeman come to the dining room and says, Julius Noga, I have to bring you to the Gestapo, to the Linz.</span> <span id="s340">He says, I have to bring you to the Linz.</span> <span id="s341">I says, Gestapo?</span> <span id="s342">He says yes.</span> <span id="s343">When I hear that word Gestapo, I know -- I already knew it is Gestapo.</span> <span id="s344">I says, oh God.</span> <span id="s345">Good-bye.</span> <span id="s346">He says, okay, you change your clothes, take whatever you need like toothbrush and soap, when you had, whatever, you know, take it with you, and you come with me.</span> <span id="s347">So we go on a station, regular station and we take the train.</span> <span id="s348">That was only 16 kilometer to Linz.</span> <span id="s349">So what was very hard for me to say good-bye to this wonderful family, you know?</span> <span id="s350">They took me as their own.</span> <span id="s351">They had two children, a little girl, Minnie, she was about eight years old, and Francel, he was about 10 - 11 years old.</span> <span id="s352">And the children was there, and he ask me, “Julian, where you going?”</span> <span id="s353">I says, “Well I have to go on Linz.”</span> <span id="s354">“What for?”</span> <span id="s355">I says, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s356">“Are you be back?”</span> <span id="s357">I says, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s358">“Oh, come on, Julian,” you know?</span> <span id="s359">Break my heart, cause those children were so nice.</span> <span id="s360">And the farmer come and says, “Julian, you have to go.</span> <span id="s361">Gosh, what did you do?”</span> <span id="s362">I says, “N-Not much.”</span> <span id="s363">“Well, I gonna help you all I can, okay?”</span> <span id="s364">So the policeman was good to me, I says well, okay, ha -- I gotta finish with my horses, see, I take care of the horses, I gotta give them water, I gotta give them some hay, you know?</span> <span id="s365">He says, go ahead, do it, yeah, okay, we got time.</span> <span id="s366">So I say good-bye to my horses.</span> <span id="s367">Such a big, beautiful, shiny horses, oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s368">That was a break -- a heartbreak.</span> <span id="s369">And there was a French war prisoner Louie, and I want to talk to Louie because I know he gonna take care of the horses, so I told Louie, Louie -- he understand pretty good German, I says, take care of those horses, they are very nice horses, you know?</span> <span id="s370">Don’t beat them, never beat them, you know.</span> <span id="s371">Treat them good, work with them slow, don’t rush them, you know.</span> <span id="s372">Take care of them.</span> <span id="s373">He says, I will, I will.</span> <span id="s374">So I say good-bye to horses and to everybody, so we go.</span> <span id="s375">Policeman had a -- a bicycle, so we walked to the station just a kilometer and a half, two kilom -- not even two kilometers.</span> <span id="s376">Then we were ou -- then he come to the ma -- where they sell the tickets, and there was a man, and -- yeah.</span> <span id="s377">And for that man, each morning he had a -- yeah, each morning I bring some milk, see?</span> <span id="s378">He was the -- he was the regular old man, you know, high ranking, and -- and he said -- the police ask him question because that was forbidden for Polish people to ride the tran -- train.</span> <span id="s379">So he asked, did you sell any tickets to this man here?</span> <span id="s380">And I was behind that policeman, and he look at me, and I -- I just make a motion no.</span> <span id="s381">And he says, no, I never sell him no tickets.</span> <span id="s382">Oh, good.</span> <span id="s383">So he put a [indecipherable] the tickets, or how many times he sell me the tickets, but he was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s384">His name was Schattsinger.</span> <span id="s385">Okay, so the train come, and I was standing there, and I was thinking, my gosh, you know, should I fall on the track, you know, and let the train go over me, you know, because I know this time it’s going to be tough, and I know what I gonna get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: You -- you -- you talked a -- you told that story in a -- on the videotape, so maybe we can just summarize a little bit by saying that you -- you spent what, 11 months, or quite a long time in jail.</span> <span id="s387">You tried to get out of jail, that was prevented.</span> <span id="s388">They found out about your attempt to break out, and eventually you were sent to -- to the concentration camp Flossenbürg.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: I would like to ask you a few questions about Flossenbürg, if that’s all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Okay, fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: One of the interrogating SS men there, asked you during the early time, when you had just arrived, whether you knew why you were sent to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: And you said, because of your relations to an Austrian girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: And he indicated that that was not so, but that you were there for revenge purposes too, to pay back, I believe you said, you p-payback for the German soldiers killed in Poland in Begost?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Bidgast.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: In Bidgast.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Did you ever find out whether that was the real reason, wh-whether that was really true?</span> <span id="s401">That seems to be a different --</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: I think that was his personal opinion, you know, probably he lost his friend or somebody there in Bidgast, that was -- that was big outbreak, before the war start over there.</span> <span id="s403">And probably he take advantage and tell me this in [indecipherable] you know, you here for those German soldier got killed in Bidgast.</span> <span id="s404">That -- I was surprised, you know, I -- I don’t even knew that time where is Bidgast, as far away from our place where we was living.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Tell us a little bit more about who was there in this concentration camp, where it was a stone quarry, where you had to work very hard cutting stones.</span> <span id="s406">What -- what was the population of that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: That time when I arrived, it was on a August, I believe August third in 1942.</span> <span id="s408">That was a small population I should say, not quite 2,000.</span> <span id="s409">And my number I -- I received my number, I don’t know if that number is right or not, 1623, that is my number.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: And what were the nationalities?</span> <span id="s411">I mean, you were Polish, were there also Jewish prisoners, were there Austrian German prisoners, what was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Oh yes, that was about 17 - 18 different nationalities in that concentration camp.</span> <span id="s413">And actually the oldest prisoners was Austrian and German.</span> <span id="s414">Actually, 1938, that Austrians prisoners, and German, they build up that concentration camp.</span> <span id="s415">There was no other -- other nationalities than the first.</span> <span id="s416">After they build up that concentration camp, I believe the first prisoners come from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s417">Then, naturally come from Poland and o-other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Were people treated differently depending on where they came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Maybe that was just a little differences between like French prisoners, English -- we had some English prisoners, too.</span> <span id="s420">Matter of fact, two Americans pilot, they was killed there, in Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s421">They run away from a stalag, from a regular war prisoners camp, and they was caught by Flossenbürg and they was brought to Flossenbürg, and after their questioning, they was executed, those two American pilots, and they’re in a death valley in Flossenbürg, they got the ledge, and American flag, and you can read on that ledge -- it is a big ledge, you know, six feet long and about 36 inches wide, about eight inches high, you know?</span> <span id="s422">And that was founded by Polish people, that ledge, Polish prisoners.</span> <span id="s423">And says, two Americans, unknown.</span> <span id="s424">But I remember when they was brought to the concentration camp, and I remember when they was questioned, yeah.</span> <span id="s425">And when you read those -- you got those ledges, about 17 or 18 in the death valley, you go from one to the other one, then you see how many people die, losted their life in that concentration camp in Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s426">You start with the Russian, over 25, 000.</span> <span id="s427">The next one gonna be Polish ledge, same size as the American ledge, you know, over 17,000.</span> <span id="s428">Then you got the French, then you got the Czechoslovak ledges, you know, 3,000 - 4,000 French, Czechoslovak, Italians.</span> <span id="s429">And -- and before you go any further before that you got a German ledge, and says exactly I want to say 5,969.</span> <span id="s430">Something like that.</span> <span id="s431">Almost 6,000 German people losted their life -- German prisoners losted their life there.</span> <span id="s432">That was a tough, tough concentration camp.</span> <span id="s433">When you are in, there was not much differences, you know.</span> <span id="s434">We was treated almost -- almost the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Were there Jewish prisoners, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yes, that was about -- it says on the -- on the -- on a board somewhere, and on a chimney, cremation chimney, it says 3,335 Jewish people lost their life in Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s437">Yes, they was there from Poland, from Hungary, from different -- German, Jewish too, from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Were they treated differently at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: They was treated bad.</span> <span id="s440">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s441">And they was working, you know, they give them the -- the hardest work, you know.</span> <span id="s442">There was Russian, Jewish people, and Polish people was treating the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: You did, in your videotaped interviews, speak about a German prisoner, Hans Bauer, who -- who had saved your life, twice I believe --</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: -- you speak very highly of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: More than twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: More than twice.</span> <span id="s448">We don’t have to say that over again, but was there -- w-were there other incidents where it wasn’t quite so black and white as one sometimes seems to think, where other people helped you, who were maybe also German, or other nationalities?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Well, Hans Bauer was German, you know, but he -- if he -- if he died, God give him heaven.</span> <span id="s450">He saved me so many times, not only twice, so many times, because we come in friends in Munich when we stay over the night there, and I even [indecipherable] his cigarettes, and he was a heavy smoker.</span> <span id="s451">And he says, “Okay, thank you, I can keep this -- that bag?”</span> <span id="s452">I says, “Keep it, because I got another one.”</span> <span id="s453">And he says, “Okay, you are a good fellow, I remember this.”</span> <span id="s454">Okay, and later on he become kapo -- foreman, you know, and many times he -- he had me, you know, I -- and -- and I was so glad, you know?</span> <span id="s455">I counted the -- once I fall in a -- well, the -- the -- th-the main kapo -- kapo in -- in a granite quarry caught me during the work, you know, and I was smoking.</span> <span id="s456">You not supposed to smoke for 12 hours when you work there in the quarry, so -- so he gave me shtaffkommando, what is shtaffkommando?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: It’s a punishment --</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Outfit.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: -- outfit, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s461">Now, in that punishment outfit you can’t last more than 30 days, you know, then you com -- either you commit suicide or they kill you, you know?</span> <span id="s462">And I, thanks God, you know, I was there seven or eight days, then one evening I saw Hans Bauer and I told him, I’m in a shtaffkommando.</span> <span id="s463">He says, “Why don’t you told me sooner?</span> <span id="s464">Okay, tomorrow morning you -- you go with my outfit to the quarry.”</span> <span id="s465">So next day I go, and a kapo from the other kommando, shtaffkommando, he come and says, “Hey, you not belong over here, come on.</span> <span id="s466">You belong to me.”</span> <span id="s467">Hans Bauer come to him, “Nevermind, he stay with me.”</span> <span id="s468">Oh.</span> <span id="s469">He was surprised you know, but you know, those kapos between themselves they don’t want to fight, you know?</span> <span id="s470">So I was lucky that time, he saved my life ri -- right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: What -- what -- what about the guards and SS authorities there, was there different kinds of -- of treatment, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s473">There was some, not all of them was bad.</span> <span id="s474">There was some people like we are too, you know.</span> <span id="s475">There was some -- was some bad ones, and also good ones.</span> <span id="s476">And we didn’t fright too much SS.</span> <span id="s477">What we was frightened, the kapos because they want to show the SS how good they are, they no have to work, you know, they just you know, had a better food, you know, plenty food, you know, and of course you know, hey kapos, you gotta be careful with the kapos.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Did you ever lose faith while you were there?</span> <span id="s479">I -- I believe you were brought up Catholic, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Was it -- was a strong -- was it a religious family, could one say that, or was it not so strong?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Ah, y-yes.</span> <span id="s483">Hans Bauer helped me because I told Hans Bauer several times, tomorrow I go commit suicide, I go on the barbed wire, you know, and they gonna shoot me, you know, I -- just a couple minutes you know, and I gonna go.</span> <span id="s484">[indecipherable] he call me crazy, you crazy he says.</span> <span id="s485">No, that’s the easiest way, you know.</span> <span id="s486">No, no, no, no, no, don’t do that.</span> <span id="s487">So he -- he helped me.</span> <span id="s488">Now, that was a time, especial that was so hard, you know, before big holidays gonna come, you know, like Christmas, Easter, you know, one Christmas, second Christmas, third Christmas and you still there.</span> <span id="s489">And you ask yourself, my gosh, what I did?</span> <span id="s490">I didn’t steal, I didn’t kill, you know?</span> <span id="s491">Because I loved someone?</span> <span id="s492">That’s what I’m here and I’m mixed up with those people over here?</span> <span id="s493">And sometime you -- when you see those execution almost every day, every other day they hang somebody, and they had big speeches, then you hear those shots every morning before six o’clock in death valley, then in the evening.</span> <span id="s494">Then you hear some shots at night, there by the crematorium, you know, the black wagon come with some kind of people, go straight to the crematorium, and you hear just a shotgun, you know?</span> <span id="s495">You hear -- you hear those shots, you know?</span> <span id="s496">So today people says, gosh, you know, some people disappeared, and many families, they don’t know how they disappeared.</span> <span id="s497">That was to Flossenbürg what they disappeared.</span> <span id="s498">And sometime -- sometime you -- you start to believe -- you start -- stop to believe if the God is right.</span> <span id="s499">I says no.</span> <span id="s500">God can’t see this, you know.</span> <span id="s501">And God -- how God let this happen?</span> <span id="s502">Then next time, you -- you cry, you pray, God forgive me.</span> <span id="s503">God, I love you.</span> <span id="s504">Please help me.</span> <span id="s505">Is so hard, you know, h-how you -- once you ready to die, you know, you no believe in nothing, you know the next time my gosh, maybe -- maybe po -- by some kind of coincident like Hans Bauer, many times he told me, maybe this gonna be some occasion, you know.</span> <span id="s506">Maybe we gonna be free someday.</span> <span id="s507">See?</span> <span id="s508">We ga -- but, on the other hand, have all kind of professors, you know, all smart people, politician and this and this, and on Sunday afternoon I like to hear what they say, you know?</span> <span id="s509">I learned lots from them.</span> <span id="s510">And they say the one thing what they did to us, they not gonna let us free.</span> <span id="s511">Before the Americans or Russian, whoever come first, before they come in, they gonna kill us all.</span> <span id="s512">So they gonna, how should I say [indecipherable] --</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Erase.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: -- the evidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Erase the evidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Erase the evidence, you know, no witnesses.</span> <span id="s517">And that was possible, and that -- that -- that happened in -- in some other concentration camp, that what I hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Julian, how long did you stay?</span> <span id="s519">How much -- how long did you stay in Flossenbürg?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Well, that was when I -- A-August third, 1942, til the end, til April 23rd, I never forget that -- that date.</span> <span id="s521">Is a lucky number.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: And then the camp was evacuated and you were all taken on a death march to -- to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: But before you reached Dachau actually, you were liberated by the American army, by Patton’s third army, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: What was your health and your mental state at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Oh, you see, th-those -- since Friday, when -- when we marched til Monday at noon, we was freed.</span> <span id="s528">They not give us nothing to eat except I think on Sunday they gave us a -- just a little slice of bread.</span> <span id="s529">No coffee, no water, nothing.</span> <span id="s530">So we had no food, and we gotta march so many hours.</span> <span id="s531">Sometime they let us r-rest for three or four hours, in no time we march again.</span> <span id="s532">So, when you’re hungry and thirsty, how -- how you can march?</span> <span id="s533">So among the -- the -- from my column, what was almost 2,000 prisoners, there was just half of that left.</span> <span id="s534">And I tell you the truth, I was prepared to die, because I was -- I was so weak, you know, and each step hurts, you know, and -- I -- I-I-I was -- I was dizzy, you know, and gosh, you know, but, since in the morning I hear the machine guns in behind, I hear the -- we hear that noise, you know, and we understand that the -- that the Americans come, you know?</span> <span id="s535">So you fight and you -- you -- you get your strength, the last strength you got, you know, to last as long as possible, you know.</span> <span id="s536">And we did it.</span> <span id="s537">Gosh, you know, 12 o’clock, at noon, the first tanks -- American tank I saw.</span> <span id="s538">First I was mixed up, you know, because I see the big white star on their tank, I thought they are Russians.</span> <span id="s539">But soon we find out they are Americans.</span> <span id="s540">And that was, I believe, 90th or 97th division of that army, General George Patton, God give him heaven, George Patton, General George Patton.</span> <span id="s541">He is my, how should I say, he saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: What -- what -- what happened then?</span> <span id="s543">Could you recuperate in some way?</span> <span id="s544">Could -- di -- did you get food?</span> <span id="s545">Did you get sent into where?</span> <span id="s546">What happened afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: About 10 o’clock, before noon, we passed a little town by the name Shtamserit.</span> <span id="s548">It was in Bavaria [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s549">And then when we was free, we go back to that little city.</span> <span id="s550">And right away, the American takes -- take care of us, you know?</span> <span id="s551">They open a kitchen, they feed us, they give us cigarettes.</span> <span id="s552">And the American, thanks to them, many of them sacrificed their life, but also many there save our lives.</span> <span id="s553">So I appreciate it very much.</span> <span id="s554">Thanks to all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Wh-When you were a little stronger, did you go back to Poland?</span> <span id="s556">Did you know anything about your mother at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Ah --</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: I should -- I should also say -- we should also say that before the outbreak of the war, your three brothers, who were also in Poland, went back, had been gone ba -- had gone back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: -- to United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: -- again, so it was -- your mother was back in Poland.</span> <span id="s563">Did you know anything about her?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yes, wa -- I-I wrote her a letter once awhile, then I received some letters from my mother, and so -- also my mother send me some packages once in awhile.</span> <span id="s565">You know, bread and onions and little bit pork, you know, whatever, yeah.</span> <span id="s566">Yeah, so I know my -- my mother was still alive, but after I recuperated, after three weeks, the American officer gave me a bicycle and then I pedal to Austria to see my lovely girl.</span> <span id="s567">I was -- now, I -- I was anxious to see her, you know, and how she lives, you know, and whether she gonna take me back.</span> <span id="s568">So -- so I eat that time, from the first day I eat.</span> <span id="s569">So I starts slowly, you know, you can’t overeat it.</span> <span id="s570">But after awhile, you know, I eat day and night, wherever I can find the food, you know, I eat.</span> <span id="s571">So I was strong enough after three weeks, and I pedal to Austria.</span> <span id="s572">First I come to a friend of mine, another friend, Eddie.</span> <span id="s573">I didn’t -- I didn’t have enough guts, you know, go by myself to Frieda’s father farm, you know?</span> <span id="s574">So I took with me Eddie, friend of mine.</span> <span id="s575">And then that was on Saturday, May 18, 1945, how can I forget?</span> <span id="s576">And was eight o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s577">We come to the front door, ring the bell, and Frieda’s sister Teresa come out.</span> <span id="s578">And when she saw me she s-start screaming, Julius, Julius is here.</span> <span id="s579">Frieda was sitting on the back porch, you know, when she hear that name she couldn’t believe it, you know, that’s me.</span> <span id="s580">She was thinking, you know I -- I was dead, you know, because they -- they -- they -- they hear, you know, what they was doing in the concentration camp, by their evacuation, and she had pretty good idea from Ravensbrück, you know, how that treatment was, see?</span> <span id="s581">So she hoped, but she wasn’t sure whether I’m still alive or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: So, the parents decided to let you stay on the farm, or what -- what -- what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No, I -- I didn't want to stay on that farm, but I stayed just a little on the other side of the woods, you know, with my friend Eddie.</span> <span id="s584">And that was nice people you know, they let me stay, they give me a room, you know?</span> <span id="s585">I stayed there and then we have Red Cross, and the American UNRRA we call that, you know, they -- they give us packages, you know, and food, you know, cigarettes and the Americans take of us good, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Maybe this is another good way to end this side here.</span> <span id="s587">This is the end of tape one, side B, interview with Julian Noga.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Julian Noga.</span> <span id="s590">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s591">So you had come back to -- to the farm or to the village where Frieda lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: And you found housing somewhere, some Austrian people that you stayed there, with your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yeah, I stay with my friend a-and just not far away from Frieda’s parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: And you began to see Frieda again?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: What was the reas -- reaction by -- from her parents?</span> <span id="s598">How did they feel about it, di --</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Well, the -- they knew what we was going through and they -- they was -- they were not against us, you know, they understand, you know.</span> <span id="s600">They a -- actually, they understand we belong together.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Did you experience any responses or reactions from the people in the -- in the village, in the area there against or for you?</span> <span id="s602">What -- what was the relationship?</span> <span id="s603">Did you have any contact with them?</span> <span id="s604">Were there any feelings towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: With -- the village there by Frieda’s parents?</span> <span id="s606">Well, I didn’t have so much contact with -- with those Austrians there.</span> <span id="s607">They were friendly, and I don’t know what they was thinking about me, but Frieda was, you know, in a different position, see, wi -- number one, she was from a rich family.</span> <span id="s608">And the small village knows, you know, she was in a concentration camp, why she was there, they know.</span> <span id="s609">So that time, you know, you come to the small village like that where the people know each other, you know, and this -- it’s little bit sensitive, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s610">So Frieda go through something, you know, different.</span> <span id="s611">To me it didn’t make much difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: How did you -- how did you live at that time?</span> <span id="s613">You got assistance from Americans still, or did your par -- did her parents help you, or how did that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Red Cross, and the organization -- American organization UNRRA, we call them that.</span> <span id="s615">And you had some places, charity places you know, and they take care of those people.</span> <span id="s616">Oh, right away they used to have those houses, and barracks you know, the Germans worker was living before.</span> <span id="s617">And they put those people in a -- again, in a camp, but different type camp, you know.</span> <span id="s618">They had a good kitchen, good food.</span> <span id="s619">So sometime we go there.</span> <span id="s620">I -- I didn’t live -- I live only about two months in a camp like that, you know, for the refugees, camp for the refu -- refugees, but I didn’t like that.</span> <span id="s621">So many people together, you know, that’s reminds me, you know?</span> <span id="s622">That’s the same thing what I was going through three years, or so -- so I go and live private and I look for the job.</span> <span id="s623">And I become -- I worked on a machineries for a -- for a -- for a company.</span> <span id="s624">I was the baggerfuehrer, how you say baggerfuehrer in English?</span> <span id="s625">[indecipherable] and -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: It’s some kind of working machine that you drove?</span> <span id="s627">Back --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Bigger, yeah, backhoe, backhoe, bigger, something like that yeah.</span> <span id="s629">I was working very good job, and I lived privately, and any time I had chance I visit Frieda, Frieda visit me, you know, and we prepared to --</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: And then you deci --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: -- get married.</span> <span id="s632">There was no other way, see?</span> <span id="s633">The -- the only thing is, gonna be a little bit hard, you know, because I have to face her father and ask him, and I did.</span> <span id="s634">Not by myself, there was a -- another husband from Frieda’s sister, mar -- Margaret husband.</span> <span id="s635">And he says, “Julian, I go with you to father, you know, and ask, you don’t be afraid.”</span> <span id="s636">So we go, both of us, you know and I ask.</span> <span id="s637">And the first thing you know, he ask me, what you gonna do?</span> <span id="s638">How you plan your life?</span> <span id="s639">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s640">We got plenty land, we can give you piece of land, and we got lum-lumber, you know, build up the house if you want to stay here.</span> <span id="s641">And I says no, no, I got my family in United States.</span> <span id="s642">Oh, well I [indecipherable] to America, see, because I know there are -- America is a free country, you know, and it doesn’t matter you know, whether you -- what kind of a nationality you are, you know, you -- you live different.</span> <span id="s643">See, but in a small village like that, you are a foreigner, you know?</span> <span id="s644">They might say, okay, he’s a good man, you know, and this and this, you know, but you gonna be foreigner forever.</span> <span id="s645">Y-You see what I mean?</span> <span id="s646">That’s why there was only one way for us to -- after we get married.</span> <span id="s647">Then he give his okay, yeah, okay, so long you go United States.</span> <span id="s648">Yeah, you got your family, I hope you take care of my daughter.</span> <span id="s649">I says don’t worry about that, yes I will, I promise, you know.</span> <span id="s650">Then, okay, we prepared and then we get married exactly one year to the date when we’re -- when I was freed in [indecipherable] in Germany, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: But before you left, your daughter was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Oh yes, yeah, yeah, little Frieda was born there in Austria before we come to United States, yeah.</span> <span id="s653">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: When was she born?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: She was born July -- July 12, I think, 1946, right, yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Did you -- did you go back to Poland to see your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: No, at that time, I liked to go to Poland, but that time there was a Communist regime and I thought, you know, they might keep me there.</span> <span id="s658">So I didn’t take a chance, but an -- after 1960, I decided, for good or for bad, I decided to go and see my mother.</span> <span id="s659">That was exactly 21 years when I saw her last time.</span> <span id="s660">And that was at Christmastime, shortly before Christmas, and that was the nicest Christmas for me and for my mother to see each other, and she was so happy to see me.</span> <span id="s661">And then I stay nine days in Poland.</span> <span id="s662">Then I go back to Austria, I stay there on a -- on a -- nine, 10 days there, then I come back and everything was all right, and I was glad I -- I saw my mother.</span> <span id="s663">And she was happy to see me, and she know that we got good living here in United States because she was here before.</span> <span id="s664">Matter of fact, she was three times here when she was single, you know.</span> <span id="s665">She traveled back and forth, you know, then third time when she come [indecipherable] she married my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: We will talk about that a little bit more when we have reached your life here in America in --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: -- in the 1960’s.</span> <span id="s669">You had never seen, actually, your father, and you had not really seen your -- yeah, you had seen your brothers, but never your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Did you know where they were living at that time and how did it come about that you could go?</span> <span id="s672">You needed somebody to vouch for you, I think?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes, throughout the Red Cross I found out the addresses for my oldest brother Matthew, and for my father.</span> <span id="s674">And I wrote a letter to my father.</span> <span id="s675">He had to sign the affidavit of support, and he did sign the paper and that’s what we come to my father and that was 1948 in March.</span> <span id="s676">First time I saw my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: How did you get to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Through --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: By boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: By boat, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: How was -- tell us a little bit about that -- that voyage, that trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Oh, that was very excited.</span> <span id="s683">That was very excited, my gosh, you know?</span> <span id="s684">Gosh, you know, that was so excited, see the America.</span> <span id="s685">Before we come, we stay in a -- in a -- in a -- we was waiting for -- for visa and -- and the American, they teach us -- they tell us, you know, what is that -- what kind of a life we’re gonna have in a -- America.</span> <span id="s686">You got all kind of opportunity, if you want to work, if you want to save, you can be millionaire, if you want it.</span> <span id="s687">See?</span> <span id="s688">That was very excited.</span> <span id="s689">And then -- then the boat come, you know, and we go on a boat.</span> <span id="s690">Oh, what a good food we had, you know.</span> <span id="s691">So many people were sick, I never was sick.</span> <span id="s692">I eat for two, for three, you know, my gosh, you know, and I was big that time, you know, I weighed, I don’t know, I weighed 220 - 240 pounds.</span> <span id="s693">Yeah.</span> <span id="s694">So when I saw -- was very excited when it come to New York.</span> <span id="s695">That was, I think, March 22nd, I think, in 1948 when -- when we saw the statue, liberty statue.</span> <span id="s696">I had a tears in my eye.</span> <span id="s697">And you understand why.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Could you -- could you say that -- I didn’t understand what you were saying.</span> <span id="s699">You saw the statue of --</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: When we saw the Statue of Liberty, we say, God bless America, this is the free country and this is Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s701">What I hear so much about the Statue of Liberty from my mother, for years.</span> <span id="s702">You know how emotional it was?</span> <span id="s703">I can’t explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Was somebody waiting for you there?</span> <span id="s705">Did you -- di -- did they pick you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: No, no, we had a ticket straight to Utica because my father was living in New York [indecipherable] with his outs -- outskirt Utica and we had a train ticket there, and the -- the next day we come to Utica, the first time I saw my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: How was -- how was that -- how was that meeting, that first meeting, to see him in --</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: You know, it’s hard to explain.</span> <span id="s709">Tha-That was a -- it is a good question, though.</span> <span id="s710">You see, I didn’t grow up with my father, I never saw him, you know?</span> <span id="s711">I think my father more as a close friend than father.</span> <span id="s712">I can’t help it, you know?</span> <span id="s713">And he was strong, gosh you know, and we look like a brother, you know.</span> <span id="s714">So I think I’m more like a brother.</span> <span id="s715">And he was good to -- to me.</span> <span id="s716">There wasn’t many discussion, family discussion you know, and this, you know, about I was in between, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Did he know more or less what had happened to you?</span> <span id="s718">Did he ask you about it, did you talk about that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Yeah, yeah, we -- yeah, I told him, I explain him, you know, what it was.</span> <span id="s720">I was -- spent some time in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s721">Yeah, well, too bad, too bad.</span> <span id="s722">Well, he says, this is fault -- your mother fault, you know, she shouldn’t go to Europe, you know, she should stay there.</span> <span id="s723">Well, on one hand I agree with him, on the other hand I disagree, see, because there was some other reason that she couldn’t stay here, see?</span> <span id="s724">Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: So where -- where did you stay when you came?</span> <span id="s726">Did you stay with your father, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yeah, first three months were stay with -- with my father, and right away they give us the job, wi -- was -- Frieda was learning how to weaving, and I was working in a -- in a factory, clothing factory, you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s728">And I make a good money at that time, and we stay three months with my father, you know it’s a little bit crowded.</span> <span id="s729">So after three months we get a small apartment in Utica on blandin -- Blandina Street, yeah, I never forget that upstairs vi -- over the grocery stores.</span> <span id="s730">That was the Italian grocery stores, Jerry, yeah.</span> <span id="s731">And we was so happy, my gosh, on our own in United States.</span> <span id="s732">Even in a small apartment, we were so happy, so free.</span> <span id="s733">And then we was working and start saving some money.</span> <span id="s734">Then in 1952 -- no, ’51 I think, we bought a small farm there, about 15 kilometer -- 15 miles from here, Vernon Center.</span> <span id="s735">And we had some chicken, about three or 400 chickens and some cattle.</span> <span id="s736">And we were -- Frieda worked on the farm, I worked on the construction and in the evening I worked on the farm and -- and we was very happy, you know, that -- I -- I [indecipherable] it is the same thing like in Austria, somewhat.</span> <span id="s737">Little bit different, but we got the own farm, see.</span> <span id="s738">But we had that farm for five years, then I always had it in my mind, you know, to go to my monument business, because that’s what I learned in Flossenbürg, you know, cut the stones, you know.</span> <span id="s739">I was -- that helped me too, because I -- really I know when I talk about myself how good I was, but I was good s -- good stoneconner -- cutter.</span> <span id="s740">And when you’re a good stonecutter you get a little bit more food, you know, and that’s what was very important, that’s what my friend gave me advice, you know, if you -- if you w-work -- do good, and many times, you know, they give me special jobs, you know, very co-complicated job, and I did it, you know, and I belong -- I used to belong to the best stonecutters there in Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s741">Yes, so I go to the monument business here.</span> <span id="s742">I stotes -- I start [indecipherable] I start with a small monument business, and after 15 years I go for the big business, and like you see right here when you look at it through the window, that’s our business here, Monument Place, and from then up to now we do very good, and now my son Ricky take over, and I just go once awhile, you know, help him out a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: It’s a little bit ironic in a way that you found yourself loving a job that you were forced to learn in a concentration camp, but you liked it later on, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s745">I’d -- I tell you the truth, I used to like better stonecutting than work in a bakery.</span> <span id="s746">I didn’t like the dough and flour, you know, and dust, you know?</span> <span id="s747">But you got dust with the stones too, but -- yes, I -- I like and I like monument business and is very interesting because every day you got something else to cut, different flowers, different sculpture, you know, and lettering and this, you know, and this is very, very interesting cause there’s no end to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: So you were happy to be here, and you gradually started to build a life.</span> <span id="s749">You had your own apartment, you rented a farm.</span> <span id="s750">But was it alf -- also difficult, maybe a little bit, to adjust to a different country?</span> <span id="s751">Was it easy to be with the neighbors in some ways, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: O-O-Oh yes, oh yes, that -- that, to be honest with you, takes not -- I should say about 10 years, say, because naturally there is a entirely different country than Germany or Poland, you know?</span> <span id="s753">Different system, different -- even food.</span> <span id="s754">And different living you know?</span> <span id="s755">And takes a time, long time to adjust you know, to the custom, you know, how do it -- how the people live, but you like it.</span> <span id="s756">You like it, but you gotta adjusted to it, see?</span> <span id="s757">Sometime you grab something to do -- oh no, in Europe you go -- do -- do different see?</span> <span id="s758">But here you do different.</span> <span id="s759">Sometimes says no, that’s wrong.</span> <span id="s760">No, it isn’t wrong when you -- then after you find out, you know, it is right, see?</span> <span id="s761">So it takes awhile to adjust, no matter -- I think this is same thing, no matter what country you go.</span> <span id="s762">It takes time to adjust to the system, and now, by gosh, after so many years we live in this country, what 50 years?</span> <span id="s763">God bless this country, you know?</span> <span id="s764">It is the best country on the earth.</span> <span id="s765">God bless America.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Did you feel the need to talk about the experience that you went through to anybody else but your wife?</span> <span id="s767">Did you find yourself talking to neighbors, or did people want to know, did they ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Oh yes, oh yes, and very interesting.</span> <span id="s769">Even now, we had several interview, you know, on that radio station where I got my program every Sunday, was three times there, and then we write article to the local paper, [indecipherable] Dispatch.</span> <span id="s770">And many people ask us, you know, my gosh [indecipherable] went through, and tell us some more about that.</span> <span id="s771">So I’m glad to tell, and a -- very interesting, you know, the younger generation is so interested in this story, you know.</span> <span id="s772">They had no idea, you know.</span> <span id="s773">First they thought, you know, that only Jews was in a concentration camp, which is true, nobody can say different, see.</span> <span id="s774">Jew -- Jewish people suffered the most, you know, during the war.</span> <span id="s775">That was a really Holocaust for them, and they had no help from nowheres, you know.</span> <span id="s776">That’s true, you know.</span> <span id="s777">But also same time, you must say, you know, that many other nationalities suffered -- even worse, some of them, you know.</span> <span id="s778">You take those people in Siberia in Russia.</span> <span id="s779">My gosh, what they must went through.</span> <span id="s780">Even worse, you see?</span> <span id="s781">So we are glad to talk about this, you know, and God forbid, you know, that this never happen again, something like that.</span> <span id="s782">And young generation, yeah, matter of fact, as you know, I wrote the wa -- article of my recollection to the book for the high schools teachings about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s783">I got my six pages there, my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: When was -- when was that, and who initiated that?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: That book?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Mm-hm, how did that come about, and when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Oh that was -- oh, well, because, actually the Jewish people start, you know, teaching about the Holocaust for the high schools, see, in New York state.</span> <span id="s788">And when we find out that Jewish people gonna -- gonna m-make that book, you know, we also want to be there, y-you know, and tell our story, and we was accepted.</span> <span id="s789">And there’s some Catholic Christian stories too, in that book.</span> <span id="s790">So many people ask if this is true, you know, especially younger people.</span> <span id="s791">Is that true, or it is just a propaganda?</span> <span id="s792">You know, that gets you a little bit.</span> <span id="s793">What kind of a propaganda?</span> <span id="s794">Th-This not propaganda, I got so many evidence, films, books, by gosh, people was there like me, you know.</span> <span id="s795">I no lie.</span> <span id="s796">I tell -- see, who gon -- whoever gonna listen to this tape, you know, I can’t lie, you know, because somebody can straighten me out, hey wait a minutes.</span> <span id="s797">You -- you -- you lie about this, or something like that.</span> <span id="s798">So we give you that -- that -- that true story where we was going, true, and what we saw, what we experience that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: So did you feel that your experience as a Polish inmate in a concentration camp was a little bit forgotten by history, in a sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: I think -- I think it is enough books and mention about the Polish people suffered during the second World War.</span> <span id="s801">Don’t forget.</span> <span id="s802">But that was a -- we say six millions Jewish people losted their life during the second war.</span> <span id="s803">Oh my gosh, about six million Polish people, Christian people sacrificed their life during that war.</span> <span id="s804">So maybe -- maybe this is not the -- how should I say it?</span> <span id="s805">This is a little -- a little bit difficult question.</span> <span id="s806">But maybe it is -- maybe doesn’t -- maybe -- maybe the history doesn’t say enough, you know, about Polish people, and not only Polish people, what about other nationalities?</span> <span id="s807">What about Russian?</span> <span id="s808">What about the other nationalities suffered so many?</span> <span id="s809">How many Russians, how many millions, they die, you know?</span> <span id="s810">And this -- those people gotta be taken to consideration too, you know.</span> <span id="s811">Not only one nationality, see?</span> <span id="s812">All of them.</span> <span id="s813">And I am glad we had an invitation to Holocaust, to Washington, and we told our story.</span> <span id="s814">They treat us nice, you know?</span> <span id="s815">And I told them the same story what I tell you right now, that -- and we’re speaking about the Jewish people, yes they suffered the most, and they had no help from nobody, yeah.</span> <span id="s816">So we was a little bit more lucky, you know, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: I would like to come back to this a little later, but let’s go back in time again to th-the -- more the beginnings of your family here.</span> <span id="s818">You had a second child?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Yeah, Richard was born 1951, in January.</span> <span id="s820">Yeah, and he grow up here as a hundred percent American, okay?</span> <span id="s821">And he’s still single, he is with us.</span> <span id="s822">He got his house next to us, he bought a house, he living in his own house.</span> <span id="s823">And he take over our monument business and he work there.</span> <span id="s824">And he had a college, yeah, educated.</span> <span id="s825">And daughter Frieda, she’s also -- oh my gosh, how many languages she speak?</span> <span id="s826">She even speak the sign sa -- language and she’s a foreman for the organization for the deaf people.</span> <span id="s827">Right now she is in New York City, there for a whole week.</span> <span id="s828">She got a meeting there.</span> <span id="s829">And she is close to us, she live in Syracuse.</span> <span id="s830">And we got nice two children and two grandchildren, yeah.</span> <span id="s831">And we are very, very happy.</span> <span id="s832">It wasn’t so easy.</span> <span id="s833">There was a hard working, you know.</span> <span id="s834">Frieda was working hard, I was working hard.</span> <span id="s835">So we come to this, what we today got, you know, we are not millionaire, we -- we are not rich.</span> <span id="s836">But we make a good living and we are very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: When you had your children, did you have certain dreams for them?</span> <span id="s838">Did you -- did you know what you wanted to give your children, what you wanted them to be, certain --</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Ah, this is another tough question, yeah, and I have to tell you that true.</span> <span id="s840">Yes, many times come to me, and to be honest with you, sometime I not believe that happen to me, I go through this, you know, that wasn’t me.</span> <span id="s841">Then I think, you know, yes, that was me.</span> <span id="s842">I go through this.</span> <span id="s843">I give you example.</span> <span id="s844">How can you feel, let’s say January, February, you know, you’re co -- you work 10 hours, wintertime I was working 10 hours in a quarry.</span> <span id="s845">You come, they counted you, somebody’s missing, okay?</span> <span id="s846">The wind blows, snow, cold, below zero, you know?</span> <span id="s847">You stay without a hat, you stay [indecipherable] what that means, attention?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Attec -- yeah, attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s850">And they count and count, one prisoner is missing and you stay there for two, three hours, hungry and cold, don’t move.</span> <span id="s851">How can you this explain to anybody what that is?</span> <span id="s852">So, those days, you know, happened many times.</span> <span id="s853">Coming back to me.</span> <span id="s854">I says, how can you -- or how can you go through this?</span> <span id="s855">This is impossible, yeah.</span> <span id="s856">That was possible.</span> <span id="s857">Yeah, so sa -- those -- yeah, every time you see those faces, you know, familiar faces, SS, commandant, inspection, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: So this --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: And you thought this is no end to it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: So it seems very unreal to you now?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Did you -- but m-my question was actually, did you have any -- di -- how did you want your children to bri -- how did you want your children to grow up?</span> <span id="s863">Did you have certain dreams for them?</span> <span id="s864">Something that you wanted to give them, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: -- how did you want to do parenting?</span> <span id="s867">Did you have any --</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: We didn't talk much about that, and even now we no talk much about that, you know, and thanks God, w-was going through, it did -- didn’t affect our mind, you know, or nervous break or something like that, no.</span> <span id="s869">No.</span> <span id="s870">I always got answer for myself and Frieda same thing, you know.</span> <span id="s871">Thanks God.</span> <span id="s872">Could be a worse, you know.</span> <span id="s873">But time to time you know, it comes, you know.</span> <span id="s874">Some happenings, you know, what is hard to believe, even for me, even for me, I saw it with my own eye what happened, you know?</span> <span id="s875">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Did your children ask you sometimes about that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Or did that not come up much -- I mean, how -- how did

prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: We’re still in contact with a few others.</span> <span id="s893">One of them is a very close friend to me, Dr. Jake Terry, T-e-r-r-y.</span> <span id="s894">He is a doctor in New York City, and he is very active in ex-prisoners organization, he go [indecipherable] every year.</span> <span id="s895">He had -- they had meetings, you know, and they make lots of changes there in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s896">Like I said, the -- the Laundromat was located in a -- in a washroom where we used to take a shower.</span> <span id="s897">All the electric factory was located in a kitchen, our kitchen used to be.</span> <span id="s898">And some French company built up the little factory there, right in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s899">And Jake didn’t like that, and I didn’t like that, and we discussed it, and Jake, with the rest of it -- members of that organization, they put the pressure on the Bavarian government to eliminate those private -- or in a commandanture, there was a regular, people was living there, you know, like a apartment, they change for the apartment.</span> <span id="s900">So those people was

ever go back to Flossenbürg?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Oh yes, several times, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s906">The first time was the worst.</span> <span id="s907">When I came to the little museum what they got in there by the cremation there, not far away.</span> <span id="s908">Then I looked at it, all pictures, the commandant and the -- how the prisoners was working in a quarry and this and this, then in the middle I saw the pretty good size picture there, and there was a bunch of prisoners, and there was a kapo, and -- and -- and they was receiving the soup.</span> <span id="s909">And guess what?</span> <span id="s910">I recognize myself.</span> <span id="s911">Then I almos -- I almost fainting, you know, I -- I couldn’t believe it, I called Frieda na -- says, “Frieda, look at this picture, and you see anything unusual?”</span> <span id="s912">She looked at it closer, she says, “Julian, that’s you.”</span> <span id="s913">Second in a -- in a first row, you know, yeah.</span> <span id="s914">And then -- then I remember, you know, and we go -- that was the first day in a -- in a -- a quarry.</span> <span id="s915">After two weeks where we was on a [indecipherable] block, the newcomers blocks, you know, we was there 14 days, that’s the time, you know, the SS officer ask me, you know, if I know why I am here, you know, and -- yeah.</span> <span id="s916">And then -- then I remember there was a small -- we make a joke [indecipherable] I remember this exactly, you know, because usually the SS was tall guys, you know, and this, but that photographer SS man, he was a -- a little guy, red hair.</span> <span id="s917">And he had a big camera, you know, like a accordion, black one.</span> <span id="s918">And he make the picture and says, no wonder -- we make a joke out of it, no wonder, you know, they no want him on the front, you know, this -- he’s got the right job just to make a picture.</span> <span id="s919">And that picture -- who knows how, you know, survive and I’m -- and this is the best evidence you know, if somebody says no, you wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s920">And why I -- this is very interesting -- why I know that was the first day in the quarry, because we had a -- a wooden -- wooden shoes, you know, wooden soles.</span> <span id="s921">And then a -- and that same day I was -- they gave me to the kettakommando, we -- we climbed a -- in a quarry, you know, on a stone, and we’ll put the ke -- chains around the big blocks and the crane pull them out from the -- from the quarry.</span> <span id="s922">And they give us leather shoes.</span> <span id="s923">So that first day, I’m standing there with wooden shoes that I know that was from August, let’s say 17 - 18, August 18, ni -- 1942, see, the picture was made.</span> <span id="s924">And I’m on that picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: When was that first trip when you went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Oh gosh, the -- for a long time I no want to go there.</span> <span id="s927">I told you the truth.</span> <span id="s928">I didn’t want to see it.</span> <span id="s929">I was scared, you know?</span> <span id="s930">But then we decided, me and my family, Frieda, daughter Frieda and son Richard to go.</span> <span id="s931">And that was -- I believe, you know, I can’t tell you exactly the -- whether -- that was ninese -- 1980 -- ’83 - ’84, I come first time to the Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s932">Was everything change, you know.</span> <span id="s933">The trees growing you know, bushes growing, then I see their factories there, then the -- all barracks gone, they got the one family houses, you know, where the barracks was there.</span> <span id="s934">I didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: How -- how did your children respond to that?</span> <span id="s936">Did you have a feeling that they understood something in a different way than before, or what was their response?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: The daughter -- daughter Frieda want to run away, you know, from that concentration camp.</span> <span id="s938">She couldn’t -- you know, she was shaking, you know, and she couldn’t believe it when she saw the cremation oven, you know, it’s still there, you know, untouched, yeah.</span> <span id="s939">And when she saw that, she knew, and she see those pictures, see my picture over there, she want to run away.</span> <span id="s940">But we make videotapes there and they stay, then -- then after that we go -- we go Germany, Austria, most every two, three years we go there, you know, we still go on there, you know, because Frieda got some relatives there, sisters.</span> <span id="s941">And when we go there, naturally, we stop in Flossenbürg, you know, just look at, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: W-Why --</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Is -- is interesting though.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Yeah, that was -- that was my -- my other question.</span> <span id="s945">Why did you decide to go back after the first time?</span> <span id="s946">Was that important to you to go back to that place for some reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Yes, because I -- I was talking to some people, they were there.</span> <span id="s948">And I says, you should go, you should see, there’s -- everything is change, but a few houses, you know, and a few things are still there.</span> <span id="s949">It is a beautiful chapel build up from the towers, you know, watch towers.</span> <span id="s950">Beautiful chapel.</span> <span id="s951">And I thought, my gosh, maybe I should go and see that place and go to that chapel and thank God, you know, we survive, you know.</span> <span id="s952">So we go and I’m glad we go, we -- we saw and after that we go almost every two years there, and we stop there, and that most important to be there, that was 50 anniversary, you know, when the concentration camp was free, liberated.</span> <span id="s953">And you wouldn’t believe -- before we go there -- first I thought I don’t know, should we go or not?</span> <span id="s954">But, one of the guy from Arizona, his name i -- was Bob Hager, he find out about me in a United States Holocaust -- he saw the movie, and he called me, and he -- over the telephone he introduce himself and he says, “I’m the one from the Third Army, I open the gate there, in concentration camp Flossenbürg.”</span> <span id="s955">I says, “Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s956">Thanks.</span> <span id="s957">Where you live?”</span> <span id="s958">Oh, here in Arizona, I retired, so and so, and wa -- I was in a 97 division of Third Army, General George Patton.</span> <span id="s959">So this gonna be 50 anniversary and I’m in contact with the Munich government there, with the minister, and I got invitation and probably you gonna get invitation too.</span> <span id="s960">And we should go, and we should meet there.</span> <span id="s961">I says, okay, we go.</span> <span id="s962">Yeah, then I go with the whole family.</span> <span id="s963">But before, I says, I want to do something.</span> <span id="s964">Then I call Bob, and I told him over the telephone what I want to do.</span> <span id="s965">Some kind of mark, like a bronze plaque, to thank Third Army for liberation.</span> <span id="s966">He says, yes, that’s a good idea.</span> <span id="s967">I gonna call up Munich and I gonna tell them, you know, and they gonna find a place where they want to put that -- that plaque.</span> <span id="s968">Good, good idea.</span> <span id="s969">So he called me back, he says, yes I already -- I already talked to minister so and so in Munich.</span> <span id="s970">I says, good idea, and that plaque what Julian Noga gonna design, we can put it in death valley on a wall.</span> <span id="s971">There is a wall there between the chapel and -- and death valley, and he can put it there.</span> <span id="s972">And when he -- when he make this plaque, I give him the help, and they help him, you know, to -- to place that plaque there.</span> <span id="s973">Okay.</span> <span id="s974">So I design that plaque.</span> <span id="s975">I put pretty good size, oh I don’t know, 28 inches by 18 inches high bronze plaque.</span> <span id="s976">And then I put in the left corner on top, I put American Sherman tank.</span> <span id="s977">Then in right corner on top I put that emblem, the -- from that 97 division emblem they had, there is like a fork, like a devil fork or something like that, you know?</span> <span id="s978">That was the emblem for the division.</span> <span id="s979">So I put that emblem in the right corner on top and then I say, well, thanks to the American, you know, for liberation this and this, then I put Julian Noga, number 1623, and other prisoners, to thank Americans, see?</span> <span id="s980">So when we -- when I -- when I bring that plaque over there, I had two workers there, what they take care of that place, and they had the drill, and they, you know, we already told them, you know, how this gonna be put in the wall, in the granite wall.</span> <span

very -- and the Jewish people had a nice ceremony there, by the Jewish monument and also they had prayer and we was with them and that was very emotional, you know, we -- we feel like brothers, you know?</span> <span id="s986">That doesn’t mean you are Jewish or German or Polish or whatever, or Czechs, or French, you know?</span> <span id="s987">We was like -- like brothers, you know?</span> <span id="s988">We respect each other because only we know what we was going through.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Is remembering --</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: So -- excuse me, I didn’t finish yet, yeah.</span> <span id="s991">And the Bob was there, the Bob Hager, he was there and when it come time, you know, the plaque was covered with the white cloth.</span> <span id="s992">When it come time, the -- Bob Hager and me, we unveiled that plaque in death valley there, where the execution they had almost every day there, you know, with so many people die over there, and that was a great moment you know.</span> <span id="s993">And Bob Hager lay beautiful -- with his wife Peggy, he lay a beautiful flowers there by that plaque and that was very -- he put, and then after that there was a program, you know, and there was many speeches there from different nationalities, you know?</span> <span id="s994">And even the mayor from Flossenbürg, he says, I am 56 years old, I was born after the war.</span> <span id="s995">I’m sorry, you know, that you people have to got through this.</span> <span id="s996">I’m sorry that our quiet, willa -- village come on a map as a certain -- as such a bad place.</span> <span id="s997">He had a nice speech, and says, of course, we are not responsible for this what happen in our quiet village, but also we got that black spot in our history.</span> <span id="s998">I’m sorry for that.</span> <span id="s999">Such a beautiful speech he had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Were there other responses from -- from Germans?</span> <span id="s1001">Did people approach you in any way, did you hear any kind of reaction from people who were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Oh, my gosh, there was a -- there was another -- another mayor from Ravensbrück, there was some high officials, you know, and they come -- they follow us, they ask us question.</span> <span id="s1003">And television cameras and -- and a radio -- those people from the radio station, you know.</span> <span id="s1004">Gosh, we was so busy, you know, and they ask question, you know, and that was very interesting, you know, very interesting.</span> <span id="s1005">And again I say that usually younger generation, you know, that was so -- for them that was so interested, you know, what it was, that -- Flossenbürg concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Is remembering important to you?</span> <span id="s1007">Apparently it is, but is it -- i -- is also painful, but -- but is it -- is it important to you to remember, and what do you do to keep the memory alive when you are getting older and older --</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Yes, well this is -- I got my own explanation for myself, see?</span> <span id="s1009">That was a wartime, and gosh in a wartime, many, man -- this no -- no war, you know, is honest on either side, you know.</span> <span id="s1010">And during the wartime so many people had it worse, maybe worse than -- than -- than -- than me, you know, like take any Jewish family, you know, like I meet -- even the Dr. Terry, you know, he losted a whole family there, he is by himself.</span> <span id="s1011">And many other Jewish people, you know, they losted their whole family, you know?</span> <span id="s1012">And also some Polish people losted their family in a concentration camp, and -- and was -- you know, there could be a worse, you know, but maybe of this experience I explain myself, what we was going through, maybe make a -- maybe this experience make me a better man, you know, and that’s why I’m so busy, you know, with this social organization, you know, and I try help other people.</span> <span id="s1013">And I try tell the people that life can be a different, you know.</span> <span id="s1014">And, you know, it bothers me when I see that the American, you know, make a demonstration, and sometime they burn the American flag, you know, that hurts.</span> <span id="s1015">I -- I say, people, you don’t know what you’re doing.</span> <span id="s1016">You don’t know that the life can be a different.</span> <span id="s1017">And matter of fact, you know, if I was young boy when the older people says, you know, what they was going through the first World War, I laugh and I says, ah what -- they say they eat rotten potatoes, you know and this and this.</span> <span id="s1018">My gosh, it’s happen, I no have to wait long enough and I eat rotten potatoes.</span> <span id="s1019">I -- and this is hard to believe, why rotten potatoes?</span> <span id="s1020">I tell you why.</span> <span id="s1021">When a potatoes is rotten, you cut the bad -- bad part out of it, and rest of it is little bit yellish -- brownish, you know?</span> <span id="s1022">Rotten potatoes is sweeter, and healthy potatoes is bitter, that’s why.</span> <span id="s1023">So I remember what the older people says, we used -- then we was so hungry we eat the rotten potatoes.</span> <span id="s1024">Yes, I understand, now, see?</span> <span id="s1025">So -- but when a -- when it comes -- you know, at that time, I didn’t pay my -- m-much attention, you know, oh gosh, there was a first World War.</span> <span id="s1026">So what?</span> <span id="s1027">So what?</span> <span id="s1028">They was born in wrong time, you know, I was born after the war, you know, I’m lucky.</span> <span id="s1029">But by gosh I not have to wait too long -- too long, you know, to go maybe even worse what they was going through.</span> <span id="s1030">See, then I find out -- that’s why, you know, that experience, that life what we had, maybe make a be -- better man out of me, you know?</span> <span id="s1031">Maybe I appreciate it more, what we had, you know, the life, the freedom, you know.</span> <span id="s1032">What is really important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: You mentioned social work or some charity work.</span> <span id="s1034">Tell us a little bit more about that.</span> <span id="s1035">When did you start doing it, and what is it, actually, that you are doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Well, first when we come -- when we come to this country, there was that time, you know, when President Truman was president, and a -- of United States, and he made that President Truman Act, you know, for the DP persons, for the -- for those people who couldn’t go back to the Communist country, you know, so they -th-the border was open for -- to this country you know, and here in Utica, besides me, come in -- many, many people come in.</span> <span id="s1037">Some of them was in the concentration camp, but most of them, you know, they was working in the -- on the farms, like I was working on a farm first, and in the factories, you know?</span> <span id="s1038">Then we -- well, we come to this country like I told you from the beginning you know, e-everything was strange over here, was beautiful but strange.</span> <span id="s1039">So we organize ourselves, and I was one of the co-organizer i-in this organization.</span> <span id="s1040">We named that organization the newcomer’s organization, see?</span> <span id="s1041">So we started making shows, you know, and whatever money we had, we have some orphans in Germany, some widows, you know, the money was going, you know?</span> <span id="s1042">There was like a charity organization.</span> <span id="s1043">And thanks God, you know, I was 35 years president of this organization.</span> <span id="s1044">Then I organized another organization what is Kopernik Memory Association.</span> <span id="s1045">So my idea was to have another organization with the Polish background, you know, to tell us about the Polish history, you know, Polish culture.</span> <span id="s1046">And same time we collect enough money, you know, on 45,000 dollars, and we build up the beautiful statue here in Utica.</span> <span id="s1047">That was my idea, I must say, Kopernik statue, 21 feet high and stays right in the center of the city of Utica, across the street from the Munson Proctor Ins -- Institute -- museum, see.</span> <span id="s1048">And I’m very proud about that, and we had other people, you know, I like.</span> <span id="s1049">Then I start radio program, Polish and international music I play every Sunday for two hours on the local station here, on the other side woods there, you know, I can walk over there, you know, I live close to it.</span> <span id="s1050">And this is my hobby and I’m very happy, you know, very busy you know, between radio station organization, I belong to quite a few of them, and our business, you know.</span> <span id="s1051">Keep me busy, I get no ol -- no time to get old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Did you keep up a little bit with the discussion about Jewish-Polish relationships in Poland in the 70’s, and then in the later 80’s this become a -- a difficult discussion to -- in Poland, to di -- to discuss that more openly than it was before.</span> <span id="s1053">Did you keep up with that a little bit?</span> <span id="s1054">Do you think it’s -- the -- the process of working through this very difficult subject matter is -- is happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: This is a -- a very delicate question, you know.</span> <span id="s1056">I grow up with the Jewish people, as I told you from the beginning, you know.</span> <span id="s1057">Matter of fact, I had the Jewish girl, we was very close with the -- nothing was there, not -- we was not in love, no, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1058">But we grow up together and thanks God, you know, she survive, you know.</span> <span id="s1059">She had the Christian paper, she emigrate to Germany.</span> <span id="s1060">She was working on a farm in Germany, as a Polish girl and she married a Polish guy, you know, and her father was killed, and -- during the war, and her mother was killed, too, you know, and she was the only one there, you know.</span> <span id="s1061">So we grow up with the Jewish people and I had nothing against the Jewish people there in -- in -- in Poland, absolutely, you know.</span> <span id="s1062">That was a -- more like a tradition, you know, if you want to buy something you go in a Jewish store, you know, you buy, you know, you get good deal, you know?</span> <span id="s1063">But -- and Jewish people in Poland, I think there was about three and a half -- three and a half million Jewish people in Poland, you know.</span> <span id="s1064">There was more Jewish people in Poland that time than today in Israel, see?</span> <span id="s1065">And -- and they had businesses, they had heavy industry that was in Jewish hand, too, and I think they was treating, you know, very well, they -- we had doctor and -- doctors and professors and scientists and all kind of -- you know, and that was -- that was -- I think they was treating good.</span> <span id="s1066">But here, after years, time to time, I see some articles in the paper that -- that we aren’t -- that we are, Polish people, anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1067">Now, this is, to me, a little bit hurts me this, this accusation.</span> <span id="s1068">Because I wasn’t anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1069">I live -- I had a friend, Jewish friend, and I still got Jewish friend here.</span> <span id="s1070">Jake Terry is a example.</span> <span id="s1071">I have here in Utica many Jewish people are good friends, close friends.</span> <span id="s1072">And that hurts sometime when they accuse us, you know, to -- that the Polish people are anti-Semitic, yeah.</span> <span id="s1073">Well, gosh, you know, I don’t know what they mean.</span> <span id="s1074">Well, this happened -- see, our -- somebody, you know, another Christian make a denunciation on me, you know, about the [indecipherable] what I tell you about, you know?</span> <span id="s1075">How about Frieda, you know, some people make a denunciation.</span> <span id="s1076">So you got bad people here, here, and I believe, you know, maybe that was some anti-Semitic, you know, in -- in Poland between some kind of people, you know, not -- not me, you know.</span> <span id="s1077">And when you say the Polish people, then you talk about all Polish people, that I’m included, ex -- as a -- as a -- a -- from a Polish background, you know?</span> <span id="s1078">And we -- I think we shouldn’t say that, that -- you know.</span> <span id="s1079">I believe that some people was anti-Semitic and maybe today you -- you -- you’ll find them, see?</span> <span id="s1080">Like you find here in this country, anti-American people, right?</span> <span id="s1081">Yeah?</span> <span id="s1082">When I listen to -- to Rush Limbaugh, you know, I wonder -- I wonder, you know, what kind of an American he is, you know, when he called our president stupid, and a liar and this and this, call him name, you know?</span> <span id="s1083">That’s for me -- that hurts me, too, you know?</span> <span id="s1084">I mean, this is a very delicate -- delicate question, you know, between the Christian and Jewish people in Poland.</span> <span id="s1085">But I think that Poland opened the border for seven century, when the other countries, you know, chase out the Jewish, you know, like Spain or other countries chase out the Jewish people, Poland take them, you know, and for seven century, the Jewish people was in Poland.</span> <span id="s1086">And my gosh, you know, maybe there was some incidents, you know, I don’t know about that, see?</span> <span id="s1087">But as I remember, you know, like y-you take a -- even little city like Struchin or Tarnów.</span> <span id="s1088">My gosh, the -- most of the population was Jewish population and the businesses, most of them was in Jewish hands.</span> <span id="s1089">So that was, I think, I don’t know if you -- if you say criticize, this is -- I-I don’t know, I haven’t got no answer, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: This is the end of tape two, side B, interview with Julian Noga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial interview with Julian Noga.</span> <span id="s1093">This is tape number three, side A. I would like to go back in time a little bit when your children were young.</span> <span id="s1094">What -- what was your life like then?</span> <span id="s1095">You both worked?</span> <span id="s1096">Di-Did your wife still work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1098">I worked first shift, she worked second shift, or the other way.</span> <span id="s1099">She worked first shift and I worked second shift, th -- so we was with -- one of us, you know, was with the children, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: But that was not an easy -- an easy life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Was kind of tough, but we didn’t know the difference and we do our best, and by gosh you know, we was thinking, you know, to let the children grow in a -- in a good house, you know, and later on they get good education and we was very successful with this, thanks God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Say a little bit more about the education of your children.</span> <span id="s1103">They got -- they went to high school and then to college, both of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: No, Frieda, which is our ol -- older -- older daughter, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s1105">Yeah, she was born in Austria.</span> <span id="s1106">She go high school, then she take some courses, you know, like typewriting and shorthand.</span> <span id="s1107">And she was very good with the languages, so she speak fluently, she take German in the high school.</span> <span id="s1108">She speak fluently German, fluently Polish, English.</span> <span id="s1109">And after she get married she take another course to speak sign language.</span> <span id="s1110">And now she has good job in Syracuse, New York.</span> <span id="s1111">And she is the boss there, you know, she’s got a group of people she work for, then -- and she do very good with the sign language.</span> <span id="s1112">And she is good for the catch up -- with the languages, to learn, and -- other languages, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s1113">Okay, and Ricky, Ricky was different, you know?</span> <span id="s1114">She learned a little bit German, he can keep the con -- conversation in -- in German and in Polish.</span> <span id="s1115">And he finished the high school, and then she go -- then he go college, yeah.</span> <span id="s1116">And after he finished the college, he get a good job, he work for the big insurance company as a safety inspector.</span> <span id="s1117">But the insurance is -- lately, you know, they change a little bit, and same time I need him here for our business, you know, because we want to continue with the business after oh, you know, after 40 years I build up that business and I -- I don’t want to let it go, so I invite him here, and he is already what, four or fifth year with me, and I teach him how to carve, how to do the monuments and he is very, very good in that, he’s got a good hand, cause -- because he’s a little painter on the side, you know, that picture you see over here on the wall, that’s his painting right there.</span> <span id="s1118">Which is pretty good, I -- I should say.</span> <span id="s1119">So in the monument business, he is pretty artistic and he’s got new idea and put the new designs, new flowers, new carvings, you know, he is good for that, and I’m glad, you know, so the name stays in business after I go, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Was -- was he naturally interested, or did you -- or -- or was -- wh-what did he do before?</span> <span id="s1121">Was that sort of a natural interest of him when you asked him, or did you had to put a little pressure on him to say please, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Well, like I said, you know, he had a -- after he fini -- finished the college, he had a pretty good job there in Michigan there.</span> <span id="s1123">And that was going good for awhile, then getting a little bit slowdown and [indecipherable] and when he come home we had a good discussion over here, and I told him simply, you know, I getting older, you know, and here is the business, you know, everything, all the equipment, trucks, all equipment, you know, just -- what you need just to start working, you know, and I teach you, you know?</span> <span id="s1124">He had pretty good idea though, because he grow up actually, into the business.</span> <span id="s1125">But no matter what, you know, you’ve got to practice, and you know, you got to learn.</span> <span id="s1126">So -- and he was -- he learned quick, you know, how to do that monument job, see?</span> <span id="s1127">Yeah, so he is pretty good with it and I am glad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: What -- what -- what do you consider kind of highlights in your life here in America?</span> <span id="s1129">Was there anything that was especially proud f -- proud thing for you, or something that sort of stands out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: The -- the big -- big day for us, me and Frieda was when we become citizens of this country.</span> <span id="s1131">I get my paper in 1956 and she’s got her citizenship paper, ’58 -- eight? ’</span> <span id="s1132">57.</span> <span id="s1133">That was the great moment, you know, when we become American citizens, you know.</span> <span id="s1134">And this is a -- a very touchy -- I should say privilege, you know, for anybody love this country.</span> <span id="s1135">And number two, for the first time in my life, you know, when it comes election, you know, so we can go to the election place, and we can vote, you know, that means so much to us.</span> <span id="s1136">So that day, afternoon is off by us, like a holiday.</span> <span id="s1137">We dressed up.</span> <span id="s1138">I never go without a tie, you know, to vote, you know, this special privilege to me.</span> <span id="s1139">And we feel very comfortable we can vote, because we never vote before.</span> <span id="s1140">So that was -- yeah, that was the wa -- couple highlights which occur, you know, in our life, you know, speaking about the citizenships and -- and all the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1141">Then, of course, you know, our 25th anniversary of marriage, then 50 anniversary of the marriage, quite some time ago, that was a highlights, too.</span> <span id="s1142">And many times happen in organization who I belong, they gave me some certificate for the good job, you know.</span> <span id="s1143">They make a special banquet for us.</span> <span id="s1144">There was one banquet for that 50 anniversary of liberation of concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1145">The Polish community make a special banquet for us, we had about 250 people, and many congratulation and there was a high official from the county, from the city, and congratulate us.</span> <span id="s1146">And that was very interesting to us, we turn a little bit back, you know, to accept a invitation from United States Holocaust in Washington, D.C..</span> <span id="s1147">I must say that was very interesting, and very important to us to tell our story for the future generation, you see?</span> <span id="s1148">And I must say there, in Holocaust, they treat us like a royal, you know?</span> <span id="s1149">Really, you know, we enjoy every minute there, when we was there and something like Holocaust -- United States Holocaust in Washington, this is very important and I give credit to the organizer that’s -- that -- that -- that m-miserable time we lived through, second World War, that is not forgotten, you know, that is somehow documented, you know, right there, and this is United States Holocaust in Washington, and I give a credit to those people, organizers, donors -- and we are donors of -- a-also.</span> <span id="s1150">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1151">Sometime I mix, you know, word German, you excuse me, when I speak English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: I can translate, that’s -- that’s all right.</span> <span id="s1153">What did -- what did you give to the museum, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Well, first of all, we -- we gave some money, donation, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1155">Couple times --</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: But you also gave some objects, I think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Yes, we gave many pictures, that’s what they ask us for, from our families, from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1158">And also I have to make a -- how should I say, I diverse my jacket, you know, that striped jacket from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1159">I had that original striped jacket, and by many occasion, whether in a church or by many occasion, I wore that jacket, you know, when I had a speech, when -- when that was something about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1160">And when I come in Washington, you know, they tell me, make sure bring that jacket.</span> <span id="s1161">So I did bring that jacket there.</span> <span id="s1162">And you know, that was some kind -- I -- was hard to -- to give that jacket because you know, this was like a diverse you know?</span> <span id="s1163">That jacket keep me warm, you know, there in concentration camp, and I have to -- but I thought, on the other hand, okay, this is the right place for the jacket, you know, so the future generation can see what kind of a clothing you had.</span> <span id="s1164">How I was dressed up, see?</span> <span id="s1165">Yeah, and that was -- that was a little bit emotional.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Maybe you can speak a little bit more about the society that you belonged to.</span> <span id="s1167">Maybe you can say the name one more time, but also a little bit more about the work that you do.</span> <span id="s1168">How many members, what -- what do you do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Like for ins --</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: -- what kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: -- like for instance, the -- the -- that -- that organization like [indecipherable] I -- I am co-founder.</span> <span id="s1172">Have about a hundred, over a hundred members, you know, and strictly work for charity, you know?</span> <span id="s1173">We help some poor people, blind people, you know, just -- just strictly charity or-organization to get the money for th -- for that purpose, we organize twice a year, sometime three times a year, some kind of dancing, or -- or banquet so we get the money for that purpose.</span> <span id="s1174">This is wa -- wa -- one of the organization.</span> <span id="s1175">The second one, I’m also co-founder, that was my idea Kopernik Memorial Association.</span> <span id="s1176">Now this organization is on a different level, it’s not so much charity organization, but it’s a organization where they got their own museum and they had so many Polish items.</span> <span id="s1177">What they demonstrate and show, like for the teacher, for the students, you know, what is this about the Poland, you know, what kind of a country this is, you know, the culture, you know, and this -- and this is -- and then they got films, pictures, a-and scholarship, yeah, for -- for the students, that every year they gave three scholarship to the students.</span> <span id="s1178">And

Massachusetts, Chicopee, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s1261">I was here in Utica, so we send the packages, little money.</span> <span id="s1262">So my mother had a good life after the war.</span> <span id="s1263">During the war she had it tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: What did you -- did she tell you more about that, what happened to her during the war while you were there, or was

America?</span> <span id="s1302">Did they -- where did they live, in different places?</span> <span id="s1303">And did you have some kind of contact or relationship with them?</span></p> <p><span

id="s1327">Q: This is the end of tape three, side A, interview with Julian Noga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Julian Noga.</span> <span id="s1330">This is tape number three, side B. I just had a question and now I’ve completely forgotten them, so let me just -- let me just think one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: Di-Did you ever feel that Americans in general, or that the younger generation doesn’t really know enough about Poland, so that you’re assoc -- that your society has really taught younger people much more about Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Could you give maybe an example, also, if you have one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: That was -- that was for some time the younger generation, American younger generation, they didn’t know much about the Poland, that was not much to them --- to ye -- ye -- I mean, it was not interesting.</span> <span id="s1336">Besides, you know, Chopin was Polish, you know, Maria Curie-Sklodowska, Paderewski was a good artist, and -- and General Kasimir Pulaski, and [indecipherable] for this country, and General Kasimir Pulaski was wounded and died there in Georgia that time in the war, you know, die for this country.</span> <span id="s1337">They know a little bit, little bit a-about that, see, but really th-that -- the more interesting was to the younger generation, here in this country, when Holy Father John Paul the second become Holy Father as a pole -- Polish cardinal, then the people was more interested where he come from?</span> <span id="s1338">Ah, he is Polish.</span> <span id="s1339">What he was doing during the war?</span> <span id="s1340">Well, this and this, you know, and they -- then they -- they -- and that was interesting, I think, and they was more interesting, you know, to find out, you know, what -- what kind of a country is the Poland, you know?</span> <span id="s1341">I speak generally, you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1342">Then a second, when a -- when a Communist was -- we think was so strong and we thought, you know, nobody gonna fight Communist you know, and the Communist gonna be forever, here a simple co -- guy come from the Gdansk, Lech Walesa, and he started that strike what was impossible that time, you know, in any Communist country.</span> <span id="s1343">He started it and he get 10 million workers behind him.</span> <span id="s1344">And this is very interesting, without the one shot to be fired, you know, he defeated the Communists, you know.</span> <span id="s1345">Thanks to him, you know, and the Holy Father was helping too, and I must say, that time, President Reagan help also, you know [indecipherable] like he call on Gorbachev, come on, get down with the Berlin wall, come on, open the border, you know, and this and this.</span> <span id="s1346">That was President Reagan and he was the first president he called it by name, you know, he called the Communist, you know, devil, or whatever he said, yeah.</span> <span id="s1347">So this together, you know, of course they study in Poland, you know.</span> <span id="s1348">Then that Poland was more interested to the younger ge -- generation, you know, which is good to -- to know, these facts, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: What -- what about your own children and grandchildren?</span> <span id="s1350">Are they -- to what dis -- to what degree are they interested in their own si -- Polish and Austrian, for that matter, background?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1352">To be honest with you, we not talk that much, you know, about this, you know.</span> <span id="s1353">I -- I don’t know, we never discussed this, really, you know.</span> <span id="s1354">We talk more about, you know, what happened, what you doing, you know, and this and this, but we not go there.</span> <span id="s1355">Once awhile we talk, you know, how nice was in Austria, and around holidays, you know, they got different style there for the holidays, you know, and also in Poland, you know, so we -- we talk the tradition a little bit, you know, but not too much.</span> <span id="s1356">Maybe we should talk more about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: I guess I was just wondering whether they themselves had sort of the urge to read books about it, or to find out, or to -- to go themselves, or -- or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Yeah, well, not -- really, I don’t know what to say, yeah, it’s -- it doesn’t come to that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Wh-When you look back, what kind of impact -- I mean this is a very difficult, complex [indecipherable] question, but maybe you can speak a little bit to it, when you look back, what kind of impact did your experience during the war have on you, for your life afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: That -- I -- say again, I -- I didn't get you, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: What -- what -- what impact -- what -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Impact was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: -- effect, what -- what -- what effect did those experiences during the war have on you for your life afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Oh, like I said before, you know, that tells me, you know, that life can be [indecipherable] different, see?</span> <span id="s1365">And that the life itself can be so miserable for many people, not only for me, for many people.</span> <span id="s1366">And sometime, you know, I think why is it like that?</span> <span id="s1367">Why -- why was it like that?</span> <span id="s1368">What I did wrong, you know?</span> <span id="s1369">Why those people suffered so much, you know?</span> <span id="s1370">Is that my guilt because I am Polish, is that a guilt because I’m Jewish?</span> <span id="s1371">We didn’t do nothing wrong, just our nationality and that was a crime to them?</span> <span id="s1372">You see, so you -- you think sometime, instead of world where we live today, you know, is a -- is a -- is a -- is a honest, or sometime, how should I say, dishonest.</span> <span id="s1373">Especially you know, it bothers me because those people was high ranking, you know, no matter what -- whether that was Communist system, or fa -- fascism, or -- or -- or -- or now, democratic system, they was then high and they still high.</span> <span id="s1374">Nothing happened -- actually, nothing happened to them, you know?</span> <span id="s1375">What happened to regular, average people, they suffered the most, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Your own political sympathies, are they -- to which direction -- wh-what -- what are you, politically speaking, more sympathetic to which party?</span> <span id="s1377">Are you more of a Democrat --</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Independent, Independent, I just vote, and Frieda is more a open Democrat, you know, and I in position, you know, because I got the radio program and I got so many friends in both parties, you know?</span> <span id="s1379">Even in Green party, see?</span> <span id="s1380">So, I decided to stay Independent, but when it come to the votes, I look who runs for that office, you know, would I like that guy.</span> <span id="s1381">I listen careful, you know, then I wait, you know, which one -- which -- which one is better, you know?</span> <span id="s1382">Then I vote regardless whether he’s Republican, Democrat, or Green.</span> <span id="s1383">Yeah, I go by the person, see?</span> <span id="s1384">Frieda goes strictly Democrat, you know, my wife, yeah.</span> <span id="s1385">But also sometime, yeah, o-oh, gosh, he’s a Republican, but he’s a good man, yeah, maybe I should vote for him.</span> <span id="s1386">I says, that’s up to you, that’s up to you.</span> <span id="s1387">Yeah, so, again, thanks God we live here in this beautiful country, and lately now, you know, yesterday we find out that Governor Bush was elected the new president.</span> <span id="s1388">We wish him very well.</span> <span id="s1389">Too bad you got some winners, you got some losers.</span> <span id="s1390">That was unusual, we’re waiting 35 days after the election and finally we find out who is the president for us, and I -- I hope, you know, he gonna do good and keep this country strong and democratic, you know -- I’m very, very proud, you know, to be citizens of this beautiful country, United States of America.</span> <span id="s1391">God bless this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Maybe -- I have maybe one more question for you.</span> <span id="s1393">And maybe you’ll have nothing to say, but is there any particular event that happened, a political event, or a social movement or anything, over the last 50 years here, that had a special impact, a special effect on you that was sort of important to you for some reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Well, when at that time, you know, what a -- what was it, 1962, when John Kennedy was shot, you know, the president, you know, that makes a big impact on me, you know.</span> <span id="s1395">I-I think on all of us, see, because that shouldn’t happen, you know.</span> <span id="s1396">That was a big impact, you know, and I feel so sorry, you know, that happened.</span> <span id="s1397">Otherwise, some other -- I no see anything special besides.</span> <span id="s1398">I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Well, I have one more question after all.</span> <span id="s1400">Do you have a busy social life?</span> <span id="s1401">Do you see people, do you go out, are you busy in the community, apart from your work with the society, are you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Oh yes, yes, we had so many meetings, by gosh, you know, almost every week meeting, you know.</span> <span id="s1403">So in the evening I like to go for a meeting, you know, and discuss this, whatever they got in the program you know, and I’m pretty active.</span> <span id="s1404">Which is good because you meet the people and you work for them, and they do good job, and -- and this is a free country, you know, and you can -- you can do -- so long, you know, you no do anything wrong, you know, against the government, you know.</span> <span id="s1405">And this is good, I like that part and this very interesting to me, and I want to keep myself busy, you know, I -- I like to do.</span> <span id="s1406">Matter of fact, you know, after we finish this interview, we got a meeting at the Polish community club toda -- tonight, and we gonna elect a new officer, yeah.</span> <span id="s1407">So we gonna vote, you know, that give me another privilege you know, to -- to select, you know, more officers, see?</span> <span id="s1408">And is a pretty good organization.</span> <span id="s1409">Actually this is a -- to Polish community club belongs about 28 organization, different organization are shareholder, and we are shareholder, too.</span> <span id="s1410">And I on a board of directors, see?</span> <span id="s1411">So, this is a very strong organization, we got the beautiful club.</span> <span id="s1412">I was president once for three years, I remodeled that place inside, installed the air conditioner, and you know, new ceiling, new floor and new walls, and there’s many, and by many occasion you got weddings and banquets, and we can handle about 300 people, and there’s a beautiful -- this a old building, but inside is beautiful atmosphere, you know, remodel everything.</span> <span id="s1413">Thanks to me, I should say.</span> <span id="s1414">No, I overdo it.</span> <span id="s1415">But I was the president, and that was my suggestion to remodel that place, because that was a old style, you know, and now the younger people, when they get married, you know, they want to go in a decent place, you know, have a wedding, you know, because they make a picture, you know, and this and this.</span> <span id="s1416">So I thought that’s a [indecipherable] time, you know, to remodel this place.</span> <span id="s1417">No air conditioner, there was no air conditioner, oh, got to be.</span> <span id="s1418">So I installed two air condition there.</span> <span id="s1419">And it is a place where, you know, what -- that people can go.</span> <span id="s1420">Not only Polish people, but also, you know, Americans, you know.</span> <span id="s1421">And is -- I’m very proud I belong there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Well, on that positive note, let me thank you very much for giving the interview, for doing this.</span> <span id="s1423">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: You’re welcome, you’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Julian Noga.</span> <span id="s1426">This is tape number three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Julian Noga.</span> <span id="s1429">This is an addition to the interview conducted on December 14th, 2000.</span> <span id="s1430">Today is the 15th of December.</span> <span id="s1431">Th-This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s1432">When I thought about the interview yesterday, I thought that maybe we can go over one more time about the various organizations that you are --</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: -- have been working for, for the course of your life in America.</span> <span id="s1435">Just to clarify a little bit, and maybe speak in a little bit more detail about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: So the very first organization that you founded or joined was what and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: That was a short after we ca -- we came to this country.</span> <span id="s1439">There was many others -- s -- people come from Germany, Austria, Italy, England, so called displace -- displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1440">And we thought that time that we need an organization, we should be organize.</span> <span id="s1441">You know, work together, help each other, and so -- and so we or -- organize, I am the co-founder of White Eagle Association here in Utica, New York.</span> <span id="s1442">And this is an organization, a charity organization like I said yesterday and exists already 50 years.</span> <span id="s1443">We just celebrated 50 anniversary of founding that organization.</span> <span id="s1444">And that organization is also a member of Polish American Congress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Let’s -- let’s talk about the White Eagle a little bit more.</span> <span id="s1446">What kind of causes did you support, and how did you get money together to support them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Well, you see, after the war -- oh -- oh, after the war was ended, there’s -- there was so many widowers, so many invalids, you know, people unable to work.</span> <span id="s1448">And we organize some doings, some banquets and shows, and collect some money, and we helped those people.</span> <span id="s1449">And also we help some children, you know, the orphans.</span> <span id="s1450">And -- and stick together, and -- and also w-work together to -- not to be lost in this big country, as it is, United States, see?</span> <span id="s1451">And I think we did a good job, and I was president for 35 years in that organization, I’m very proud, and this is a very well known, fine organization -- charity organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: And that was a local -- that was a local effort here from -- from Utica?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: Yes, local, but also we got delegates to the Polish American congress.</span> <span id="s1454">Polish American congress is national-wide organization connected with the Polish American alliance organization, what is a -- a very big, more like a insurance organization.</span> <span id="s1455">Matter of fact, we had insurance, many of us.</span> <span id="s1456">We had insurance, life insurance, yeah, from th -- from this organization.</span> <span id="s1457">And we got one president from both Polish American alliance, and Polish American congress.</span> <span id="s1458">This is one president, a very fine man.</span> <span id="s1459">I had a chance to talk to him.</span> <span id="s1460">He was our honorable guest in White Eagle Association when we celebrate a year ago our 50 anniversary.</span> <span id="s1461">Matter of fact, I was sitting next to him, and I show him my indentity card from American Holocaust, you know, United States Holocaust, and he was very interested.</span> <span id="s1462">And then I had a interview with him after, and also I put on my radio program.</span> <span id="s1463">That interview was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1464">Now, Polish American congress have lobby in Washington, D.C., and Polish American congress was working hard so that -- that Poland become a mem -- member of NATO organization.</span> <span id="s1465">And now still the Polish American congress work hard to help somehow, that the Poland be a member of United Europe, what is very important.</span> <span id="s1466">And also, the Polish American congress had a -- a -- many people in different way financially as -- for the needy people, you know?</span> <span id="s1467">And I understand that I am delegate there, I represent the Polish home [indecipherable] from Utica.</span> <span id="s1468">I -- I am the delegate to the congress and our meetings usually we have in Schenectady, New York, Albany, New York, or even here in Utica, you know?</span> <span id="s1469">We discussed many problems as Polish Americans, what is good for us, what is bad for us.</span> <span id="s1470">Our meetings are very interesting, what we really work hard.</span> <span id="s1471">So, because between us, Polish people from the past, from the second World War, there is some differences between our Polish -- Polish American people in between, and Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1472">Now, s-so what we do, many times we invite Jewish rabbis, professors, and we try dialog, and smooth out some of those matters a-a-are not clear, you know, or some of those accusations sometime, they are not right, they are wrong.</span> <span id="s1473">So we try and work together because Jewish people and Polish people go through the hell, through the second World War, and we should understand each other better, and -- and help each other, you know, in a many -- when you -- so-called political matters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: So when you -- and so you do seminars where you invite Polish amer -- Polish people -- Polish Americans and Jewish Americans to -- to enter into a dialog about certain subject matters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: Yes, like we have meeting and we invite, like I said, the -- some rabbis, some je -- from the Jewish organization leaders, professors.</span> <span id="s1476">In one of the meeting we had, oh, a few years back, I never forget that little bit -- was little bit touchy, I disagree little bit with that -- one of the speech, had one professor from Schenectady University, he was a young, Jewish professor, 35 years old, something like that.</span> <span id="s1477">He make a questions, how come during the war the Polish people, they had to save more Jewish people?</span> <span id="s1478">And that was a very touchy question.</span> <span id="s1479">Then, also, that was that one survivor, I believe his name was Steve Stone, I believe, yeah.</span> <span id="s1480">He was hiding by Christian family during the war, he was five years old.</span> <span id="s1481">And he listened to this conversation and when everybody finished talk, then he get up and he says, Professor, you tell us that the Polish people should had more and saved more Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1482">Did you ever was in Poland, did you ever know more about that situation what it was during the -- during the war?</span> <span id="s1483">He says no.</span> <span id="s1484">He says, you just -- how did you find out about that, and how -- how you are -- well, I think that’s what I hear, that’s what we talk, you know, and this and this.</span> <span id="s1485">He says -- then he said, Professor, you know that the Poland was only country under the German occupation for helping the Jews, for saving the Jews, was death sentence for that.</span> <span id="s1486">Oh, he didn’t know what to say.</span> <span id="s1487">He says, yeah but anyway, how come Holland save percentage-wise more Jewish people than Poland?</span> <span id="s1488">Then this Steve, the Jewish fellow, he says, well, percentage, that was a different situation and there is a difference between Holland and Poland.</span> <span id="s1489">See, in Poland that was -- before the war started, that was three and a half million Jewish people living.</span> <span id="s1490">Okay, Poland is Christian country.</span> <span id="s1491">The German know that.</span> <span id="s1492">And the German expect that the Polish people gonna help Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1493">And that’s why they set that law, for anything to do with the Jewish people, Polish Christian help Jewish people or hiding Jewish people, death sentence.</span> <span id="s1494">And that was the -- the poster was all over the city, you know, in Polish and in German, you know, and that was clear, you know, what you’re going to get.</span> <span id="s1495">But even so, this Steve -- this is not my words, this Steve told that professor from Schenectady, New York, even so, the Polish people save about 100,000 Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1496">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1497">And different -- different ways, see, some churches, you know, help lots, you know.</span> <span id="s1498">The nuns, and also there was like Professor Karski.</span> <span id="s1499">Professor Karski, who knows how many indentity card he give to the Jewish people as a Christian.</span> <span id="s1500">And those people survived.</span> <span id="s1501">So I think that was a good answer to this.</span> <span id="s1502">I’m sorry to say, you know, that the Jewish people maybe feel bitter against the Polish people, that the Polish people make -- didn’t make enough, you know?</span> <span id="s1503">But when you go to Israel, when you look at it, what’s the name that place, you know, where that -- all names are, and they have -- had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Yad -- Yad Vashem?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Yad Vashem, the memorial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: Yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1508">You see so many Polish names, and so many trees was planted, you know, to honor those people, saved Jewish people, and I’m so glad -- I’m so glad that -- that so many, at least so many was saved.</span> <span id="s1509">Even so, you risk your life, but you save.</span> <span id="s1510">If you save only one life, this is good, you know, but they save quite -- quite a few thous -- a few thousand, hundred thousand like that Steve se -- did say.</span> <span id="s1511">So this is -- this is -- I wish -- I wish -- my wish is -- and I work hard, you know, and -- and I wish -- so this come true, that more understanding come in between Polish and Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1512">We understand what they go through.</span> <span id="s1513">They go through the hell, and we was the next, you -- we go through the hell.</span> <span id="s1514">Maybe in -- not in so -- s -- same degree, you know, but we was not much better than Jewish people, you know that, when we give you interview about my wife, Frieda and myself.</span> <span id="s1515">I come t -- we come to the concentration camp, for what?</span> <span id="s1516">Because we love each other?</span> <span id="s1517">Why Jewish people come in a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s1518">Because they was Jewish, yeah.</span> <span id="s1519">Was that crime?</span> <span id="s1520">There was no crime.</span> <span id="s1521">They didn’t do nothing wrong.</span> <span id="s1522">They was people like anybody else, see?</span> <span id="s1523">And that bothers me.</span> <span id="s1524">Now, how about Gypsy, Roman, let’s say.</span> <span id="s1525">They come, so many of them to the concentration camp, because they was Gypsy, because they was Roman, right?</span> <span id="s1526">All met --</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: All same with other religions, like how you say, people [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Jehovah Witness?</span> <span id="s1530">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Jehovah Witnesses, right.</span> <span id="s1532">Because they was Jehovah Witness, was that crime?</span> <span id="s1533">Or how about homosexual?</span> <span id="s1534">How many homosexual was there?</span> <span id="s1535">They didn’t do nothing wrong, you know, that wel -- that was for then -- even in this country now, this is a private matter, you know, between person and person, you know?</span> <span id="s1536">And that -- that -- I no see any crime.</span> <span id="s1537">So you see, when you -- when you go through this as a -- as a ex-concentration camp prisoner, I had so many Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s1538">I eat with the same spoon, we help each other all we can.</span> <span id="s1539">And when I hear such accusation now from the Jewish side, it hurts.</span> <span id="s1540">Because if you say that Polish people are anti-Semitic, that means I am anti-Semitic too.</span> <span id="s1541">And I am not.</span> <span id="s1542">I swear I am not, see, because I grow up with the Jewish people, I like Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1543">They didn’t do nothing wrong to me, and I have no reason to be against the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: D-Do you feel that sometimes it is also a question of Americans -- non-Jewish Americans maybe not having enough information to understand certain things?</span> <span id="s1545">When -- when you told people that you were out o -- that you were in camp, for instance, did they immediately assume you were Jewish, or did they understand that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Yeah, many people -- many -- many people told me -- many people told me -- we talk, well, for instance in that coffee shop we meet, you know, and so we have conversation.</span> <span id="s1547">They say, ooh, what wa -- Julie, what was you doing during the war, where were you?</span> <span id="s1548">Well, I was in Germany, yeah, I spent almost four years in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1549">Oh gosh, four years in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1550">Oh, Julie, I didn’t know you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1551">Now, this is -- you know, make me -- sometime make me laugh, then sometime you know, it bothers me a little bit, see, because again, besides the Jewish people, there were so many other nationalities in a concentration camp and they suffered just the same, you know, like Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: You -- you did -- you did tell your story once or twice in the -- in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s1553">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: About three times, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: About three times.</span> <span id="s1556">And it was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Here’s the one of them hangs, you know, about three years ago for Valentine day, there was a -- on the front page -- page, there was that article, you see that -- my picture, I smile, Frieda, you know.</span> <span id="s1558">They were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: It shows -- it shows both of you arm in arm and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: -- looking very sweet and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: -- but when you look at it above, you know, when we se -- gl -- right after we get married, you know, see our picture, you see how good looking we were at that time?</span> <span id="s1563">Oh, Frieda was a beautiful girl, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: I want -- I want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: And then -- and then we publicize, and we have so many response from people, you know, American -- even from younger generation, we was -- I was surprised that the younger generation was so interested.</span> <span id="s1566">And you know, it is for the younger generation here in -- in this country, when you write story you was in a concentration camp, about, because you’ve fallen in love -- fallen in love with a Austrian or German lady.</span> <span id="s1567">So the young generation says, and for that they sent you to the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s1568">I says, not only that, they send me to the concentration camp, I -- in a way I was lucky they send me to the concentration camp, but I can be hanged for that.</span> <span id="s1569">No, they -- they can’t believe it, you know.</span> <span id="s1570">For what, for love?</span> <span id="s1571">Because you love someone you come to the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s1572">I says yes.</span> <span id="s1573">You say that time change, you know, and here in this country you can marry whoever you want, you know, regardless on the color skin, you know, on background, you know, that doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1574">See, but that time, during the Hitler time, Hitler want to keep up the clean race, you know, German race, you know, no mix.</span> <span id="s1575">But I no have to tell you what happened after the war, you know, there was a big mix.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: So that was sort of an example for comments from the younger generation.</span> <span id="s1577">Did you receive -- give us a few more examples from -- maybe from the Polish community or from other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: M-Many of them, many of them, some people sent us the article in case we need it and even the [indecipherable] lady, you know, she drop about 10 n-newspapers, you know.</span> <span id="s1579">And there was a -- a -- a big reaction on this, and even the state senator, you know, once he -- he wrote me a -- a beautiful letter, and he says, Julie, I know you for a long time, I didn’t know what you was going through.</span> <span id="s1580">Oh, what a interesting story, so and so.</span> <span id="s1581">And wa -- that response was very, very -- in general was very good, but als -- and we had some telephone call, yeah, oh congratulation, yes, yes, specially the last one, and what we had three years ago on Saint Valentine day, they even call me on the station that time and congratulate me.</span> <span id="s1582">But also when I get home after the program, you know, I had a nasty telephone, I told you that.</span> <span id="s1583">A guy call me, he says, hey, you was in a concentration camp, Mr. Noga.</span> <span id="s1584">I says yes.</span> <span id="s1585">Oh, and then you survive.</span> <span id="s1586">I saw your picture in that paper, this morning’s paper.</span> <span id="s1587">You look good.</span> <span id="s1588">You was probably the -- one of the collaborator with the Germans, right?</span> <span id="s1589">You know how this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1590">I says, buddy, whoever you are, you are so wrong, and I got no words for you, good-bye.</span> <span id="s1591">Then I hang up.</span> <span id="s1592">You know?</span> <span id="s1593">You got people -- all depends, you know that.</span> <span id="s1594">People are very funny, some people.</span> <span id="s1595">Right away they accuse you for something.</span> <span id="s1596">If I was collaborator with the Germans, you think I go United States Holocaust there in Washington and tell my story, and my name, I didn’t change my name, my father and my brothers, you know, still were living -- was living here, you know?</span> <span id="s1597">I put my name if I was doing something wrong?</span> <span id="s1598">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1599">And before they accept me in -- in United States Holocaust --</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: -- before they invite me, they check up my background.</span> <span id="s1602">They know who I am, yeah.</span> <span id="s1603">So, you see, here is -- so again, when I come to the Polish people and Jewish people, I wish we get some more dialogs, we get together, we smooth out some differences, you know.</span> <span id="s1604">And be friends, you know, as we was before the war started, you know, I had so many friends, I still got so many friends there, Jewish friends, yeah.</span> <span id="s1605">And again, nobody can take away anything from Jewish people, what they was going through, through the second World War.</span> <span id="s1606">They had not much help.</span> <span id="s1607">I wonder sometime how come American Jewish didn’t help that time.</span> <span id="s1608">When Professor Karski come and speak to the Roosevelt and tell him, Mr. President, in Warsaw, in Poland, the Jewish people are -- they are killed by Germans, they sent to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1609">You know what the President Roosevelt did say at that time?</span> <span id="s1610">Well, after the war is finish, we take care of those war criminals.</span> <span id="s1611">And that was -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1612">And that time he come -- Professor Karski come with a Jewish leader from the -- from Poland, from the Jewish underground.</span> <span id="s1613">His name was, I believe Ziegenbalg -- Ziegenbalg, something like that.</span> <span id="s1614">And they go to the English government, they go to the American government and nothing help that time, nothing help.</span> <span id="s1615">So the -- Ziegenbalg, he commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1616">He open a -- I understand he open a gas in the kitchen, then he died, because he couldn’t -- he couldn’t do anything to help Jewish people, you know?</span> <span id="s1617">And this is a tragedy, see, that -- that the whole world that time, no want to listen about this tragedy, what’s happen to Jewish people, what they was doing in Poland, you know?</span> <span id="s1618">And that bothers me, you see.</span> <span id="s1619">And that -- this -- this what I can say, I wish, you know, we -- we smooth out those differences, if this exist any differences between Polish and Jewish people, so there’s more understanding, you know, why, why and why, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: I would like to stop for just one second, and -- okay, so we -- I have one last question left, and -- and that has to do -- there is another organization that you have worked for, or that you actually founded, and that was the Kopernik Society, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Yeah, when -- when -- when did that happen and -- and -- and why Kopernik?</span> <span id="s1623">You -- what is the -- your interest there?</span> <span id="s1624">Or what is your mission of that organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: I was -- that time I was the president of Polish community club here in Utica, and under the -- my jurisdiction, there was 28 Polish organizations, see?</span> <span id="s1626">So otherwise, each meeting I speak to delegates of 28 organization, see that Polonia in Utica.</span> <span id="s1627">That time was very strong and still is strong.</span> <span id="s1628">So, most of the -- those organization was like a insurance, like a ro -- mothers of rosaries, or Saint Anne Societies, and Saint Peter Societies, you know.</span> <span id="s1629">But I was looking around and I was thinking, gosh, you know, we need a organization, you know, on a little bit higher -- higher level.</span> <span id="s1630">Tell us about the culture, Polish culture, American culture, you know?</span> <span id="s1631">So that was a -- at that time, 1970 some -- yeah, that -- ’73, I think.</span> <span id="s1632">That was a -- a fi -- fifth anniversary -- 500 anniversary of Nicholas Kopernicus -- Nikolai Kopernik birthday.</span> <span id="s1633">And then I called special meeting, the whole Polonia meeting, and it -- oh, about hundred people attend, presidents, you know, from different organization, you know, guests.</span> <span id="s1634">And I introduce my plan, you know, we -- we need another organization.</span> <span id="s1635">And because this is a 500 anniversary of Nicholas Kopernicus, Nikolai Kopernik birthday, maybe we should build up a statue, put the statue here in the city [indecipherable] to this -- make a mark, you know, to this, because who was Nikolai Kopernik?</span> <span id="s1636">Nikolai Kopernik was the astronomer, and he was the first man find out that the -- not the sun but the earth turns around the sun, right?</span> <span id="s1637">Yeah, and that -- that came long time til his book and theory was accepted, but finally was accepted, and by gosh, truth is, we can send a man on the moon, do you know, and this and this, you know, that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1638">And so the people agree to -- to do this, and wa -- coming back to Nicholas Kopernik -- Ko-Kopernicus, he is a universal man.</span> <span id="s1639">And I think that -- that time I thought -- I thought that was worth [indecipherable] to build up the statue for him.</span> <span id="s1640">And we did.</span> <span id="s1641">I designed the pedestal, because I am stonecutter, of course, and the statue was made -- three and a half meter high, was made in Warsaw, in Poland.</span> <span id="s1642">Bronze statue, made out of bronze.</span> <span id="s1643">So we put it together, and -- that statue, with the pedestal base, is 21 feet tall and four inches, exactly.</span> <span id="s1644">And then -- then we had unveiling.</span> <span id="s1645">When the statue was ready we had unveiling and many, many people come.</span> <span id="s1646">And the congressman make a -- a -- recorded it in Washington, D.C. in Congress, that such a thing happen in Utica, New York.</span> <span id="s1647">And that was a big -- big, big thing.</span> <span id="s1648">So -- and the organization, Kopernik organization, right after that decided to give a -- help students in college, you know, give a grant, you know, give a scholarship.</span> <span id="s1649">And that’s what they do since that, up to today, you know, they do -- not big sc-scholarship, you -- like thousand dollars for three s -- for three students, each become thousand dollars -- get a thousand dollars, yeah.</span> <span id="s1650">And that organization -- yes, the organization got the -- got the museum and they’ll find work for this community.</span></p> <p><span
