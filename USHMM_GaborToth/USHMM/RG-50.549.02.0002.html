<span id="s15">One of the things that you didn’t say on the, on the videotape was the names of your parents, I believe and maybe we can just start with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My

id="s20">She, her father was a pediatrician and she grew up in a very middle-class environment, very comfortable in the first district of Vienna.</span> <span id="s21">She, she, they were a very close family.</span> <span id="s22">Her, her, she had a sister, a younger sister and she went to school in Vienna and actually I went to the same school late.</span> <span id="s23">And she, she helped my grandfather a little bit in, with the patients and always was interested helping the sick.</span> <span id="s24">She, she was very happy child and by the way, I can show you the painting of my great, great, great-grandmother which is hanging here on the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Kay, stop for one second.</span> <span id="s26">Can you talk a little bit more about what the atmosphere was like in your home, when you were growing up.</span> <span id="s27">Do, how, I know your father was political and I don’t know if that was true of the whole household.</span> <span id="s28">Can you talk a little about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I was born and lived in the first four years of my life in Vienna, in a, __________ comfortably apartment in Vienna’s eighth district.</span> <span id="s30">My father’s father was a lawyer and he had died a few months before my arrival.</span> <span id="s31">And it, my father was an editor at the newspaper and my mother managed the household.</span> <span id="s32">My parents loved music, people and discussions and they went out a lot, and, at, as well as having frequent get-together at their place.</span> <span id="s33">Their friends were writers and artists and the atmosphere at home was always very lively.</span> <span id="s34">My father worked at night so when he came home in the morning to sleep, I had to be very quiet.</span> <span id="s35">His paper appeared in the morning and, so he had to work all night.</span> <span id="s36">And they liked if I even left the house so I wouldn’t disturb him.</span> <span id="s37">Before my father had, he had graduated from law school and this enabled him to be the newspaper’s responsible editor.</span> <span id="s38">A position which required him to represent the newspaper in court whenever it was sued.</span> <span id="s39">He also, also specialized on reports relating to international subjects such as the League of Nations.</span> <span id="s40">As, as the world passed the period of economic depression, my father lost his position in 1927.</span> <span id="s41">He was appointed an editor to several publications in Berlin, and relocated his family to that city.</span> <span id="s42">I started going to elementary school in Berlin, Villmustof (ph), where we lived until 1933.</span> <span id="s43">And returned to Vienna after Hitler’s victory.</span> <span id="s44">It was an, I went to an all-girls’ school and we had religious instruction once a week.</span> <span id="s45">We were given bible instruction and we were encouraged to make plays (ph) about the lives of the characters in the Bible and, such as, for instance, Esther and Ruth.</span> <span id="s46">In Berlin, my father worked as and, responsible editor at the Montock-Morgan (ph) whose editor in chief was Leo __________ , as well as at the Togaboo (ph) and founded the economic review there __________.</span> <span id="s47">In 1931, he was sent on a reporter’s trip around the world, visiting Russia, Manchuria, North China, Korea, Japan and the USA.</span> <span id="s48">There is a write-up about him in the New York Times, July the 5th and from 1931 to 1933, he was co-editor in chief of the Daily __________.</span> <span id="s49">My mother disliked Berlin thoroughly, missing the charm of her daily existence.</span> <span id="s50">The social life was much reduced though we still had a lot of visits from family and friends.</span> <span id="s51">In March, 1933, we returned to Vienna, except for my father who wanted to finish some professional obligations, but was obliged to make a sudden departure when he escaped arrest by the Gestapo, May 1933.</span> <span id="s52">From then on, he was blacklisted as an opponent to the Nazi Regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: What, can you talk about how aware you were politically of what was going on at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Oh I was a child.</span> <span id="s55">I had no political views.</span> <span id="s56">When the Nazis came of course, I was, I was anti-Nazi, anti-fascist.</span> <span id="s57">I, I was very frightened by them, very.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Do you remember hearing discussions, political discussions at home with your father and mother and people who would come over?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes, I, I listened.</span> <span id="s60">I didn’t say anything but I listened.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: And what was usually the, the tenor of those discussions?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: The, the, I must say that there’s a vast generational change in the attitude of children, children were rarely even permitted to take part but we, we were very interested and usually just listening behind the door, too.</span> <span id="s63">And, but we weren’t asked about our opinions.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: What was the relationship between you and your brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: I had only one brother and he, he was the big brother and he treated me as his little sister and we were, we had fun together.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: What kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: At that time, I mean at the time when I was, the time I’m speaking is six, seven, eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: What kinds of things did you do with, how did you play?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: We, he had a, a rail...</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Train?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Train.</span> <span id="s72">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Electric train?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s75">And we liked to play with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Let me jump ahead now to when you emigrated, how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Can I add something to the other, to your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: I played mostly with my friend, girlfriend who was the daughter of a very prominent painter in Berlin.</span> <span id="s80">Her name is, was Yoseffa Shtinehart (ph) and her father had a very large __________ and we were together daily there and we, and I played with her, I mean very intensively at, and very much fun plays _______________ and games.</span> <span id="s81">And she just lived around the corner and in 1933, when the, the, Hitler came to power, he was immediately arrested and it was terrible for me.</span> <span id="s82">It was in fact, on the day of my birthday and it was a terrible shock and he was released but he took off very, at that, just at that moment he took off for Israel with his family.</span> <span id="s83">It was very difficult for him to emigrate because of his paintings and how to take them along and safeguard them, but that’s a long story.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: How old were you when you emigrated to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Oh that’s a few years later, I ...</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: We went back to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: We, we were going back just to talk about some of the things that you hadn’t been asked in the video and now the, the main focus of this is going to be your experiences after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: How old was I..</span> <span id="s90">.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: I was 17 going on 18.</span> <span id="s95">I was ready, I was, when I came I went to high school.</span> <span id="s96">And I applied for college immediately afterwards.</span> <span id="s97">Excuse me, what was your question before?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: I just had asked you how old you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: What were, what was the emigration process like?</span> <span id="s101">Can you tell me a little bit like, what that was, what that was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: How we got into the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: That was very strange experience because we had to leave Europe during 1942, at the time when the transatlantic travel was very rare and we were extremely fortunate to get a little space on one of the rare transports that went from Portugal to the United States.</span> <span id="s105">But by no means directly because they, the ship tried to avoid the mine, the mines of the ocean and we went first to Cuba then to the Bermudas and finally, we ended up at Virginia Beach but we didn’t know we were, where we were.</span> <span id="s106">We just ended up and the immigration officers came on board and processed us on board and then when finally we were allowed to leave the __________ when they agreed, they were afraid that the boat contained spies and or, any other people they didn’t wish to come on, to the United States.</span> <span id="s107">And that was their main concern.</span> <span id="s108">And so not everybody got off.</span> <span id="s109">So those that were allowed to get off finally were...</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Blindfolded?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Blindfolded and we were guided to a train.</span> <span id="s112">And the train were, was also blindfolded and we couldn’t look outside and we didn’t know where we were.</span> <span id="s113">We didn’t know we were in Virginia Beach.</span> <span id="s114">And then something very nice happened.</span> <span id="s115">We received something to eat and...</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Were you blindfolded at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s118">Then of course they took it off in the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: In the train they took it off because the train was black.</span> <span id="s121">You couldn’t see anything anyway.</span> <span id="s122">And they gave us sandwiches and I, I don’t think I’ll ever forget my astonishment at the white bread that was given to us.</span> <span id="s123">During the war and I thought this was a special welcome gift.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: You later found out this was...</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Your daily bread.</span> <span id="s126">And then we were, when the train left, we weren’t told where we were going and we landed, not landed, we arrived at New York City, Penn Station, 34th Street, the doors were opened.</span> <span id="s127">We were told you’re on your own and here we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: So there you were in New York.</span> <span id="s129">What were your impressions of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Well, first of all, we didn’t quite know what to do.</span> <span id="s131">Here we were, we weren’t prepared for, for that and we had very little money and so we had to decide what to do.</span> <span id="s132">So we actually decided to split up because, and everybody, we all had friends and family here in New York, but they had no clue that we had arrived.</span> <span id="s133">And so we didn’t want to overwhelm any, any one in particular so we said it’s best we go each to one person and then maybe they can put us up and that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s134">And they did put us up very kindly, each one of us separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: And what did you think of, of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yeah, I walked the first day, already, on my arrival.</span> <span id="s137">I walked from 34th Street to, I think 86th Street on the west side.</span> <span id="s138">I was overwhelmed and I must say the, the word freedom became something of meaning.</span> <span id="s139">It, you were free to go without showing a paper, without identifying yourself.</span> <span id="s140">You were free.</span> <span id="s141">That was my, my really, the first impact.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Did you talk about that at all with people?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Just a feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s146">I think this the first time that I mentioned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: And you were 17, 18 at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: And you’d never really experienced this kind of freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Right.</span> <span id="s151">No.</span> <span id="s152">Because, not anyway, in the, as a child I had experienced that freedom, but not as a teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Did it take some getting used to?</span> <span id="s154">Was it strange?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No, I, I loved it.</span> <span id="s156">It and I, and that for me is the essence of America.</span> <span id="s157">It stayed with me.</span> <span id="s158">I, I, now even more shocked than a person who hasn’t experienced that at the necessity of writing the social security on everything you, you hand in now.</span> <span id="s159">Before when I arrived in the United States, you needed nothing, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s160">You gave your name, everybody believed you and if, if, if you, if they asked you do you have an identification and you took out an envelope from a letter that you got yesterday, that was sufficient.</span> <span id="s161">And that was, that, I thought was marvelous.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: And this was after having been asked for your papers at every checkpoint _______________</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: You were in school at this time.</span> <span id="s165">What, how did the teachers and, and your fellow students respond to you as, as a, as an immigrant, as someone who’d come from such a horrible experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Actually, nobody asked me anything.</span> <span id="s167">The only person who realized that was a teacher who, whose job actually it was to deal with children whose mother tongue is not English.</span> <span id="s168">And she was, she knew it, I think, about my background and she was very kind.</span> <span id="s169">And very helpful.</span> <span id="s170">She collected clothes that I needed but she didn’t let me know that she gave it to me.</span> <span id="s171">She just, it appeared where I was sitting or she just gave, she never wanted to be thanked for it but I knew she must have been, she had collected it.</span> <span id="s172">And, and mostly marvelous clothes that I had never even had before, such beautiful clothes.</span> <span id="s173">And the, the co-student, my students, colleagues never asked me anything.</span> <span id="s174">And the fact that my English was very poor of course, was very noticeable and in fact, it was non-existent in, in the first few weeks.</span> <span id="s175">I learned fast but it, the first few weeks it was non-existent and so you tended to go, we had to eat at school, right?</span> <span id="s176">And so you tended to go and sit with children that you could talk with.</span> <span id="s177">So a little French table was sort of brought together with little refugees from Belgium and France and we got to know each other because of the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Did you know any other Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: I, these children were Jewish mostly, my little friends, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: And did you discuss the, where you had come from?</span> <span id="s181">Did you discuss the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Oh, we, we told each other our stories, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s185">I remember my Belgian friend came from a diamond family and my, and I, and my French friend came from a doctor’s family.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Eventually when you learned how to speak English better, did you then talk about _______________</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: No, because it, I wasn’t asked _______________ no.</span> <span id="s188">The only thing, where I talked about actually is when I left Europe I was given certain letters and documents by a variety of people to bring to the United States which I kept on me with great care.</span> <span id="s189">And amongst it was a, a request by the Truckmay (ph) family for me to contact the Quaker in the United States, that was very important because the Quakers had given their support to the Luchombon (ph) Project and to, and Pastor Truckmay (ph) was entirely dependent on their financial help.</span> <span id="s190">And so that was one of the first things I did it, was to go to the New York Quaker office and they were very interested and they asked me to come to a meeting and they asked me to give a little talk on my experience and, and they, they were fascinated by what had happened to their support, to hear about it from firsthand.</span> <span id="s191">And there’s a little story, aside, is a lady came up to me and she said, would I agree to stay with her during the summer and be a companion to her daughter.</span> <span id="s192">And that was in springtime and so that seemed very far away and I agreed of course, yes I would.</span> <span id="s193">And then when I did spend time with that family in the summertime, what she really wanted me to do is to teach her child German.</span> <span id="s194">And to me, that was terrible.</span> <span id="s195">I didn’t want to speak German.</span> <span id="s196">That was the language of the enemy.</span> <span id="s197">But I didn’t want to disappoint her either.</span> <span id="s198">So I did teach the child German but it was, it was a great insight to my person, in a way.</span> <span id="s199">And I, I mention this because nobody would think of that, I don’t think.</span> <span id="s200">You, you don’t think you, this little girl speak, this not little, this young girl speaks German so why shouldn’t she speak German with, I, I can understand her now very well but at that time, it made me very unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Did you talk to anyone else aside from the Quakers about, about your experience?</span> <span id="s202">When did you begin to talk to, more, more openly and were people willing to listen to your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: I, it’s hard to answer.</span> <span id="s204">I cannot give you a time.</span> <span id="s205">There was no particular time when I started to talk about it.</span> <span id="s206">I was very occupied with doing my schoolwork and I, without being asked, I would not have started anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: And you weren’t asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: And, and nobody, nobody asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Why do you think that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: That’s an excellent question.</span> <span id="s211">They, in the United States, the United States were preoccupied with the war and the war effort.</span> <span id="s212">And they were fighting the war, they were not, I believe, interested in what happened before.</span> <span id="s213">Perhaps, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Maybe they thought it was impolite or... to ask if it was something that, to ask about something that might have been hard to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Your brother joined, or was a member of the United States Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: In, in the video you talked about his...</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Contribution...</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: To the war effort.</span> <span id="s225">Do you, do you feel as though you made a contribution?</span> <span id="s226">Did you, did you want to make a contribution?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Not through, not because of my brother but yes, immediately after I came, I felt guilty, personally.</span> <span id="s228">Also, I felt guilty that we were saved.</span> <span id="s229">Made me feel guilty.</span> <span id="s230">I felt guilty that I left France at this particular time.</span> <span id="s231">So, I might mention something that I never mentioned before.</span> <span id="s232">It, it didn’t occur to me to mention it, I guess or I forgot.</span> <span id="s233">But just before we left France, somebody contacted me and asked me to distribute anti-Nazi literature.</span> <span id="s234">I must say today they give it a name but at that time, we didn’t think of ourself, neither working for the Resistance or Underground, we, we, didn’t occur to us to think in those terms.</span> <span id="s235">And they, and they, today they give this a name.</span> <span id="s236">And they call it a coolyay (ph) but I just was a young girl on the bicycle who distributed this literature.</span> <span id="s237">And, and I, I, I personally did it in the streets of Toulouse and it was very dangerous but I don’t think it ever occurred to me to think that I did something dangerous.</span> <span id="s238">The only thing I knew was that I had to keep my mouth shut, never tell anybody what I was doing, not my parents, not my friends, nobody.</span> <span id="s239">It was zero.</span> <span id="s240">You had to do what you were asked to do without asking any questions.</span> <span id="s241">And I felt I was doing something important.</span> <span id="s242">And to leave that gave me this guilt feeling.</span> <span id="s243">And also, I, I had something very rare, a bicycle.</span> <span id="s244">And I wanted to leave it with this organization and so when we escaped from France to Spain and we were on the train, this train stopped in Toulouse and I had my bicycle with me, on the train and I suddenly jumped out of the train and it, I wanted to leave the bicycle at the station.</span> <span id="s245">And my father jumped after me and said, you crazy?</span> <span id="s246">I mean, he was right actually, it was crazy.</span> <span id="s247">And he, he, he gave me a, a slap, he slapped me.</span> <span id="s248">And the stationmaster came and said, what are you doing?</span> <span id="s249">You slapping this young lady?</span> <span id="s250">You mustn’t do that.</span> <span id="s251">And everybody was against my father and defended me.</span> <span id="s252">And so I told the stationmaster what I wanted to do, to leave the bicycle in Toulouse and he helped me.</span> <span id="s253">He gave me a, he put it where the baggage is and he gave me a little receipt and I sent the receipt to somebody whom I told to give it to this other person and today I know he never got it but, that’s another story again.</span> <span id="s254">But anyway, I tried very hard and, and I also didn’t want to leave Earnest (ph) because I was afraid he would not be taken care of was parcels.</span> <span id="s255">Those were the basis for my guilt feelings actually and it stayed with me when I came here.</span> <span id="s256">So one of the first things I did was, when it was founded, I went to the Free French Movement in New York.</span> <span id="s257">[end of side one, tape one] One of the first things I did was, when it was founded, I went to the Free French Movement in New York and wanted, and told them I wanted to join them.</span> <span id="s258">They, they recruited people to go to England and on, and I was told I was too young.</span> <span id="s259">But until now, I don’t believe that was the real reason.</span> <span id="s260">At this particular point I think I must have run into somebody who was an anti-Semite and didn’t want me to join them.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: There were no Jews in, in this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Very few and the reason I, I think this today, at that time I was just devastated.</span> <span id="s263">I think this today is, you know how the __________ came to New York at one time and the French Embassy gave him a reception, we attended.</span> <span id="s264">And the remarks he made made me think that.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Was that the first time you’d experienced anti-Semitism in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Pretty much so, oh it’s a very good question.</span> <span id="s267">I really have not experienced, personally, anti-Semitism in America.</span> <span id="s268">Maybe because I, in New York, maybe of New York, if I would have been sent to another region maybe I would have.</span> <span id="s269">But in New York?</span> <span id="s270">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: When, when did you become a citizen?</span> <span id="s272">American citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Well, we, just about five years after the arrival.</span> <span id="s274">As soon as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Did you feel as though you were then an American?</span> <span id="s276">Or did you feel that before?</span> <span id="s277">Or did it take awhile?</span> <span id="s278">Or did you ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: I ask myself that.</span> <span id="s280">I, I feel like I’m an international person, an international citizen.</span> <span id="s281">Especially, since the United Nations started.</span> <span id="s282">I, I, I was very glad about the start of the United Nations and it sort of fitted my personality.</span> <span id="s283">As a matter of fact, I don’t know if you remember but, no, the, the United, first United Nations session were in a campus of Hunter College in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s284">And I went there and I was completely enthusiastic about the whole organization and of, when I looked for a job after I graduated from school, was the first thing, I went to the United Nations.</span> <span id="s285">But like every other of these organizations which I didn’t realize, is you needed somebody to push you if you wanted a job.</span> <span id="s286">I mean you needed to know somebody and I just walked in and applied and of course, I never got one.</span> <span id="s287">But I was very disappointed not to get one.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: What did you study at Hunter College?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: I, I prepared myself exactly for that.</span> <span id="s290">I studied political science, philosophy and art.</span> <span id="s291">And in the, today this would be no, no problem but at that time, they came to me and said, art doesn’t sit with that.</span> <span id="s292">Why you taking art?</span> <span id="s293">And I thought quickly and I said well what about a political cartoonist?</span> <span id="s294">And they said ah, yeah, you’re right.</span> <span id="s295">And so I was allowed to take those three options.</span> <span id="s296">But I, I, I wouldn’t, I wanted art for something entirely different reason.</span> <span id="s297">It’s to me, art gives life another dimension.</span> <span id="s298">And it isn’t cartoons that I was after, I was, my thought were that art is, well is, really the kind of life that I wanted to pursue.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: And you did study at a art school in New York as well as going to Hunter?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s301">I took classes at the Art Student’s League immediately and then I stayed at the art school, art student’s league as full time as monitor and after, after I had more time.</span> <span id="s302">I, I, I changed from Hunter College day to Hunter College evening and went to art school during the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: And did you study painting?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Painting.</span> <span id="s305">And drawing, from the model.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: What were most of your subjects about?</span> <span id="s307">What were most of your paintings and drawings about that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: People.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: And do you feel as though that it was a, a way of expressing things that had happened to you earlier during, during the war and during your escape from France?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: No.</span> <span id="s311">The, I, I did not take art as a means of translating realism.</span> <span id="s312">To me, art was the, gave the contact of the soul and maybe replaced what other people taken their religion, religious experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Can you tell me more about the reunion with Earnest in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Oh, I, I came to England officially to visit my grandmother who lived there.</span> <span id="s315">And my father came with me.</span> <span id="s316">It was not officially to visit Earnest but of course everybody knew I was going to visit Earnest.</span> <span id="s317">So the first thing I did was to fix a meeting place and we met at a subway station, underground.</span> <span id="s318">And we threw into each other’s arms.</span> <span id="s319">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: How long had it been since you’d seen him?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I saw him the last time in 1940, 1940 and this was 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: And you had communicated by writing letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Very few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: We got married seven days later.</span> <span id="s326">At the, where was it, Kensington.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Did you know that was gonna happen when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: No, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s329">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Were you surprised?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: You must have thought about him an awful lot during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s334">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s335">And as I said before, I mean, it, it left me great guilt feelings that I, I wasn’t able to help him.</span> <span id="s336">We did send the packages soon as we came to Lisbon and he got it and then I sent a package from, as soon as I came to New York and Earnest says he never got it.</span> <span id="s337">And then we couldn’t send anymore anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Did you get to go on a honeymoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Well, if you call it that.</span> <span id="s340">We had no money and so we went to a little room, rented a little room in, in London.</span> <span id="s341">That was our honeymoon, wasn’t very exciting maybe from the outside but for us, it was most exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: And how long did you stay in London together?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Not too long because I wanted to claim him, to come to the United States as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s344">And also, that is perhaps, I had just gotten a job in New York at the New York Public Library.</span> <span id="s345">And they had given me one week of leave and I had already extended it to two weeks.</span> <span id="s346">So I had to come back if I wanted to keep my job and it is very important that I kept my job because I wanted to send money to Earnest.</span> <span id="s347">So, for these reasons I didn’t stay long at all.</span> <span id="s348">I returned to England, to excuse me to the United States and immediately claimed Earnest but I was still not citizen at the time.</span> <span id="s349">So I had to wait ‘til I became citizen a few months later until he, he could really come as the wife of an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: But he did come with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Oh, he didn’t, he stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Oh no, he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s354">He had to wait for the visa.</span> <span id="s355">Oh no, he couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: And how long was that?</span> <span id="s357">Several months?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Oh yes, it was, he only came in, in February of the next year.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: What was that time like?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Here?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: In between?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: In between it was very hard, very hard but well compared to what went before, it wasn’t as painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: So you were working as, as a librarian.</span> <span id="s364">As a research...</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: As, yes, in the, in the, in, in New York and that became my profession.</span> <span id="s366">I had not gone to library school before and only went to library school when I arrived in Washington at a much later, much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Can you talk about your career?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Oh yes, I loved my career.</span> <span id="s369">I loved, I loved being a librarian.</span> <span id="s370">When I first worked in New York, I worked with the, the American government had sent to various libraries the books that they captured in the various countries and wanted them to deposit in various libraries, of course the first library was the Library of Congress.</span> <span id="s371">But the New York Public Library was one of the chief libraries to receive these bounties also.</span> <span id="s372">So they had received an enormous amount of Nazi literature.</span> <span id="s373">And they engaged me actually to sift through all that material and make it available and of course it was very interesting to me, to, to do that.</span> <span id="s374">So my first duty as a library assistant that I was, was already within the, the field of World War II literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: You said it was very interesting, it must have been also somewhat difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: It was difficult but it was, it explained a lot to me that had happened.</span> <span id="s377">The, it, it, it filled gasps and it, it, I was, I worked together with actually with a lot of other people who had similar backgrounds and we, we were constantly discussing our work.</span> <span id="s378">It was a very interesting time.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Do you recall any one particular document or any piece of literature that you came across that stands out?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Hitler’s Mien Kampf (ph).</span> <span id="s381">It was the first time that I came across it.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: And you read the entire ...</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No, I didn’t read the entire, didn’t, but enough to, to be impressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And what were your impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: That he was a madman.</span> <span id="s386">And it was just not understandable to me, how a civilized people, the, the people that I had known in Germany, would fall for such a madman.</span> <span id="s387">And it, this is really not, this is still not resolved, I think that question.</span> <span id="s388">Why people accept mad leaders and they still do it today.</span> <span id="s389">So, the duty of democracy in my opinion is to explain that very clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: And that’s, it’s still a question in your mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: It’s, yeah, not a question, it’s still a challenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: You had said in the Washington Post that you, that you struggle to understand what happened during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s393">Is this one of the things that...</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: That you?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes, like how people can be so evil is my, I cannot understand it and I see it every day today.</span> <span id="s397">Until very recently, I, I couldn’t accept it.</span> <span id="s398">I, I mean I, I was always idealistic.</span> <span id="s399">I always thought that the good will win.</span> <span id="s400">Now I’m not so sure anymore.</span> <span id="s401">I, people always sort of laughed at me when I maintained this attitude that, they called me naïve and, and unrealistic and, and, I guess because I had experienced so many good incidents that I firmly believed that the good will win out.</span> <span id="s402">I’m afraid to say that I, I have to, I have my doubts today.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: When did that attitude change?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Very recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Any explanation?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Seeing what’s happening in this world and how people repeat the same errors, which I would call errors, the same errors that have, that I can document, exactly for the same reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: For example, Bosnia.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s409">Or Ruvana (ph) or everywhere in the whole world.</span> <span id="s410">The whole world.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: But it’s interesting that you felt for most of your life, very optimistic and hopeful.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s413">It...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Can you talk a little bit about where that came from?</span> <span id="s415">I mean did you, you were incredibly, I don’t know, maybe blessed is the word you could use during your experiences during the war.</span> <span id="s416">I mean, you, you managed to find your family amidst incredible chaos.</span> <span id="s417">That had to make you feel as though somehow there was a light shining on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: No I didn’t take it so personal.</span> <span id="s419">I thought that there are so many good people to make this possible.</span> <span id="s420">I mean, I didn’t talk to you now about Varian Fry (ph) for instance.</span> <span id="s421">He was my hero.</span> <span id="s422">I don’t know if you know who he is.</span> <span id="s423">But Varian Fry (ph) was the person who, he, he was assigned by the Emergency Rescue Committee to distribute visas in France for the intellectuals and this is how we were saved by obtaining one of those out of quota visas.</span> <span id="s424">And, but the risks this man took.</span> <span id="s425">He was in danger every day of his, of his life while he worked in, in Marseilles and to me, he, he, he did it out of idealism, out of the conviction that he had to save people.</span> <span id="s426">And he, he saved as many as he possibly could.</span> <span id="s427">And when he came back to the United States, the world had forgotten him.</span> <span id="s428">It’s very sad, finally, when we came to the United States, my father wanted to write a biography of, of Varian Fry (ph) but he was not allowed to do it.</span> <span id="s429">He was told somebody else is writing it which, this biography has never came out, so, it was very sad.</span> <span id="s430">It was sad also for my father because he admired him and then finally, the, there was an exhibit about him and the United States Memorial Museum made an exhibit about Varian Fry and he’s now being recognized and it, he, I think you will hear about him very shortly.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: I wanted to go back to you and Earnest and...</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Settling down and he finally was able to come to join you.</span> <span id="s434">Can you talk a little bit about your, your early years and maybe sort of...</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s436">We, the first thing was for him to, to me, to regain his self-esteem.</span> <span id="s437">He hadn’t worked, he hadn’t studied for all this time and I was concerned that he, he should be given every opportunity possible so, but we had no money and so the first concern was to, to have enough money to live independently.</span> <span id="s438">So he had to find a job and he took any old job, whatever it was, he didn’t, a long series of short jobs that he accomplished in the first half-year of his stay in America and then we had enough money to, to rent a little apartment on mid-Manhattan.</span> <span id="s439">And actually apartment is a big name for a room and a kitchenette.</span> <span id="s440">And then he joined the, I was very concerned that he should go continue his studies and he, he went to the new school and he took a scholarship and he, he then wrote a thesis and then the thesis was sent to many colleges and universities so he could ask for scholarships.</span> <span id="s441">And he did receive a, several scholarships and he choose to go to Johns Hopkins.</span> <span id="s442">And that of course meant that we had to leave New York and that meant that I had to leave my job.</span> <span id="s443">I might say at this point, this is the story of my life.</span> <span id="s444">I had to leave my jobs whenever it just started to bloom, whenever the first blooms came out, I had to leave because my husband was transferred or for such reasons.</span> <span id="s445">And today, I know that many married couples split up because of this situation which doesn’t allow the woman to continue her career.</span> <span id="s446">And, but at that time, there was no question.</span> <span id="s447">And so I went with Earnest to Baltimore and I got a job in the Veteran’s Administration Hospital Library.</span> <span id="s448">And that made me change to a specialization that I had then for quite awhile, which is medical librarianship which is a class, sort of, in itself.</span> <span id="s449">We settled in, in Sparrow’s Point, it, it, and Earnest went to Baltimore every day and I went to my hospital library.</span> <span id="s450">And he started his Ph.D. in economics.</span> <span id="s451">He choose economics.</span> <span id="s452">And after awhile, I said Earnest, we have to start a family.</span> <span id="s453">This is, I’m getting impatient about that.</span> <span id="s454">And so, he had to look for a job because he, he, he did get the scholarship and he did have a very, very small contribution for his teaching when he did, it was sort of a teaching scholarship.</span> <span id="s455">And he taught a few classes in Johns Hopkins, but was nothing one could live on.</span> <span id="s456">So he traveled to Washington and he actually got a job in Washington and we moved again.</span> <span id="s457">And as a matter of fact, I had taken, I had started to go to library school that summer in New York.</span> <span id="s458">I, I took off for a session of the summer school at Columbia University and took medical librarianship and my teacher there came from Washington and was chief of reference in the Armed Forces Medical Library which is the predecessor of the National Library of Medicine.</span> <span id="s459">And so when Earnest found his job in Washington, I went to see her and asked her if she would consider hiring me and as I had had an A in her course, she offered me a position in the reference library of the Armed Forces Medical Library which was located at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology which is the forerunner of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: NIH?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: No of, in, the, for the army, Walter Reed (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Walter Reed (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yes and, the, the history of the growth of medical librarianship is very interesting and very influential because as you mentioned NIH, I mean NIH would be much less of what it is without the National Library of Medicine next door and actually it had an, it’s own library which adjoined later.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: You talked about wanting to have a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Did you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes, actually I was rather unlucky.</span> <span id="s468">I had __________ miscarriages.</span> <span id="s469">And then I did have a successful pregnancy and had a girl.</span> <span id="s470">I named her Nicole, Nicole Andrea and she was born in ’53.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: And is she still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Okay, I wanted to make sure, I hadn’t heard.</span> <span id="s474">And what, what is she doing?</span> <span id="s475">Where does she live?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: She is a teacher of biology.</span> <span id="s477">She studied biology and she fell in love with a, a British citizen and married him and he, he was not treating her right.</span> <span id="s478">He was beating her and she had to leave him.</span> <span id="s479">And so she had a very unhappy time.</span> <span id="s480">She passed away unhappy time.</span> <span id="s481">She had a baby at that time and my granddaughter and she, but she stayed in England.</span> <span id="s482">And so today she is in England.</span> <span id="s483">She had remarried and is __________ divorced and now she’s teaching biology in, in excellent school in Brighton.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: When did you first talk to her about, or tell her about your experiences as a young, as a, as a girl and as a teenager, during the war and before?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: __________ a good question because she grew up after she, after she was four years old, a little bit like, I just remember I was four years old first time I, she, my husband is assigned his first foreign service appointment.</span> <span id="s486">My husband’s position was in the Department of Agriculture when he came and the, he, he will tell you about his position so I won’t go into this.</span> <span id="s487">That, he became then attached to the Foreign Agricultural Service and he was sent overseas as assistant attaché and his first assignment was in Germany.</span> <span id="s488">So that was not easy.</span> <span id="s489">In, to answer your question, what do you tell your little girl about the country she’s just about to go to school in?</span> <span id="s490">And that was very difficult.</span> <span id="s491">We lived, when we came to Germany, this, the, there was a whole compound in Bonn.</span> <span id="s492">We were attached to the embassy, right?</span> <span id="s493">And there was a whole compound in, in Bonn called __________, it was called the golden ghetto by the local population because it, the American embassy had beautiful grounds and a lovely school and a wonderful restaurants and...</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: __________</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s496">Do you want to take a break?</span> <span id="s497">Okay.</span> <span id="s498">Do you want to finish up this story or?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yeah, finish it up and __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">End of tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: You’re, you’re talking about, tell how difficult it was to tell your daughter about your experiences in, in, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Yes, _______________, yes.</span> <span id="s504">She, she was going to the American school in Pittusdorf (ph), and at the same time, we wanted her, in this, we wanted her to learn German.</span> <span id="s505">Because we felt that she should not feel that she’s living in a sort of separate ghetto.</span> <span id="s506">And the school itself did not teach German very intensively.</span> <span id="s507">All the subjects were in English and they had a little German but it wasn’t very much.</span> <span id="s508">So we had somebody come over to teach her German, to prepare her for it, normal transition if she, she wanted to, to go out of this golden ghetto.</span> <span id="s509">And we did not at this time, tell her about our previous experience in Germany but it was very difficult to keep quiet about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: So when, when did you finally talk to your daughter about the war experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Well, to come back what I had said, I felt that as a such a young child, she could not deal with this information, she would hate the country she is in, she would hate every individual for doing what they did to their parents, that’s the way I imagined she would react because that’s certainly the way I would react if I had heard this from my parents.</span> <span id="s512">And it would not be a happy life for her to have to deal with this problem, with this psychological problem so we postponed to tell her when she was old enough to deal with it and we told her and it was a great shock to her.</span> <span id="s513">And, but she, she was very loyal and she, she felt very much with us and she, that’s the way it is today.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: How old was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: When we told her?</span> <span id="s516">About, I’d say, ten, eleven.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: And you think she understood?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s519">I, I don’t know if you can ever understand so.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: How was that for you to be in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Very difficult.</span> <span id="s522">Very different, that’s why we came to this conclusion.</span> <span id="s523">It was very difficult, I, but we made some very good friends that are, are Germans and we still know them and it, it made me realize that you should not generalize, that as a matter of fact, we met a lot of people who were in the Resistance.</span> <span id="s524">We, we met a group of the, from the, Shtowfumbergs (ph) that had tried to kill Hitler.</span> <span id="s525">We met other Resistance fighters.</span> <span id="s526">There was as a matter of fact, a whole group of them in Germany.</span> <span id="s527">And it was very impressive to talk to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: How long were you in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: We were twice as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s530">We were first for, I’d say, three years, a little more, maybe.</span> <span id="s531">Then we were called back for a year and then we were assigned again for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: And what years were those?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: That was, so long ago, sixty...</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: It, it’s okay if you don’t remember, just generally in the sixties.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: In the sixties, yes.</span> <span id="s536">In the late fifties and early sixties.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: And did you experience any anti-Semitism there, in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: In Germany?</span> <span id="s539">Yes.</span> <span id="s540">Not personally but we did hear anti-Semitic remarks.</span> <span id="s541">Not addressed to us at all but when you were in a restaurant, you overheard conversations between two ex-Nazis, obviously SS people, and you understood what they were saying sometimes.</span> <span id="s542">It was very hard not to react.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Did you ever go back to your neighborhood in Vienna where you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Oh yes, recently.</span> <span id="s545">We wanted to show this neighborhood to my daughter and we intend to show it to my grandchild.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: What was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Like coming to a foreign country, actually.</span> <span id="s548">Not countries, nothing, the, the streets had changed and the environment had changed, that’s what I mean by that.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: What kind of emotions did it bring up?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: The, the emotions that any injustice that you had to live through would bring up.</span> <span id="s551">I felt I had been unjustly, I felt is not the word, I had been unjustly treated and so did my entire family and this is how you react to that.</span> <span id="s552">Today I think of the black people in America and I can understand their anger, perhaps better than other people can.</span> <span id="s553">Even though their anger is not constructive at this point.</span> <span id="s554">You don’t choose not to be angry when you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Do you still have a lot of anger?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: It’s not an anger at people, it’s the anger of the in, injustice.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Towards, it’s at, I’m not sure I quite understand.</span> <span id="s558">It’s that is not at the people...</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: The anger is directed against the injustice of, of, of life, of the situation one has to face.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Do you feel as though you were deprived of, of large portion of your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: It’s not a matter of feeling, it’s the truth.</span> <span id="s562">It certainly is true.</span> <span id="s563">But because it was also partly because of the war, I recognize that other people were also deprived who were not in the same situation such as the American soldier, so, it’s not a unique situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: How do you think that experience sort of shapes who you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: It entirely shaped who I am.</span> <span id="s566">I, I’m not a psychiatrist but isn’t any experience shaping the person entirely, and even the unconscious?</span> <span id="s567">So, I mean that is always what defines you?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: What decisions and choices in your life do you think were made as an outgrowth of, of, of the war experience?</span> <span id="s569">For example, your marriage with Earnest or, or your choice of your career?</span> <span id="s570">How much of those things were influenced by the war experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Well my, the, the greatest influence of my war experience certainly is to apply for the job at the Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s572">I, I had up till then worked to, with the medical library field.</span> <span id="s573">My last job was in Geneva, in Switzerland where I built up the medical library of the university there and a colleague of mine drew my attention to the advertisement in, in one of the Washington papers for that, they advertised for the job of the librarian of the Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s574">And I thought I was well qualified for what they asked and I applied and obviously they agreed with my desire to work there.</span> <span id="s575">And the experience I had gathered contributed of course immensely to this job.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: How many years did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: I got the position in ’89.</span> <span id="s578">And I resigned in ’95.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: And in what ways did it contribute to your understanding of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: In what way did?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Working there.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Working there contribute – every day.</span> <span id="s583">Every minute of my work I learned something new and it was fascinating for me to work with the material I worked with.</span> <span id="s584">And to build this library, I, I, when I came we had just a few hundred books on, on a few shelves and, and some office on “L” Street and when I left, we had a full-fledged library which was my joy to build up.</span> <span id="s585">Also from an architectural point of view since I had had that experience in Geneva, working directly with the architects, I, I had also this opportunity here and I worked very closely with Freat (ph) who is the architect of the museum and who is also a refugee child.</span> <span id="s586">And so we had a lot in, in common and it was a great experience.</span> <span id="s587">We could, to build up this library from scratch.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Why did you want to work at the Holocaust Memorial Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Because of my past experience.</span> <span id="s590">You asked were there anything in my decision, in my career decisions was related to my past experience and that is the reason I applied.</span> <span id="s591">I felt now finally I can do something to, to bring this part of my life out.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Is there, is there any one, I asked you this about your work at the New York Public Library, is there any one instance or moment or document or anything that, that stands out during your time at the Holocaust Memorial that you came across that had a profound impact on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s594">There is a book published by Klassfelds (ph) which describes the transport to Auschwitz and is very comprehensive and one day we, when it came out, of course we acquired it as soon as possible and as, when it arrived, I opened it to the name Earnest Koenig and here described when and under what circumstances Earnest was brought to Drancy and from Drancy to, I mean it didn’t, not Washington, Drancy to Auschwitz and it didn’t describe him.</span> <span id="s595">It only mentioned his name but it described the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: And you didn’t know this?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: I had never seen it before.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: And what impact did that have on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: It, it’s a shaking up experience.</span> <span id="s600">I, I, now in the library, the majority of questions of people who come in now are trying to trace what happened to their ancestors and I was obliged to show them and have them, have the same experience that I had and it was very difficult for me to do that but I had to.</span> <span id="s601">I __________, working when you work with people in the reference and I knew exactly how they would feel when they saw the names of their loved ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Had Earnest talked to you much about that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: No, he and I, and, and perhaps that was a mistake.</span> <span id="s604">I took that for his not wanting to talk about it and I do not know whether I was correct in this assumption.</span> <span id="s605">I, I just assumed that if he wished to talk it, he would start the conversation on, on the subject and I was not going to initiate or push or, I was always there to listen if he wished to open up.</span> <span id="s606">And it was very slow in coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: And has he since?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s609">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: In the past _______________</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Oh yes, but, but not early on.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Do you feel as though you and Earnest have sort of a bond or a connection because of, your experiences are different during the war but you, you did have, were persecuted?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Yes of course, certainly, one does have such a unique bond.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Do you consider yourself a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: I am a survivor.</span> <span id="s616">But so are other people.</span> <span id="s617">I mean if you are, if you survive a fire, you’re a survivor.</span> <span id="s618">So, I mean this, the, the, the term survivor today has broadened enormously.</span> <span id="s619">And on the one hand, on the other hand, it sort of particularized by a certain group.</span> <span id="s620">So I, it’s hard to answer, do you, I think I know what you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: I was actually getting at whether you and Earnest agree on, on that term, whether you both agree whether you’re a survivor because in the classic sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Oh, you, I tell you something.</span> <span id="s623">I have found out that the people who come from Auschwitz think that that term is sort of reserved for Auschwitz survivors.</span> <span id="s624">I’ve met a lot since then and they do not consider me a survivor.</span> <span id="s625">So on people or maybe also in perhaps other of the death camps, think the same way.</span> <span id="s626">When I say Auschwitz it might include the other four, five death, extermination, I mean extermination camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Do you and Earnest disagree about that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: No, I, I, I think his experience was vastly more wrenching than mine.</span> <span id="s629">I, I mean I didn’t have to watch people hang at 12 o’clock in the morning and stay there and then maybe be called as to be shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Do you, do you ever have dreams or nightmares about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Actually, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: That’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Do, do most people that you speak, I have never asked this question, or have been asked this question so I don’t know what other people answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: The two other interviews, I remember one specifically said that he didn’t, I don’t remember about the other one.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: I asked you about how the experience affected the choices you made.</span> <span id="s637">Wondering whether it, what influence it have on your spirituality?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: I think we talked about it inasmuch as my experience showed me the goodness of people and that has, had a lasting influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: You had said when you came to America that you felt somewhat guilty, that you had, I guess left behind people, do you still have those feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: No.</span> <span id="s641">I mean the people that I left today are mostly have their own careers and is only one of the ones that I had left behind died.</span> <span id="s642">He joined the Resistance and got shot.</span> <span id="s643">All the others survived.</span> <span id="s644">Almost, I might add, strangely enough since it was very, they had very different experiences after I left.</span> <span id="s645">Very different, some went illegally to Switzerland, some went to the Resistance, some went, came illegally to Paris, went back to Paris and hid there.</span> <span id="s646">It is, it’s almost unbelievable that none of them got hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Have you ever seen, seen any of them since?</span> <span id="s648">Or spoken with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: I see them so frequently that we call, I call the, the Mafia.</span> <span id="s650">We, we, we stick together like glue.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: So there’s some in Virginia here?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: There’s, as a matter of fact, some not in Virginia but in Maryland and some in New York and, but we get together and we talk on the telephone all the time and we know of each other and we support each other and when, and there were reunions.</span> <span id="s653">We went to a reunion, I think it was ’88, I’m not mistaken, _______________ in Leshombon (ph) and there’s going to be one this year in Leshombon (ph) for the sad reason to bury Maktotottmay (ph) and so we see each other very frequently.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: And that time seems like it left a profound and lasting impression and impact on your life, that time in Leshombon (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s656">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Why do you think that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Because it’s, it’s a most unusual story.</span> <span id="s659">The, that a whole village, in fact I think it’s the only time an entire region, an entire region decided not to cooperate with the power in, of the government, to oppose the government in, in such a threatening situation to them, their own lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: You had said...</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Not such a single person.</span> <span id="s662">That happened very often.</span> <span id="s663">Not just a single family or two or three devoted citizens but an entire village and their neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: You told me at lunch that you consider yourself a pacifist.</span> <span id="s665">What, what do you think that’s, what do you think that’s an outgrowth of?</span> <span id="s666">Where did that, I mean, was that from your family or from the Quakers?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: It, it must be a combination but I just hate to see people be committed to a situation which they cannot control, it’s beyond their control.</span> <span id="s668">And in war, you give up the control of your destiny.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: You had also said that your pacifism sometimes comes into conflict with, with wars that might be just.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Yes, I’m, I have learned that I have to admit that there are times when you have to give up your individual freedom for the, for the good of a principle which is the freedom of somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: I don’t know whether I have any other questions for you?</span> <span id="s672">Is there anything else you’d wanted to say?</span> <span id="s673">Guess one of the things that I had asked you, in the questions I’d given you earlier was about the, whether you thought the experiences that you and Earnest had been through ever caused any difficulties in your relationship at all?</span> <span id="s674">It’s a tough question to answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Could you be more precise?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Well, that, that you had both been through such harrowing times that, whether you thought it meant that it was hard to get through to him or it affected your communication or that one of you didn’t want to talk about something.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: No I would related it to the past experience if we, like all people who live together for 50 years have differences of opinion, then it is more due to the change of the culture in which you live in that has occurred over those 50 years and I’m particularly referring to the change of women’s rights for instance.</span> <span id="s678">And I am for complete legality, always was, even before it was fashionable.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: __________</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: The legality of women and men, meant something to me ever since I can remember but at that time, it was sort of unusual and, and it wasn’t an issue in, in our relationship.</span> <span id="s681">However, I, now that women not only demand equal treatment but also demand, not only equal treatment before the law, but ask for equal treatment in any situation, this might constitute sometimes a point of difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: I guess my earlier question was, was sort of based on the, the phenomenon where men who’ve gone through experiences of war are, don’t like to talk about them.</span> <span id="s683">They sort of keep it very hidden and reserved and I just wondered whether that Earnest had had that with his experience and that, it result...</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: What kind of, are you thinking of something in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Oh his, well his experience at, at the concentration camp and, and not wanting to talk about that and whether that made you feel somehow like you didn’t understand a part of him, or didn’t know a part of him.</span> <span id="s686">I just wondered whether there had been any of that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Yes, I mentioned it before, that he was reluctant to talk about it.</span> <span id="s688">And I was reluctant to ask and I never knew whether he wanted me to ask first.</span> <span id="s689">And that was the difficulty, we, we really didn’t talk about that until he, he, he seemed to become a little more comfortable with the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: And why did it change?</span> <span id="s691">Why did he become more comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: I think time, time, probably.</span> <span id="s693">And then his wish to talk about it became stronger and then my, also my family encouraged him to talk about it when we visited them.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">[end of side one, tape 2]</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Did that bring you closer?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: We were very close to begin with so I don’t know.</span> <span id="s697">I don’t think you, you could say that because we were very close at the start.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Was it a positive experience that, that he began to talk and...</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Oh yes, I was very glad that he did.</span> <span id="s700">Very glad.</span> <span id="s701">Yes, it gave me a great deal of insight and well like, you might find out, you might find that asking people the things that you ask gives you an insight that you didn’t have before and adds to your knowledge of this world.</span> <span id="s702">It surely does.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: And did you discover whether it was the reason he didn’t say anything, was it because he was waiting for you to ask or?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: No, I don’t, no, I think now he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: I don’t have any other questions.</span> <span id="s706">If there’s more that you want to say, that...</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: I would have to think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Do you want to look over your notes?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: If not, that’s okay.</span> <span id="s710">Well, we were talking about, that you talk, you speak about the Holocaust a lot these days.</span> <span id="s711">Can you, can you tell me what, what it is that you do and, and how often you, you talk about your experiences?</span> <span id="s712">And you, we, we talked about before we started recording that, for a long time you didn’t talk, you didn’t discuss it much, you didn’t talk to other people and talk publicly and now, and now you do.</span> <span id="s713">Why, why is there that change?</span> <span id="s714">Why is __________ that change?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Well we have, ever since I’m working at the museum, I bring home a lot of material and also my husband has started to write his memoirs and that is probably the, the main reason, because after writing his memoirs he asks me to read them and to give my opinion and that’s how we start about.</span> <span id="s716">His memoirs by the way, are not just on the Holocaust at all, his memoirs are about his entire life which includes his very happy childhood and after the war, his experience in foreign service.</span> <span id="s717">But of course, in the middle of these happy stories, is his experience of Auschwitz and he is extremely interested anything that relates to the Holocaust and its origin.</span> <span id="s718">And so we, we come very interested in the entire question of why the question of anti-Semitism and the history of anti-Semitism and in particularly the history of anti-Semitism in Germany and Austria and in France.</span> <span id="s719">And that’s a very vast subject if you really want to get knowledgeable about it.</span> <span id="s720">The, it also refers you to things that have not disappeared and are, are, are reappearing in our days now.</span> <span id="s721">We have a very strong nationalistic party in every one of these countries, especially in France and in Austria, which is frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Do, do you feel as though it’s sort of a duty of yours, to, to speak more openly about the Holocaust and help other people understand it?</span> <span id="s723">I mean is there, do you feel as though now you have more of a, kind of a mission, or that there’s more of a need?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yes, because we are dying out.</span> <span id="s725">The people who can testify.</span> <span id="s726">There are very few left and each time you talk about a subject, one or more details come up that have not come up before, which might be helpful in writing this history.</span> <span id="s727">As an example, I just learned two days ago about a happening that might be interesting to mention in this connection.</span> <span id="s728">In, there was the, the big question in France was why the was the village of Leshombon (ph) spared and we never had really an answer and I don’t think that there is an answer right now either that is hundred percent.</span> <span id="s729">But one of our colleagues was caught by the French police and put into a bus in order that he be transported into a camp or we didn’t know where of course.</span> <span id="s730">And he was all of a sudden released.</span> <span id="s731">And of course he jumped from the bus and disappeared but the, we all had theories on why this had happened and his theory was is because he was so young, he was 12 years at the time.</span> <span id="s732">And the answer appeared two days ago, it wasn’t at all because he was too young, because as we know now, very young children were brought into concentration camps.</span> <span id="s733">It was because the mayor of the city had written to Pitton (ph) saying that the children, the Jewish children of Leshombon (ph) have, are under the protection of the Swiss.</span> <span id="s734">Sicroa (ph) Swiss.</span> <span id="s735">And therefore cannot be touched.</span> <span id="s736">He had never received an answer but apparently this was noted by the authorities.</span> <span id="s737">They must have just of notified the police there and the little boy was left.</span> <span id="s738">This note, this letter by the mayor became known only very recently when the archives of the Red Cross, Swiss Red Cross was finally made available which was very recently.</span> <span id="s739">And I expect that such incidences will come up daily now that the archives of, of the former Soviet Union, the archives from all over the occupied countries where the German Gestapo was the government, are coming up now.</span> <span id="s740">And they had been hidden before.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: How old is your grandchild?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: She’s 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: She’s 20?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Have you talked to her about...</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: How old was she then?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Oh, I wouldn’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: What did you tell her?</span></p> <p><span
