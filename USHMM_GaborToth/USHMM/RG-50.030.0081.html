me your full name and when and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My name is Antoni Golba.</span> <span id="s12">I was born on November 7, 1918 in Stockniytza (ph), Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Tell me a little bit about your childhood and the town where you grew up.</span> <span id="s14">Tell me what it was like and what your parents did?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: My father was manager of the town Administration Office.</span> <span id="s16">My mother was a housewife.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">We were brought up in special circumstances in that city of Stockniytza (ph).</span> <span id="s18">We inhabited mostly, I would say, in 85 percent by Jewish people.</span> <span id="s19">So, we had contacts every day in every situation, most of all with Jewish people.</span> <span id="s20">My father, on account of his functions in the Office of Administration, dealt with a businessman regarding taxations, all kinds of permits for commerce, permits for trade, and in addition they had some contacts outside of the office.</span> <span id="s21">They used to know -- because they used to go to school together with Jewish people, like my mother.</span> <span id="s22">She was always, even after she got married, she had Jewish friends with whom they used to sew some clothing, fixing decorations at home.</span> <span id="s23">They used to live across the street, so they would for a cup of tea or something like that it was a very common thing.</span> <span id="s24">They saw each other once a day.</span> <span id="s25">Naturally, at that time, I was maybe less than four or five years old, so I didn't realize what was going on, but I took it for granted that that's the way it should be and nothing is unusual about it.</span> <span id="s26">Then at school I met also a number of Jewish friends, boys and girls, and particularly with one .</span> <span id="s27">We shared one school bench for a number of years.</span> <span id="s28">For five years we are sitting next to each other and, of course, very friendly, as a rule, but occasionally little fights, nothing harmful really.</span> <span id="s29">On top of this, one day we decided that we like music.</span> <span id="s30">So, we started taking lessons on the violin by the same teacher.</span> <span id="s31">Since then, we participated in all kinds of school activities, concerts, plays, etc., next to each other.</span> <span id="s32">That was going around until the year in high school, we separated.</span> <span id="s33">We went a little bit different ways, because we were getting older and you know had different friends, but still friendly, still playing together.</span> <span id="s34">I used to go to his house and we used to play duets, classical music, naturally.</span> <span id="s35">We liked it very much.</span> <span id="s36">I liked his home very much, very nice people.</span> <span id="s37">His father was a lawyer, very well known lawyer.</span> <span id="s38">Unfortunately, he was blind, but that, of course, it didn't mean anything for me or anybody.</span> <span id="s39">He was still one of the best lawyers in the town.</span> <span id="s40">We graduated from the high school in 1936 and it was starting to make a decision to what profession to take and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s41">So, my father -- originally I wanted to go and study music, but my father said no, it's no good, because you're not going to earn any money.</span> <span id="s42">After all, I wasn't anything outstanding, I mean like talent, but I thought I was but my father said, no, you go study accounting and that's the way you will survive this situation.</span> <span id="s43">Sruleck (ph), he decided to study medicine.</span> <span id="s44">At that time, also, there was some liberal art courses, more advanced than what we had at our high school, and he had to take some of them to pass the entrance examination to start the medical studies.</span> <span id="s45">That was the last time, in 1939, that I saw him.</span> <span id="s46">After that I lost completely track -- I tried very much through friends in this country, in Israel, in Poland, but nobody knows what happened to him.</span> <span id="s47">He was a very good friend, one of the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: He went to Warsaw?</span> <span id="s49">That's where he went?</span> <span id="s50">A: That was before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Before the war.</span> <span id="s53">He started -- he took several liberal art courses between 1937 and 1938 with certain interruptions.</span> <span id="s54">I don't remember exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Was your family religious, very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s57">My mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s58">My father was very religious too.</span> <span id="s59">He was a member of Parish choir, he had a very good voice, base, and he was participating in all kinds of ceremonies, church events, stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Tell me about the baker you knew named Hiam Gorskey (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Well, Hiam Gorskey, he was actually a baker, but at the same time he was a council man.</span> <span id="s62">So, my father knew him.</span> <span id="s63">He had sort of a business contact with him, but nevertheless, he was extremely friendly and he liked me over a hundred of other children, he liked me.</span> <span id="s64">He used to come to our place.</span> <span id="s65">I used to sit on his knees and play with his beard.</span> <span id="s66">And he liked that very much.</span> <span id="s67">Of course he had some cookies with him.</span> <span id="s68">There was no question of bribery or anything like that.</span> <span id="s69">It was simply I liked him.</span> <span id="s70">I liked to play with his beard and I liked his products, his baking.</span> <span id="s71">His bagels the best in the world as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s72">Of course, at that time he could have been in his sixties, and I don't know what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Tell me what happened when the Germans invaded Poland, in your personal memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Tell me what you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: That was September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s76">I happened to -- I meant to go on a bicycle from one place to another from to Busko because I was involved in some Scouts organization so I wanted to see what was going on in Busko.</span> <span id="s77">After all, it was a very important day, and going by it's like a highway, not particularly -- the traffic was not too heavy, actually it was nothing really, but what I noticed and that made a very important impression on me.</span> <span id="s78">I saw an older woman with a cow in the meadow, not very far from the highway with a little child.</span> <span id="s79">The child was playing probably with flowers and she was probably a grandmother because she was in her sixties.</span> <span id="s80">All of a sudden an airplane came, German, and the German lowered his flight very much and started shooting at that cow, at that woman, at that child.</span> <span id="s81">Naturally in no time he killed everything, the cow, the woman and the child.</span> <span id="s82">And he kept coming back and he was shooting.</span> <span id="s83">I mean he probably went in some kind of hysteria I should say because no sane person would do that.</span> <span id="s84">It was extremely cruel, and I was so shaken by that.</span> <span id="s85">We heard so much about Germans, you know, how they were going to treat us and everything, but to such an extent.</span> <span id="s86">When I arrived to the place that I was supposed to go, I told them the story.</span> <span id="s87">Everybody they didn't believe me, but later on they had the proof because someone told them the same story that there was reckless shooting of innocent people, you know, just like this particular one.</span> <span id="s88">That was one event.</span> <span id="s89">Later on, I joined the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s90">I actually was not drafted, and actually I was waiting to be drafted, but everything was so sudden and the administration was mixed up, everything was collapsing, the administration.</span> <span id="s91">Anyway, I volunteered.</span> <span id="s92">I joined the Army, a certain unit which conducted some skirmishes in Bathos, in the Eastern part of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: That would be in about the middle of September.</span> <span id="s95">Q: 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: 1939, right.</span> <span id="s97">Everything was interrupted the hostilities were in that particular area because not very far the Russians crossed the Polish border on the 17th of September and of course, we never expected something like that.</span> <span id="s98">We were not prepared for that.</span> <span id="s99">We understood that we had one enemy.</span> <span id="s100">That was Germany, and that they were going to invade us and probably destroy as much as possible, but all of a sudden, at that time, we didn't know what actually was in that agreement, and that was the story, to participate to divide Poland into two spheres of interest.</span> <span id="s101">Then everything stopped, so the Polish units, some of them were able to go south to Hungary or Romania.</span> <span id="s102">You know, they were taken there as not exactly prisoners or war, but they were isolated and kept.</span> <span id="s103">Eventually they let them go home, but in my case I decided to return home.</span> <span id="s104">Unfortunately, of course, there was a surprise.</span> <span id="s105">I was taken prisoner by Germans and I stayed.</span> <span id="s106">I was in a prison camp for a couple of hours and I decided not to stay there any longer so I took advantage of a guard that was not paying attention to what was going on, so I escaped.</span> <span id="s107">I returned home to to my parent's place at the beginning of October.</span> <span id="s108">That was my end of the struggle, the unofficial war with Germany and the unofficial war started then.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Now, in the early German decrees against Jews in your town, and you and your family tried to help, is that right?</span> <span id="s110">Can you tell me what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: In 1939 there was a panic.</span> <span id="s112">Of course we expected things to come because the fear that we are going to destroy you, everybody is going to -- we need this room, we need that room for our German people.</span> <span id="s113">We are growing now.</span> <span id="s114">My assignment is to extend Germany as far east as possible so we'll destroy you Poles and Jews and everybody has to go.</span> <span id="s115">We knew that there is nothing good coming.</span> <span id="s116">And of course, they need the manpower for work, so they were arresting a lot of Polish young people, men and women, and sending them to forced labor camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s117">It wasn't concentration camps, yet, just forced labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">They used to work on farms or in factories.</span> <span id="s119">As far as Jews are concerned, they were very restricted.</span> <span id="s120">They couldn't change their place of residence.</span> <span id="s121">They couldn't move, they couldn't communicate, letters or stuff like that.</span> <span id="s122">They would have to be controlled by the German officials.</span> <span id="s123">Every little thing you have to apply to the County which was, of course, in charge by the Germans.</span> <span id="s124">The Germans were in charge.</span> <span id="s125">You had to get permission for everything, for food, for everything.</span> <span id="s126">For clothing, there was a shortage of clothing, naturally.</span> <span id="s127">There was a shortage of food.</span> <span id="s128">And, of course, from time to time they demanded from Jewish people to surrender some valuable things in an official or unofficial way, like bribes, you know, trying to get a permit for something, so it cost in the form of gold or something valuable.</span> <span id="s129">Those restrictions, they couldn't move from one place to another.</span> <span id="s130">In that situation, many young people, Jewish people, people say 20 and up, they knew what was going to happen, so they decided to run away from that situation.</span> <span id="s131">The Polish partisans started organizing so they joined them in the forest, or they simply moved to another place with false identification documents.</span> <span id="s132">The one case I remember, the next door people his name Shpinrot(ph) had a daughter about 18 years old, Mauka Spinrot, she actually was a friend of one of my brothers, so we talked her into accepting a forged i.d. card, like a passport.</span> <span id="s133">I mean, it had more value than just an ordinary i.d. card.</span> <span id="s134">It was like a passport, showing all the details, names the date of birth, religion, her age, and something like that.</span> <span id="s135">So, we issued the card for Makur (ph) I believe, a Polish name, and of course, Roman Catholic and everything.</span> <span id="s136">So, she took that.</span> <span id="s137">They were very grateful for this and she volunteered for the forced labor camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s138">So, this way the Germans treated as one of Poles and no questions asked.</span> <span id="s139">I'm not sure because I wasn't there, but I'm sure that she survived.</span> <span id="s140">This was the first case I remember.</span> <span id="s141">After that, we started doing this more often.</span> <span id="s142">Of course, my people, I belonged to the underground organization.</span> <span id="s143">That was the organization before , and of course they wanted to know everything and of course they were helping and all that.</span> <span id="s144">They liked the idea because we kept stealing the forms just for the i.d. cards and giving them to the whole county.</span> <span id="s145">So, I am sure that quite a number of Jewish people got those forged i.d. cards and they were able to move around to survive.</span> <span id="s146">I'm sure about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: So, mostly what you did was steal the i.d. cards, and other people did the forgery?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s149">I mean I could never, writing, some of them were dark.</span> <span id="s150">Some of them were typed.</span> <span id="s151">There was a seal to be applied to that kind and the signature of the chrishelpman(ph) the guy in charge of the county, the German fellow.</span> <span id="s152">So, they had specialist that could fix that.</span> <span id="s153">They looked like original, there was no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: In the Polish underground that you were in at that time, were there also Jews in that group?</span> <span id="s155">Did the Poles and Jews work together in the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: If I remember correctly, we used to send, because there were some partisans, I mean not very much activity there because they were just organizing everything, so we sent some young fellow, at least two people to join that partisans group, because they were good soldiers.</span> <span id="s157">I believe they used to be in the Army.</span> <span id="s158">The rule was two years in the Army.</span> <span id="s159">They were very well trained soldiers, intelligent guys, so I think we were doing very well there with Polish partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: You had a lot of Jewish friends, your family did, but did the other Roman Catholics in the town try to help the Jews too?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Oh, yes, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s162">It was like everybody had one favorite Jew, a family or one -- like say, my mother, my father, they had a family.</span> <span id="s163">Anyway, he was the owner of a hardware store, so we started buying stuff and then the friendship developed gradually.</span> <span id="s164">Other people and actually we were new in that place in .</span> <span id="s165">Before the war I think my father was transferred from other place in 1937, so we were not able to know too many people but they accepted us.</span> <span id="s166">I mean, after all, my father was proved that he was an extremely good man.</span> <span id="s167">He was self-taught, my God, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s168">He could do anything for anybody.</span> <span id="s169">So, naturally we were helping people.</span> <span id="s170">The people who were well off like the owners of stores, food stores or hardware stores or clothing stores, they were well off people so they were able to disappear simply from that place.</span> <span id="s171">They used to hide in different places, some villages, but their main belongings, their most valuable things they used to -- they left everything with us.</span> <span id="s172">They used to come at night, to pick up some parts of clothing or money to buy or we used to buy medicine for them and at night they used to come and pick up the medicine.</span> <span id="s173">What else was there.</span> <span id="s174">Food, even shoes.</span> <span id="s175">I remember we got a pair of shoes for a , because it was winter and he needed a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s176">So we bought, with his money.</span> <span id="s177">We kept his money.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: What were you risking by doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: A death because that was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s180">At first, we just couldn't believe that such a thing is possible.</span> <span id="s181">I mean it's an innocent thing to help to buy some food for somebody.</span> <span id="s182">This situation is tragic.</span> <span id="s183">We were scared because --especially after they closed for Jews and they prepared -- they moved them from to another bigger place to Ghetto.</span> <span id="s184">This was another thing.</span> <span id="s185">I witnessed, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s186">I remember the beatings the old men, the old women, children.</span> <span id="s187">They were reckless.</span> <span id="s188">Those Germans were like animals.</span> <span id="s189">Of course, the bastards, they even -- first of all the beatings were one thing, but then the searching for valuables.</span> <span id="s190">If somebody, of course they assumed since he's a merchant, a well off merchant, he must have something of value hidden, some gold or other stuff.</span> <span id="s191">So, they were crazy, searching the whole place was turned upside down and with beatings and kicking, shootings.</span> <span id="s192">They assembled everybody on the market place.</span> <span id="s193">I am talking about one particular day when they decided to move them to the Ghetto, to a bigger place.</span> <span id="s194">That was a terrible thing I will never forget.</span> <span id="s195">So much blood, I better not talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Where were you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: I was hidden on the roof on one of the buildings.</span> <span id="s198">We just observed everything that was going on in the market place, you know, down below and I saw many things.</span> <span id="s199">And then somebody, people who were closer, they were watching all of this from a shorter distance on the ground or say next door neighbors.</span> <span id="s200">So we collected, for our organization we wanted to have a report of what was done to people on that particular day and so we prepared a written report to the , how this particular procedure was performed in the place of .</span> <span id="s201">It was early in April 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Was there a round up and they were taking them away?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yes, they formed a column, women, men, children, and they were marching to the next place about I would say about twenty miles away on foot so that there was a lot of old people, of course, they were sick old people.</span> <span id="s204">They were dying like flies so that was a terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Did the people who were being rounded up try to fight?</span> <span id="s206">A: No, they were taken by surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: The Germans came with guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Naturally, they surrounded the place.</span> <span id="s209">The best they had, the troops, the SS.</span> <span id="s210">They were quite experienced in those things and very well trained and they hated everybody so naturally that was a reflection.</span> <span id="s211">They were just behaving exactly the way they were asked to behave.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: So, after that, most of the Jews were gone?</span> <span id="s213">A: All of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: All of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: All of them, because that was the idea, to clean the place from Jews because of the Ghettos, organization of Ghettos.</span> <span id="s216">They moved them, I think to Kyertza (ph), which is about 50 miles from Shedowuf (ph).</span> <span id="s217">So, you can imagine what happened to that column.</span> <span id="s218">I don't know, in that column could have been 1,000 people originally.</span> <span id="s219">If 500 reached that destination, maybe more, maybe 600, but the rest small children, no food, no nothing.</span> <span id="s220">I know because I was in an evacuation like that in 1945 from one camp to another, so I know how it goes.</span> <span id="s221">No food, just shooting, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: But it wasn't executions?</span> <span id="s223">A: There were executions.</span> <span id="s224">Q: There were?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: It was not like executions -- let's say he didn't like the color of your hair or something like that, or in many cases there were quite a lot of old people, in their seventies or eighties, sick, old sick people so they couldn't move.</span> <span id="s226">They couldn't leave the house to the assembly place.</span> <span id="s227">They couldn't go there because they were simply sick and not able to move.</span> <span id="s228">So, they were shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s229">On the bed, on the sofa, whatever, they were shot and that's all.</span> <span id="s230">They didn't bother -- and after they left, so naturally the town people had to clean the mess.</span> <span id="s231">So, naturally they had to bury the dead people, to put them together in one place.</span> <span id="s232">It was quite a procedure.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: How did that affect the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: It was a terrible thing, because we had a taste of things to come.</span> <span id="s235">They used to say, "Oh my God.</span> <span id="s236">Today they are taking care of Jews.</span> <span id="s237">Tomorrow they will come to pick up and start the same thing with us.”</span> <span id="s238">Everyone was convinced that this was going to happen like.</span> <span id="s239">Young people, as a rule left the house.</span> <span id="s240">They were no longer with their parents.</span> <span id="s241">I left the house.</span> <span id="s242">I was not in my parent's house.</span> <span id="s243">I used to sleep two blocks away in a different place.</span> <span id="s244">Every young fellow at that time, just after this, there was no room, no place for young people.</span> <span id="s245">Many of them moved to another city.</span> <span id="s246">Some of them they joined the partisans.</span> <span id="s247">What good was that?</span> <span id="s248">I was there because I was told to stay there because of the organization.</span> <span id="s249">I was responsible for a number of things, and of course, I was hiding but acting.</span> <span id="s250">Gradually things were quieting down, gradually, so I got a job.</span> <span id="s251">There was some of the stores, old, formerly owned by Jewish people.</span> <span id="s252">They were opened, but that was the government's property, but they still need people to service.</span> <span id="s253">In addition, there was a system of distribution of food that especially applied to farmers, the compulsory reporting of agricultural production, what each farmer produced, corn or potatoes or whatever.</span> <span id="s254">So, he had to report this, and he had a certain portion, actually the majority of what he produced had to give to the Germans because they need food for them.</span> <span id="s255">As a bonus for this, they used to give coupons to buy some hardware on a farm, stuff like that, ordinary nails, anything, some food stuff, or clothing.</span> <span id="s256">So, they distribute for the produce delivered to the Germans, grain or potatoes or anything, they used to get those coupons so they could get the clothing or anything.</span> <span id="s257">It was something like extra -- of course the prices, they paid very little for it.</span> <span id="s258">The official price was something unbelievable, low.</span> <span id="s259">On the Black Market the price of meat or bread was much higher than what you could get officially.</span> <span id="s260">The official price was low.</span> <span id="s261">So, to compensate for this, they issued those coupons to make them more willing to deliver that food stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: While you worked in the shoe store you were still part of the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s264">I was told you stay there because many things were going on at that time.</span> <span id="s265">The organization started growing.</span> <span id="s266">Training was intensifying.</span> <span id="s267">There were a lot of things to be done.</span> <span id="s268">We needed room, place for people who used to come from the organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Special messages, so it used -- it was necessary to have a place like that so I was told to stay there and be in charge of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: So you mostly hid people?</span> <span id="s271">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: What about weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Weapons.</span> <span id="s274">We started collecting weapons in 1939 as soon the hostilities stopped in October after I returned home, we started looking for whatever was left.</span> <span id="s275">Because in the area there was a couple of battles that were Polish forces were defeated because they were not well organized.</span> <span id="s276">They were not strong enough, so anyway they lost a battle here, a battle there.</span> <span id="s277">So, the weapons were left on the field, so we decided to collect those weapons and ammunition and keep this and clean it, maintain it until the proper time will come and we'll eventually make use of it.</span> <span id="s278">So we were cleaning them.</span> <span id="s279">There were special sections who were doing just this, cleaning the weapons.</span> <span id="s280">Maintenance, hiding this in certain areas.</span> <span id="s281">It was quite a big job.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Then you got caught sometime in 1943.</span> <span id="s283">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Before I got caught, there were many things, -- this place Shidoweouf (ph)_ got a very bad name as far as Germans were concerned.</span> <span id="s285">They kept coming.</span> <span id="s286">They were searching for illegal weapons, food, illegal food, meat, stuff like this.</span> <span id="s287">It was a center of very unfriendly activities as far as Germans were concerned, so they didn't like that place very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Constantly young people, there were a lot of young people there, mostly university students, like on a vacation.</span> <span id="s289">It was 1939, so they were not able to return to school, because the schools were closed.</span> <span id="s290">Like one family Mr. Kacherofsky, he was the principal of the elementary school.</span> <span id="s291">He was a very well known person.</span> <span id="s292">He had three sons, each of them was a student, one was studying chemistry.</span> <span id="s293">One was a pharmacist I think, and one was medicine.</span> <span id="s294">They wanted to get those young fellows, arrest them, because it is obvious if they are young, and they used to serve in the Polish Army, they are reservists, so naturally they are no good.</span> <span id="s295">So, what they did just a couple of weeks before they got me, they surrounded, they had a very nice a sort of a house with farm buildings, because they had a little farm, they surrounded this and they started shooting without asking.</span> <span id="s296">So, they killed Mr. Kacherofsky, the principal of the school, his wife, and his wife's sister, and there were only two young sons there in the house, but one was able to escape from this.</span> <span id="s297">In spite of the fact that there was a ring.</span> <span id="s298">So, the house was burning.</span> <span id="s299">The father was dead.</span> <span id="s300">The mother was dead.</span> <span id="s301">The aunt was dead, and the oldest son, the student of chemistry is dead.</span> <span id="s302">One of them escaped, so this way they destroyed the whole family.</span> <span id="s303">And of course, there was not even a mention or a suspicion that they were helping Jews.</span> <span id="s304">They had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s305">They probably were, but officially later on they simply wanted those young fellows, because they were Poles, nothing else, and valuable, intelligent, promising, young fellows, so they wanted to destroy them.</span> <span id="s306">That was one family.</span> <span id="s307">Another family on the other side of the city in similar way they surrounded it.</span> <span id="s308">They burned down the whole thing, and thank God, as I mentioned before, no young fellow was staying in his original place of residence.</span> <span id="s309">He was hiding some place.</span> <span id="s310">So that was very intensified action against Polish young fellows.</span> <span id="s311">So, no doubt that the Gestapo knew about my activities.</span> <span id="s312">I mean after all, so many things happened.</span> <span id="s313">So many i.d. cards were issued, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s314">There is something not very clear going on in that area where he works, so why don't we get him.</span> <span id="s315">So that's why June 12, 1943, they came.</span> <span id="s316">They surrounded the store, and they took me and my friend.</span> <span id="s317">We were together.</span> <span id="s318">He also was hiding.</span> <span id="s319">Actually his father was a couple months before arrested and taken to Auschwitz and they already knew that he was killed in Auscwitz.</span> <span id="s320">I met him, I was in Warsaw in April, 1943.</span> <span id="s321">That was the Jewish Ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s322">I remember hearing the battles going on at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: You were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No, I didn't participate but we just knew that something was going on.</span> <span id="s325">That exactly was going on, the uprising of Jews in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s326">So, I took this young fellow, a friend of mine, and I brought him to my place and said you have no place to go so you'll stay with me.</span> <span id="s327">It wasn't very long that the Gestapo came and just took us, him and myself, and that was the end of my being a salesman in the hardware store.</span> <span id="s328">It wasn't too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: I think that I want to go back and ask you to tell me what you know, tell me as if I never heard of the Polish Home Army.</span> <span id="s330">Tell me what you knew of the organization, how wide spread it was.</span> <span id="s331">What kind of things you heard that were going on nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Well, it started right after the end of hostilities in October 1939.</span> <span id="s333">I have a feeling -- it's a very well known fact that they were prepared for things, for the defeat, because after all, the Germans were very well prepared and we are a poor nation.</span> <span id="s334">We were not able to be prepared to such an extent as Germans were.</span> <span id="s335">So, they made plans for underground activities because they were hoping that the Allies in the West, England and France would definitely help.</span> <span id="s336">Sooner or later, we'll have to be prepared, officially if the Army is no longer in existence at least underground is active.</span> <span id="s337">So, they started organizing right away, 1940.</span> <span id="s338">On two levels, first of all the most important level was the military preparation.</span> <span id="s339">And the other level was the civil administration because they had to keep a network of people for the administration in case of the German occupation will collapse we'll have to take it over.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Did everyone know about it then and how did you find out about it and how was communication take place?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Well, one day in , men I used to know when I used to go to high school, came and he says that he reprsents the underground organization would I be willing to join that.</span> <span id="s342">Things are -- with my background because I was active in boy scouts for all my life.</span> <span id="s343">I was a boy scout, scout master at the very end.</span> <span id="s344">Military preparation and training, so you will have to join us and help us.</span> <span id="s345">So, I agreed, and I had to be sworn in and originally we started with a small unit like I'd say 85 people that we could know of each other.</span> <span id="s346">The first assignment was just to take care of the weapons, prepare the weapons, hide them and keep them.</span> <span id="s347">That was quite an extensive activity and many people were involved in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Another area was training.</span> <span id="s349">Of course other guys like say myself I was about 22 years old at the time, so I didn't have to be trained, but I had to be an instructor in a little group of say ten young fellows.</span> <span id="s350">I had to train them.</span> <span id="s351">Later on I was asked to join the officers group because I wasn't an officer.</span> <span id="s352">So, I took part in the training of that underground officers school.</span> <span id="s353">Of course we had lectures.</span> <span id="s354">We had all kinds of assignments outside in the woods.</span> <span id="s355">All kinds of instructors, professional officers from the Polish Army, experts on explosives.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: How did your group communicate with other groups?</span> <span id="s357">How did you find out what else was going on and how long were you training the small group you had; a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: That was training after the level of sergeant, but I was there about six months maybe, and in my school I was about seven, eight months, at the officers school.</span> <span id="s359">Of course, that was in hiding.</span> <span id="s360">We are meeting -- only once I remember they decided to do some exercises in the field so we met, about twenty people there.</span> <span id="s361">Some of them friends, some of them from different areas, from different cities, but anyway no more than that.</span> <span id="s362">Besides the assignment was to concentrate on the communications to interrupt communications, to destroy telephone communication, to destroy some of the bridges.</span> <span id="s363">So we concentrated on the explosives, theory and some exercises with the real stuff, but not too much because it was very expensive and dangerous.</span> <span id="s364">It was dangerous, so we kept this to the minimum.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">We took part in the organized group we took part in certain things like I mentioned that the compulsory collection of the farm products, of the registers.</span> <span id="s366">Each small city had a register, extensive control of the people, of the farmers, of the amounts of farm products to be delivered.</span> <span id="s367">There was official record of that and they kept that in those offices in the administration of the cities.</span> <span id="s368">So, at one point, the underground authorities decided to destroy all of this just to show that the Germans will be helpless in case like that.</span> <span id="s369">They lose control of what was delivered, what is supposed to be delivered.</span> <span id="s370">They lost control of it so we worked on that systematically.</span> <span id="s371">We are destroying, and it worked very well, because people were able to hide more food for themselves.</span> <span id="s372">The Germans started panicking because so little food was delivered.</span> <span id="s373">OF course the communication, the communication was a very important thing in a case like that.</span> <span id="s374">We had our own communication between cities, so in other words, we knew in advance that the Gestapo is coming to our place.</span> <span id="s375">But the official way, there was no telephone because we destroyed the telephone connections.</span> <span id="s376">But we knew because we had our own networks.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Let's go back and talk about the communication and how you knew the Gestapo was coming?</span> <span id="s380">How did the communications get to you?</span> <span id="s381">---</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: We had a person working for the Post Office, the local Post Office.</span> <span id="s383">She was my future sister-in-law, and she was a member of my group, and at the same time she was in contact with a similar person working in a place in Hymernick (ph), which is about 18 miles away, and it was the headquarters of German police.</span> <span id="s384">So, of course, every movement of the police was observed and they have some people who were interested in knowing what they were planning to do next, where they were planning to go.</span> <span id="s385">So, there was a connection, and the intelligence knew roughly, I mean in most cases they know where they are going and when and so they would notify the person working in the Post Office in Hymernick (ph), who in turn would call our Zosha (ph), my sister-in-law and she would know in say half an hour they will be here so get ready.</span> <span id="s386">She would send a message on a bike.</span> <span id="s387">My younger brother used to come to me and then we spreading, used other people, so we used to disappear from the place for the duration of that visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Tell me what your parents knew about what you were doing and what they thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Well, my parents, of course, they knew that I was involved in something, especially early in 1939 and early 1940 because some strangers were coming, people they didn't know from my organization used to visit me on special assignments.</span> <span id="s390">I used to disappear for a number of days.</span> <span id="s391">So, naturally at home there were always questions, where have you been.</span> <span id="s392">You better watch out.</span> <span id="s393">This is not good.</span> <span id="s394">You'll have to pay for this one day.</span> <span id="s395">Be careful.</span> <span id="s396">So, they knew quite well.</span> <span id="s397">Of course, I wasn't going to tell them the details, obviously I am involved and I should actually -- you should give me your blessings not to criticize me on that.</span> <span id="s398">My parents understood and they were 100 percent behind me.</span> <span id="s399">My father, naturally, was very much affected by what was going on because the Gestapo used to come a couple of times a month, at the beginning especially, and they used to call him and they used to ask him questions about my activities before I got arrested, naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">They wanted to simply to coordinate things which they know with what was happening, but of course, my father didn't tell them anything.</span> <span id="s401">But he paid, with his health forms, because this was too much tension, too much aggravation, and he was suffering from some heart problems, and eventually he had a heart attack in 1945.</span> <span id="s402">He couldn't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s403">So, that was -- my mother survived, she was probably physically stronger and was able to survive that.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Tell me about your arrest.</span> <span id="s405">Why were you arrested, do you think, in 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: After the war, I met some of my friends, we used to work together in those areas and they told-- nobody knew exactly why.</span> <span id="s407">Of course, there were notes that men with my age, my background, he will be involved in something so why not take him away.</span> <span id="s408">At least it will be quiet here.</span> <span id="s409">This is a trouble maker, a typical trouble maker.</span> <span id="s410">Get rid of him.</span> <span id="s411">Let's get rid of him.</span> <span id="s412">I had all kinds of ideas and thoughts, especially when I was interrogated in Prison, by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s413">At one point, the man in charge of the interrogations said "Listen, don't be stupid.</span> <span id="s414">We know everything about you, about your activities, particularly you did a very bad thing.</span> <span id="s415">You helped Jews.</span> <span id="s416">You issued i.d. cards to Jews.</span> <span id="s417">In that next room, next door here, is a group of Jews, young fellows from Shedoweouf who told me everything about you, how many cards you issued.</span> <span id="s418">Just tell me and we'll finish this," he tried to be funny, "I'm sure you'll like to go rest a little bit.</span> <span id="s419">I am tired myself, so let's have it.”</span> <span id="s420">I said, "No, I don't know.”</span> <span id="s421">But I was seriously shaken by that, that next door he had a couple of Jews that could support his suspicion.</span> <span id="s422">But I said no, definitely no.</span> <span id="s423">I don't know anybody Jews, no nothing.</span> <span id="s424">Don't bother me about Jews.</span> <span id="s425">I hate Jews.</span> <span id="s426">And that was the end.</span> <span id="s427">There was nobody next door.</span> <span id="s428">Nobody, no Jews, no nothing.</span> <span id="s429">It was just one of his tricks, trying to get something out of me.</span> <span id="s430">They repeated the same thing in Auschwitz, because the case was continued.</span> <span id="s431">That was say about July 1943.</span> <span id="s432">They moved us to Auschwitz in September.</span> <span id="s433">Of course, the file went with me as a case, not like any other average prisoner, but a prisoner with a case of helping Jews.</span> <span id="s434">They used to call me in Auschwitz a couple of times.</span> <span id="s435">I got a little Chinese torture in Auschwitz, but of course, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s436">I didn't tell them anything because I knew for sure that that was bologna.</span> <span id="s437">They didn't have those particular people that we helped.</span> <span id="s438">So I was sort of secure as far as this was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: When you were in prison there in , they interrogated you on and off during that whole three month period?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Mostly their question was were you helping Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Membership in the illegal organization, underground organization and banditry, and helping Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: When they interrogated you they tortured you and they threatened you?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yes, well it started with a simple beating with a rubber hose down in on my behind.</span> <span id="s445">That was an opening in each case, it was just a little introduction.</span> <span id="s446">Then you get up, one guy was particularly interested, a powerful man, he used to hit me in my ear.</span> <span id="s447">He liked my right ear.</span> <span id="s448">He used to hit me so many times and of course I don't hear any more in that ear.</span> <span id="s449">That was the end of it.</span> <span id="s450">Then another interesting approach was to put my fingers into the door.</span> <span id="s451">They used to squeeze, ask me question and press the door to try to close it.</span> <span id="s452">Naturally it destroyed, I used to play violin, as I probably mentioned before, and after that, even after I recovered reasonably well, I couldn't play violin because I had no touch here in those three fingers there.</span> <span id="s453">And of course I lost three or four teeth, that was in , and they beat my -- another, beating testicles.</span> <span id="s454">They used that at the beginning of September.</span> <span id="s455">I remember that because when the preparation for a transport for Auschwitz came my testicles were the size of a soccer ball and when we were in the yard waiting to move to the train, I couldn't move because it was so heavy I had to hold my hand like a basketball or something.</span> <span id="s456">They were very swollen.</span> <span id="s457">I thought I would probably die on my way to Auschwitz, but somehow I didn't.</span> <span id="s458">In Auschwitz I, not at first, with all this I went to it's not exactly a hospital but something like first aid station.</span> <span id="s459">So, they gave me some pills and they sent me to work naturally.</span> <span id="s460">I was able to -- I met a friend from my high school and he was working at that particular first aid station, and he helped me to get into the hospital for my testicles to perform some surgery or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: No, he was Polish.</span> <span id="s463">He got me into that hospital and they performed I think they call it puncture (ph) or something, drawing that fluid or infection, that subsided a bit but I had always trouble with this area.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: When you were in prison in what did they say if you had given up and given them information, did they say they would release you?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: No, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: So, you knew if you talked you would be killed anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s468">Well, besides, that was impossible.</span> <span id="s469">I was prepared to die.</span> <span id="s470">There was no question about it.</span> <span id="s471">Things were going very bad.</span> <span id="s472">So, when I was so sick, what's the difference, you die today or in a week, or two days.</span> <span id="s473">I was very, very sick.</span> <span id="s474">Infection here, infection in the back, my kidneys were not working right.</span> <span id="s475">The fingers are bothering me.</span> <span id="s476">I'm not hearing nothing, so what's the use.</span> <span id="s477">Here I lost two or three teeth in , later in Auschwitz I lost another four, so what's the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: When you knew that you were going to be taken to Auschwitz did you know what Auschwitz was?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: How did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: It was a very well known fact in the underground press actually there were some people taken to Auschwitz on previous occasions from our neighborhood, so they stayed there for a month or two maybe and all of a sudden a notification would come that he got a heart attack or something like that, he died.</span> <span id="s482">So, I knew, of course, with the background with the underground papers, we knew everything, what to expect.</span> <span id="s483">In may cases that meant just the end.</span> <span id="s484">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: So, tell me how you got transported there and how you got registered there and you were in a block with other political prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Well, there was a mixture, well, when I arrived there naturally you have to see a show, they produced for you, not so much Germans, but the prisoners in many cases are criminals.</span> <span id="s487">We had red triangle, they had green triangle, mostly German criminals and some of them -- in most cases German criminals they got the best jobs there were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s488">You know, like copo, or block elder stuff like that.</span> <span id="s489">So, everytime a transport came, they used to show what they know what they can do with you.</span> <span id="s490">With of course a huge sticks they used to beat everybody and I mean first of all there was the that means the bathroom.</span> <span id="s491">There were some unbelievable things going there too.</span> <span id="s492">A lot of beatings an stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Did you go on a big train though with others?</span> <span id="s494">A: Yes, in a cattle train.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: In a cattle train, and were there Jews on the train, too?</span> <span id="s496">Had they deported a big huge group of people at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: No, I don't know.</span> <span id="s498">In that particular -- you see every transport is detailed, is marked, the date.</span> <span id="s499">The reason I know is I asked -- they have a museum in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s500">I asked for a certificate to prove that I was there.</span> <span id="s501">On that certificate it says it was a transport from Radom (ph).</span> <span id="s502">It's Warsaw, Radom (ph), Kiertza (ph), and then Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s503">In other words, there was a number of people from Radom (ph).</span> <span id="s504">It could have been Jews because there was plenty of room.</span> <span id="s505">Why not, there could have been.</span> <span id="s506">I don't really don't know.</span> <span id="s507">At that time I was not aware of what was going on ten feet from me.</span> <span id="s508">I was sick and just looking around and trying to escape as many blows as possible.</span> <span id="s509">It was quite an experience, but of course, thank God this was done by the criminals, not political prisoners, German.</span> <span id="s510">That's what you expect from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: So initially you went into the hospital, and then when you recovered what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: They sent us right away to work.</span> <span id="s513">In that area, there was not very much to do there except, I don't know what they did.</span> <span id="s514">There was a group of I don't know, 20 of us.</span> <span id="s515">They could have been ten Russians, five Jews, a Jew from Belgium, oh my God, skeletons really, three or four Poles.</span> <span id="s516">About twenty of us, and he told us to push a wagon on the rails, usually for constructions building and stuff to move building materials, stones or cement, stuff like that, a triangle thing.</span> <span id="s517">It was loaded with stones and it was a little bit uphill area, not much, but it was so heavy that with four guys on this side and four on this side and two in the back and we couldn't move that.</span> <span id="s518">So the SS men got crazy, started beating us and I don't know, I was very ambitious, those guys are beaten but everybody was holding this somehow because if you would drop that that the whole wagon would go back because it was a down slope.</span> <span id="s519">Finally I show you and he threw everything -- because you can move, everything that was inside goes out, stones and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s520">And I was on that unfortunate side where he put all the stones and everything.</span> <span id="s521">He was a powerful man, a very strong man that he could do that.</span> <span id="s522">Ten of us couldn't do it, he could do it himself.</span> <span id="s523">And again, unfortunate thing, everything went on my right foot and it was completely destroyed, damaged, some nerves and the muscles.</span> <span id="s524">Everything was damaged severely and to this very day, I have some loss of muscles and everything.</span> <span id="s525">I never recovered from that.</span> <span id="s526">It's another souvenir from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s527">And of course, the foot was black and blue for a number of weeks.</span> <span id="s528">I could hardly move, but I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s529">But that was the basically that's what I got from Auschwitz from Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: In the time that you were working, you were also questioned again in connection with your --?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s532">In the very beginning for about, I don't remember, about three times maybe I was called to a so-called polishok tilo ,(ph).</span> <span id="s533">That's the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s534">That's where my file was.</span> <span id="s535">They asked me similar questions from Kiertze (ph).</span> <span id="s536">Anything new?</span> <span id="s537">Did you change your mind, because if you changed your mind we'll be very generous and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s538">We'll appreciate this.</span> <span id="s539">I said, "No, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s540">How can I tell you, I don't know.”</span> <span id="s541">I refused.</span> <span id="s542">But later on, there was --the camp was getting a little bit disorganized.</span> <span id="s543">In the meantime, there was an uprising.</span> <span id="s544">Some Jewish commander, those fellows who took care of new transports, transports of Jews, preparation for the gas chamber, there was one very well very selected group of Jews, young Jews, healthy, strong, good looking Jews, and they used to work on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: You mean the Canada (ph) commando, the one who met the trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: , they're taking care of the goods of the clothing, the valuables and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">But this group --</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Tzaunder (ph) command?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Tzaunder command, right.</span> <span id="s550">commander one day decided to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">They were prepared with some weapons.</span> <span id="s552">They started a little trouble there, but unfortunately nothing --.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Did you know about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: I knew about it because the area where they were running -- they tried to escape, was not very far from area where I used to work, my commando.</span> <span id="s555">And, one afternoon we just saw something.</span> <span id="s556">There was a lot of noise, shooting, and you can distinguish guns and some noises not very far.</span> <span id="s557">It could have been less than a mile away, much less.</span> <span id="s558">So,we knew that something was going on, and we found -- and of course, once this happened, everybody is going back in the middle of the day.</span> <span id="s559">Forget about work and everything.</span> <span id="s560">They form the columns and you go back to the camp, because that's a dangerous situation.</span> <span id="s561">They were not sure what was happening at that time.</span> <span id="s562">If the whole camp is going to start a problem.</span> <span id="s563">So our guards, SS men, they drove us to the camp as fast as possible.</span> <span id="s564">They were behaving like crazy.</span> <span id="s565">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s566">We knew it was something and then when we arrived they told us what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Who told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: All the friends, the prisoners, inside.</span> <span id="s569">We had some connections.</span> <span id="s570">I mean later on I developed -- I knew some people that had underground organizations, connection with the outside life and they're quite well organized.</span> <span id="s571">They helped people to escape, were very seldom successful, but they did.</span> <span id="s572">That was the assignment they had.</span> <span id="s573">And eventually prepare for a little uprising as well.</span> <span id="s574">the situation was like this.</span> <span id="s575">That was late.</span> <span id="s576">The Russians were moving like crazy from the East.</span> <span id="s577">They were very close to the -- they were in Poland not very far from Krakow (ph).</span> <span id="s578">So, the camp commander, they didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s579">So, they decided to evacuate the camp gradually, and that's how I got to Graustroiten (sp).</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Once you were out of the hospital or the place where they helped you get a little better, you were in a block with the German criminals and political prisoners or what was your block?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: It was a mixture.</span> <span id="s582">I would say it was mostly Jews and percentage wise, I don't know, 70 percent Jews, 10 percent Russians, the rest Poles.</span> <span id="s583">The Russians --whatever was left, they were destroyed a couple of years before I came.</span> <span id="s584">There were just behaving like animals, the Russians.</span> <span id="s585">They were destroying themselves.</span> <span id="s586">We used to work on the damaged aircraft, German, American, English aircraft.</span> <span id="s587">They used to bring to the place and we used to take the good parts from that, and of course they wanted to save that, from the inside of the aircraft from the motor.</span> <span id="s588">In many cases, there was a special kind of alcohol but strictly for the function of the operation of the machine.</span> <span id="s589">For some parts of the aircraft, steering, I believe it was a combination of oil, alcohol, of course alcohol for consumption.</span> <span id="s590">But the Russians, once they found that this was alcohol, they started drinking that and I witnessed myself, once during their lunch break they drank that alcohol and they died in terrible pains, because you know it was a poison and acted immediately after they drank it.</span> <span id="s591">But of course, they had a good time before.</span> <span id="s592">I remember it.</span> <span id="s593">I saw it myself.</span> <span id="s594">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: The grapevine, the talk of uprising in Auschwitz, even if you didn't hear about something specific, can you tell me more about how that works.</span> <span id="s596">Could anybody find anything out?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: No, that was top secret and you would have to be trusted to the utmost.</span> <span id="s598">You have to have the right connections.</span> <span id="s599">No, my first months, it would be possible, I wouldn't even dream that such a thing exists.</span> <span id="s600">Later on, yes, when you regain your mental powers, a little physically you feel a little bit better and you look around and you start getting ideas and you look for the right people.</span> <span id="s601">Of course, religion, also illegal to practice.</span> <span id="s602">It was illegal naturally, but there were priests who were serving if someone was willing to take advantage from a confession, so a priest could come.</span> <span id="s603">If you were very sickly you could have a confession.</span> <span id="s604">But that was like a similar situation to the military organization particular organization, but that was more not everybody could take advantage of that, but there was such a thing.</span> <span id="s605">There was such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Did you ever hear about any specific escapes?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s608">Escapes every time if naturally if the escape was unsuccessful, we knew about it because if the person was caught, in most cases was killed.</span> <span id="s609">So, they brought the body, and when we were working outside of the camp returning to the camp, his body was supported by something, I don't know, I remember some metal object so he was sort of standing and they put a table with an inscription something like "Hurrah, I'm back.</span> <span id="s610">I am so glad that I'm back.”</span> <span id="s611">And we had to march by this every day returning from work, and we had to see this.</span> <span id="s612">One time I remember a guy they caught him but they didn't kill him.</span> <span id="s613">He was alive so they hanged him.</span> <span id="s614">So, of course, everybody had to watch this.</span> <span id="s615">We assembled at the cell blocks and we had to watch the whole ceremony, the hanging.</span> <span id="s616">I remember that.</span> <span id="s617">I remember beatings, flogging, that was the official way for some.</span> <span id="s618">Some penalty for something that officially 25 hits so they had an official table.</span> <span id="s619">You had to stretch on it.</span> <span id="s620">They bind your two legs and arms and everything, and one of the prominent people in the camp, usually a German criminal, performed the whole operation, hit the guy 25 times, maybe more.</span> <span id="s621">I remember that, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: In the time that you were there, did news ever come through the underground of successful escapes that you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Well, no, not really.</span> <span id="s624">I don't remember anything like that.</span> <span id="s625">I found out later on reading or hearing from friends mostly from descriptions, stories of escape.</span> <span id="s626">Some successful, some not, but only from reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: In that time before you went to Gross-Rosen, did you make any new friends who were your fiends through your whole time in camp and maybe even ones who went with you on the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: No.</span> <span id="s629">From Gross-Rosen, that may be an interesting.</span> <span id="s630">I had a copo on a train, on the transport to Buchenwald from Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s631">He was a German criminal.</span> <span id="s632">Earlier just I learned tarot, fortune telling, using very primitive cards made from paper, and I don't know.</span> <span id="s633">Just for a piece of bread I was studying them.</span> <span id="s634">I was not kidding, I was telling them what was in the cards, so naturally for a guy like myself I told them, oh a couple of months you'll survive and everything will be fine.</span> <span id="s635">In many cases was in the cards.</span> <span id="s636">So, in the transport going to Buchanwald somebody told that copo here is a guy, he can tell you your future.</span> <span id="s637">It's a particular situation, we are going to a new place.</span> <span id="s638">This is almost end of the war, what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s639">So, he gave me a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s640">They were very well provided, copos, and tell me what do you see?</span> <span id="s641">My God I saw nothing but death.</span> <span id="s642">Ace, combination of cards, immediate.</span> <span id="s643">As soon as possible I saw him, but of course I couldn't tell him that.</span> <span id="s644">Oh, you are going to be drafted soon, because you see that was the end of the war and they took a lot of those criminals from the concentration camp, they sent them to the East, to the Russian front.</span> <span id="s645">Of course, he preferred going there to staying with the camp.</span> <span id="s646">Oh, I see you'll get special recognition.</span> <span id="s647">I see a new uniform, You will be okay, you will be all right.</span> <span id="s648">But no, it wasn't like that, but what could I tell him.</span> <span id="s649">So, we arrived at Buchenwald- and a day or so after that, I go to there was what you call it, not a bathroom area, a huge barrack --</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: A latrine?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes, but you can wash there also.</span> <span id="s652">So, returning from that I see there was a common site, people, dead bodies on a little wagon, cart, my God I don't believe it.</span> <span id="s653">I saw this guy that I predicted he will drafted.</span> <span id="s654">He was dead in the wagon.</span> <span id="s655">So, after all the cards didn't lie.</span> <span id="s656">It's like that.</span> <span id="s657">When you change the camps, people involved, interested who remember that you did something wrong in a previous camp, there is you have a freedom for a day or so to take care of this guy, to kill him, to simply kill him or damage something, warn him.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">That's what happened to this copo.</span> <span id="s659">People who were in this group decided to fix him and they killed him there.</span> <span id="s660">It was about two days after arriving to the camp in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Had you known him before?</span> <span id="s662">In Gross-Rosen?</span> <span id="s663">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: So other prisoners killed him?</span> <span id="s665">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: And how did they kill him?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Sticks, chalking, you know that is a familiar -- they learned this from the copos.</span> <span id="s668">That's what they do, first you're on the ground.</span> <span id="s669">You're already semi-conscious and they put a stick on your neck and jump a couple of times on that stick, and that's all you need.</span> <span id="s670">You don't have to perform any particular cruelty or anything like that.</span> <span id="s671">You're on the ground, stick on your throat and a couple of jumps.</span> <span id="s672">That's all.</span> <span id="s673">That's what they did in every block, especially I remember that was very typical of a quarantine.</span> <span id="s674">Quarantine in Birkenau, when I arrived every evening here we had to watch that kind of performance.</span> <span id="s675">A guy in charge of that particular barrack was going through that barrack and if he didn't like somebody he said come with me in the front and that's what he did.</span> <span id="s676">I saw a couple of times like that.</span> <span id="s677">All kinds, Russians, Jews, Poles, no matter what.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: When you went from Birkenau or Auschwitz, to Gross-Rosen, how did you go?</span> <span id="s679">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: How long were you in Gross-Rosen and what did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: We did the same job.</span> <span id="s683">In German, "tza legga bat rieben" (ph), it means dismantling aircraft, removing the good parts, the same thing.</span> <span id="s684">Assembling them, sorting them, so that's what we were doing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Tell me when you left Birkenau and went to Gross-Risen, and how long were you in Gross-Rosen before you went to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: I left Birkenau about I think it could have been October, the beginning of October to Gross-Rosen, and we went by train.</span> <span id="s687">SS organized a commando because "tza legga bat reiber" (ph) going to Gross-Rosen, just like a subdivision.</span> <span id="s688">It's not at Gross-Rosen itself, the big camp, it was like a branch or something like that, not very far from the center.</span> <span id="s689">Anyway, it was a subdivision, or subbranch or something.</span> <span id="s690">We were there until I'm not sure February I think of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: That's what your paper said, February 26.</span> <span id="s692">A: Something like that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Why were you transported from there.</span> <span id="s694">Tell me how that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: The reason was because the Russians were coming.</span> <span id="s696">They were very successful in that area.</span> <span id="s697">There was very heavy fighting at Sylitzea (ph), the Polish part and the German part of Stylitzea (ph), and there was some very important battles going on.</span> <span id="s698">Of course, they didn't wait.</span> <span id="s699">They wanted to remove as many people as possible from those camps.</span> <span id="s700">And they were times that you could hear the artillery, shooting.</span> <span id="s701">One day more, one day less, anyway they decided to move us to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Then, did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yes, something not very, nothing specific.</span> <span id="s704">There were all kinds of jobs like cleaning, sweeping, light jobs, because there was already a disorganization.</span> <span id="s705">The camp commander didn't know what to do and we were trying to organize some secret defense group.</span> <span id="s706">I came across some Polish communist.</span> <span id="s707">They used to be participating in Spanish civil war, and they were -- but of course involved from the very beginning was created by Hitler for communists, German communists and communists from all over the area from the European scene.</span> <span id="s708">Those guys were very well organized in Buchenwald and very well off.</span> <span id="s709">They had good food, because top management were communists_ so they took care of them.</span> <span id="s710">In April, when we arrived there -- before the beginning of April they started looking for people, able bodied people with some military experience who would be willing to participate in a little fighting with the SS people, soldiers.</span> <span id="s711">But, so I agreed to participate in that, but nothing came from that, because there was not enough, they were promised weapons and they never came.</span> <span id="s712">Something like that, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s713">In the meantime, I believe, April 7, he decided to organize the evacuation, not of everybody, but of a large group of prisoners from Buchnwald, and he moved even the first part I remember went to Kaminetyz (ph) by train, but in Kaminetyz (ph) there were Americans started bombarding the transportation communication.</span> <span id="s714">It was completely disrupted, so we could no longer go south using the train, so we had to go by foot.</span> <span id="s715">So, everybody out, and march, south.</span> <span id="s716">Possibly, two Dachau, but later on we found out that it wasn't supposed to be Dachau, it was supposed to be a place in Bavaria in nice beautiful picturesque place, forest, they prepared the graves and everything, they were going to liquidate a whole group.</span> <span id="s717">But of course they couldn't make it because George Patton was first.</span> <span id="s718">He liberated us the twenty- first of April, 1945.</span> <span id="s719">I remember exactly, a 11th tank division, and I met some people there I used to exchange letters for number of years after that, soldiers, Polish soldiers, Polish American soldiers and the picture that you have in my story, it was taken by him.</span> <span id="s720">The whole group we arrived there.</span> <span id="s721">That was roughly the end of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: You say you knew in 1943 what was going on in the camps, but a lot of Polish Jews didn't know what was happening when they were transported from Ghettos.</span> <span id="s723">Do you think you knew because of the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s725">Important thing is this.</span> <span id="s726">The concentration camp in Auschwitz and later on in Birkenau because they started with Auschwitz was originally for Poles.</span> <span id="s727">So, a vast majority of prisoners were Polish.</span> <span id="s728">In the year of 1940, '41, '42, it was absolute majority.</span> <span id="s729">Later on they decided to enlarge the field, the area of activity so they started Birkenau.</span> <span id="s730">Birkenau, if I remember correctly, was mostly for the Jews, but Auschwitz as such the majority of the prisoners in Auschwitz were Poles, but things were changing all the time, but Birkenau, the prisoners from Auschwitz were working on the Birkenau camp.</span> <span id="s731">When I arrived in 1943, there was still construction going on.</span> <span id="s732">It wasn't finished, not everything was finished.</span> <span id="s733">So that's the reason that Jews were not aware of actual -- the Auschwitz place.</span> <span id="s734">They were more aware of Treblinka, other places in --.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: And a lot of them didn't know even when they were on the trains usually?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Auschwitz, no.</span> <span id="s737">No.</span> <span id="s738">I remember when I was in Auschwitz, I talked to some Hungarian Jews, that was 1944, in the summer, a huge transport of Hungarian Jews came, and I remember that we had some good times because a lot of good food came with them and our kitchen was using rice, my God, what rice.</span> <span id="s739">We were -- and they didn't know.</span> <span id="s740">They told them that they were going to a nice place, secluded, and you will be able to work until the end the war.</span> <span id="s741">Nothing is going to happen.</span> <span id="s742">Of course, give us your valuable and everything because we have to maintain a certain comfort for you.</span> <span id="s743">You have to live like people, like human beings, so nothing to worry about.</span> <span id="s744">They did the same with Czechoslovakian Jews.</span> <span id="s745">They did the same with Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s746">They did the same with Gypsies.</span> <span id="s747">They were my neighbors.</span> <span id="s748">I knew I saw them, Hungarian Jews experience very badly because they were burning them day and night, day after day.</span> <span id="s749">It was unbelievable smell, and of course we had a better soup, but my God nobody could eat that soup.</span> <span id="s750">But that was terrible, really, summer of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: The punishment for collaborators, if the AK found out what then happened, and tell me about your specific knowledge of specific cases?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Well, the organization was the smallest unit, was I don't know how it was equivalent to a post which would be corresponding to a small town.</span> <span id="s755">Several posts would be a county, more or less corresponding to a county and several counties again, would be like a district and so forth.</span> <span id="s756">On our level, it was the smallest unit in the organization.</span> <span id="s757">Of course, we had a division of activities was first of all the military activities which included training and preparation for a specific assignments.</span> <span id="s758">Collecting of weapons, ammunition, maintenance, and that will be the military part, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s759">Then would be a part like a diversion of sabotage.</span> <span id="s760">Sabotage would have to perform certain tasks, disruption of communication in general or in particular cases according to the situation, according to the needs.</span> <span id="s761">It would be run, usually by soldiers, former soldiers who used to be on active duty in Polish Army, because they used to be most of the time Junior Officers.</span> <span id="s762">Then there would be the political side of it which would be the distribution of press or preparation of future needs of future administration, organizing of future councils which would be planning supply in case of uprising, would be in charge of preparation of food, supplies of food or medications, hospitals, but there was a unit also that took care of unfriendly acts of some people who were cooperating with the German authorities.</span> <span id="s763">It could be done in various ways, the most common in situation would be to report some experiences some SS acts, some facts to Gestapo as an act of well loyalty I would say to Germans.</span> <span id="s764">For some stupid reason he would discover that he was loyal to the German occupation.</span> <span id="s765">He started to cooperate with them and he would be reporting all kinds of trespassers like , with the collection of food by farmers, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s766">He would be sabotaging deliveries, so this is -- he would be reporting to Germans all kinds of irregular activities in that area, engaged in which actually were in the interest of Polish population, so these people were not too friendly to Poles.</span> <span id="s767">So, I remember two or three cases that one case was a policeman of Polish nationality who was too eager to please German police, and he hurt so much Polish people, that he was reported to higher authorities, the underground Polish authorities, and the accusations were collected and facts were collected and he was executed in due course.</span> <span id="s768">A similar situation was with another Pole that also was cooperating with German authorities, but not on a more or less on an economical level, like smuggling, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s769">Smuggling was an important part, because a lot of people depended on smuggled food because the official quota that you got of food was not enough.</span> <span id="s770">In certain circumstances you have to smuggle, or in many cases they were doing this for gain, but it was a necessary fact, necessary activity for the benefit of Polish population in general.</span> <span id="s771">So if somebody was trying to disrupt this or report some activities of smugglers to German police, the act was unfriendly and if it continued for a number of occasions, so the guy deserved a penalty and in that particular case that I remember, that guy was executed.</span> <span id="s772">Of course, a due course of law was applied to that situation.</span> <span id="s773">There were certain underground jurist, lawyers, judges, of course not employed by the current German administration, but they were original members of Polish jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s774">So, they were knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s775">They knew the law and they were able to issue a proper decision based on their experience and knowledge.</span> <span id="s776">One case I know also, a third case, a Jew who was very friendly with the German police also reporting all kinds of activities to German police and he was I understand the story, he was warned several times not to do it.</span> <span id="s777">He was even warned by some Jewish -- as a matter of fact, his family were telling him to stop that nonsense, but of course he was hoping that this way he will be able to survive, and his family, and so he was also killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Was this before the deportation?</span> <span id="s779">A: That was before the deportation.</span> <span id="s780">Q: So, it was very early?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Very early, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: There is a lot of talk among Jewish Polish partisan groups that there was a lot of anti- semitism in Polish non-Jewish partisan groups.</span> <span id="s783">Do you know anything about that?</span> <span id="s784">Do you have an opinion or do you remember incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s786">I don't -- you see for me I would have to if things like that took place of similar nature, it was probably after I was arrested because a lot of activities -- I mean the situation was getting more active in the second half of 1943 and the beginning of '44, and I was no longer there.</span> <span id="s787">I don't know, and frankly from people that I know, from those days, there was no such a thing as in a group, in a small group, not many Jews were participating, but if there were and I know of one from a friend of mine, there was not anything anti-semitic about that particular, I think it was two brothers or something like that.</span> <span id="s788">They were visitors.</span> <span id="s789">They were visiting a friend a mine.</span> <span id="s790">He had a huge barn and in that barn they were able to come to that barn and from the woods were they were members.</span> <span id="s791">They used to come, they used to take some food for the group.</span> <span id="s792">My friend trusted them, and they trusted him.</span> <span id="s793">They even used to have a radio receiver.</span> <span id="s794">They used to listen to the broadcast from London, together, in that barn, that particular barn.</span> <span id="s795">It was those two Jews and this friend of mine, and they were very close to that particular partisan group and there was nothing unfriendly because I think they knew each other when they were very small children, like that.</span> <span id="s796">They were more or less of the same age.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Now, going back to the deportation from you town, after all the Jews were deported was the Jewish population the majority?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Yes, it was majority.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: So, the town was sort of a ghost town?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: For a little while, yes, but the vacancies you may say were filled by Polish people who were deported from the area of the western part of Poland for example.</span> <span id="s801">There were some people rom the area.</span> <span id="s802">There were also in the area of Lublin, very rich area as far as agriculture was concerned.</span> <span id="s803">They were very good, very rich farmers so Germans decided to deport them and put some German people mostly I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s804">In other words, German born people so because they were deported from or simply they asked for better conditions, better kind of life.</span> <span id="s805">They expected that from Hitler because we're doing some small -- maybe I'll say it was quite a common thing, many of them were spying for Germans before the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s806">For a number of years they were in touch with German intelligence.</span> <span id="s807">They were collecting intelligence for them.</span> <span id="s808">So, if the guy was not to rich, just average, small farmer or something if he was able to get a farm like in that Lublin area , so he was very glad to do that, to take over that farm.</span> <span id="s809">And the Poles from that area, from the entire family was sent to small places like Shedowoeuf (ph).</span> <span id="s810">There was not very much they could do about it.</span> <span id="s811">They were completely destroyed, poor people with their children and everything.</span> <span id="s812">So they did some, maybe I don't remember exactly what they did, maybe they were just common laborers or something like that but they took over the possessions or houses originally occupied by Jews who were deported to Ghettos.</span> <span id="s813">I know a case of a guy he was a living in Germany in the Gdansk (ph) before the war and when the war came, he was no longer they simply told him go to Poland.</span> <span id="s814">We don't want you here because this is German reich and we need only 100 percent Germans here.</span> <span id="s815">So, he was sent to Poland.</span> <span id="s816">He was an intelligent guy, he was a professional, some sort of an engineer or something.</span> <span id="s817">So, he got one of the stores originally owned by Jews not as a property just as administration, management, for the management and he was paid as a manager of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Did any of the Jews that were deported come back after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: I wouldn't know.</span> <span id="s820">I think maybe, but I really don't know.</span> <span id="s821">I was in touch with my friends after the war, but the first time I came to visit Shadoweouf (ph) was last year, for the first time.</span> <span id="s822">You know, I could recognize that place because number one, there was very heavy fighting, the Russians were fighting with Germans in 1945 in the beginning when the main offensive was moving from the East to the West.</span> <span id="s823">Everything was destroyed, so now everything is rebuilt and the people maybe here or there I could recognize somebody, but it's very, very difficult to.</span> <span id="s824">Nobody really knows.</span> <span id="s825">New people, new faces, new buildings, like a strange place.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Now, can you just tell me just very short what your losses were in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Well, I mean the reason my father died is absolutely the reason I was arrested and the Gestapo was trying to interrogate him many times and that's how he paid with his life.</span> <span id="s828">He had a heart problem and that's why he died.</span> <span id="s829">My cousin died in Auschwitz in 1943.</span> <span id="s830">My uncle, my father's brother, died in Russia.</span> <span id="s831">He was in the Polish police before the war and according to the American Red Cross, I just got the news last year that he was liquidated let's say, the camp was liquidated by the KGB in Russia , the name of the camp.</span> <span id="s832">My brother, younger brother during the hostilities, during there was a fierce battle in January of 1945 between Russians and Germans, so they were running scared and he just got married, he married that the one in the post office, she used to be our contact, and they had a little child, and in January he had to cross -- running away from the Russians, he had to cross a river, a small river, but anyway it was deep enough that it was up to his neck with the child carrying the child.</span> <span id="s833">So, after that he got pneumonia and he died shortly after that and the child died also.</span> <span id="s834">The youngest brother he spent some time, I don't know exactly, but close to a year in a German concentration camp.</span> <span id="s835">I met him after the war when we independently joined the Polish Armed Forces in Italy.</span> <span id="s836">I met him there.</span> <span id="s837">But he told me that he had a very tough time to survive that concentration camp and he got a problem with his heart also.</span> <span id="s838">But he was okay for a number of years, but complaining of his heart all the time.</span> <span id="s839">One day, and he settled down in England.</span> <span id="s840">He married an English girl and I think they had three children and he was driving one day and he got a heart attack while driving and here a collision head on with another car and he was wounded very badly because of that heart condition, the heart attack, and he didn't recover from that.</span> <span id="s841">He died shortly after that.</span> <span id="s842">So, I considered this part of the war also.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: We only have a very few minutes left and I want if you can for you to describe for me the deportation that you watched from the roof, if you can?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Well, the idea was to assemble everybody on that market place.</span> <span id="s845">The younger people were able reasonably healthy people on the average, they were able to get there with their belongings, not much, small things necessary for life.</span> <span id="s846">Probably they had their most valuable things on them, but anyway, the younger group could make it.</span> <span id="s847">So, they were assembled around that market place and they were waiting for the older generation.</span> <span id="s848">But with older people it's a different story.</span> <span id="s849">So, some of them could walk and some of them could not walk.</span> <span id="s850">Some of them were sick, simply sick in bed, so these people as I know from after everything was finished, they were killed on the spots by the Germans.</span> <span id="s851">He couldn't walk, so he was killed.</span> <span id="s852">Because later on the abandoned places, the buildings, the apartments, had to be cleaned and the dead bodies had to be removed because it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s853">So, I saw a couple of dead bodies when they were cleaning that.</span> <span id="s854">There was a whole crew cleaning the place and mostly for middle age sick people or very old people, there was no chance, so they were either left in their bed, dead, or in that market place were shot, because they couldn't move.</span> <span id="s855">Also, a lot of people who were sick on that march between Shedoweuf (ph) and which is I don't know about 18 miles, it was impossible for them to make it, so the older people were shot.</span> <span id="s856">There were lots of dead bodies on the highway.</span> <span id="s857">So that's what we prepared in the report to our authorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">We mentioned as far as I remember it the idea was it was butchery, senseless because they simply acted like animals and they just left so much destruction and fear because everybody was psychologically -- the Polish people were very very worried after that.</span> <span id="s859">I told you that the young people stopped living at their usual places of residence.</span> <span id="s860">They left the houses.</span> <span id="s861">Most of them went to the forest to join the partisan groups.</span> <span id="s862">Others were just moving to other places under assumed names with forged i.d. cards.</span> <span id="s863">That's how it started, terror, uncertainty, fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s865">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: I'm sorry to put you through so much.</span> <span id="s867">A: Well, it has to be done, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
