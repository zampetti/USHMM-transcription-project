<span id="s16">Dickman was my maiden maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I was born in Bayreuth in Bavaria in the as they say.</span> <span id="s19">That had a great influence on my early youth only when Mother was Latvian at the.</span> <span id="s20">There was always singers coming and staying in our house and things like that, and started later to resent it terribly much because I hated...started to hate.</span> <span id="s21">Couldn't be helped.</span> <span id="s22">I had one little episode when I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s23">I met this fabulous old gentleman who looked like Wagner.</span> <span id="s24">I feel into his arm when I was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s25">He was a poet and a writer, and he was a Latvian and so far he was a friend of Wagners and came to rehearsals in Bayreuth, and so I met him and he went off to Munich, sent me tickets.</span> <span id="s26">He was wonderful.</span> <span id="s27">And one day he called me in the street and said I have to come.</span> <span id="s28">I said why.</span> <span id="s29">He said, "I have to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s30">So I run.</span> <span id="s31">There was this old man pacing up and down and he said, "When I die, all these things, they'll die with me.”</span> <span id="s32">I said, "What?"</span> <span id="s33">He said, "About When I heard, I said, "I don't want to hearing anything about Wagners.</span> <span id="s34">But he said you have because with me he dies.</span> <span id="s35">And he's die I don't want to have anything to do with the Wagners.</span> <span id="s36">so far that I just didn't want to have anything about them.</span> <span id="s37">That's strange but...but what can you do when you're 16 you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Tell me...tell me about your childhood.</span> <span id="s39">You had an unusual one.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: I was...I was a…We were the fifth, fourth and fifth children of my mother.</span> <span id="s41">We had a wonderful, wonderful.</span> <span id="s42">All of them.</span> <span id="s43">Very happy family life.</span> <span id="s44">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s45">In Bayreuth.</span> <span id="s46">My mother was absolutely .</span> <span id="s47">My father was more of poet.</span> <span id="s48">Very nice.</span> <span id="s49">And then when I went to Munch I fell for that because my father had taken the drawings of a child to a Professor and he said, "Ah, she's very gifted.</span> <span id="s50">Why don't you send her?</span> <span id="s51">So I had the first permission when I was 16.</span> <span id="s52">When they called me back, I was too young and I could go again.</span> <span id="s53">But Munich was very important.</span> <span id="s54">But the second time, I was in Munch...I remember the first time feces on the wall and Jews.</span> <span id="s55">That was the start of Hitler.</span> <span id="s56">And he...it was terrifying.</span> <span id="s57">But we didn't…crazy people.</span> <span id="s58">They thought it was crazy people, but it wasn't.</span> <span id="s59">And it went on.</span> <span id="s60">And then in my studio where I worked as a pupil...there was a young girl, beautiful girl and she came one day with a hack and cross, with a swastika.</span> <span id="s61">I said, "What are you going...” She said, "Oh, one of my boyfriends gave it to me.”</span> <span id="s62">I said, " You better don't wear it because the has this hack and cross.”</span> <span id="s63">So for me she kept it back, but then she wear it again, and that was the beginning.</span> <span id="s64">Hack and Cross.</span> <span id="s65">Swastika.</span> <span id="s66">All over.</span> <span id="s67">And it took away the joy.</span> <span id="s68">And then I got anonymous telephone calls.</span> <span id="s69">I should go to this place far out of Munich and these were the people I had refused to meet and be friends with, and they took...</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Explain.</span> <span id="s71">I don't understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Well, I..</span> <span id="s73">.</span> <span id="s74">I got a telephone call for example, "Be at 9 O'clock at Corner, Munich at 9 o'clock.</span> <span id="s75">And then telephone thing.</span> <span id="s76">I didn't go of course.</span> <span id="s77">And the next thing is I got a letter that my father died and I should go immediately to Bayreuth.</span> <span id="s78">I knew also that wouldn't be true.</span> <span id="s79">This was the revenge of certain young punks because I refused to walk and go out with them you know.</span> <span id="s80">So that it was the beginning that I knew I was...I was on the list you know.</span> <span id="s81">But...and I was on their list.</span> <span id="s82">But of course, I didn't bother.</span> <span id="s83">knew that I married and went to Holland and I forgot about.</span> <span id="s84">But I couldn't forget about, because I think I mentioned that I married in 1922 and in 23 we visited Bayreuth.</span> <span id="s85">And in Beareth, there's a beautiful old Beareth opera house which got Wagner to Beareth.</span> <span id="s86">offered him that house, but, of course, it was not big enough...to Doctor Wagner.</span> <span id="s87">But it was gorgeous...Beareth....and I loved it and I showed it to my husband and then down that opera...little opera hill came down a troop...a troop of singing boys with the old flag.</span> <span id="s88">and everything.</span> <span id="s89">And my husband had a terrible temper and he wanted to go over and tear that flag down.</span> <span id="s90">But my father kept him back, said, "Don't.</span> <span id="s91">These are only stupid boys.”</span> <span id="s92">My husband was very prophetic.</span> <span id="s93">It was 1923.</span> <span id="s94">He said, "How can you say that?</span> <span id="s95">In 10 years these boys will be your judges, will be your teachers, will be your...whatever it is.”</span> <span id="s96">And he was right.</span> <span id="s97">Ten years afterwards.</span> <span id="s98">23 to 33.</span> <span id="s99">He knew it.</span> <span id="s100">He said it to my father.</span> <span id="s101">But we knew and I knew it.</span> <span id="s102">Married to him, I mean I knew.</span> <span id="s103">He was politically inclined, which he proved later too and I learned a lot of things and I got interested in...in politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: So in 1923?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: That was in 1923 when my husband said to my father, "In 10 years you will see those boys.”</span> <span id="s106">And that was right.</span> <span id="s107">They are your judges and they are the...that's it.</span> <span id="s108">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Where did you go after Beareth?</span> <span id="s110">After 1923, after that visit, tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A:I was...I was married in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s112">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s113">The most marvelous life anybody could have.</span> <span id="s114">My children were born there.</span> <span id="s115">Lots of friends.</span> <span id="s116">It was a marvelous life there.</span> <span id="s117">And I could paint and I could draw.</span> <span id="s118">I didn't start at that time first, but later I did.</span> <span id="s119">And it was just marvelous.</span> <span id="s120">I took to Holland like as if I was born there.</span> <span id="s121">And I felt I always talked the language without an accent.</span> <span id="s122">It was my...I forced myself to listen you know.</span> <span id="s123">And nobody thought that I would not be born in Holland.</span> <span id="s124">That was wonderful.</span> <span id="s125">I loved it.</span> <span id="s126">And then, of course, a tragedy came.</span> <span id="s127">And my husband knew it before hand.</span> <span id="s128">He said, "They come.</span> <span id="s129">They will come.”</span> <span id="s130">And I knew they will come.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s132">I want to pause and stop the tape for a moment please.</span> <span id="s133">Okay, we are back on tape.</span> <span id="s134">Huh...You had a..</span> <span id="s135">.</span> <span id="s136">you had started to talk about the year 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: During Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s139">What happened in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: You know that was that terrible....the beginning in Germany.</span> <span id="s141">And of course, we were terribly not only touched but all the refuge coming and we tried very much to do for them, the ones who came and we...it was just a restless time.</span> <span id="s142">And my husband knew immediately.</span> <span id="s143">He said, "This is the beginning.”</span> <span id="s144">And my mother said the same thing.</span> <span id="s145">We knew it.</span> <span id="s146">And then I became ill and had fever, and I was sent away for a few months.</span> <span id="s147">And...uh...it was alright and I came back and it was very much better and then came 38.</span> <span id="s148">That was Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s149">Wasn't it.</span> <span id="s150">And my mother was still in Beareth because she didn't want to leave.</span> <span id="s151">She was very proud.</span> <span id="s152">She had no money in Holland.</span> <span id="s153">She had her money in Germany of course so she didn't want to leave.</span> <span id="s154">And the Gestapo came and the same night I went to Germany immediately.</span> <span id="s155">I had my Dutch passport.</span> <span id="s156">I could do that.</span> <span id="s157">I went to Beareth and started a fight of 7 days with the the , with these people because I wanted my mother out.</span> <span id="s158">And before they gave a exit reason that she could leave, they had of course a hundred thousand things to day.</span> <span id="s159">I was every day for 7 days there and fought with those people, and told them what I thought about them.</span> <span id="s160">I did!</span> <span id="s161">I told somebody...one man that...one of the that I know you.</span> <span id="s162">Your father was a fine man.</span> <span id="s163">He was really a noble man.</span> <span id="s164">I said, "Oh you seem so...and why do you make a effort to besmear my whole family?"</span> <span id="s165">"Oh, no, we don't know.</span> <span id="s166">We don't.”</span> <span id="s167">But he did.</span> <span id="s168">But in any case, after 7 days I got the permission to go to the bank and get my mother's fortune go to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s169">The bank director know me as a little child.</span> <span id="s170">He said, "Listen, I know you, but it's better that you go.</span> <span id="s171">Your mother couldn't come out.</span> <span id="s172">I'm sorry we have to take the money.”</span> <span id="s173">So they took my mother's whole fortune.</span> <span id="s174">That's why she didn't come to Holland.</span> <span id="s175">I went to them opposite in that old palace which was once a palace and then was a Nazi place and got a visa for my mother to exit.</span> <span id="s176">But we say I didn't get it, but it was there.</span> <span id="s177">And then I said, "Okay, I will go.”</span> <span id="s178">But when I came into the house...I forgot to tell you, my...the pictures...the pictures of my youth.</span> <span id="s179">You know, I had so many.</span> <span id="s180">The beautiful portraits of my ancestors, they were hacked to pieces in that Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s181">My mother's apartment looked unbelievable and the beautiful picture.</span> <span id="s182">I didn't mind my picturers, my drawings of my youth but the picture of my beautiful grandmother.</span> <span id="s183">And so I left and my mother followed in a few days.</span> <span id="s184">I purposely did that and when she came without trouble.</span> <span id="s185">She could come over, but she left everything and came like that to Amsterdam and I was...we were happy to have here.</span> <span id="s186">But the Kristallnacht was something which has to be thought of you know.</span> <span id="s187">I was there.</span> <span id="s188">I saw it.</span> <span id="s189">I saw the destruction.</span> <span id="s190">It's sad.</span> <span id="s191">Terrible.</span> <span id="s192">I had a friend who came to me, not a Jewish friend, and she belonged to the aristocracy there and she said, "You know we are so desperate.”</span> <span id="s193">Her father in law was a very high, you know, very religious.</span> <span id="s194">And she said, "Believe me, we are not all like that.</span> <span id="s195">Believe me.</span> <span id="s196">We think it's terrible.”</span> <span id="s197">But of course, they couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s198">There were the Nazis and they have the power and in Beareth they had especially power because there was a teacher who helped Hitler before and the Wagners, of course.</span> <span id="s199">I didn't even talk about the Wagners yet.</span> <span id="s200">Huh?</span> <span id="s201">Would you like to know about the Wagners and my family?</span> <span id="s202">Now my...I only remember that we always had singers coming and staying in my father's house who were singing for .</span> <span id="s203">With their little children, they always talked about and grandma, but it was who was the power of course behind the throne.</span> <span id="s204">And I remember there was in white and between and the youngest daughter and her husband , he was the greatest anti-Semite, the Englishman.</span> <span id="s205">So we saw them walk all the time.</span> <span id="s206">Beautiful old ladies, smiling, angelic, but the devil as we all know.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: You saw them?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yes, of course we saw them.</span> <span id="s209">And my father knew Seigfrid and when I was graduating Seigfried gave me permission to play the piano, his piano, in our...I know that when I left school I played by Greek on the piano, on Seigfried Wagner's piano.</span> <span id="s210">Yeah, he was nice.</span> <span id="s211">It was she who was the bad one.</span> <span id="s212">But Seigfried was very nice.</span> <span id="s213">Whenever he saw me, he waved to me.</span> <span id="s214">You know that's...that's passe, of course.</span> <span id="s215">And so I left.</span> <span id="s216">My mother left and that was all about Germany and I didn't want to hear about Germany anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So this happened in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes, that was in 1938 and we settled her down and then, of course, ”•we knew what was coming.</span> <span id="s219">And then I got...I went to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s220">I worked in the....No it's very important.</span> <span id="s221">I had fever and the doctor said I must go away, get away from Amsterdam, from that fever place so to say and I went to Arosa.</span> <span id="s222">And I met a friend and he said, "Go to this hotel outside of Arosa.</span> <span id="s223">I was there and my husband left me and on the first evening I went down, consoled myself by putting on a long gown, evening dress which I loved, and I'm called to the telephone.</span> <span id="s224">And my husband called me.</span> <span id="s225">I had just arrived you know, and he said, "You have to come back.”</span> <span id="s226">I said, "What?"</span> <span id="s227">"There is the invasion of Vienna.”</span> <span id="s228">I think it was...not yet, I mean the Nazis went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s229">I forgot.</span> <span id="s230">In any case, I said, "I can't.</span> <span id="s231">I have high fever.”</span> <span id="s232">He said, "Then I'll call you tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s233">And I come out and there stand two elegant Germans.</span> <span id="s234">They said, "Ah, .</span> <span id="s235">We observed you are so beautiful.</span> <span id="s236">Will you come out?"</span> <span id="s237">I said, "I am not accustomed to go out with strangers.”</span> <span id="s238">They said you must speak a very educated talk.</span> <span id="s239">I said, "Oh," I said, "You listened?</span> <span id="s240">"If you listened," I said, "then I tell you that I just heard that you invaded Austria.”</span> <span id="s241">"That couldn't be," he said.</span> <span id="s242">This gentlemen is the of some paper.</span> <span id="s243">I said, "But it is true.”</span> <span id="s244">And I let them stand there.</span> <span id="s245">But I knew that I was on their list so I had letters.</span> <span id="s246">That was before Arosa.</span> <span id="s247">That was in .</span> <span id="s248">And I had bags...my husband wrote me every day.</span> <span id="s249">And I went to my bag to look for them in the bag.</span> <span id="s250">The letters had disappeared.</span> <span id="s251">So I knew...the chambermaids.</span> <span id="s252">They're all German chambermaids.</span> <span id="s253">They had taken my letters, and the next day it was brought back.</span> <span id="s254">And so I said, "I cannot stay here in that hotel with those.”</span> <span id="s255">So I went down to the gentlemen and said, "I will not stay here in the hotel.”</span> <span id="s256">He said, "Why not?"</span> <span id="s257">I said, "Your guests.</span> <span id="s258">I don't like your guests.”</span> <span id="s259">And I wonderful chance.</span> <span id="s260">One of the skiers saw me from Holland.</span> <span id="s261">He came.</span> <span id="s262">He said, "You know this lady is here in the hotel.</span> <span id="s263">Don't you know here?"</span> <span id="s264">I said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s265">I called her up.</span> <span id="s266">I said I have got to get me a room.</span> <span id="s267">That was the lady from Holland.</span> <span id="s268">She said, "I will.”</span> <span id="s269">So she got me a room.</span> <span id="s270">I took a sleigh and left everything in the hotel and I knew I was on their list and that was true.</span> <span id="s271">That was the beginning.</span> <span id="s272">But they...but I was on the list.</span> <span id="s273">They had stolen my letters from my husband and so on.</span> <span id="s274">And that was now 39 I think.</span> <span id="s275">So that was...we knew we were... how could I say... not only my husband, but I was too on the list.</span> <span id="s276">And there it was.</span> <span id="s277">And then, you know, the invasion and we knew it.</span> <span id="s278">I said to my little housemaid when we went on vacation for a few days in August.</span> <span id="s279">I said, "Stay here.”</span> <span id="s280">She said, "Why.”</span> <span id="s281">"I said, "Best.</span> <span id="s282">The Nazis come.”</span> <span id="s283">She said, "It couldn't be.”</span> <span id="s284">I said, Yes.”</span> <span id="s285">We were on vacation and after the second...on the second day the maid comes in and while we were having dinner and said that three gentlemen are outside.</span> <span id="s286">They come and then a screaming starts.</span> <span id="s287">My children never forgot it.</span> <span id="s288">There was these three Gestapo people there and two Dutch policeman and they wanted to have Mr. Model into prison.</span> <span id="s289">Yeah.</span> <span id="s290">And they screamed.</span> <span id="s291">That was the worse thing.</span> <span id="s292">And I went up to him.</span> <span id="s293">I was so furious.</span> <span id="s294">Said, "Why do you do that.”</span> <span id="s295">He said, "He's in our books 6 years.”</span> <span id="s296">"What for?"</span> <span id="s297">"Smuggled dollars.”</span> <span id="s298">I said, "My husband smuggled dollars?"</span> <span id="s299">"Yes, Ma'am.</span> <span id="s300">American Bank.”</span> <span id="s301">He didn't really do it.</span> <span id="s302">So I immediately dumped into a train, left my children there, went to Amsterdam and came to my house and the maid said, "You know, they were here with Mr. Model.</span> <span id="s303">They opened every drawer and looked and left my in pieces and everything.</span> <span id="s304">They looked for papers and, of course, they couldn't find it, so that was the beginning of the prison.</span> <span id="s305">At the same night at 11 o'clock at night, my maid comes...that little maid...a very patriotic Dutch girl and she said, "There's a gentlemen...I had sent away...there's a gentleman and he's one of those who was here with Mr. Model when he came with the Nazis," she said, "and he said he insists that he has to talk to you.</span> <span id="s306">I said, "Okay, if he insists.</span> <span id="s307">Put him in your room.”</span> <span id="s308">So I went there and it was one of the Dutch officers.</span> <span id="s309">You know I told you there were the Gestapo and then two Dutch officers.</span> <span id="s310">And he said, "Please, Mrs. Model, trust me.”</span> <span id="s311">I said, "Why should I trust you?"</span> <span id="s312">He said, "I am the other international law that we are forced to be with the Nazis when they do something with Dutch citizens you know.”</span> <span id="s313">And then he took out a little match box and in that matchbox inside he had what he only could written.</span> <span id="s314">He had written...he had 9 people I should warn.</span> <span id="s315">And I warned them of course.</span> <span id="s316">He said, "Please trust me.”</span> <span id="s317">I said, "But why should I trust you?"</span> <span id="s318">He said, "I tell you a story.</span> <span id="s319">Last year...two years ago...I don't know...we had caught a young German who came due, he said, who came over with 5 and the police called your husband because when they asked him, "What do you do with the… He said he delivered something to Mr. Model .</span> <span id="s320">Now he said...the policeman said latter...We knew Mr. Model had a perfect name.</span> <span id="s321">He wouldn't smuggle .</span> <span id="s322">So they called my husband.</span> <span id="s323">My husband said, "I can't come.</span> <span id="s324">Come to me.”</span> <span id="s325">So they came.</span> <span id="s326">Three policeman with this young German Jew and my husband said, "Do you know me?"</span> <span id="s327">"No.”</span> <span id="s328">My husband said, "I have never seen that boy.”</span> <span id="s329">But he said, "Let me be alone with him.”</span> <span id="s330">So the police left, went the other room.</span> <span id="s331">They were very polite and my ...my husband said, "How did you get my name?"</span> <span id="s332">He said, "I bought it.”</span> <span id="s333">So he said, "What?"</span> <span id="s334">"Yeah, there is an exchange in Berlin and your name was on the highest list.</span> <span id="s335">I paid 800 marks for your name as the one who helps everybody.”</span> <span id="s336">I swear it this was the truth what I tell you.</span> <span id="s337">So he had my husband's name and gave the police knew he wasn't smuggling.</span> <span id="s338">So my husband said the police that they should not put him back to German...send him back to Germany.</span> <span id="s339">And he vouched for him and he gave him money that he could go in that...” which at that time was only a detention camp and not a..</span> <span id="s340">.</span> <span id="s341">later became that terrible camp.</span> <span id="s342">So my husband got it done that that boy who got him into difficulties was not put back to Germany.</span> <span id="s343">And this was the policeman.</span> <span id="s344">He said, "And I was there when your husband pleaded not to put that boy back.</span> <span id="s345">And I said to myself if I ever can do something for that man will.</span> <span id="s346">And now was my opportunity because when I came there I knew I will help.”</span> <span id="s347">And he said, My colleague...colleague I don't know.”</span> <span id="s348">But the funniest thing is that next day in the afternoon, the colleague called me and said, "Ah, he so wonderful.</span> <span id="s349">We got him something to eat in the morning before he went to the Gestapo headquarters.”</span> <span id="s350">Imagine.</span> <span id="s351">They're all heart that because they saw how wonderful he was.</span> <span id="s352">In prison...the prison...they said, "He's so wonderful...he had...he gives courage to everybody.</span> <span id="s353">He said to them when they walked in the prison yard, he said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s354">They will not last out here.</span> <span id="s355">Then will not last 10 years," to the people you know.</span> <span id="s356">That was him you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Before I ask you more about your husband, I'd like you to put your purse on the floor.</span> <span id="s358">It's a little distracting.</span> <span id="s359">You should try not to touch the mike up here.</span> <span id="s360">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Did I?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Tell me about your husband and how did he get involved in helping people.</span> <span id="s363">My husband as a young man already was involved.</span> <span id="s364">When he was 18, he was already a leader for young people.</span> <span id="s365">And when I met him he had...was always in politics but against everything....against the common man you know.</span> <span id="s366">So I knew that and I was happy and I became just like he was.</span> <span id="s367">I helped everybody as far as I could, but I wasn't as powerful as he.</span> <span id="s368">Everybody could come to him and they did.</span> <span id="s369">They did.</span> <span id="s370">I told you the Nazis told me.</span> <span id="s371">They knew since years that he was helping everybody and told me themselves.</span> <span id="s372">And I said, "What did you say to me?"</span> <span id="s373">Now isn't that stupid.</span> <span id="s374">I got so mad.</span> <span id="s375">I was alone.</span> <span id="s376">He was ”Karloff•.</span> <span id="s377">The name of the Nazi hunter who took my husband was Inspector Karloff.</span> <span id="s378">Never will I forget the name.</span> <span id="s379">And he said, "I think he's a wonderful man myself.”</span> <span id="s380">And I said, "And you keep him in prison yet?"</span> <span id="s381">"But he's our enemy?"</span> <span id="s382">I said, "What do you expect?"</span> <span id="s383">You know he's too naive.</span> <span id="s384">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s385">And so they kept him and kept him and kept him.</span> <span id="s386">And he could...he...he didn't get my letters.</span> <span id="s387">I got his letters which were desperate.</span> <span id="s388">He never got a letter and I wrote every day.</span> <span id="s389">I sent somebody to the prison.</span> <span id="s390">(Sigh) He didn't...and they didn't give it to him.</span> <span id="s391">And he was tortured because there were bombings from the English at that time.</span> <span id="s392">But they were lost and then I get an anonymous telephone call from The Hague when he was about 4 weeks in prison.</span> <span id="s393">And he...there was a German speaking and said, "You don't know me but I know about you and I know about your husband.</span> <span id="s394">I would like to see him.”</span> <span id="s395">I said, "He's not here.”</span> <span id="s396">"Where is he?"</span> <span id="s397">I said, "In prison," and bang the telephone went down.</span> <span id="s398">I should not say in prison.</span> <span id="s399">He was in prison.</span> <span id="s400">And that was it.</span> <span id="s401">A week after that, the same thing.</span> <span id="s402">"Can I talk to Mr. Model?"</span> <span id="s403">I said, "He's in prison.”</span> <span id="s404">"Wait a moment," he said, "I come.”</span> <span id="s405">So there came a tall, nice, portly German who said, "I did not put my car in front of your house, which was nice with the Gestapo of course.</span> <span id="s406">But I have to tell you that I am not your enemy.</span> <span id="s407">I'm your friend because Mr. Model did something so fabulous once for me.</span> <span id="s408">You know he always did things.</span> <span id="s409">I want to help him.”</span> <span id="s410">I said, "You only can help him when you get him out of prison.”</span> <span id="s411">And he disappeared, you know, and that was it.</span> <span id="s412">And then I didn't hear anything and then one day I get a telephone call Saturday morning and the same voice said, "I see clear.</span> <span id="s413">I talked to that Karlo.</span> <span id="s414">And that was it.</span> <span id="s415">And then in the afternoon at 2 o'clock a taxi comes and my husband was home.</span> <span id="s416">But that wasn't the end of it.</span> <span id="s417">Every week one of the Gestapo people came to the bank and got him to The Hague or to Rotterdam, and he never told me what happened there.</span> <span id="s418">He never told me.</span> <span id="s419">But every week twice, three times, they called him again.</span> <span id="s420">Cat and mouse you know.</span> <span id="s421">H</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: What was the excuse first for putting him in prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Oh, he was the collector of the...of the dollars all over Europe, which wasn't true at all of course.</span> <span id="s424">It was...it was actually the...uh...you know...then...yeah...then I was at the Gestapo for the eighth time.</span> <span id="s425">I never came...I always went to the Gestapo and he interrogated me, and on the eighth time, he said, "Something terrible has happened while I was away.”</span> <span id="s426">I said, "What has happened?"</span> <span id="s427">He left...left the other man go and I was alone with him.</span> <span id="s428">And he said, "Some people have...I had forgotten about this even..."Some people have offered money for Mr. Model's release.”</span> <span id="s429">I said, "What?"</span> <span id="s430">"Dollars," he said.</span> <span id="s431">I said, "We have no dollars.</span> <span id="s432">My husband has no dollars.”</span> <span id="s433">We delivered it to the Dutch.</span> <span id="s434">We were supposed to deliver it.</span> <span id="s435">"No, no, no. 4 thousand dollars or 8 thousand dollars.”</span> <span id="s436">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s437">In any case, suddenly I..</span> <span id="s438">.</span> <span id="s439">he said...he mentioned a name, Mrs. Levy.</span> <span id="s440">This Mrs. Levy, she was at my door, but I didn't receive her.</span> <span id="s441">He said, "Yes, but she was not Jewish.”</span> <span id="s442">She had the name....she was a German who worked together with the Mexican Consul to get money out of the people.</span> <span id="s443">And he said...when I was in prison...I forgot to tell you that men came in...a banker and said, "Outside is a lady.</span> <span id="s444">She can help to get your husband out of prison."</span> <span id="s445">And immediately I knew.</span> <span id="s446">Impossible!</span> <span id="s447">I knew that wouldn't be possible.</span> <span id="s448">So I said, "I don't believe you.”</span> <span id="s449">"Oh," he said, "Yes.”</span> <span id="s450">I said, "Oh, it costs money.”</span> <span id="s451">"Yes, it costs money, but what is money for the release of Mr. Model?"</span> <span id="s452">I said, "It's nothing, but for me it's something because I don't have any dollars.”</span> <span id="s453">"And anyway," I said, "I can't.</span> <span id="s454">"Who's the lady?"</span> <span id="s455">He said, "This is a Mrs. Levy."</span> <span id="s456">So I knew the name you know.</span> <span id="s457">And when I was there he said, "Mrs. Levy came to him and offered the Gestapo...imagine, he said, 4 thousand or 6...8 thousand dollars...I don't know...for the release of .</span> <span id="s458">Of course, he couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s459">I said, "No, you couldn't do it, of course.”</span> <span id="s460">That was the beginning and I knew darn well that they had...they wanted...we would have paid...they would have paid 4 thousand dollars and then they would have come to us and give us 8 thousand dollars because that's what they did.</span> <span id="s461">But I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s462">I knew my husband would hate it, and he said later he was so glad for that I didn't believe them and didn't let...I didn't see Mrs. Levy ever.</span> <span id="s463">But she interfered with my life because she wanted money.</span> <span id="s464">Later after the war, I heard, she was taken into prison by the Dutch with the Mexican Consul because she cheated and got money.</span> <span id="s465">I know people who paid her the money.</span> <span id="s466">But very nice people, Cohen, from Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s467">I heard that they paid the money.</span> <span id="s468">I didn't because first of all, I didn't have it.</span> <span id="s469">Anyway, that was...that was the beginning you know.</span> <span id="s470">And then we get a telephone call from the American Consul, knew my husband, of course, my husband works for an American bank.</span> <span id="s471">And he said, "Mrs. Model, you have to get him out of the country.”</span> <span id="s472">I said, "Don't I know that?</span> <span id="s473">Don't I know that?"</span> <span id="s474">And before the Nazis came, on the day before the Germans marched in...I forgot to tell you...I had in my living room about 13 people who all wanted to leave the country with my husband because they knew where he is there is action and they can do something.</span> <span id="s475">But my husband said, "I cannot leave.</span> <span id="s476">I have 40 people who depend on me.”</span> <span id="s477">But I will help you and we got in touch with other people.</span> <span id="s478">And there was a cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s479">He said, "I am a criminal but I don't go.”</span> <span id="s480">He said, "I cannot go if he doesn't go.”</span> <span id="s481">I said, "I cannot go if he doesn't go.</span> <span id="s482">I stay, of course.”</span> <span id="s483">It was...ah...I never can forget that afternoon and they were all there and the Belgium Consul even offered us that we could go, and he said he wouldn't go because some 40 people are depending on him.</span> <span id="s484">He cannot go.</span> <span id="s485">And he looked at me and I said...funnily enough I had...he said to me later, "Why did you not say anything.”</span> <span id="s486">I said, "I had a feeling we would get out anyway.”</span> <span id="s487">Real funny thing.</span> <span id="s488">I have a feeling we'll get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: What did your husband mean '40 people are depending on him.”</span> <span id="s490">He had a bank and 40 people were depending on him.</span> <span id="s491">He couldn't let them from one day to the other without money, without anything.</span> <span id="s492">That was him.</span> <span id="s493">He said, "I cannot.”</span> <span id="s494">My mother was one of them.</span> <span id="s495">You see.</span> <span id="s496">He said, "I couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s497">40 people.</span> <span id="s498">I..</span> <span id="s499">.</span> <span id="s500">I cannot go.”</span> <span id="s501">And when he said that, I said, "We will go.”</span> <span id="s502">I..</span> <span id="s503">.</span> <span id="s504">I had absolutely the feeling we will go somewhere.</span> <span id="s505">We could do it.</span> <span id="s506">It was my...it was not made up.</span> <span id="s507">I felt we could leave.</span> <span id="s508">And if so, he finished everything and when the American Consul said try get out and then a few other people called and the Underground called us and we were twice put...it was the most awful thing.</span> <span id="s509">Twice we were put on a list...an exit visa...visa, which was the most important from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s510">But we couldn't no visa.</span> <span id="s511">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s512">Let me think back.</span> <span id="s513">Then that's another time when the....when the was a friend there officially they gave the visa...we gave the permit...permit, but it was not the business of course.</span> <span id="s514">And called me and said we have another...we had another visa...exit visa...visa...exit for you.</span> <span id="s515">I said, "But we have no...have no visa for...from where should you go.”</span> <span id="s516">But then the American Consul said, "Mr. Model, try to get in touch with the American Consuls.”</span> <span id="s517">How it really happened, I don't know.</span> <span id="s518">But the time went and the exit visa was gone and we get another call and they said, "If you don't leave now, you will never leave.”</span> <span id="s519">That's the Underground.</span> <span id="s520">So my husband again went to Rotterdam where the American Consul was, and he said to him, "It's desperate.</span> <span id="s521">I will be killed and we all will be killed if you don't give us the…"I can't do it.”</span> <span id="s522">But...then my husband said, "I would...you would be responsible to Beareth because my husband worked for the bank where Beareth was...something.</span> <span id="s523">He got a little frightened and he said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s524">Let your wife come on the...” And I came.</span> <span id="s525">And he...he took our notes, but this was it.</span> <span id="s526">But then in the meantime it was Friday and Saturday morning my husband went...on Monday, we were supposed to go to that transport.</span> <span id="s527">I had to tell my mother that we leave.</span> <span id="s528">I had to pack two bags.</span> <span id="s529">And my sons had 40 degree fever or something.</span> <span id="s530">Any case he said, "You have to come immediately.”</span> <span id="s531">He called me from Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s532">I was not permitted to take a taxi but I did, jumped into the train and arrive, and there he stands and he smiles a little bit.</span> <span id="s533">And he said, "I think we will make it.”</span> <span id="s534">So he had told me that while he was talking to the Consul he remembered his other Spanish visa.</span> <span id="s535">He went to the Spanish Consulate and there was one girl left.</span> <span id="s536">And she said, "I can't do anything.”</span> <span id="s537">He said, "Here are...I don't know how much money he gave her...Dutch money.</span> <span id="s538">Please.</span> <span id="s539">To your favorite charity, but please put a Spanish visa and she did.</span> <span id="s540">She did.</span> <span id="s541">That was our savior...that unknown girl put a Spanish visa in our passport.</span> <span id="s542">And then he went back to the Americans Consulate and said to him, "Here, I have a Spanish visa.”</span> <span id="s543">Then, of course, I..</span> <span id="s544">.</span> <span id="s545">I had to sign different things and at 3 O'clock on that Saturday afternoon, here comes out a very looking man.</span> <span id="s546">I forgot his name, thank God.</span> <span id="s547">He gave me my passport, gave me his hand and said, "Here is your passport.”</span> <span id="s548">For you, I miss my golf.</span> <span id="s549">I swear it.</span> <span id="s550">That's what he says.</span> <span id="s551">And I said, "But you saved our lives.”</span> <span id="s552">He said, "For you, I missed my golf.”</span> <span id="s553">And then we went to Amsterdam and I had to tell my mother that we will leave and we didn't...and my sisters after me died when my husband was prison, and then I.... It was terrible, of course.</span> <span id="s554">You couldn't tell people, but I had to tell my mother and my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: You had to leave without your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s557">We couldn't take her.</span> <span id="s558">And then.</span> <span id="s559">I must think back.</span> <span id="s560">Then that was Saturday.</span> <span id="s561">And on Sunday, my husband went to see my mother.</span> <span id="s562">He was so wonderful to her.</span> <span id="s563">And while he was gone, I get a telephone call from that man with whom my husband worked Underground whom I knew very well.</span> <span id="s564">I mean my husband didn't tell me, but I knew.</span> <span id="s565">I knew the work of that friend of ours.</span> <span id="s566">And he said...it was 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Sunday afternoon.</span> <span id="s567">Monday morning, we had to be at 7 o'clock with our two bags on the Grand Central Station.</span> <span id="s568">We would be smuggled into a transport.</span> <span id="s569">And that ...and he said, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s570">He has to be 8 o'clock...he has to go to Grand Central Station.</span> <span id="s571">Don't ask any questions he said.</span> <span id="s572">So when my husband come in, I said, "You have to be at 8 o'clock at Grand Central Station.</span> <span id="s573">Didn't know what...but he said, "I will be go.”</span> <span id="s574">So you can imagine, I died a thousand deaths you know when he went at 8 o'clock.</span> <span id="s575">He came back at ll o'clock at night.</span> <span id="s576">And this is when he had to memorize the undersea port stations in which the English bombed...the ones with the Nazis...when the Germans wanted him to bomb.</span> <span id="s577">And this was the list from that was the head of the Underground in The Hague who had a blueprint and said my husband has to memorize that blueprint where where the U-boats are really built.</span> <span id="s578">And that he had to do.</span> <span id="s579">He had to memorize.</span> <span id="s580">You can imagine.</span> <span id="s581">In 2 hours!</span> <span id="s582">And then the men from The Hague, who was the head of The Hague put...put his paper again and said, "Good luck," and left with the blueprints and they were in my husband's mind.</span> <span id="s583">He didn't tell me what he had done, of course.</span> <span id="s584">I heard it only then in...in Spain because he was so desperate that he could lose the memory of that.</span> <span id="s585">Imagine, in they will be delivered…But he said the man from The Hague said, "We waited for you.</span> <span id="s586">We had to have somebody with memory and brains.”</span> <span id="s587">So that...so that was the last thing, and then the next morning we went to the station.</span> <span id="s588">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s589">My mother was standing in a corner.</span> <span id="s590">My brother was standing in a corner, and then we went into a train.</span> <span id="s591">That is it.</span> <span id="s592">And that was goodbye.</span> <span id="s593">Goodbye.</span> <span id="s594">Goodbye.</span> <span id="s595">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s596">And then we went the train.</span> <span id="s597">Halfway on the way to Brussels the door opens and out comes a very tall, good-looking German officer.</span> <span id="s598">I think his name was Mr. ”Von Hagen, Colonel von Hagen• or something.</span> <span id="s599">He bowed to me and he said, "Mrs. Model, I have to borrow your husband.”</span> <span id="s600">And he was a German officer.</span> <span id="s601">He said, "Don't be afraid.</span> <span id="s602">I would like to talk to him.”</span> <span id="s603">My husband had to go.</span> <span id="s604">I was sitting in that train.</span> <span id="s605">My children got frightened.</span> <span id="s606">You can't imagine how awful that was.</span> <span id="s607">After 20 minutes, he came again and that was the man who had just heard the name Model.</span> <span id="s608">He had heard about my husband, and he always wanted to know whether we are a family of a German General from Model.</span> <span id="s609">And my husband said...I am not s family...we knew who we were, of course... I am not, and now and please let me go back to my wife.</span> <span id="s610">She will die a thousand deaths because she went through quite a lot.</span> <span id="s611">So he said, "Mr. Model, I only wanted to say you we heard so much about you and I am glad I met you," and he let him go.</span> <span id="s612">Now that same Mayor or whatever he was kept his hand about me because I had a little basket.</span> <span id="s613">The kids called it because it was a little basket which we had from our boat into which I put three little on this side.</span> <span id="s614">The books I had from my husband, and a few drawings I had made of my husband and my mother and a friend.</span> <span id="s615">There were in that little basket which the kids called you know because I carried it myself.</span> <span id="s616">So wherever we stopped in Paris...in...first in Brussels...in Paris and we had to go out and walk a little bit, this Gestapo man who was with that ....</span> <span id="s617">with that German officer came over to me and said, "Open that basket.”</span> <span id="s618">And every time he said it, that officer came said, "Leave her alone.”</span> <span id="s619">That went on four times.</span> <span id="s620">Four times he kept his hand over me.</span> <span id="s621">He said, "Leave her alone.”</span> <span id="s622">But in when he said goodbye, he came over.</span> <span id="s623">He said, "I kept my hand...hand over you Mrs. Model.</span> <span id="s624">What is in that basket?"</span> <span id="s625">I said, "You could have opened it.</span> <span id="s626">There are books, .</span> <span id="s627">But I didn't...I was glad he didn't, because when we opened on the boat these books because friends wanted to see it again, out fall drawings which a friend from Paris had made about Hitler and poems.</span> <span id="s628">Imagine that!</span> <span id="s629">That was my luck that he didn't force me to open that...that basket.</span> <span id="s630">That was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s631">I wish I had...I could thank him.</span> <span id="s632">Yeah.</span> <span id="s633">So then we were in Lisbon...in Madrid.</span> <span id="s634">In Madrid, you know we could only met because....</span> <span id="s635">Yeah, I forgot.</span> <span id="s636">When we arrived in Sandebastian, we were led to a hotel, and hardly had we entered that hotel when a young Dutchman come over and said, "Mr. Model, the Embassy from Madrid has already called three times.</span> <span id="s637">You have to call back.</span> <span id="s638">They have to talk to you immediately.”</span> <span id="s639">So my husband called back.</span> <span id="s640">It was the Embassy, and the Ambassador said, "I was told that you bring news.</span> <span id="s641">Please, tomorrow, you...you come to Madrid.”</span> <span id="s642">My husband said, "I cannot do that.</span> <span id="s643">I cannot just leave her.</span> <span id="s644">I have no visa.</span> <span id="s645">They knew that we had to.</span> <span id="s646">"But you will get it.”</span> <span id="s647">So next day came the Dutch Consul from Optowa.</span> <span id="s648">I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s649">They're lovely old people there who had no visa.</span> <span id="s650">Of course, my husband said you have to get them a visa to Spain too.</span> <span id="s651">And he came, and it took 4 days until we got permission from the...from the Spanish ”thing• to travel through Spain to Madrid.</span> <span id="s652">And then we were in Lubrick, and he dumped us in the , and he said, "You sit here.</span> <span id="s653">If I come back after 2 hours,"...He had a funny feeling...I couldn't get...get rid of my knowledge.</span> <span id="s654">"If I'm stay a longer it's fine, but you have patience, and he dumped us in .</span> <span id="s655">The kids run around the of course, and I was sitting at with these other people also.</span> <span id="s656">And he came after 2 hours, looked terrible and said, "I couldn't talk to him.”</span> <span id="s657">When I enter he came over to me, "Ah how wonderful the ... He said, "Ah, you know that I play golf with the German ambassador all the time.</span> <span id="s658">He's such a nice man.”</span> <span id="s659">When my husband heard that, he said, "For God's sake," so he didn't tell them about the , but he had knowledge of a few other things and he told them that.</span> <span id="s660">And the officer said, "Yes, but have told that bring out the most important news about Underground.</span> <span id="s661">No?"</span> <span id="s662">Max said, "That must have been an error," you know.</span> <span id="s663">And he came to me and he said, "My God, if the man is Lisbon is the same caliber, I have to call America with my knowledge and then it's too late.</span> <span id="s664">But the man in Lisbon was wonderful.</span> <span id="s665">My husband spend the whole week with who was the Under Secretary and when we were on the boat he heard on the radio then...on the ship's radio...that the Dutch replaced and the from became the Ambassador.</span> <span id="s666">That was...he never knew....that baron never knew that it was the little Jew from Amsterdam who cost him his post.</span> <span id="s667">Yeah?</span> <span id="s668">Isn't that?</span> <span id="s669">The...the turn of events is just miraculous in a way, you know?</span> <span id="s670">It's just...you can't believe it sometimes.</span> <span id="s671">Yeah.</span> <span id="s672">And then we landed in Lisbon.</span> <span id="s673">It was nice to be there.</span> <span id="s674">You could breathe again.</span> <span id="s675">The kids liked it, and he worked with the Embassy every day.</span> <span id="s676">Yeah.</span> <span id="s677">And then friends...they learned the boat was , which was a boat for 150 people where there were 500 on the boat, you know, all refugees.</span> <span id="s678">All refugees, of course, some spies too.</span> <span id="s679">We were five in a cabin.</span> <span id="s680">We paid three thousand dollars which was sent from America.</span> <span id="s681">My sister-in-law sent the money for the boat to pay for.</span> <span id="s682">We paid.</span> <span id="s683">Some didn't you know.</span> <span id="s684">There was a whole bottom of the boat was full with...with...uh...young immigrants from all over and they, of course...they didn't pay a penny, but we were...we could pay so therefore we pay.</span> <span id="s685">Huh?</span> <span id="s686">And there was guy ”•on the boat behaved very badly.</span> <span id="s687">His wife at least.</span> <span id="s688">He didn't.</span> <span id="s689">And the Rabbi from Luxembourg, we were elite there, we were first class because we paid.</span> <span id="s690">But this couple who had money with no refugees, the son-in-law of the conductor, , and lovely wife and son and I think and then, of course, it spoke around immediately that my husband does bring from the bottom of the bunk, and a Dutchman.</span> <span id="s691">Everyday the kids...he organized those kids so they put the food which were above the table and put them down because they didn't get any food you know.</span> <span id="s692">The people down there was organized.</span> <span id="s693">Every day the kids went down and...and did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Your husband told them to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s696">We got more...we got food...more food, but our food too to divide too.</span> <span id="s697">But then one day that young man came, that Dutchman came and said a baby was born.</span> <span id="s698">And it's terrible amongst these many people.</span> <span id="s699">It's terrible...the wife...the young wife of a young Russian or Polish violinist...I cannot forget it.</span> <span id="s700">"We must have a room.</span> <span id="s701">We must have a room.”</span> <span id="s702">So my husband started and we go to because they had a living room on the boat.</span> <span id="s703">They had a saloon on the boat.</span> <span id="s704">He said, Mr. , you have to give up your saloon.</span> <span id="s705">She said, "I can't.”</span> <span id="s706">He said, "Why can't you?"</span> <span id="s707">"I have to receive people.”</span> <span id="s708">My husband said, "Whom do you receive?</span> <span id="s709">I won't come anyway.”</span> <span id="s710">Do you receive the Rabbi of Luxembourg, and Mr. and Mrs. something on the ?"</span> <span id="s711">No, she couldn't give her room.</span> <span id="s712">So that was number one.</span> <span id="s713">Then, he went to the Luxembourg Rabbi and he said, "I can't give it this room.</span> <span id="s714">A friend of my wife is living there.”</span> <span id="s715">Then he went...of course, the people who had no living room and wanted out of first class...our friends wanted to give their bathroom, everything.</span> <span id="s716">But you couldn't then.</span> <span id="s717">Then the purser came to my husband who had observed my husband of course, and said, "You know, Mr. Model.</span> <span id="s718">I give him...give them my room because I saw how tough it is.”</span> <span id="s719">So that young of wife then came to the purser's room.</span> <span id="s720">I give you these little sketches.</span> <span id="s721">Everything is the purest truth what I tell you, not that I want to make up, but it's true.</span> <span id="s722">It is true.</span> <span id="s723">So that young baby was looked after in the purser's room on top of the ship and not in the bottom of the ship.</span> <span id="s724">Yeah.</span> <span id="s725">So that was....I was so happy when was permitted in the radio room than the room of ”Sandam•.</span> <span id="s726">And Madrid was replaced by that one he had made.</span> <span id="s727">So he was very happy and he became....” • became the Ambassador.</span> <span id="s728">No?</span> <span id="s729">That's another story.</span> <span id="s730">Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: On the ship can you...On the ship can you tell us about Shigall himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: No, I mean...I he was...he had nothing to say.</span> <span id="s733">Bella was everything you know.</span> <span id="s734">Bella was the ruler and she...she was standing on the bottom on the...on the rung.</span> <span id="s735">I was sick.</span> <span id="s736">I wasn't up very much.</span> <span id="s737">She said, "My daughter, my daughter, My daughter.”</span> <span id="s738">"What about your daughter?"</span> <span id="s739">"Eva is still in Paris.”</span> <span id="s740">Of course, Eva is a very nice person.</span> <span id="s741">I later met her.</span> <span id="s742">I helped her when she was in New York.</span> <span id="s743">Very nice woman.</span> <span id="s744">And she was married at that time and couldn't get, but she came out and that was her whole complaint.</span> <span id="s745">Only that Eva comes out.</span> <span id="s746">But he didn't say much I mean.</span> <span id="s747">She run around with a book on her back so my husband said, "Why do you run around with that book?"</span> <span id="s748">Do you think some people can buy....” You know he was...he had a..</span> <span id="s749">.</span> <span id="s750">he had, but Bella, Bella and later we saw them in New York a few times and he was always very apologetic you know, and I liked meeting him.</span> <span id="s751">The daughter came and I liked her very much.</span> <span id="s752">She was a few times in my house and her husband was selling.</span> <span id="s753">Bags full of sketch, not sketch, but were etchings and she went from rich people to rich.</span> <span id="s754">Sometime she came to me to have lunch.</span> <span id="s755">She's a wonderful daughter, and she sewed for him them at that time.</span> <span id="s756">You can imagine later it was different by that time.</span> <span id="s757">Just had to get money.</span> <span id="s758">He was brought over by the Cultural Mission or something but they...of course they paid for his apartment I'm sure but...so she sold these books which she got.</span> <span id="s759">She's a wonderful daughter.</span> <span id="s760">Really.</span> <span id="s761">Really wonderful.</span> <span id="s762">He was a…He couldn't say anything.</span> <span id="s763">He was rude by here.</span> <span id="s764">And then one day I see him in the street and he cried.</span> <span id="s765">She had died, and he was desperate.</span> <span id="s766">Then shortly afterwards he fell in with a young English girl.</span> <span id="s767">It wasn't so terrible you know.</span> <span id="s768">But he was a nice man.</span> <span id="s769">He was just a weak man you know.</span> <span id="s770">I had nothing against him.</span> <span id="s771">And Eva was wonderful.</span> <span id="s772">I saw her later when she married .</span> <span id="s773">Very nice.</span> <span id="s774">Had two boys, so she was very very nice woman.</span> <span id="s775">Eda.</span> <span id="s776">She was very rich, but she also gives.</span> <span id="s777">She was not like her father was, stingy.</span> <span id="s778">She gives.</span> <span id="s779">She gives pictures here and there.</span> <span id="s780">I admire her very much.</span> <span id="s781">Very nice, very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: So you were...back on the boat.</span> <span id="s783">Are there other stories about the boat trip that you would like to tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s785">One day I was bed.</span> <span id="s786">I had high fever, and I heard singing and I went down.</span> <span id="s787">There were a few Viennese young boys with ”Leader• and I went up to one and I said, "Aren't you ashamed?</span> <span id="s788">You sing a song of Vienna.</span> <span id="s789">There your grandfather cleaning their streets.”</span> <span id="s790">He looked at me.</span> <span id="s791">He said, "So I sang But two young girls came down and said, "Oh excuse us because it was so rude and stupid of that man and I was perfectly right and she will see that I don't sing any…That's what he sang all the time with his guitar.</span> <span id="s792">So that was another thing, but he didn't sing it anymore.</span> <span id="s793">Yeah.</span> <span id="s794">About...about...because you asked me about the boat.</span> <span id="s795">Yeah.</span> <span id="s796">Otherwise, the kids had a lovely time and somebody tried to teach them the...the national anthem and they had a good time and my son, my older son, who had so much tears when his father was in...in prison and later in Paris when he had to go away.</span> <span id="s797">He cried and cried but then he comes to me and there was my old, smiling lovely boy who was his old self.</span> <span id="s798">He had...it was a miracle.</span> <span id="s799">There was...his father was there.</span> <span id="s800">He didn't have to be afraid that they come and take his father.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Let's back up.</span> <span id="s802">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s803">Explain about coming into New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s805">I forgot.</span> <span id="s806">I have to tell you that of course.</span> <span id="s807">We landed in Staten Island, and there were...my sister in law and some friends, and he had taken an apartment in Fifth Avenue so we could go there and the kids started immediately to...it's wonderful for them.</span> <span id="s808">You know, the high skyscrapers and everything.</span> <span id="s809">They loved it.</span> <span id="s810">And, of course, it was terribly hot but nothing was bad.</span> <span id="s811">It was so wonderful to be in America you know.</span> <span id="s812">That was it.</span> <span id="s813">My husband got immediately a job, and that was also wonderful and so we stayed for a few week and a month in that Fifth Avenue apartment and then I looked around and found....and then we had to go up Riverside Drive at night to see somebody who asked him to see...I don't know who it was...and we stepped out of Riverside Drive on Seventy Second street, and I look around and I said, "It's lovely here.”</span> <span id="s814">And I see...on the other side, I see something that looked like an apartment to...rent.</span> <span id="s815">I went over and this was the apartment I rented.</span> <span id="s816">Just like that.</span> <span id="s817">First one, and I rented it the next day.</span> <span id="s818">That was...yeah...and I'm still there.</span> <span id="s819">Yeah.</span> <span id="s820">Now asked me some questions.</span> <span id="s821">I talk and talk because but please.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s823">What is it like...uh...for you...uh...a young artist young artist with a husband and children first seeing the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Well, as an artist, I mean I thought nothing but these two little things, but I wanted my children to get out of New York.</span> <span id="s825">I wanted them to learn English without an accent because I had seen in Holland when the children lived with their parents, they had an accent.</span> <span id="s826">They learned it.</span> <span id="s827">But then a friend of ours...I said I have to get them in a school outside of New York until a friend of ours she got us the addresses.</span> <span id="s828">And one afternoon when the kids...I put them in a camp....you know we had friends who had told us about a camp, so the kids were in a camp already after a week.</span> <span id="s829">Just gave me tips you know.</span> <span id="s830">There...You have to have a friend, you know…was one of them then you know, and I went then...we got a telephone call.</span> <span id="s831">A young man came and said and said we should come out on Sunday.</span> <span id="s832">And I said, "We will do that of course.”</span> <span id="s833">And it was very chancy little man.</span> <span id="s834">He was…He was sent....I said, "Yeah.</span> <span id="s835">Sent to look us over.”</span> <span id="s836">He said, Yes.”</span> <span id="s837">And he stumbled over a table where some photographs...the only thing I could take were photographs and the photograph fell down.</span> <span id="s838">He said, "Who did that?"</span> <span id="s839">I said, "I did.”</span> <span id="s840">He said, "Oh, Mrs. Model, your children are in because our chairman ”•is one of the big publishers and he loved children of artists.</span> <span id="s841">So it was.</span> <span id="s842">I came there and they immediately got accepted.</span> <span id="s843">Of course, my older one immediately was...in spite of he didn't know English he was in short time on top of his class.</span> <span id="s844">It's just fabulous.</span> <span id="s845">Peter always was was very intelligent, but immediately on top and loved and adored by the others.</span> <span id="s846">And ” was...he's like that.</span> <span id="s847">So that was from the beginning and I had a wonderful time in the boarding school outside of New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: What was the adjustment like for you and your husband in the first year.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: We got a scholarship, by the way.</span> <span id="s850">That's what I wanted to tell you.</span> <span id="s851">I was adjusted immediately.</span> <span id="s852">I didn't have any trouble whatsoever.</span> <span id="s853">I felt at home.</span> <span id="s854">I spoke English, of course, and my husband spoke English and we were immediately...we...we immediately felt that's where we wanted to be.</span> <span id="s855">We had some American friends and that was wonderful.</span> <span id="s856">And it was no trouble.</span> <span id="s857">I mean I..</span> <span id="s858">.</span> <span id="s859">just wonderful, so we took…And that's it.</span> <span id="s860">I can't say anything but perfect results.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: What work did your husband do?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: My husband was in the banking brokering business.</span> <span id="s863">But he had a..</span> <span id="s864">.</span> <span id="s865">was a specialist.</span> <span id="s866">He was something very special also in that because after his work and somebody come to me in America and said, "You know I made a study of your husband's brain and I saw there were only 18 people in America who could do what he did," but I never knew what he did.</span> <span id="s867">So that was a little exaggerated, but it was surely truth.</span> <span id="s868">And he could work immediately, and it was very important.</span> <span id="s869">And people were awfully nice, Americans...the Americans we knew, but for one.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Turn back.</span> <span id="s871">When you talked that the FBI had called your husband at some point.</span> <span id="s872">Could you explain about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s874">That was very strange.</span> <span id="s875">He gets a telephone call.</span> <span id="s876">I must not forget to say something.</span> <span id="s877">When we were in Staten Island and that immigration officer interrogated us didn't want to let us in because we had no hotel.</span> <span id="s878">We had only , which was address of my husband's office business.</span> <span id="s879">And he said nobody lives on .</span> <span id="s880">My husband said, "I know.</span> <span id="s881">My family and my friends are down there.</span> <span id="s882">They will tell us where we live.</span> <span id="s883">I can't lie to you," he said.</span> <span id="s884">"I can't tell you I live in that hotel where we were before, but I have no address.</span> <span id="s885">This is business.”</span> <span id="s886">And he was very nice.</span> <span id="s887">But then finally my husband took out his Dutch career papers and he said, "Why didn't you tell me before?"</span> <span id="s888">He said, "I didn't need to.</span> <span id="s889">I have a perfectly valid passport with a perfectly valid visa," which was true.</span> <span id="s890">And he didn't want to do it, but then he had to do it.</span> <span id="s891">And so that was the reception.</span> <span id="s892">And then we were boat...the boat left us to Manhattan skyline and we saw it was beautiful, Staten Island.</span> <span id="s893">Not Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s894">It was Staten Island.</span> <span id="s895">Yeah.</span> <span id="s896">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s897">We were at home.</span> <span id="s898">The kids were at home immediately.</span> <span id="s899">There is no doubt.</span> <span id="s900">My youngest son said to me...after a week, he said to me, "Mamma, can you believe...if I tell my friends in Holland that I am accustomed to skyscrapers, they wouldn't believe it.”</span> <span id="s901">I'll never can forget he said that.</span> <span id="s902">It's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Tell me about the FBI.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Oh, yes, so the FBI knew of course then through this immigration thing that he was a Dutch career you see.</span> <span id="s905">So they approached him and said they trust him.</span> <span id="s906">Could they use him to be their...when they need...when they need something to know about Holland and all that.”</span> <span id="s907">So that was when they called him, very often.</span> <span id="s908">And about people whom they had, you know...and my husband, of course, never said anything negative about the people.</span> <span id="s909">Then, afterall, we didn't know them.</span> <span id="s910">We only know one friend and we said he's a very rick and wonderful man.</span> <span id="s911">But this is way asked.</span> <span id="s912">He never told me really what they asked him, but he went constantly.</span> <span id="s913">In the first year, he was constantly called to help them because they trusted him.</span> <span id="s914">He was a Dutch career.</span> <span id="s915">They believed.</span> <span id="s916">And they saw the papers you know.</span> <span id="s917">So that was very good, of course.</span> <span id="s918">And I..</span> <span id="s919">.</span> <span id="s920">when we suddenly became citizen, he was...you know I talk a lot, and then he said But my husband always warned her, "Mina, you get yourself in deep water.</span> <span id="s921">Don't do that."</span> <span id="s922">Mr. Roosevelt was in there too, but he was a leftist organization.</span> <span id="s923">Don't forget you must tell these interrogation officers for the citizenship, you must tell them that you were a member of these things.</span> <span id="s924">He was so asked me, "Did you belong to any organizations.”</span> <span id="s925">"Yes," I said, I belonged to that but I left after 2 years.</span> <span id="s926">That was true.</span> <span id="s927">They knew everything.</span> <span id="s928">And he knew that.</span> <span id="s929">Through the FBI, he knew.</span> <span id="s930">They would ask everything.</span> <span id="s931">So I was safe.</span> <span id="s932">I wouldn't have thought about it, that I was a member once.</span> <span id="s933">But that was the truth and I was so happy.</span> <span id="s934">And they were very nice because I was not a member any more.</span> <span id="s935">All these little things come back now when you ask it you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Is there anything else you would like to add to your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: To that?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: To any of it.</span></p>

don't...I don't want to remember so much about that now.</span> <span id="s944">We were free of them and, of course, I left my family and all of them.</span> <span id="s945">That was tragic and terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: How did you lose your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: In the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s948">She was there.</span> <span id="s949">And my brother was sent away and the kids were sent away.</span> <span id="s950">This is my book then, in this book.</span> <span id="s951">It was terrifying.</span> <span id="s952">It was terrible, of course, and my husband's sister died in…That was the other thing, and.</span> <span id="s953">.</span> <span id="s954">uh...after the war....ah...you know, it's really...we should...we started a new life, and we were very happy here.</span> <span id="s955">The kids were happy here.</span> <span id="s956">My husband was happy here too.</span> <span id="s957">It's only terribly that I had to lose him so early.</span> <span id="s958">But otherwise, it was a wonderful life.</span> <span id="s959">We had nice friends, and I had my...my work.</span> <span id="s960">You asked me about my

<span id="s969">That's it.</span> <span id="s970">America was good to us and is good to us.</span> <span id="s971">So what more do you want?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Can you think of anything
