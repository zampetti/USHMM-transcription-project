<p><span id="s17">Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">On Dec 7, 1941 I was in Mawui.</span> <span id="s19">I lived in the country and did not hear about it until I went to the city to go shopping.</span> <span id="s20">I consider myself American.</span> <span id="s21">We speak Japanese at home.</span> <span id="s22">I did not experience prejudice.</span> <span id="s23">I heard people say Japs when I went to the city.</span> <span id="s24">In my part of the Island I did not hear anything like that.</span> <span id="s25">We lived as</span></p> <p><span id="s26">before.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">As Japanese we did the manual work.</span> <span id="s28">After the war white people did manual jobs and some educated Japanese Americans had big jobs.</span> <span id="s29">The younger ones of course want more, they think they are just as good.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">We were more accepting.</span> <span id="s31">When Japanese Americans came home from the war they had better opportunities for education than before the war.</span> <span id="s32">Times were changing.</span> <span id="s33">Many of our better educated citizens got</span></p> <p><span id="s34">top jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">With regard to relocation camps, priests, reverends of Buddhist faith, principals of schools were taken away by the FBI to relocation camps because they were people of Japanese background, educated in Japan and I presume they were taken because they had some connection with Japan.</span> <span id="s36">In the country, we lived as before.</span> <span id="s37">My sister had a friend in Santa Barbara who wrote us she was in a relocation camp.</span> <span id="s38">After the war she came to Hawaii.</span> <span id="s39">She visited me and then these things came out.</span> <span id="s40">Her father had a drycleaning business.</span> <span id="s41">They had to practically give it away or leave it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">I do not remember what the reaction of my familuy was to this news.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">They had worked so hard to get what they had and she had planned to go to college.</span> <span id="s44">I do not remember what happened after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">I do not think it could happen in Hawaii.</span> <span id="s46">Where would they take us.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">There were too many of us.</span> <span id="s48">It never occurred to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">From the seventh grade on my daughter Phyllis wanted to study archeology.</span> <span id="s50">The principal told me I have to work very hard because she will have to go to school for ten years to be an archeologust.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">I worked in the school cafeteria.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Archeology meant Israel to her.</span> <span id="s53">She studied Hebrew in Hawaii University and when she graduated went to Hebrew University.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">I do not remember anything about the Holocaust until my daughter started to work with the Jewish Federation.</span> <span id="s55">Phyllis is going from one Kibbutz to another.</span> <span id="s56">While at Hebrew University she worked part time for the Jewish Federation.</span> <span id="s57">They offered her a full time job as a receptionist after she finished college.</span> <span id="s58">She was a fine art major.</span> <span id="s59">She left Israel in 1979 and came back in the summer of 1980.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">She went to Dachau.</span> <span id="s61">I forgot a lot of what she said.</span> <span id="s62">She had a roommate in Israel from Skokie, Ill. whose parents were in the Holocaust and through her she wanted to visit a concentration camp on the way from from Israel.</span> <span id="s63">She went to Dachau.</span> <span id="s64">My husband was interested in what the people suffered and Phyllis was very</span></p> <p><span id="s65">sympathetic to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">When the children got bigger they asked my husband questions about his war experiences, and he told them and they were very</span></p> <p><span id="s67">interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Did he tell them about the relocation camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">My second son went to visit one of the relocation camps.</span> <span id="s71">He said it was bleak, cold, desert.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">I never saw those camps.</span> <span id="s73">My husband did talk about it when they</span></p> <p><span id="s74">asked questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">When Phyllis worked for the Jewish Federation, she attended the Anniversary of the Holocaust and we went with her for the past 5 years.</span> <span id="s76">We try to make it each year to remember the Holocaust survivors and at the service, the speaker talks about what had been done and what we should do that that people will not forget.</span> <span id="s77">My daughter was also asked to help out with the Independence Day of Israel Celebration.</span> <span id="s78">She makes posters and helps them.</span> <span id="s79">We have gone with her to Israeli Independence Day Celebrations.</span> <span id="s80">My daughter is in Israel now and we go every year whether she is here or not.</span> <span id="s81">I think it is important for the Jewish people otherwise people will not understand what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">With regard to the extermination of the Jewish it is hard to believe that such a thing happened.</span> <span id="s83">Maybe that is why people do not believe it.</span> <span id="s84">If we do not keep it up I guess in the next generation or one following that there will be no one who can remember these things.</span> <span id="s85">I believe that because Phyllis had friends whose parents were survivors, we came to understand what happened.</span> <span id="s86">My son was living is Skokie, Ill, he met survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">.</span> <span id="s88">END.</span></p></body></html>
