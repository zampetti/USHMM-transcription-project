city in between Wilna on the Dutchna called Garadock.</span> <span id="s19">My father had his business there, and he was a very good situated man there, he made a very nice living.</span> <span id="s20">And we kids went to Hebrew school, and we had a life of luxury because my father wasn’t a poor man, and he tried to give his kids, that’s all what he had was me and my brother Meyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: What kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: My father had like collecting all kind of shmutas and transferring this to factories which it was made to paper.</span> <span id="s23">Was a educated man, good-hearted man, and a man that did not live for him -- for himself.</span> <span id="s24">I meet people today and they are telling me stories of my father that I never knew because I was too young to know him so well.</span> <span id="s25">When they were in need, when they couldn’t return the money, if they borrowed, or what -- whoever had to get married, or whoever was poor and -- and they could not afford, my father was always with the wide smile and a -- and a open hand to help the people.</span> <span id="s26">And a lot of people were supported by him, by -- by [indecipherable] helping hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What areas and villages did he work in?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: He didn’t.</span> <span id="s29">He had big storage rooms where people worked for him, they used to collect the shmutas from all around the villages, and once a week bring it to him.</span> <span id="s30">This was a Friday, when they were paid, and they had for Shabbas.</span> <span id="s31">So a whole week from Monday til Friday, those people were always, you know, out of the house from one village to the other village.</span> <span id="s32">They used to -- how should I tell you -- they used to let my father trade things.</span> <span id="s33">They traded soap, they traded some kitchen stuff, other stuff for the shmutas.</span> <span id="s34">The peasant needed this because he used to get a chit, he couldn’t afford to buy this in the city, and they got, instead, the -- the -- the merchandise that was what my father used to supply them, that they bought from my father, he didn’t supply them.</span> <span id="s35">But there always were more on the books.</span> <span id="s36">Oh, oh, oh, and they paid.</span> <span id="s37">But once a week that they used to come and he used to make with them, you know, a settlement, how much you owe me, how much I owe you.</span> <span id="s38">And this was the day, Friday, when he settled with them always.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: What was your home life and the role of your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: We were very, very -- that’s all what we were is two kids.</span> <span id="s41">And they [indecipherable] over us, you know, the best clothes, the best toys.</span> <span id="s42">My father used to travel a lot so everything was bought from -- from the big cities like Warsaw, like ma -- like Bialystok, like Wilna.</span> <span id="s43">And all this -- the -- all the little town used to come ra -- to me, because I had toys that nobody else had.</span> <span id="s44">But there was never a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s45">My mother always used to say, come, come, doesn’t matter that it’s her toys, it -- right now it’s yours, come and play with it.</span> <span id="s46">And you know, that they didn’t know even that here are the people in the States, that you -- my mother used to refer to them, come in, you don’t have to stay behind the window, come in.</span> <span id="s47">The -- nothing will happen to the doll, we won’t be mad at you, go in and play with the doll.</span> <span id="s48">And up to date, I never knew -- I am not a type to -- to talk and to share my experience, and to -- to say who I was.</span> <span id="s49">Take me what I am now.</span> <span id="s50">And I -- but there are people that tell my friends, oh my God, she never told you that?</span> <span id="s51">She never said nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Then what happened as you got a little older?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: As I got older, my bigger brother, he was six years older, Henry Meyer, our whole family was in Bialystok and around Bialystok in the little towns.</span> <span id="s54">My grandfather, my grandmother, my aunts, my uncles.</span> <span id="s55">And he went there to high school, of course it was a Hebrew high school, my father was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s56">He liked very much Israel, and he liked his kids should know a perfect Hebrew.</span> <span id="s57">So he went to -- I went to a public school, a Hebrew school, which my teacher is still in Israel now.</span> <span id="s58">And -- and he went, finished it eight cla -- eight grades, and he went to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s59">My parents hand him to -- to the family, to stay with them.</span> <span id="s60">And I was still finishing up public school.</span> <span id="s61">The last year of his graduation from high school, I entered high school, to Bialystok, they send me.</span> <span id="s62">He finished and they send me.</span> <span id="s63">In the first half a year, when I came home for Hanukkah, for vacation -- and I will say we had the first phone in the whole little town.</span> <span id="s64">Had a phone in the -- my father’s business, and we had a phone home.</span> <span id="s65">And -- I’m sorry, the druggist had a phone.</span> <span id="s66">And as I was sitting and doing my homework, I heard a call.</span> <span id="s67">I knew that you cannot get too many calls there.</span> <span id="s68">And they said, comes -- hurry, come with the doctor, your mother passed -- fainted.</span> <span id="s69">And my father was playing checkers my neighbor next door.</span> <span id="s70">So I call him.</span> <span id="s71">I still remember how I climbed the -- climbed the stairs.</span> <span id="s72">I got such a weakness in my -- being so young, in my knees, because the doctor was some very high steps.</span> <span id="s73">You had to climb the steps and I just couldn’t get on the steps.</span> <span id="s74">So on four I climbed the step screaming, my mother -- I didn’t say my mother fainted, I said, “My mother’s dying, my mother’s dying.”</span> <span id="s75">It was too late.</span> <span id="s76">He came there, you know, it wasn’t a long distance to -- to drive or to walk, is -- was -- it’s -- everything was very close.</span> <span id="s77">But my mother fell off the chair and that was it.</span> <span id="s78">Never saw.</span> <span id="s79">In fact, when we brought her home, she was so warm because she was fresh dressed.</span> <span id="s80">And my mother was a very elegant woman.</span> <span id="s81">With the lipstick on her lips, I never -- I didn’t let her to put -- I -- I did not let to put her in the floor because I didn’t believe that she is dead.</span> <span id="s82">And from there on my trouble started.</span> <span id="s83">My brother returned to finish his schooling, to get his m -- his -- what do you get, diploma?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: His degree, and -- and I had to remain home.</span> <span id="s86">And that summer -- and my father, on top of everything got very sick.</span> <span id="s87">He didn’t take any food, he was a heavy smoker.</span> <span id="s88">He was transferred to [indecipherable] to a place where they tried to feed him very often, and you know, things that had -- had a lot of calories like a lot of butter and just to -- his intestines were terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s89">He was there seven months.</span> <span id="s90">So, in other words, besides the girl that worked for us and -- for so many years, I had no mother, I had no father.</span> <span id="s91">But my mother’s brother stayed with us to watch me.</span> <span id="s92">And he took care of some of the business and then my father’s brother used to come to take care on the business.</span> <span id="s93">And this -- there was no life already, this -- everything was, you know, went to pieces.</span> <span id="s94">And my har -- my father was there seven months until he returned home.</span> <span id="s95">And at the meantime, I went already to my aunt -- aunt’s -- to his sister, to my father’s sisters, to Bialystok, because I entered school bo -- baca -- my brother finished and I entered.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: So you were going to school during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Right, and my bro --</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: And what else did you do -- what else did you do during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Nothing much, I had -- my family was very big in Bialystok, I had a lot of young cousins.</span> <span id="s100">You know, everybody -- when you get to be already beaten but [indecipherable] with no mother, with no father, father was sick, we didn’t know what the -- tomorrow will bring.</span> <span id="s101">Ye --</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: You were how -- you were how old at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: 13.</span> <span id="s104">13.</span> <span id="s105">My mother died exact on my birth -- my 13th birthday.</span> <span id="s106">So I stayed a whole year there with my aunts.</span> <span id="s107">I was very thin, I was sick.</span> <span id="s108">I couldn’t take any food, I was vomiting.</span> <span id="s109">My aunts had full hands with me.</span> <span id="s110">For the summertime, my brother came to take me, they didn’t trust me to come home myself.</span> <span id="s111">So he took a sleeping train, I should be -- and I vomit a lot when I was traveling, so he was afraid to let me travel just like that.</span> <span id="s112">So he took me in the sleeping train, and we came home.</span> <span id="s113">Before we had to -- we didn’t have a station.</span> <span id="s114">Like here, you come, you take a cab, you go to -- from the airport, straight.</span> <span id="s115">We had to travel from my town.</span> <span id="s116">We had a man that used to pick us up by wagon and horse.</span> <span id="s117">So he was waiting [indecipherable] about 30 kilometers -- 50 kilometers from -- from -- from my town.</span> <span id="s118">And he used to bring us home.</span> <span id="s119">He knew -- he worked for us f -- for my father for so many years.</span> <span id="s120">And this was star -- we are supposed to meet the man to take us home, my brother said, you know, “We’ll make a stop here in --in this little town Moladetchna.”</span> <span id="s121">Said, “What for?”</span> <span id="s122">“Oh, I want to introduce you to somebody.”</span> <span id="s123">He was afraid to tell me because I wouldn’t go home.</span> <span id="s124">He knew that I cannot have a su-substitute for my mother, he knew my attitude.</span> <span id="s125">So he was afraid that I won’t come home for the summer.</span> <span id="s126">But so close to home, where will I go, I cannot go back already.</span> <span id="s127">So he decided that he’ll tell me.</span> <span id="s128">My father, returning from his convalescent home, wherever he was, at the train he met a woman from Wilna which was a divorcee with a child -- with a son three years older than I. And my father was a ga -- a very good looking man, very handsome and with a lot of money, so what’s bad about?</span> <span id="s129">She was a very smart cookie.</span> <span id="s130">She knew how to take him in, and [indecipherable] and -- and my brother knew about it, and to me they didn’t say until I will meet her.</span> <span id="s131">Sure, in the first time she was very nice, tried to impress me.</span> <span id="s132">But I do -- didn’t stay there more, I just couldn’t picture somebody taking my mom’s place.</span> <span id="s133">And we stayed there a day or two and we went home.</span> <span id="s134">And then slowly, slowly, she start to come visiting and I knew that it’s something more than a plain visit.</span> <span id="s135">You know, I wasn’t really baby baby.</span> <span id="s136">And I saw my father’s attitude, he was in ba -- he was in bad shape, he didn’t -- he wanted to do so much for his kids.</span> <span id="s137">And in the same token, I guess he fell in love.</span> <span id="s138">Which I could swear, and anybody else that knew him, that this could never happen after -- because s-such a life that he had with my mother, you don’t see, you don’t hear.</span> <span id="s139">And that was -- and that was it.</span> <span id="s140">Then slowly, slowly, now this was ’39 already, close to the 40’s, the Russian come in.</span> <span id="s141">My father was already the -- they wanted him, they were watching him, he couldn’t do this, he couldn’t do this.</span> <span id="s142">Everything is capitalism, everything is richness, and -- and he -- he cannot have any [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s143">E-Every day they found something else to a -- to blame him.</span> <span id="s144">And he’s on --</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: And you were a child, were -- were you aware of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yeah, because I was -- I wasn’t really a stupid child, I was -- I knew.</span> <span id="s147">And I went through right, a lo -- a lot, I went through a lot.</span> <span id="s148">And my mother was a extremely intelligent woman, so was my father.</span> <span id="s149">He put in too much effort in their kids.</span> <span id="s150">I don’t know if shows today, but at that time it showed.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Were you still going to school then?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Ah, sure -- no, that time it was a mishmash.</span> <span id="s153">There was no schooling, there were -- the Poland went out, the Russian, it didn’t come in.</span> <span id="s154">There was a mishmash.</span> <span id="s155">As soon the Russian came and settled their government, I went back to school.</span> <span id="s156">And my father said he is not going to Siberia no matter what.</span> <span id="s157">If it won’t be today, it’s going to be tomorrow, but they are looking after him.</span> <span id="s158">And one night he picked up himself and he went, he said, you stay home, to my stepmother and her son, and I’ll go.</span> <span id="s159">In meantime she brought already -- she had in Wilna a s -- two sisters and a mother, and she brought them in, you know, to our town, to be closer to her.</span> <span id="s160">Why not support the whole family, only her?</span> <span id="s161">So they got to go our little town, and they got my -- my father got for them an apartment, not a big and luxurious apartment, but manageable.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: And the name of your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: This was in Grudeck up -- but this wasn’t in Grudeck, I -- I meant to say that this was in Lida, after we moved to Lida.</span> <span id="s164">And my father picked up himself and he went to look, if it wouldn’t be Lida it would be a different town.</span> <span id="s165">But he had a few people that he knew in Lida, so he decided he’ll go first there.</span> <span id="s166">Sure enough, he got, you know, in good times we would never pass that street.</span> <span id="s167">But he didn’t want to be showing, he didn’t want to be -- people should, you know, recognize him.</span> <span id="s168">He wanted to sit quiet, and have his meals and see what will -- will happen.</span> <span id="s169">And we left everything, and we moved to this town, to Lida with -- comparing our -- our conditions that we lived, with the help, and with the luxury and with -- with the -- with all kind of -- of what do you call this on the floor, the rugs, the Persian rugs, and all that going and it’s such a mess, it’s -- it was like th -- going in a stable.</span> <span id="s170">But we had no choice because my father wanted to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: How did you get from one town to the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: A wagon.</span> <span id="s173">Wagon [indecipherable] train, wagons.</span> <span id="s174">He hired somebody to transport us.</span> <span id="s175">[indecipherable] too many around we need to get our private belongings, we needed our clothes.</span> <span id="s176">We’re storing about furniture here and there, you know.</span> <span id="s177">But [indecipherable] we left everything, not -- and we didn’t take nothing.</span> <span id="s178">Our life went to pieces.</span> <span id="s179">It was nothing -- nothing left.</span> <span id="s180">But you know, when you are young, you don’t think, it won’t be today, it will be tomorrow and -- and -- and what’s doing about Germans?</span> <span id="s181">Who was telling me again about the war.</span> <span id="s182">I went back to school.</span> <span id="s183">My older brother didn’t -- couldn’t stay home, he didn’t like the way my stepmother handled me.</span> <span id="s184">He didn’t like -- every day she found something that I’m not doing right.</span> <span id="s185">That I’m not -- I don’t have the right friends -- I grew up with these friends.</span> <span id="s186">I went to school with them.</span> <span id="s187">They -- it -- vera -- you know where you come, you are two years old, and you grow u -- and you are f -- the -- 14 - 15, how can you desert them?</span> <span id="s188">And that’s one house next to the other, and that’s not that you have to take the car and drive.</span> <span id="s189">So when you look through the window you always saw somebody walking by, passing by, knocking in your door, knocking in your window.</span> <span id="s190">So she didn’t like this, she didn’t like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: So you’re [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: And -- and I got to be a slave, you know, already, do this, do that.</span> <span id="s193">I never -- I never washed a -- a sock in my life.</span> <span id="s194">I didn’t know I was -- I was so k -- they cared about so much I had to really -- was very, very spoiled.</span> <span id="s195">Very spoiled.</span> <span id="s196">Me and so my brother.</span> <span id="s197">When I was in Bialystok, Daddy used to come and open up accounts for me.</span> <span id="s198">Here, you should buy the fruit, here you should buy the chocolate, here sh -- you should buy the ice cream.</span> <span id="s199">So what did I do?</span> <span id="s200">Yeah, sure I did.</span> <span id="s201">But I didn’t eat, I brought the whole class to the -- to the stores, and then when [indecipherable] used to come, take care of all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Then what happened when things started to change in --</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Then she brought the whole family to Lida to -- my stepmother brought her mother, she still had a mother, and two sisters.</span> <span id="s204">And my father took for them a small apartment.</span> <span id="s205">I wouldn’t swear, I don’t know, but I think he paid the rent, too, because they were all three women.</span> <span id="s206">And what did they do?</span> <span id="s207">They used to do some kind of alteration, o -- the two girls -- they weren’t girls, they were people already in the 30’s.</span> <span id="s208">One was younger, one was older, and th-they used to fix clothing, or sew something.</span> <span id="s209">They made here and -- here and there something, but not to support themself.</span> <span id="s210">And my husband, should rest in peace, got to know one of the -- of my stepmother’s sisters.</span> <span id="s211">I don’t know where they ment -- wh-where they met.</span> <span id="s212">I think he went to some kind of a convention and she was there, too, I don’t know, and they met.</span> <span id="s213">My husband lived in Lida when he left Soubotnik, in my girlfriend’s house.</span> <span id="s214">So when I used to come to my girlfriend, I knew my husband.</span> <span id="s215">I knew that they have a border.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: And your husband’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: And my husband’s name was Tuvya Bielsky.</span> <span id="s218">And as soon she found out, she called my step-aunt, that I know Tuvya, I got to be her messenger, bringing him notes, he used to send to me notes, but mostly she send me there.</span> <span id="s219">Where is he, if I saw him, if I went to see my girlfriend, if I met him.</span> <span id="s220">We used to take a big ladder to go and see, he was so handsome, he was so -- he was so good, he always t-took us to the movies, me and my girlfriend and maybe we want to do something, you know, when he had the time.</span> <span id="s221">So in order to see if we could something get from him, we used to take a big ladder, climb up and see if he’s in the room, or he’s sleeping, or he’s eating, whatever.</span> <span id="s222">And that’s how I knew the news, I could bring her the news.</span> <span id="s223">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: And then, as conditions started to change, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: And then the conditions started to change when the Germans started to -- to a-approach us and the war started.</span> <span id="s226">That time --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Wh-When was that, that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: This was on the end of f -- four -- in ’41 -- in the end of ’40 or in the beginning of ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Wintertime?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Wintertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: ’40 -’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: And we still lived in the same apartment, and in the beginning it was again the Russians started to leave and the Germans started to come in, and there was no government, there was no city, everything was burning, everything was in fire.</span> <span id="s233">We had to leave for a few days the city with my father and stepmother and my brother to some, you know, village, to survive, because we didn’t know how li -- badly that will burn, if it will reach us.</span> <span id="s234">Not that we have so much to lose already, but my father had his money.</span> <span id="s235">And -- and then I -- I’m trying to remember what happened.</span> <span id="s236">And then my husband was -- he’s still in Lida, he saw the whole commotion.</span> <span id="s237">They got very close, they -- both my step-aunt and him got so like they would live together already.</span> <span id="s238">So he took her, he took bicycles for her and for him, and he ran -- as soon they saw that Lida is burning, they decided they’ll go to -- his father had a mail [indecipherable] carriage [indecipherable] and he decided that sa -- there it will be the safetiest place for him.</span> <span id="s239">And that’s how w -- what he did.</span> <span id="s240">Cause the first bomb that fell, fell where -- where he was the border.</span> <span id="s241">It killed my girlfriend and killed her father.</span> <span id="s242">And it was nothing, it was like wiped out.</span> <span id="s243">So then he grabbed her and he went to the village.</span> <span id="s244">His father [indecipherable] where he had a mill, and there was other twe -- he’s one of 12 kids; 10 si -- 10 brothers and two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: And you went back to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: And I went back to my house because my father was young.</span> <span id="s247">When my father died, he was only 49 years old.</span> <span id="s248">So my father had the very strong mi -- he was very strong minded, and he didn’t want to be exception.</span> <span id="s249">He said what will happen to everybody -- I don’t know if it was wise, or not wise, but he did not feel like to be exception, like he could do it and nobody else can do it because he had a way of escaping.</span> <span id="s250">So after we stayed by the -- in the village, you know, we escaped for a few days and the major burning of the city stopped, we returned to our house.</span> <span id="s251">Sure, people took away things, sto -- the sto -- things were stolen, a -- a lot of mas -- mishmash.</span> <span id="s252">And this happened until -- yeah, I worked at the Germans, and right near me where lived, very -- you know, I am telling you, in good times we wouldn’t even pass the street, not only live there.</span> <span id="s253">But there was big -- a building, a empty, big building, and as the Germans walked into this -- to the city, they occupied it and they made like a headquarters there and they hired young girls to work for them, like to peel potatoes, like to clean, like to fix their socks if they are torn, to wash something small for them.</span> <span id="s254">They were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s255">Wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: What -- what did you do, specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: I peel potatoes, that was my -- my job.</span> <span id="s258">And at night, we used to gather in a friend’s porch.</span> <span id="s259">The [indecipherable] came too, you know, they always say -- came, and they sang song with us, and they were telling us story.</span> <span id="s260">And never came on that [indecipherable] even, that we are Jews, or they are -- they used to give us bread, sometimes butter, you know, it -- a payoff.</span> <span id="s261">They didn’t pay us in money, you know, like a job, but this way -- but they never said, oh because you are a Jew, you have to work.</span> <span id="s262">That was it, some there, they felt very close to my girlfriend, some of them had the romances at that time.</span> <span id="s263">But it was a very short while until it got to our minds that that’s not the reality.</span> <span id="s264">The [indecipherable] didn’t come for it, they came to -- to -- to do something else with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: And then when did things start to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: And then the things start to change when -- they didn’t put us in a closed ghetto, but they assigned -- they divided the city in five boroughs, where the Jews -- where the Jews ha -- can -- they st -- gave us the star already, the yellow star, and they assigned us to five boroughs, and according wa -- who -- where it lived, you belonged to the special borough.</span> <span id="s267">Let’s say if I lived on Zaracha, I belonged to Koshorova.</span> <span id="s268">There was all the camps, the big camps, the -- how shall I tell you [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s269">That’s where you stay mil -- mi -- the armies is stationed, what do you ca -- barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Tremendous military barracks --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Bases.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: -- there was the Russi -- bases.</span> <span id="s274">There were Russian, there were Polish, and now the -- the German took this over.</span> <span id="s275">And just where they transferred us was across the barracks -- the bases, the military bases.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: So you had to move?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s278">And you know how many people in one room?</span> <span id="s279">Ah three, four families in one room.</span> <span id="s280">So they moved us with a whole family, but who -- we rented the apartment, they were [indecipherable] five people, six people.</span> <span id="s281">Me and my -- we were four people and my stepmother’s mother and sister, one, because the other one went with my husband.</span> <span id="s282">As of there -- my husband didn’t like my stepmother’s attitude, but she was a very clever woman, my stepmother.</span> <span id="s283">I give credit where credit is due, she was intelligent, and -- but by nature she was bad.</span> <span id="s284">You know, she had the terrible nature.</span> <span id="s285">And he could not -- he suffered a lot with me when he used to come to visit us and see her attitude, it bothered him.</span> <span id="s286">You could see on his face that it hurts him.</span> <span id="s287">And then he used maybe to tell his girlfriend, and she used to tell her sister, and it was even worst, because she used to tell her, stop that, you know, it’s -- it’s very -- people see, people pay attention to it, stop that, change a little bit your attitude.</span> <span id="s288">So she -- instead to get better, she always used to get worse after.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: What were the living conditions like?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s291">So many people in two rooms, and my stepbrother was very good friends with me and I think this was the main reason that she was afraid maybe someday he will marry me.</span> <span id="s292">He was about to finish engineering and he was hired by the Germans as -- in the electra -- in -- in the field of electricity, I don’t know exactly what he did there.</span> <span id="s293">But in those bases, in military bases, he worked for them.</span> <span id="s294">And in the -- whoever worked for the military bases had a special shein.</span> <span id="s295">Shein is a permit that he works for the army and there’s a lot of thing they were allowed to do, like get more bread maybe, or get some other stuff.</span> <span id="s296">And I was a messenger for the Judenrat in my -- in my area.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: This is still 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Right.</span> <span id="s299">Until in 1942, May eight, my husband’s birthday, he closed up -- yeah, meantime I must -- I marked that -- not once my husband came, he was already there, he met already with his brothers, they had already conversations there, in -- at father’s home and there was already relatives from Novagudek that escaped from the city because of the mess, but -- when they came to them -- but them -- and they had the meal and they had the chickens and they had the milk, and they had the -- all, you know, a supply -- mostly supply of food.</span> <span id="s300">So they were more safe than in the city.</span> <span id="s301">So a lot of relatives came to visit them and it was impossible already to live in the house, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: What kind of messages did you take, or who did you take them to?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Let’s say -- I don’t know how to explain.</span> <span id="s304">Judenr -- a Judenrat was like a --</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: A council.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: -- a council of the section where you lived.</span> <span id="s307">The Germans gave their messages to the juden -- to the major Judenrat and they used to divide them between the -- each section.</span> <span id="s308">In my section I was a messenger in Judenrat.</span> <span id="s309">So whatever they told me, go tell this one and this one that he is called to the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s310">There was no phones.</span> <span id="s311">Well, this one, this one, tell him that he has to be at this time there and there.</span> <span id="s312">Tell the policeman has to come and take him, you know?</span> <span id="s313">That -- that was the only way that we could communicate.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And this continued until?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Then in -- yeah, my husband [indecipherable] few times to the si -- to the -- to Lida.</span> <span id="s316">Already 19th of June he had the Russian passport -- passport, and not passport but papers.</span> <span id="s317">He grew -- he looked exactly like my son looking now, with the big moustache.</span> <span id="s318">His name was Belowsky and he had a friend, but you know, it was very, very dangerous because he knew a lot of people already and he was afraid that somebody will recognize him.</span> <span id="s319">And he tried to get through to us, and my father’s accept to come to their village to enter the forest.</span> <span id="s320">And my father said nothing doing.</span> <span id="s321">It will be with everybody it will be with me.</span> <span id="s322">He made the effort maybe two or three times.</span> <span id="s323">He didn’t help him, until the real section came up, and it was too late.</span> <span id="s324">On the shein, on the permit for my stepbrother that worked in the -- in the military barracks -- military bases, we could survive.</span> <span id="s325">In other words, the whole action was on our street.</span> <span id="s326">And they went from door to door, I’ll never forget, May eight, it’s unbelievable, it was snowing.</span> <span id="s327">And I went out, my father told me to get dressed, but I didn’t have a chance because I thought maybe they’ll leave out our house, maybe they won’t come in to us.</span> <span id="s328">You didn’t know what’s going on, but they went house by house and -- and that morning my father got up and he says, “I had a dream.”</span> <span id="s329">Said, what kind of a -- he says, “This situations is no good.”</span> <span id="s330">I said, “Daddy, why didn’t you go, you had a such [indecipherable]?”</span> <span id="s331">“I told you, he has his family there too, his relatives from Novagudek.</span> <span id="s332">Who will sleep in your woods, who can sleep?</span> <span id="s333">We’re not animals.”</span> <span id="s334">I said what’s -- I’ll answer you what you answered, what will be with everybody it will be with you.</span> <span id="s335">There is people too.</span> <span id="s336">Nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s337">Nothing doing, I’m not escaping, I’m not hiding my head.</span> <span id="s338">Fine.</span> <span id="s339">I was -- I was under his command.</span> <span id="s340">We were re -- we respected our parents very highly.</span> <span id="s341">So before he -- so he said he had a dream that I’ll remain, but I’ll be leaving the town, the -- that I’ll -- I’ll go through the section with not being hurt, they won’t kill me.</span> <span id="s342">He doesn’t know what will happen to him, but he knows that I’ll remain.</span> <span id="s343">Then, leave the stories already for later, not for now.</span> <span id="s344">There’s no time.</span> <span id="s345">And sure enough, on this w -- the Germans went in barefoot, in the snow in my nightgown they took me to the -- to this section.</span> <span id="s346">And it went -- my stepmother’s mother and her sister, one of her sisters, Fanny, and the guy sh -- did -- the German was standing and we didn’t know left is to le -- to leave or right is to leave, but right by the older woman that was there, mother was already older.</span> <span id="s347">So he put his hand, you know, like cut.</span> <span id="s348">We four went to the left, they went to the right.</span> <span id="s349">Later on we found out that we remained and they went -- and they were killed.</span> <span id="s350">And this was pretty long, nobody knew when and what and how.</span> <span id="s351">This was pretty long until they send us the [indecipherable] ghetto, because they took out plenty of people there, and you could go -- they didn’t assigned you, you have to go to this house, to this house.</span> <span id="s352">Whatever you grabbed, which house you grabbed when they brought you on their -- on their security, on German security to the ghetto, you knew already that you are lost, that you cannot go out from here, that the ghetto is already a closed one, that you have a curfew.</span> <span id="s353">And we went out to a house -- into a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: What happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Father was with me.</span> <span id="s356">My father and me.</span> <span id="s357">My father died in the woods.</span> <span id="s358">He was killed in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: So you went to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: And next day we had to go already to -- it was organized about the work.</span> <span id="s361">What shall I tell you, there was five, six families in that -- in a room.</span> <span id="s362">You practically slept to -- one on top of the other, such a narrow -- whatever you -- it was in the house cause those people, they took out from the houses.</span> <span id="s363">How many of them were dead, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s364">I know that day it was killed five and a half thousand people in that -- in that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: What was your daily life like in the -- in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: From the morning [indecipherable] we were -- had to get up in the morning and somebody was waiting outside for us in a certain -- in the beginning when Lida was ruined and the Germans came, we were cleaning the -- the bricks, you know, that -- the houses that was ruined, to clean up the bricks and make the property, clean up the properties.</span> <span id="s367">It was not easy work.</span> <span id="s368">Sunday morning the Germans were playing with the -- with us a game, let the big dogs -- I worked just across the -- their -- their residence.</span> <span id="s369">They used to let the dogs down, make a game with us, and the dog used to tear you in pieces.</span> <span id="s370">And there were like wooden, you know, like trays that you put the bricks, and they told you not to [indecipherable] bricks, to slap -- they told you to put -- that you should really get a backache, or break your neck or break your head.</span> <span id="s371">So this -- two of you cou -- could only sneak in when they didn’t look at you.</span> <span id="s372">That was my first job.</span> <span id="s373">And the worst thing was Sundays, when they used to eat their fat and nice breakfast, and then go for a walk, but their -- their dogs ate better than we ate [indecipherable] the whole time that they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Where did you get food from?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: We used -- we -- we used to go to work, you know, it’s [indecipherable] when you -- we knew some -- you gave away everything from yourself, the money and everything, th -- and the peasants that knew you used to sneak in, that you bought from them all of your life, eggs, or milk or this or that.</span> <span id="s376">They used to pity you in the beginning and they give you and then they made good business too.</span> <span id="s377">If you had money they sold to you, but not always you could buy.</span> <span id="s378">If a German used to catch you and he was in a bad mood, you didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s379">So he was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: But you could not get -- you could not get outside the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No, I’m talking about even before the ghetto got closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Yeah, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: In the ghetto there was certain things that you could bring in, not too much, and listen, Jews are always very smart people, they always knew how to get along.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Were there many young children your age there with --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yeah, I have a lot of friend with -- we survived together, yeah, in that time after wa -- after the -- I mean, the action.</span> <span id="s386">Sure I lost quite a few friends, this -- this was -- and then in this ghetto my husband came one time.</span> <span id="s387">Said to my father, “You see, I told you what will happen.</span> <span id="s388">I warned you, I begged you.</span> <span id="s389">You didn’t have to go through that.</span> <span id="s390">The woods are full of trees and the trees are covering us.</span> <span id="s391">Here, no matter how you walk out, they’ll see you.”</span> <span id="s392">And I was upset about it because the reason that I worked in gardens of one of the Polacks -- lot of people, you know, were used -- they -- they used to plant and we had to clean it and watch it and water it and there was big fields of -- of -- of gardens.</span> <span id="s393">In the fee -- and it was so hot in the summer, and the German was standing over you and you couldn’t -- you know, you really couldn’t not work, or play that you are sick, or you don’t feel good.</span> <span id="s394">What -- what more you complain, the s -- more you got over your head.</span> <span id="s395">Somehow my stepmother was very good fren -- friends with the owner of this -- of this gardens that he was in charge of them.</span> <span id="s396">I don’t know if it was his or if he was only in charge with the -- th-the Germans made him in charge of it.</span> <span id="s397">But he lived there, and as soon you know, they produced to make [indecipherable] tomorrow was a -- a section.</span> <span id="s398">To-Tomorrow it will be something happen.</span> <span id="s399">I pass by I heard somebody say tomorrow something will happen this guy, this guy.</span> <span id="s400">And that’s how in the ghetto started to where the talking and what to -- what we will do, where will we hide, and what -- how and what.</span> <span id="s401">At night still were young, we used to -- too long we couldn’t go, and too far we couldn’t go, but next door we used to [indecipherable] and come to one backyard all together and sing fa -- Hebrew songs and -- and tell stories and what will happen, how come that we’ll have a terrible youth.</span> <span id="s402">And you know, and go home, next day you had to go to work.</span> <span id="s403">So I remember one fact, that right after this action in ma -- in May eight, and they told us that the next day we have to go to work and we should all get together in this and this point.</span> <span id="s404">I had a watch.</span> <span id="s405">I wanted to check the time I shouldn’t be too late because I was afraid.</span> <span id="s406">You had so much fear in yourself, you weren’t -- when he didn’t mean to do nothing to you but to look.</span> <span id="s407">Not so much I -- even from the Germans, like from the Polacks that the pol -- the police that helped them out.</span> <span id="s408">And I -- I ask somebody what time is this, and a Polish guy came over to me and he said the time, and I said thank you, and we went into the house.</span> <span id="s409">Didn’t take an hour, he comes in with a German.</span> <span id="s410">He says, “Where is the girl that asked me what time it is?”</span> <span id="s411">My father ra -- pushed me already away out to the room, complete to another room where other people were.</span> <span id="s412">And he showed him, he said this one, this one.</span> <span id="s413">He said no.</span> <span id="s414">I want to see the girl that asked me the time.</span> <span id="s415">So my father got very nervous and he started already, he said, “Kill me.</span> <span id="s416">What do you want to do to her?</span> <span id="s417">Kill her?</span> <span id="s418">Kill me, I’m old man.”</span> <span id="s419">Four -- he was maybe 46 years there.</span> <span id="s420">Kill me.</span> <span id="s421">Said, “No, I’ll tell you what, I won’t do nothing to you.</span> <span id="s422">I’ll -- I’ll murder you, but after you give me your -- your dau -- what connection do you have?”</span> <span id="s423">He didn’t want to tell him that I’m his daughter.</span> <span id="s424">Anyway, I saw it’s -- it’s very crucial, I came out.</span> <span id="s425">I came out and he said -- “I didn’t do nothing,” I said, “I just ask you what time because I wanted to be on time tomorrow morning.”</span> <span id="s426">It was just a stupid game that he wanted to scare the whole house and he want to make a -- a game of it.</span> <span id="s427">Turned around, took away my watch and went out.</span> <span id="s428">What di -- what did I do?</span> <span id="s429">But just stupid game.</span> <span id="s430">You know, anything to show the authorities that they -- they-they are the big shots.</span> <span id="s431">And this wasn’t the lesson for my father either, because that time I started to bother him [indecipherable] look, we went through, we could have waited.</span> <span id="s432">Tuvya asked us, he begged us, who else ha -- who else has in the whole ghetto such a privilege to go out of the ghetto one of the first ones because people would love it, but they didn’t know how and what.</span> <span id="s433">What Daddy said, Daddy said.</span> <span id="s434">And after the action this was [indecipherable] I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s435">I came for my girlfriend, in fact, she was killed wi -- in the woods, from the white Polacks.</span> <span id="s436">Her sister and brother-in-law still in Israel, and the whole family was saved by my husband.</span> <span id="s437">And we were sitting in their backyard, singing, you know, songs from -- from -- from I don’t know, maybe 60 - 70 years ago they used to sing that in -- in the Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s438">And I came home, and I said -- and I [indecipherable] crawl to my bed.</span> <span id="s439">It was very crowded to pass b-by to find your bed, you know, but was cold and chilly.</span> <span id="s440">So I took my girlfriend’s jacket, I put the -- threw it on top of me.</span> <span id="s441">A blazer.</span> <span id="s442">Came home and I lay down in bed, took off the jacket, took off my clothes, lay down [indecipherable] ready to work.</span> <span id="s443">[indecipherable] I wasn’t working all right.</span> <span id="s444">[indecipherable] had, you know, we had -- didn’t have any peace in the house, she always why didn’t you do that.</span> <span id="s445">Why didn’t you cook, why didn’t you bring, why didn’t you that?</span> <span id="s446">Til one day, I’m going -- I’ll bad -- back to this story with ma -- with the jacket, because that was the night that we left the ghetto.</span> <span id="s447">But what I want to tell you from my stepmother and I said, in the beginning I didn’t want to confess to.</span> <span id="s448">[indecipherable] I will tell it.</span> <span id="s449">Let it be on record, let people know that when you are making a hole for somebody, you are the first one to fall.</span> <span id="s450">She said to me -- I come to work in the fields and the one that I told you was in charge of me, says to me, “Today you’ll work later.”</span> <span id="s451">I said, “How can I work later, how can I get to the ghetto later?</span> <span id="s452">After six o’clock, if I’ll be met by -- by the Germans and by the police, I’ll be killed.”</span> <span id="s453">We have no excuse, they kill you on the spot.</span> <span id="s454">That was a [indecipherable] and now order [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s455">Said, “I don’t know what to tell you but I need you for work.”</span> <span id="s456">What can I do?</span> <span id="s457">Helpless.</span> <span id="s458">My stepmother sometimes didn’t come home when she heard rumors that something’s going to happen the ha -- ghetto, she used to hide herself there on the roof.</span> <span id="s459">He used to hide her.</span> <span id="s460">Her and another few.</span> <span id="s461">Came six o’clock he says to me, “Go home.”</span> <span id="s462">I said, “You told me to stay.</span> <span id="s463">I have nothing to lose already, cause after six I won’t go nowhere.”</span> <span id="s464">He said, “Go, go with the group, return to the ghetto in time.”</span> <span id="s465">Passed a few weeks, and he starts telling me a story, that my stepmother paid with the money from five ruble gold, of my father’s money to keep me later in order he should send me home and I should be killed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s466">So what for you needed the Germans that your own people could kill you.</span> <span id="s467">And I -- I kept it a secret for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s468">And he said to me, “You know, even not being Jewish, I had no conscious, because you were so innocent, I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s469">I took the money from her, but was for money they were [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s470">But I told her I’ll do some other time, not today.”</span> <span id="s471">And I kept it a secret for a long time, I didn’t tell no one.</span> <span id="s472">First well I thought nobody will believe me.</span> <span id="s473">In this time of struggle for your life, of survival, you are able take my father’s money and to kill me?</span> <span id="s474">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: [indecipherable] the story of the blazer, your friend --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s477">That night with -- I came home with my friend’s blazer.</span> <span id="s478">I don’t recall actual night.</span> <span id="s479">And I went to sleep, and all of a sudden I hear somebody’s touching me.</span> <span id="s480">I woke up, I thought my father maybe he’s not feeling well.</span> <span id="s481">He says, “No, I’m fine.”</span> <span id="s482">I decided to leave immediately, get dressed.</span> <span id="s483">If you -- my eyes [indecipherable] Daddy, takes time to get ready, Daddy, let me put on my shoes.</span> <span id="s484">I don’t want to wait [indecipherable] can change my mind.</span> <span id="s485">Now, right now.</span> <span id="s486">And we were the first ones, me, my stepmother, my stepbrother and my father, to crawl out from the Glost ghetto.</span> <span id="s487">Where the police was, where -- where -- where the Germans was, were -- were standing and somehow, on our stomachs, under the -- what do you call this, the [indecipherable] this that the ghettos were assi --</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: The walls?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Not walls, the metal, the metal, and th --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Barbed wire?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: The wiring.</span> <span id="s492">The electric wiring, because everything was -- was with electricity.</span> <span id="s493">And we passed under the wiring.</span> <span id="s494">And th --</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Who was leading you?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Nobody, but on the other side Tuvya Bielsky was waiting for us.</span> <span id="s497">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s498">That’s how we came to [indecipherable] to the -- to the forest.</span> <span id="s499">Then he met -- when he met us, he brought us to somebody that he knew for awhile, to rest up and a few hours later, these two brothers were waiting deeper in the woods for us, and then I came, and there were 17 people of the family and with us it was 21.</span> <span id="s500">And that’s how it start.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Was anybody else aware when you were leaving the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: No.</span> <span id="s503">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s504">We disappeared with no sound, with no nothing.</span> <span id="s505">Was very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: What did you take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s508">Absolutely nothing, just to chan -- one change -- you couldn’t -- how can you, you have to crawl, you have to run, you have to walk, you have to be in -- in -- you know, [indecipherable] for the rain.</span> <span id="s509">It’s -- Europe is not -- Europe is not America or Florida.</span> <span id="s510">You know, you never know, there could be below zero, maybe 20 or 40 degree below zero.</span> <span id="s511">And that’s how I survived til we left the woods in ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Ho-How did your husband know that you were leaving at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Oh, he -- he came to the ghetto just -- in the ghetto, in the Glost ghetto he came one time, and then he send somebody -- to the same peasant where we stopped, you know, for a rest, when he was waiting for us behind the ghetto, about two, three kilometers behind the ghetto he was waiting for us.</span> <span id="s514">And he took us to this peasant and this peasant came to my father to tell him.</span> <span id="s515">Because he used to come very often to bring us something, you know, like a piece of bread, or some milk, or some something.</span> <span id="s516">Some cheese.</span> <span id="s517">So he said Tuvya was here, he asked me to go and to tell you again and again.</span> <span id="s518">So I guess my father had some kind of a -- at wa -- sa -- was -- was talking to this man, but he didn’t tell us, us he surprised.</span> <span id="s519">Maybe his wife knew, but us he surprised.</span> <span id="s520">Me and my stepbrother were very much surprised.</span> <span id="s521">Later this same night we had to go out.</span> <span id="s522">And that’s how it started.</span> <span id="s523">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: What -- what were you thoughts as a young -- as a young woman at that time, a young --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: What I thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: -- what -- as you were escaping, do remember feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: I was escaping, I -- I don’t know, I had -- I had the picture of my old -- that whole night was the fi -- picture in front of me from the bench, from where I put on my girlfriend’s jacket.</span> <span id="s528">The whole young people there were sitting, and just like I left everything behind me.</span> <span id="s529">I wa -- I didn’t have a feeling of sorry, but I -- I said to myself, why couldn’t I share with them and tell them?</span> <span id="s530">First of all, I didn’t know, because I didn’t know until I didn’t come home.</span> <span id="s531">And I didn’t go into bed, my father came to me, because he was afraid maybe next bed, maybe I’ll te-tell somebody something.</span> <span id="s532">You know?</span> <span id="s533">But I had a picture, oh they remained there, they’ll have to go to work tomorrow.</span> <span id="s534">They’ll have Sunday the same show with the dogs.</span> <span id="s535">They’ll have this, they’ll have that.</span> <span id="s536">I was too young to have special feelings.</span> <span id="s537">But I said oh, I’ll miss that sitting in the backyard and not seeing my friends.</span> <span id="s538">I don’t know where I’m going, I’m going to the wolves, I’m going to the bears, I’m going to the -- to the woods without nothing.</span> <span id="s539">It’s very har -- it was very hard to turn into a animal, being a human being.</span> <span id="s540">In that time we were animals, but we were -- we had freedom.</span> <span id="s541">We could move.</span> <span id="s542">Not in daytime, but at night time.</span> <span id="s543">And that’s how the leadership of my husband went.</span> <span id="s544">My husband was [indecipherable] then we were constantly together.</span> <span id="s545">He was with his girlfriend and I was with my family, but this was counted as we lived in one bunker, you know, we made one -- one place of -- of living together.</span> <span id="s546">And he saw that -- how much suffering I’m [indecipherable] how alone I am in this world.</span> <span id="s547">And he saw that my father wants to help me and he can, but he was -- he was threatened that she’ll leave him [indecipherable] do that.</span> <span id="s548">So he -- and so he tried, he tried to supply me boots, he tried to supply me warm clothes.</span> <span id="s549">He tried to always when he went out to bring something more for me.</span> <span id="s550">He told me always not to take so much to heart, things will change, everything will pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Where was the first place that you stayed after you got out?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: The first place was very close, I don’t remember exactly, but it was very -- it wasn’t organized.</span> <span id="s553">And that people were already -- the one, the family people that were there, they -- and the -- and the -- there were family people and there were neighbors next village from them, that they were relatives of m -- of my brother-in-law, that he got involved with one of their daughters, so he took out the parents, and he took out the sisters and the brothers.</span> <span id="s554">All together with us it was 21 people.</span> <span id="s555">But the other 17 people started already, especially the older people.</span> <span id="s556">What are you going to do, how will you feed them, at least we are 17 people, here four more mouths, four more this.</span> <span id="s557">But my husband always find a way.</span> <span id="s558">He always said to [indecipherable] “I’ll find a way to -- to feed them, I’ll find a way to supply them.</span> <span id="s559">Don’t you worry about.</span> <span id="s560">It’s more Jews, it’s better.”</span> <span id="s561">And slowly, slowly he started with his love and he wants to save Jews from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s562">He doesn’t care how, he doesn’t care what people will say, he doesn’t care if they’ll be satisfied with it.</span> <span id="s563">He must save Jews from -- and he was asked the question, what would you rather do?</span> <span id="s564">Kill 10 Germans or save one Jew?</span> <span id="s565">And very openly and with a lot of dignity he said, “Save one Jew.”</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Well -- well I -- yeah, we’re going to have to change the tape on that wonderful quote.</span> <span id="s567">We’re going to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: All right, tell us again who made up the group, the first group, once you got out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: When I came to the woods, there was no group, there was a family, members of the family, there was -- all related to each other.</span> <span id="s573">And they were in -- hesitating if to accept new people.</span> <span id="s574">Because like I had mentioned before, there was a question of supporting them, there was a question of feeding them, and this wasn’t the easy thing, because they had nothing with -- a-and they were empty handed.</span> <span id="s575">The whole luck of it was that they were raised -- the Bielskys were raised in villages, in hills, in woods, wi -- and trees were their friends.</span> <span id="s576">So they weren’t afraid to knock in a peasant’s window.</span> <span id="s577">They weren’t afraid if -- to knock in -- and they had s -- their stories with the peasant.</span> <span id="s578">For instance my husband -- where they -- wher -- f-first of all where they -- where they came during the day, they didn’t sleep the night.</span> <span id="s579">Or they slept, they didn’t -- they weren’t during the day.</span> <span id="s580">They couldn’t stay because they were afraid for their own shadow, and we didn’t have any trust.</span> <span id="s581">It’s not [indecipherable] determines.</span> <span id="s582">That was, at that time we were -- we organized, it was White Russia.</span> <span id="s583">So you had the wh -- white Polacks, the white Russian.</span> <span id="s584">Then you had the Polacks that they wanted to be very friendly with the Germans and they helped them a lot.</span> <span id="s585">So to give out a Jew, it was just a cinch.</span> <span id="s586">It was a -- a -- a big deal.</span> <span id="s587">And they were know in there, in their facilities where they lived.</span> <span id="s588">But they had a -- their father had the -- a mill.</span> <span id="s589">I personally did not know my in-laws.</span> <span id="s590">When I got to know them, they weren’t alive already.</span> <span id="s591">Ah, when I could get to know them, they weren’t alive already.</span> <span id="s592">They were taken away to [indecipherable] ghetto and were killed.</span> <span id="s593">So I knew only the one that they were in the ghettos -- they -- they were in the woods with us, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s594">And for instance, my husband had a friend -- first of all, my husband was a military man.</span> <span id="s595">He was in the Polish army for two years and he was a very good soldier and he had right away a [indecipherable] of certain things that he did better than others.</span> <span id="s596">He was very good in languages.</span> <span id="s597">First of all, he was g -- he grew up between Gentiles.</span> <span id="s598">They had the business, they had mills.</span> <span id="s599">They had t-to -- to grind th-their grains, they had to -- to do a lot of things that they -- you know, there was very little Jewish temples, if they had to go to temple for a holiday, they had to walk about two, three kilometers.</span> <span id="s600">They didn’t have this in their village.</span> <span id="s601">They were the only Jewish family in their village.</span> <span id="s602">But they had good things too done, and certain people that they want to remember, and th-the -- they pay -- they pay them a good price later on.</span> <span id="s603">Meaning what?</span> <span id="s604">Let’s say there was a neighbor, my husband’s friend that came to the mill for a certain thing.</span> <span id="s605">I don’t remember what he came for but was -- I really -- I wasn’t born there, I don’t know the -- the -- all the obstacles there, but that’s what I heard and read fa -- about my husband.</span> <span id="s606">So he came there, and there was a he -- they were not poor people either, the -- the neighbors, the -- the man that I’m telling you the story about.</span> <span id="s607">And there was a mill by [indecipherable] not far from each other, and there was a big river.</span> <span id="s608">This guy was 12 or 13 years old and he went to the river, he jumped, and he drowned.</span> <span id="s609">My husband was right near the river and he saw that.</span> <span id="s610">He jumped in his clothes and he saved him.</span> <span id="s611">His parents never could forget that.</span> <span id="s612">In the time of the war, when he find out that he is somewhere in the neighborhood, he paid him a visit.</span> <span id="s613">But he didn’t know even which house is his.</span> <span id="s614">This was so many years ago.</span> <span id="s615">Accidentally he knocked in the house of his parents, and he ask him about Andre.</span> <span id="s616">And his father says -- he recognized him immediately, he said, “You are -- God brought you here, you are my son’s savior.</span> <span id="s617">You saved his life.</span> <span id="s618">He is not living with me, but right here and here he is living, go knock in his door, he’ll be very happy to see you.”</span> <span id="s619">And sure enough he did it, and as he knocked in the door, he said to him, “It’s a very familiar voice, but I don’t know the name, I don’t remember you.”</span> <span id="s620">He says, “Don’t you remember how you drowned and I saved you?”</span> <span id="s621">“Oh my God,” he said, “Bielsky, what are you doing?</span> <span id="s622">I thought you are long time not between the living.”</span> <span id="s623">Took him in, he stationed him, he gave him to eat.</span> <span id="s624">There was days that th-they were hungry.</span> <span id="s625">They couldn’t find the -- a house to go in or they couldn’t, or there was Germans, or there were Poles, or they -- the owner didn’t let them in because he was afraid for him his ho -- his lo -- own life.</span> <span id="s626">But a lot of risked their own life.</span> <span id="s627">And he was very happy with him, and he said, “Look, I’m married, I have a family.</span> <span id="s628">Do me a favor, let me tell my wife that you are one from the Polacks that escaped from the army and you are trying to hide, and you are not Jewish.”</span> <span id="s629">At the moment my husband said to him, “Okay, tell her what you want.”</span> <span id="s630">But as the day passed and he rested up, and he came to his senses, he said, “Why should you lie to your wife?</span> <span id="s631">Did I lie to my conscious by saving you?</span> <span id="s632">I want to tell her the truth.”</span> <span id="s633">And sure enough, she reacted beautifully, according to the story from my husband.</span> <span id="s634">She said, “I don’t care who you are, you are a human being, and I’ll do anything and everything.”</span> <span id="s635">But for the neighbors she tried to play the same game.</span> <span id="s636">And at the same night, her sister-in-law came to visit them, she asks them -- they named him right away a different name, my husband, and she said, “Who is this guest in your house?”</span> <span id="s637">And she said her name was Mary, and she says, “Mary,” to her sister-in-law, “oh, we have a Polish guy that escaped from the army and he’s hiding.”</span> <span id="s638">“Oh,” she said, “you know what?</span> <span id="s639">I want them all in my house next week.</span> <span id="s640">I’ll make a little party and we’ll have a good time.</span> <span id="s641">Bring your guest along with you.”</span> <span id="s642">Course for some reason, I don’t know if they knew or they didn’t know, but they didn’t go.</span> <span id="s643">Husband and wife didn’t go, and my husband went to her, and he knocks in the door and walks in, and the table’s all set, and five heavy-set Germans are sitting and drinking and eating.</span> <span id="s644">She didn’t lose her head -- they ask right away who are you.</span> <span id="s645">She didn’t lose her head and she says to them, “Oh, that’s a friend.</span> <span id="s646">That’s my sister-in-law’s friend that he’s working for us, blah, blah, blah, whole story.</span> <span id="s647">They shook hands with him, he was shivering.</span> <span id="s648">He said that he da -- he was telling me always that he does not know how the table didn’t turn over from his knees shaking.</span> <span id="s649">And he said -- and he drank, and he was afra -- afraid to drink too much, maybe he’ll say something, you know, you are not responsible for after awhile.</span> <span id="s650">So he said, “You know what, I cannot leave -- I have to go to my work, I have to go to my job.</span> <span id="s651">I cannot stay too long.”</span> <span id="s652">And they ask -- so he ask them, he wanted to know what’s going on in the world.</span> <span id="s653">He said, “What’s our situation by the way?</span> <span id="s654">How do we fight?”</span> <span id="s655">“Oh, we are so close to Moscow.”</span> <span id="s656">We are so close to here, we are so close to there.</span> <span id="s657">It won’t take no time and we’ll be the winners of the world.</span> <span id="s658">Shook hands with them nicely, said goodnight and disappeared.</span> <span id="s659">He ran so fast -- it was a cold night -- he ran so fast that he thought in his mind it was a fantasy or a thought, I don’t know how to describe that, that somebody’s running.</span> <span id="s660">He’s hurt, he didn’t realize that ha -- he’s hurt, he’s speeding so fast that he thought that somebody’s behind him running after him until he fell into the snow, to the deep snow.</span> <span id="s661">And in the deep snow, saw that it’s very cold, he’ll freeze to death, he’ll remain here.</span> <span id="s662">He got up, he shlepped through to some other house where they let him in and -- and at that time it was empty -- still empty handed.</span> <span id="s663">But this guy, I think -- I think, I’m not sure, gave him the first gun, or the first rifle, or the si -- fi -- or showed him a place where he could get.</span> <span id="s664">But this was the first guy that filled his hands up that he should -- shouldn’t be empty handed.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Let’s return back to your ex -- you got into the woods, and how big was the group of people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: 17, with us 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Okay, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: And then a short while after that my husband is -- said to the whole group that not to worry, the wa -- like this we won’t survive, because small groups will have no chance.</span> <span id="s669">We have to try to bring people from -- from the ghettos.</span> <span id="s670">And he wrote a letter to his cousin, it was still in a -- in [indecipherable] in Novagudek ghetto and he told him, organize as much as you can, because they had another pes -- farmer that spoke beautiful Jewish, you would never sa -- say that he’s a Gentile.</span> <span id="s671">And his son was in Novagudek in -- in the police station, a big -- a bigshot.</span> <span id="s672">But he was -- who know -- I don’t know, or they paid him or they made money or he was a friend.</span> <span id="s673">I don’t know how -- how to -- to calculate that.</span> <span id="s674">But he had the whole information from the [indecipherable] ghetto and he was the one to send constantly with messages to the ghetto and get to the people and give them the letters.</span> <span id="s675">The first letter he sent to his cousin, a Bielsky, too.</span> <span id="s676">His name was Yehuda Bielsky.</span> <span id="s677">And he wrote him, for your sake, “For my sake, for the sake for the Jewish nation, please organize and get out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s678">We had -- the roots are wide, the forests are deep.</span> <span id="s679">We’ll survive, if not all of us, some of us.</span> <span id="s680">In ghetto you have no chance.”</span> <span id="s681">With this message, after awhile, came seven young boys.</span> <span id="s682">And one of them I want to tell you should have died [indecipherable] mentioned it.</span> <span id="s683">And they sat down, seven boys and I think -- and I’m very sure that I don’t remember exactly if two wives came with them, or they came a short time after that.</span> <span id="s684">And they came to the woods.</span> <span id="s685">And then, in between them, they made a meeting and they said, “Tuvya, you are the oldest from all of us,” -- he was at that time in the early 30’s, “and you had military experience, you were in the army, you know what discipline is.</span> <span id="s686">We want you to lead the group.”</span> <span id="s687">So he answered them, “If you listen to me, and you’ll obey my orders, I’ll do it.</span> <span id="s688">If not, take somebody else.”</span> <span id="s689">So in one voice, they all said, “We’ll agree, we’ll do whatever you say.”</span> <span id="s690">When he was in the army he had a very -- first of all, before the army, when he was a young guy yet, he was always interested in Zionism.</span> <span id="s691">He wanted very much to go to Israel and to work for kibbutz.</span> <span id="s692">But his parents -- one brother was already in the States and he -- his -- the condition, the family conditions were so poor that he had no conscious to leave, a -- mommy say -- and -- and his mother said to him, you want to go to Israel, fine, take your brothers and sisters and go because we won’t manage -- we won’t be able to manage.</span> <span id="s693">So he was, you know, there was all kind of parties in Europe, so he belonged to a party, it was a chalutz, he used to go out for -- for hard work, for building, for -- for -- for -- for other work, ha -- this was a -- he bel -- he belonged to a party chalutz.</span> <span id="s694">But when he was mobilized to the Polish army, and the word Jew was for him on such a level, that nobody, nobody could ta -- take away the pride from him, being a Jew.</span> <span id="s695">So one time -- and -- and h-he -- he was very -- he was very good in the -- I’m -- I’m going to a very important point here</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: [indecipherable] experiences in -- but we want to get -- talk about what you experience with Tuvya, how your relationship developed with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: My relationship developed with him in -- when I was his messenger, and when he saw that I -- I wer -- I was sitting sky high on a high chair, and all of a sudden I fell like to the -- to the earth, and I had nobody to care for me.</span> <span id="s698">And that’s when -- that’s what -- his heart -- he had -- he had a heart from God, he had a heart from goodness.</span> <span id="s699">He -- just to do your favor or to care for you, that was his whole life, because when he was called Jew in the army, he killed the Gentile, he killed it.</span> <span id="s700">He -- he was about to go to prison himself, i -- just because he mentioned to him that he is a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Well he had another relationship with another woman, he’d been married before?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: He had a relationship before the -- until the Bolsheviks came and the Russian people occupied White Russia.</span> <span id="s703">He lived 10 years in his little city [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s704">He had a big, big business there, and they were very, very well off.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: And then what happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: And then she had the -- a mother that she had cancer, and her mother wouldn’t budge, and she wouldn’t leave her, and she wouldn’t leave her, and Tuvya could not stay there because the Bolsheviks would send him to Siberia, and in that time it was the worst thing that could happen to somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: And then he had a relationship with -- with your step --</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: With my --</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: -- step-aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: -- m-my step-aunt, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: And what happened to that relationship?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: She was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: She was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: She was killed together in ’43 with her sister, my stepmother -- with her -- my step-mother’s son --</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: And how --</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: -- in a attack of -- of the -- of the -- in -- in the woods already.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about your role at a -- in the beginnings of your group getting together in the woods, and how your relationship then developed with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: My relationship that he always cared for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: He always cared for me.</span> <span id="s721">He cared for me, he couldn’t see, you know, that -- none justice was done to me.</span> <span id="s722">That he knew from where I’m coming.</span> <span id="s723">He knew that -- how I was raised, he knew how my father was caring for me.</span> <span id="s724">You know, when you live in a town you hear stories, you her -- you hear rumor -- rumors how you were raised, and all of a sudden you saw that, you know, I’m like a slave.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: What kind of duties did you have in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: I had duties, I had to come to my own husband and give him the reports the whole night, I mean eight hours -- six hours, I don’t remember already, that you had to stay on -- on parole -- not parole, what do you call this with your rifle in your hands and -- and watch the headquarters, or watch whoever comes on -- on the base, or whoe -- what -- and in the morning I used to say, commander allo-allow me to tell you and get a report to you that this one and this one came this hour at night with -- with the -- with food, this one went out from the base, a Russian came into the base.</span> <span id="s727">Everything is in order, nothing special happened.</span> <span id="s728">Not everybody used to do that.</span> <span id="s729">I never showed my authority in the woods that I am a commander’s wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Were you involved in any acts of sabotage?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: I was with him twice, twice I was with him.</span> <span id="s732">One time he was really [indecipherable] Germans, but by Russian -- by Russian people, sniper went through right here, and he died with the scar.</span> <span id="s733">Right here.</span> <span id="s734">I was that time with him and this wasn’t -- this was Russian partisans, they did it to him.</span> <span id="s735">They didn’t like the idea of being -- getting so big as he got.</span> <span id="s736">And he was the only -- only person that he cared for children and old people.</span> <span id="s737">In the Russian groups, if you had a wife or young per -- a lover or whatever, you couldn’t pick her, you had to go out.</span> <span id="s738">You ha -- they throw you right away out.</span> <span id="s739">He opened his arms and said come.</span> <span id="s740">As -- more is better.</span> <span id="s741">And whoever it came to the woods, and other people started to -- to object, what will we do with kids, kids cry.</span> <span id="s742">We-We’ll have a -- a -- the -- i-in case the Germans make a raid, which not once had happened that they had the raid, how will you save if a child will cry at night, it a child this and -- that’s my responsibility.</span> <span id="s743">I’ll do.</span> <span id="s744">I don’t guarantee you.</span> <span id="s745">That was always his -- he was always [indecipherable] to make a big meeting in the open fields of the woods and say, it’s my responsibility.</span> <span id="s746">The only thing that I demand from you is to listen, and discipline.</span> <span id="s747">Without discipline we won’t be able to continue.</span> <span id="s748">And somehow they had love for him, admiration for him.</span> <span id="s749">And they -- if he wasn’t on the base and something happened or the Germans raid or -- or some -- people were lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Besides being a messenger for him and making reports, what else were you do --</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: I [indecipherable] the same, I had always to receive the Russian commands to prepare, you know, special food for them.</span> <span id="s752">We needed them.</span> <span id="s753">We had to buy them.</span> <span id="s754">So when, let’s say somebody came to visit or he had a meeting for somebody, this was everything in my bunker, I had to receive them, I had to prepare.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: At what point did you became man and wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: From the first minute that my hu -- my father got killed, he told me that he’ll never, never -- he never had mine -- in his mind -- he -- better saying when his wife was killed, he said, he couldn’t do it before, but he always was with me, he always shared my sufferings and he’ll -- I should never be upset because wi -- whatever it will happen to him, it will happen to me.</span> <span id="s757">We’ll never, never separate, and he will never leave me alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: How did your father get killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: My father, he went -- now that my husband allowed him, after his wife, his second wife got killed from the Germans, he wanted to be very brave and pay the Germans for it.</span> <span id="s760">Usually my husband never let him go because at that time comparing 20 - 30, he was a old man in the 40’s, so he didn’t want him to schlep around, you know, for food, and you never know who will come from the back and -- and shot him, and you -- he liked it to -- to send the young and the brave.</span> <span id="s761">But he was very stubborn about, and he decided that he’s going to take, you know, revenge.</span> <span id="s762">Begged my husband not to go and he didn’t listen.</span> <span id="s763">Well, it wouldn’t be my father, he would take away the rifle and say sit on your behind, excuse my expression.</span> <span id="s764">But here he respected him too much, and he knew that he wasn’t -- he was a big businessman.</span> <span id="s765">So he let him go.</span> <span id="s766">And I was sitting at the fire [indecipherable] and I said to him, “Daddy, how can you leave me, I’m all -- already left all alone.</span> <span id="s767">You are the only one, you are the only soul that I possess.</span> <span id="s768">How can you leave me and go?</span> <span id="s769">The times are so un -- unpeaceful, you know, and we never know what will happen.</span> <span id="s770">I don’t know if you -- if you go, you never knew if you come back.</span> <span id="s771">How can you do that to me?”</span> <span id="s772">He listened, he picked up himself and he left.</span> <span id="s773">In five, 10 minutes he’s coming back.</span> <span id="s774">I said, “Daddy, you see?</span> <span id="s775">You -- you weren’t impressed when I was talking to you, but you came to your senses.”</span> <span id="s776">He says, “No, I went -- I never go away without kissing you good-bye.”</span> <span id="s777">So he came to say good-bye [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s778">12 people was killed that d -- that night.</span> <span id="s779">He went for food, and the farmer send out his son to mou -- to go to the ghetto and they -- and they told the Germans that here is a group of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s780">He couldn’t go, it got too -- too light outside.</span> <span id="s781">We just moved at night, the day was the night and the night was the day.</span> <span id="s782">Well -- and when there was light outside, nobody from partisans moves around, only at night.</span> <span id="s783">So he send out and a whole group of Germans came, and the -- and they didn’t have even a chance.</span> <span id="s784">One guy remained because he knew the pe -- the farmer.</span> <span id="s785">So he went to a chicken coop under the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s786">And when everything was over and all the people were killed, he came out and said, “You feel better now?</span> <span id="s787">What do you think?</span> <span id="s788">What did you do?</span> <span id="s789">You will be paid a high price.”</span> <span id="s790">So his son came out with a sword, and -- and killed him right on the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Did your partisans group keep moving around, or did you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes, we had to keep -- to move around, we had to move our land around because ber -- if we had a big -- oh, what do you call it, the -- we had people that they were investigating constantly what’s the conditions, where are the Germans, how far are they from -- from us.</span> <span id="s793">There was always 10 - 12 people around, always on horses, to find out what’s going on.</span> <span id="s794">You couldn’t live in the woods if you wouldn’t know how far the Germans are with you -- from you.</span> <span id="s795">And then we had a lot of problems from the Russian partisans.</span> <span id="s796">A lot of problems we had from them.</span> <span id="s797">He used a -- until we got the -- until we got the rifles, until we got the machines, until we got the guns.</span> <span id="s798">And then if a group used to go out, they used to ca -- take away -- take away everything from them, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s799">Until my husband put this under the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Put -- put you under what?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Put this on order, he went to the higher command, and they to -- he explained to them that we are all fighting for the same reason, we are all fighting for existence, we all want to survive.</span> <span id="s802">Why should -- and the se -- the -- the aim is the same, to save -- that time was the Russian army, to help the Russian army.</span> <span id="s803">So why are they taking away because we are Jews?</span> <span id="s804">After a lot of fights, after a lot of struggle, they came to the senses and they were punished for doing such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: What was your role as a woman or the other -- was it different than a man?</span> <span id="s806">Did you carry a gun with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yeah, I had a gun.</span> <span id="s808">I didn’t use too much, but I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: When did you use it?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: I used -- I -- I didn’t use my gun.</span> <span id="s811">They -- they took very, very little the in action, the women, because they always had -- don’t forget that we had schools on the base.</span> <span id="s812">We had places that were -- we were making bread and soap and salami and -- and fix all kind of [indecipherable] for us, and for strangers because with that we used to ba -- they used to exchange other things with us.</span> <span id="s813">They were from -- th-they called the -- our base, they called the shtetl of bells.</span> <span id="s814">It had a name, shtetl bells.</span> <span id="s815">The e -- the u -- the little city of bells.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: And what -- what were your every day jobs, besides being messengers?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: You had to have -- there was -- there was hospitals, there was sick people, there was people in typhus.</span> <span id="s818">Look, in -- in my position, mostly I used to go is sometimes I stayed on the -- on the base, but if he used to go somewhere, not for -- for -- let’s say to attacks, I used always to go with my husband.</span> <span id="s819">If it was to go and vi-visit somebody, or he had a meeting with the high authority, then he -- he wasn’t the whole authority, they had the headquarters from the whole partisans of the woods, which there was a Mr. Platone, that was not his -- his name -- real name, I think Janika was his real name.</span> <span id="s820">And they had to report to him like you have to report to your supervisor, like I had to report to my wherever I worked, my supervisor.</span> <span id="s821">They had to report everything, there wasn’t just you can do what you want to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: And when did you travel, at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Everything was at night, forget in -- in the woods about the day.</span> <span id="s824">We had -- we had a -- a wait for 10 days from the Germans.</span> <span id="s825">Nobody, not from Russia, not from [indecipherable] survived fully.</span> <span id="s826">Our -- we were at that time, I think, close to 800 - 900 people, and not one was missing.</span> <span id="s827">10 days with no food in -- in -- sitting in water up to your throat.</span> <span id="s828">And so the kids were carried out, because the management, it was [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Let’s talk about how the -- the camps were set up.</span> <span id="s830">Did you sleep in tents?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: In tents.</span> <span id="s832">In tents in the summer, on the earth, tents in the winter, used to build things, in the beginning especially and cover them, you know, winter if snow and you make one step, it’s very -- it shows.</span> <span id="s833">So we used to take a -- what do you call this?</span> <span id="s834">A strainer.</span> <span id="s835">As you walked, you had a strainer and you cover it right away with the snow, it -- that your steps shouldn’t show.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: And how many people were in the tents?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Depends.</span> <span id="s838">Usually, you know, friends got together, I want to stay with this one, I want to stay with this one.</span> <span id="s839">And there were bigger tents and there were smaller tents.</span> <span id="s840">There were then -- in the winter we had under the earth.</span> <span id="s841">We had to build, you know, under because you couldn’t -- couldn’t survive it’s -- the cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: How did you do the cooking when [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Cookings was like this, for -- it was a general.</span> <span id="s844">Before each husband went on a -- some kind of operation, no matter how you watched him and how he was restricted, you had to bring -- you always brought something for his wife.</span> <span id="s845">So she used to prepare herself.</span> <span id="s846">But there was a general kitchen for everybody.</span> <span id="s847">Special attention [indecipherable] all the people and the kids.</span> <span id="s848">We had rabbis, we had traditions.</span> <span id="s849">You could not force the people to do that, but the -- the people that wanted to observe, they did, they had no problem with it.</span> <span id="s850">They came to my husband, they asked they wanted to pray or they want to b -- to bake matzoh for Passover, they know the date, they were welcome to.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: What about personal hygiene and sanitation?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: We had a hospital.</span> <span id="s853">We had a -- it was a problem, and when the problem got -- when we started with typhus, they made a -- they build it, a special what do you call -- it was the solarium, that’s for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: A special ward, or -- a ward or a --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Right, that had always hot water, and at such a temperature that you could hang up your clothes if you had some insects or lice, or anything in it, it was -- it -- it -- it was -- i -- they got rid of it because the -- the temperature of the heat killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Was lice a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s858">Sure.</span> <span id="s859">Not everybody.</span> <span id="s860">I didn’t have it, I don’t know what it means to have it, but it was.</span> <span id="s861">Certain people had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: How large was your camp, the largest it grew?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: 1250 people were left in the woods.</span> <span id="s864">And this is after we lost -- we lost very little people.</span> <span id="s865">But the last day of ca -- going out from the woods --</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Is that -- part were older, and what part were younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: The -- we had -- in the beginning we had a lot of young people, but then the Russian --</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Just a min -- could you -- there’s -- something’s the matter with the tape.</span> <span id="s869">[inaudible] … I was asking you about the make-up of the group, how many were older people, how many were children.</span> <span id="s870">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Exactly, I cannot -- there was -- were -- in the beginning was a lot of young people, and then he d -- he didn’t rest.</span> <span id="s872">The only thing what he wanted is to save.</span> <span id="s873">And the -- he opened his hands for kids -- for older people and children.</span> <span id="s874">Some [indecipherable] we had -- the children were born in the woods.</span> <span id="s875">Abortions were done in the woods.</span> <span id="s876">We had a medical staff.</span> <span id="s877">I wouldn’t say that we had so -- so much of antibiotics, it was very hard, but certain operations were done.</span> <span id="s878">People with frozen feet were cured.</span> <span id="s879">People with typhuses were cured.</span> <span id="s880">And the food wasn’t so excellent excellent that, you know, you could put them so fast on -- on their feet.</span> <span id="s881">But the most privileges of food and milk and the better things had the kids and the old -- elder.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Did you yourself come in contact with any of the Russian partisan [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Oh yeah, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s884">First of all they came to visit us because this was a show, we had shows.</span> <span id="s885">They came to a show, like you are going to a show, like I am going to later a show.</span> <span id="s886">Our kids used to perform, we had [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s887">They prepared it, and at night, whoever had a little talent, they rehearse it and they gave a show, and a lot of people used to come to us cause we had a lot of space, we build a special place for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: And then you had to continue moving, so you would just pick up --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: We had to continue moving because we didn’t -- we could not show always for a long time that we are staying in one place.</span> <span id="s890">This was very dangerous, because if so -- w-we found out our -- a -- not agents, intelligence knew that something that determines a [indecipherable] they heard the rumor that they know one person knows where we are, more or less the vicinity, we had already at night to pack up and move.</span> <span id="s891">Leave everything behind us and move.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: How long were you in the woods after [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: I was from ’42 in ju -- end of June, to ’44 July.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: And let’s talk about July of ’44, ha -- how do you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: That was a messy day, this was a very messy day because we lost nine people that day.</span> <span id="s896">For the whole time of -- besides the group of my father’s and the other group on January fifth when my stepmother got killed, there was about five people, I think, this was the biggest amount of people that to -- were killed in one day.</span> <span id="s897">This was when the Russians started to come in, and the Germans started to move out.</span> <span id="s898">And they were wild, and they still had weapon, and -- and they came to our woods, but we weren’t afraid of them because we were -- had already a backing from the Russian that we knew that the army’s coming in the back.</span> <span id="s899">And our people wanted to take revenge.</span> <span id="s900">So every German that they found, they were killing him.</span> <span id="s901">They were revenging better than they did, believe me.</span> <span id="s902">They cut it -- pieces from them until my husband made a stop of it.</span> <span id="s903">He said, “Just leave it, let’s leave them to the authorities, they’ll pay their price.”</span> <span id="s904">But before they came up to -- to our -- to our base, they met with our people and they had a fight, and nine people killed at that time in one day.</span> <span id="s905">Next day we led to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s906">This was a tragedy because to live through years, and then the last day just before freedom, to lose people, he was sick over it.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: And the ma -- then you started to leave the woods [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: He lead them -- he lead them to Novagudek.</span> <span id="s909">He made -- he made -- there was, you know, very little people left, only the one that survived in the woods.</span> <span id="s910">That’s -- so what -- the people were left, the rest were all Gentiles.</span> <span id="s911">The one -- the war -- the one that lived through the war there.</span> <span id="s912">For Jews there were only the one that escaped for -- to the woods.</span> <span id="s913">And maybe some of them were in Russia that they came later on.</span> <span id="s914">So they organized, each one of the partisans got a -- a notification that he served in the partisans from this year to this year, and now they are free and welcome to go where and do whatever they want.</span> <span id="s915">And each one went out for the document -- there is the doc -- documents in Israel to -- that they have, you know, they made photocopies of it, because very little ha -- remained with them.</span> <span id="s916">They could travel to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: And what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: They were -- husband didn’t stay too long in Novagudek, my husband decided to go to Lida and they give him -- he had no problem of getting work.</span> <span id="s919">I was a librarian at that time, I got a job.</span> <span id="s920">And he started to -- we had no electricity in Lida during the war, and everything was destroyed.</span> <span id="s921">So they put him on the job to bring back the electricity to the city, to Lida.</span> <span id="s922">And he should manage that and be in charge of it.</span> <span id="s923">And it was a big deal to build it, but he was very [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s924">He knew that he wouldn’t be able to live in Russia, and that too many people knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Were just the two of you together?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: T-Two of us together, and his brother and his wife and a younger brother.</span> <span id="s927">But we lived -- everyone lived separate, so we didn’t live together.</span> <span id="s928">And he didn’t like the attitude of the Russian people.</span> <span id="s929">He didn’t like them in the woods, and he didn’t like them coming out from the woods.</span> <span id="s930">And he knew that someday they’ll find some reason to -- to do something to him.</span> <span id="s931">And in not quite a year, I think maybe nine or se-seven months, he decided that he wants to leave Lida, he wants out of Poland, he wants out of Russia.</span> <span id="s932">And that -- then we escaped.</span> <span id="s933">We were again the first ones to escape.</span> <span id="s934">We left.</span> <span id="s935">Him, me, I was pregnant at that time and we went through hell, we came to Wilna, from Wilna -- but everybody knew my husband, so wherever he came he had a welcome, he had no problems of getting nowhere.</span> <span id="s936">Everything was directed.</span> <span id="s937">People fr -- even from Israel there was [indecipherable] representatives sent from Israel, you know, for the survivors to th -- to direct them where to go.</span> <span id="s938">So we were direct to -- to Poland, I came to my city, Bialystok, I looked at the -- at the streets and the houses and this -- I didn’t want to stay one day.</span> <span id="s939">And on top of everything, my husband was recognized by one of the Russian [indecipherable] and he said, “Oh, you are still alive, you are here?”</span> <span id="s940">So next morning we were -- escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: We went to Lublin, and in Lublin was the same story, we stayed 10 days, after 10 days somebody met him again.</span> <span id="s943">And he didn’t want to get involved with them.</span> <span id="s944">And -- and slowly we went through [indecipherable] it wasn’t so easy.</span> <span id="s945">We got in touch with the Israeli representatives, and they managed us, from there we went to Czechoslovakia, and then we went to Hungary and then we stayed in Romania for a half a year.</span> <span id="s946">I lost my child there, and -- and then they -- we got officially certificates from the British government to go to official [indecipherable], yeah, just because of him.</span> <span id="s947">So we legally -- legally by boat went -- after a half a year, we stayed in Romania a half a year in a kibbutz, and as th -- and waited for our certificates because they promised them, else we won’t go any other way, you’ll go legally to Israel for your [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: And when did you arrive in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: In ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And how long did you stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: I stayed there a la -- quite er -- probably about 11 years, he stayed 10 years because he got very sick.</span> <span id="s952">He had a very bad ulcer, and in that time they didn’t operate in Israel yet, so he had a family in the States, and they forced him to come and to operate, but he didn’t want to do on his own, so he waited I should come, and I had two small kids and I didn’t want to part with Israel for no money.</span>
