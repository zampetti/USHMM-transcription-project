MONCRIEF: Okay.</span> <span id="s3">Uh, in April of 1945, the war had reached the stage where soldiers, had reached the stage that soldiers called it a rat race.</span> <span id="s4">The Germany army was pretty much, uh, upset and it was a matter of the Americans just chasin' 'em.</span> <span id="s5">It became a real rat race.</span> <span id="s6">Uh, on the eleventh, part of our division overran a camp at Buch- concentration camp at Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s7">Uh I was a, I was a G-1, lieutenant colonel, as a G-1 of the division headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">G-1 is a staff officer on the general staff of the commanding general.</span> <span id="s9">His capa- his job has to do with many aspects of personnel.</span> <span id="s10">Part of which are prisoners.</span> <span id="s11">So when the message came into division headquarters, the general wasn't at the headquarters.</span> <span id="s12">At this stage of the game, I don't remember where the headquarters was located.</span> <span id="s13">It was north of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s14">When the message came, it was, we became sort of frantic.</span> <span id="s15">It talked about thousands of people dying, and our troops had overrun 'em.</span> <span id="s16">So immediately I knew that something had to be done and I said before we can really recommend a course of action we've got to know more of the facts.</span> <span id="s17">So I told the chief of staff that I would just go to Buchenwald, and, for myself, find out about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">The message we had received was over radio through two echelons of command before it reached the division.</span> <span id="s19">From the battalion first to a, b- t- to the b- patrol to the battalion to combat command A and then to division headquarters.</span> <span id="s20">So I got in the jeep mounted uh with a radio, and took off for Buchenwald, while driving.</span> <span id="s21">So I got to Buchenwald about uh, I'd say about two hours after this was just my-my estimate at this stage of the game.</span> <span id="s22">I got to Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/13/95 COL JAMES MONCRIEF JR Page 2 Buchenwald about two hours after it had been discovered by our troops.</span> <span id="s24">Troops of the ninth armored infantry battalion, a patrol commanded by Captain Fred Keopfer, found the camp, and fortunately, he had a man who understood German and Russian to some extent, whose name was Gotschok.</span> <span id="s25">Now Sergeant Gotschok overheard a conversation taking place on the side of the road between what our troops consi- our patrol considered to be Germans.</span> <span id="s26">Some of them had German civilian, German military uh, some military uni- -tire, attire.</span> <span id="s27">While also had some civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s28">But they were being roughed up and by some people who Gotschok determined to be Russian because they were speaking Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">So when they were finally separated to the point that uh Gostchok could get them quieted down enough to understand what they were talking about, he found out that there was a concentration camp out the road, ten or twelve, six or eight miles out, I don't know how far they were from it.</span> <span id="s30">So [Ahem] Jefferson said okay, mount a couple of these guys up on our scout car and we'll just go out there and see this camp.</span> <span id="s31">So he radioed into his battalion commander, task force commander actually, it wasn't a battalion commander, who was Colonel, at that time, Captain Bennett.</span> <span id="s32">And Captain Bennett said well go on out there and see what is taking place, come back in and let me know.</span> <span id="s33">So with that, uh, Koepfer then had these Germans up on the front end of his m- uh, scout car, and went out to the north rim of the camp, where the Russians apparently had gotten out.</span> <span id="s34">Now these Russians turned out to be former inmates of the camp.</span> <span id="s35">When the German guard left the camp, they all took off in a cloud of dust when they heard all the commotion of the war coming on, artillery and sound of tanks and so on.</span> <span id="s36">There was no fight for Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s37">The German guard had just simply ran.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">And when they, Russians, after the German guard got out, the Working transcript: not spell checked

hole in the fence, barbed wire, and gotten out.</span> <span id="s40">And then they found these Germans guards up in the little village, and that's the reason that led to how are troops getting in there.</span> <span id="s41">So when our detail, our patrol got down there, they went to the same opening that these troops had gotten ou-, Russians had gotten out.</span> <span id="s42">And found themselves in the camp, by the time they got there though, they were overpowered with able-bodied, as able-bodied as they were, not many of them were that strong, believe me.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">But some were able-bodied and were out in the compound area and were therefore ________ for the Americans when they came in.</span> <span id="s44">So they began to have a big celebration.</span> <span id="s45">Pitchin, they just want to touch the Americans, and they were touching by grabbing them and throwing up in the air and trying to catch them and so on.</span> <span id="s46">And Koepfer said that he was afraid he was gonna get killed, dropped out there and get hurt.</span> <span id="s47">So we finally got some order maintained, told them to quiet down.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">By this time, he was led to a man who appeared to be the leader of the group, and they were well organized, incidentally, the inmates were.</span> <span id="s49">And then between them the, I don't know, well Gotschok was there to-to interpret for 'em.</span> <span id="s50">Uh, Koepfer told em to stay in place, we gonna get help quick as we can.</span> <span id="s51">And he sent his radio message, through these various echelons, came to the division.</span> <span id="s52">And I got there about two hours later.</span> <span id="s53">Our troops, Koepfer and his patrol had already gone.</span> <span id="s54">There might have been, and I don't remember, there might have been some other American troops there and I think there were, b- from our battalion headquarters, the ninth armored infantry battalion headquarters, who got the message and they came, some of them came up there.</span> <span id="s55">But other than a half a dozen other American soldiers, I don't remember seeing any other Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/13/95 COL JAMES MONCRIEF JR Page 4 American sol- all of whom I thought were in our division.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Looking back, that's the only thing I can remember about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">So when I got there [clears throat] in the meantime I had gone round and I went through the main gate as I recall it.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">I didn't go through the hole in the fence that the troops had found.</span> <span id="s60">So when I got through the- I went through the main gate and there were still a lot of milling around of inmates.</span> <span id="s61">Now let me tell you something about the condition of the inmates, the ones that were milling around.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Obviously, uh, not as in good physical condition at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">But still able to maneuver and move.</span> <span id="s64">Most of them that I saw were men who were, skin was a- looked, _______ skin wise, and it looked, next layer under that was just bone.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">It was absolutely no flesh on the, on the few[?]</span> <span id="s66">people that I saw at all.</span> <span id="s67">Uh some of them were dressed in prison garb and some had on what I would call a T-Shirt, uh, and uh, were just mixed type uni- clothes, none of had on uniform clothing.</span> <span id="s68">So then I said well I'd like to see some of the place, and uh there was a language barrier, obviously.</span> <span id="s69">I didn't have a German or a Russian interpreter.</span> <span id="s70">So in s- sign language and some way or other, I wanted to find out who was in charge or somebody I could talk to.</span> <span id="s71">And finally they brought a young man, a younger inmate, who a man who I considered to be thirty-ish.</span> <span id="s72">Uh, who had, they called him doc-tor.</span> <span id="s73">And it turned out, and when I started talking to him, that he had been a pre-med student and therefore earned the title doctor.</span> <span id="s74">So I told him what I who I was, I was from division headquarters and I wanted to get some of the, some specifics of the problems, and he apparently being a, the doctor, uh knew something of the details and he could me.</span> <span id="s75">And he told me that there were thousands and I tried to pin him down and he didn't really know whether there was 18 or 25 thousand, but he said it was somewhere in that

there.</span> <span id="s77">And he-he said some of them are actually dying, all of them are in need of medical attention, food, uh, fresh water, all of the other requirements for life.</span> <span id="s78">So then I said, well I'd like to look in a barracks, and he was my guide through, I went through one barracks.</span> <span id="s79">And the condition, uh, the conditions I saw there would just turn your stomach.</span> <span id="s80">Uh there was some leaning on the wall, inmates, some lying on the floor, and those lying on the floor I couldn't tell whether they were dead or alive.</span> <span id="s81">Some were in their bunks, they were they were stacked bunks.</span> <span id="s82">And honestly I've forgotten I don't know whether there were three or four stacks.</span> <span id="s83">But there was a-not enough room fo- in the bed space, for a big man to turn over.</span> <span id="s84">If a man my size got in there, he'd have to get out if he wanted to turn over, he'd have to get out, get in the bed a different manner, where, in which he wanted to lie.</span> <span id="s85">They were that thin.</span> <span id="s86">And th- some of the people lying in those bunks were so uh near dead that they didn't have energy enough to turn their head.</span> <span id="s87">When I would walk by.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Not that th- not that they would anyhow, but at least there was a stranger in the barracks, and I know that they-they they recognize if they was still hearing, because I was talking and obviously talking in English.</span> <span id="s89">And I was talking to this, my guide, all through this barracks tour, and none of them bothered to say anything, uh, they just let me walk by.</span> <span id="s90">Well, I went through the barracks, and I told them, uh, I said, is there a mess hall.</span> <span id="s91">So I went through what he...</span></p> <p><span id="s92">SWB: We need to put up another roll</span></p> <p><span id="s93">[CAMERA

Page 6 COL. MONCRIEF: Uh my guide led into what he called a mess hall, it really wasn't much mess hall, I saw some, a big stove, uh with some dirty looking pans and pots around but there was very little space for anybody to sit, in the mess hall.</span> <span id="s96">Uh so I presumed that people got, went by the chow line and got their little rations and then went out and ate it on the grounds somewhere, I don't really know.</span> <span id="s97">Well, there wasn't much there that I could, pay much attention, except that I did see that there was no, no supply of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">He showed me where they did have, what would be a pantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">But there was nothing there.</span> <span id="s100">So then he sh- took me, he said he wanted to show me the crematoria.</span> <span id="s101">Now the crema torium that I saw at least, when I knew, what I saw at Buchenwald, was not any huge thing, it only had two uh big ovens, but they were obviously had been used, they were big enough where you could uh poke a body through it to the end of the doorway, and uh, the thing that I remember more distinctly than anything else about the crematorium was, apparently they had uh brought people in, brought them in to the room alive.</span> <span id="s102">And had yanked them up or tied them up by their feet.</span> <span id="s103">Because at, about my height of my eyesight, on the walls, were these places where somebody had, it obviously hadn't been done by any tool to make them even and smooth, it was clawed with fingernails, into the wall.</span> <span id="s104">And you could, you could this uh shook me up.</span> <span id="s105">Uh there were only two place, two ovens as I said there.</span> <span id="s106">Now, uh, there was a, although the uh ovens were warm on the outside, it wasn't hot, it just feel it warm, I could see no evidence in the side of the ovens, this b- my guide opened the door for me and there was nothing that I could detect in the way of bodies, or ash or bodies.</span> <span id="s107">Uh, just outside and around the corner was a whole stack of bodies, just stacked up like Working transcript: not spell checked or

id="s110">Uh whether they had been uh, whether they just died naturally and were moved out there to one central spot, or whether they had been murdered and brought there, I don't know.</span> <span id="s111">But they were just stacked up out there.</span> <span id="s112">Well, with that, I figured I had enough, I tried to pin him down some more and I s- he showed me where the area of the camp was, I did not go through the whole area, mine was just a cursory inspection, I did not inspect in great detail.</span> <span id="s113">But he did show me the, where the, how far the camp extended, on each side of where we were.</span> <span id="s114">And based on that information, I made a horseback estimate, there must be 20,000 there if they were all billeted in the barracks about like similar to the one that I had seen.</span> <span id="s115">So then I got on my radio and at this stage of the game I don't remember now whether I talked in the clear or whether it was all in code.</span> <span id="s116">I think by this time in the war, everything we could talk in the clear.</span> <span id="s117">So I think I was able to relay it to division headquarters, uh, what I had seen.</span> <span id="s118">And my message was in effect, it's far worse than we had anticipated.</span> <span id="s119">Now, in the division headquarters, uh, that's- that's the purpose of the staff officer, take care of all these little details.</span> <span id="s120">And so, although this was a major detail, I g- I got the G-4 on the other end of the, a G-4 who was a very good friend of mine, just recently died, former senator from the state of Delaware as a matter of fact, name was Bowes, Kale Bowes.</span> <span id="s121">I said Kale things are a whole lot worse than we thought, and uh, so I know you want to get them to radio to the army if you haven't already been in touch with the army.</span> <span id="s122">And tell them what we need.</span> <span id="s123">And I can't begin to tell you what all we need.</span> <span id="s124">Uh, I'm not gonna try to identify every bottle of iodine or anything of that sort.</span> <span id="s125">We need all kind of medical supplies.</span> <span id="s126">We need enough food for 20,000 people.</span> <span id="s127">We probably need a whole medical Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span

in here and set up some uh kitchen operation, with food.</span> <span id="s130">Uh we need some engineer people in here to purify the water.</span> <span id="s131">Uh, we need uh, other support troops to administer, military government.</span> <span id="s132">In the mean time, military government had already been alerted, we had, it- now, within our resources within the division we were somewhat limited in what we can do in, in terms of these lu- furnishing this type of logistical support.</span> <span id="s133">But they had already been alerted, within our division.</span> <span id="s134">So we did exhaust the capabilities that we had even before uh we turned it over to army.</span> <span id="s135">But remember now, our division's mission was to fight the war and we were pursuing the Germans, and they were running fast.</span> <span id="s136">So we couldn't tarry there very long.</span> <span id="s137">Uh, Koepfer and his patrol, being of leading elements of the, of that task force down south, they had already gone.</span> <span id="s138">So he had to dash to catch up, when he sidetracked to come over to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s139">That's how rapidly we were moving.</span> <span id="s140">And he had, his mission was to uh fight the war.</span> <span id="s141">And likewise uh the echelon of division headquarters wasn't able to tarry there very long.</span> <span id="s142">So we, we exhausted, from what we had in our rear echelon, what we called it, trains command, they have th- qu- support and logistical support people.</span> <span id="s143">Uh, they brought, they did leave some rations and some medical people, they have a medical battalion that supports the whole division.</span> <span id="s144">And so they had, I believe it was a medical company that was able to stop there and start some sort of medical treatment.</span> <span id="s145">But that was only just as a temporary expedient.</span> <span id="s146">Army headquarters had to furnish some, and they furnished the, what I call the s- the uh occupying forces to come there and occupy the place and administer and set up all these logistical things.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Working
