He won, of course; but uh later on also he was quite uh popular as a uh as a as defender of Czechoslovakia, uh of Bohemia, because at that time it still belonged to Austria-Hungary.</span> <span id="s32">And uh later on, he became the president; and he was liked by by the whole population.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: What was ____ for the Jewish community in Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: The Jewish community at that time, of course they didn't have the same kind of privileges, officially uh under Austra-Hungary it was of course if somebody would change his religion, they could become in the military a general or something like that, but the religion was quite important.</span> <span id="s35">Under Czechoslovakia, under ...this was under...after 1918, uh the population whether they were Jewish or Christian, they were all equal.</span> <span id="s36">Of course, like everywhere else, there were certain anti-Semitic behav...it was some certain anti-Semitic behavior.</span> <span id="s37">They...they were not allowed to do some small thing; but in the long-run, there was, it was quite uh good society.</span> <span id="s38">I mean, toward to some in in a way uh the republic - I am sorry, I should have mentioned the the Czechoslovakia Republic was uh really under, was uh established not only under President Masaryk, but also uh who was another uh father of the country, was uh was uh was uh President Wilson of United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: As we learn more about the time that you're speaking of, and how was your family living through this early period before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Quite well, and the Jews did imp...did improve everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: And in your particular family, did you have a sister or....?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: I..</span> <span id="s43">.</span> <span id="s44">I did have a sister and brother.</span> <span id="s45">My sister went to schools, of course; and my uh my uh...when the, when the Germans came she was already about 19 years old.</span> <span id="s46">She had some business school.</span> <span id="s47">And my brother studied uh on the University to become a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s49">Now you mentioned when the Germans came.</span> <span id="s50">Could you tell us a little about your memory of when the Germans came?</span> <span id="s51">Where you were for example?</span> <span id="s52">How old you were?</span> <span id="s53">What you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: At at that time the uh (ph) in the town of Munich.</span> <span id="s55">Before Munich, the...our situation was: neither the French, nor...nor the uh...nor the British, they didn't uh somehow... They...they considered Czechoslovakia as a small state, and there was no reason for them uh to interfere.</span> <span id="s56">They tried to save the world of World War.</span> <span id="s57">Which is something.</span> <span id="s58">I mean, this is known of course today through radio.</span> <span id="s59">So everybody knows how...how Munich developed and what they had.</span> <span id="s60">But the first time Czechoslovakia had tried to defend them...uh to to defend itself.</span> <span id="s61">Later on, it was...and when it was visible the Germans were going to help Czechoslovakia uh they uh the Czech were very easily taken over by by German, by Germany.</span> <span id="s62">Who...it was in the morning, perhaps, when I saw the...under the windows where of our house marching soldiers, these were German soldiers in these... Uh, prepared to shoot anybody who would would run or would try to to do uh to to defend Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s63">Now, of course, some people were killed; but in the long-run not that much happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: But that was 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Can you...how old were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Uh, was some 20, 29.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And what were you doing for your livelihood at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: At...at that time I was working in a uh for a firm which uh they were in ex...import and export different products to in Europe and bringing again other things in.</span> <span id="s70">But I was also schooled as a painter; so this was my second profession.</span> <span id="s71">And what really happened, something what used to be a second profession...or really uh just uh it it was it was... Uh, pardon me...(stuttering) It was - I have to study - I think now uh this was my second profession; and now the second profession became the first profession.</span> <span id="s72">Because when they came, I got uh a group of people who who used to, uh whom I knew, they started to to paint uh pictures for for some Swiss uh company.</span> <span id="s73">Those pictures were ________ pretty ugly but anyhow it was a hand-made product that and then I did something for for my and for myself I was painting cause uh for some company - uh it was a book store and a uh and a factory - it it was a book store where where they were selling there pictures and ...</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: During that time, were there any difficulties that you and your family experienced?</span> <span id="s75">This was after the German occupation in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: There were not too many difficulties.</span> <span id="s77">Only the difficulties were those that were imposed by the Ger...by the German that we couldn't walk after after six or after six or eight o'clock.</span> <span id="s78">I don't recall anymore.</span> <span id="s79">In the evening we couldn't go to the parks because the parks were not allowed for Jews and dogs of course and uh the the population remained _______ of course the population I mean the Jewish population couldn't go around and buy uh uh whatever they would need immediately.</span> <span id="s80">They had to go after certain hours which, and there was the the best meats or what best products were sold out, then they could come and and buy whatever there was necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: But during this period of time - this was 1938 and '39...</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Right.</span> <span id="s83">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: What happened, then, to change that experience?</span> <span id="s85">When did the difficulties begin...?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: The...the difficulties started immediately because when the German came the main thing was that uh we have to deliver radios, perhaps so we couldn't hear - we we wouldn't be informed what's happening.</span> <span id="s87">Then of course we had to uh of course not everybody had to uh obey.</span> <span id="s88">Of course if you were caught you went to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s89">I used to go always in the evening to my friend who had a radio and listen there.</span> <span id="s90">What we did we listen uh uh radio uh uh radio London and uh then what was also prohibited uh to possession of gold and silver and so on.</span> <span id="s91">What my father did, he bought some very cheap pieces of uh...of uh rings, and so on; and then, even those and the good one, he kept.</span> <span id="s92">It was uh...of course, it was again prohibited very severely; but uh what happened that uh our maid saved most of the gold.</span> <span id="s93">And...but what we had in gold or uh uh precious stone and so on, by uh...by the maid.</span> <span id="s94">And uh uh so ...so she kept everything until the end of the uh...until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s95">Then I came back, and I got it back again from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: But let's go back now to the time that uh we were speaking of before and please tell us about how you and your family were taken to the camp?</span> <span id="s97">What was the circumstance of that...?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: The circumstances uh it was it was decided by the Jewish leadership - I don't anymore recall the official name of it - which families should go.</span> <span id="s99">They get their numbers and uh they left uh there Prague.</span> <span id="s100">Of course it was very often also happened that uh like in everything certain people had a priority to go and or not to go.</span> <span id="s101">But the those things do happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: And in your case, could you tell us how it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s104">Uh we we got uh we got uh asked to to be to be prepared to have certain uh certain amount of luggage what we can carry with us.</span> <span id="s105">I think it was like forty kilos, something like that.</span> <span id="s106">And uh to be in in - it was a big building and there the uh uh - I don't know, recall any more the name uh the name of it.</span> <span id="s107">Anyhow, we stayed there overnight, I think for two days - I I don't recall any more.</span> <span id="s108">And then we were then we left by train to to Theresienstadt [NB: Terezín].</span> <span id="s109">It was not everybody.</span> <span id="s110">My...my brother, he married at that time.</span> <span id="s111">He stayed still in Prague.</span> <span id="s112">Uh my father, mother and sister--we left for Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Do you remember when that was?</span> <span id="s114">Not precisely the date, no not precisely the date, but more or less - was it in the wintertime?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: It was...it was in wintertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: And when you got to Theresienstadt, what what did you think of the entry?</span> <span id="s117">What impressed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: At that time, uh we were just what we uh we just carried our luggage.</span> <span id="s119">And we were actually quite uh happy that we were allowed to have uh that amount of luggage, what it was allowed to take with us.</span> <span id="s120">Uh, it was decided also by... I was...by sheer luck, I..</span> <span id="s121">.</span> <span id="s122">I got to a into a barra... Pardon me.</span> <span id="s123">I should say that Theresienstadt was city, and there were military barracks; and I uh, by sheer incident [NB: accident], these many... Uh, the men were separated far from women.</span> <span id="s124">And I got to Magdeburg uh barracks, and uh it was quite close where our room where I was.</span> <span id="s125">And I uh was very close where the main leadership of the...of Theresienstadt lived.</span> <span id="s126">I uh the my my first occupation where I did, what I what I did, I joined uh OD.</span> <span id="s127">This was Ordnung Name (ph), or something like that.</span> <span id="s128">It was something like a police.</span> <span id="s129">It was not a ghetto police.</span> <span id="s130">It...it was a separate thing.</span> <span id="s131">This...this one was only kind of an organization.</span> <span id="s132">We should worry that people would work uh on the in the ghetto in proper way or just a small...it was a..</span> <span id="s133">.</span> <span id="s134">it was not the police, but something similar.</span> <span id="s135">Uh, luckily that I was...I got a room where uh where there was a uh (pause) the leadership of the camp - there there was at that time there was leader of the camp, of Theresienstadt was [Dr. Jacob] Edelstein, and he went probably uh and also uh... Pardon me, I was where at the ghetto [wahe (ph)] it was winter, a very severe winter, and we we had to stand there for many hours in the uh uh in the barracks.</span> <span id="s136">Of course, the water was cold, and it was a very unpleasant situation.</span> <span id="s137">Luckily I, one day I was standing there.</span> <span id="s138">And which is a transport going through, I uh I met my again my uncle uh Fishel (ph), who who was an engineer.</span> <span id="s139">He got into the uh in in Theresienstadt by because he...as an engineer, he built railroads.</span> <span id="s140">And at that time, there was nobody else above him as a specialist in that field; and uh he got to Theresienstadt in a separate wagon with all his possession.</span> <span id="s141">And he helped me to get in in the Technical Department, which was... Technical Department was a group of about uh a hundred painters, mainly hund...hundred.</span> <span id="s142">It was about engineers, main... mainly these uh engineers and painters and draftsmen.</span> <span id="s143">So would...would be there in a way considered draftsmen and painters together; and uh uh what my job was to uh to uh to prepare everyday statistics...take statistics take for the Kommandatur to uh... These were uh...we had to...on small strips, we had to write down how many people did receive certain amount of food, how much and so on.</span> <span id="s144">Uh, statistics also who died, who didn't die, how many are living and under what condition and so on.</span> <span id="s145">Just statistics.</span> <span id="s146">But besides that, what we did: we painted.</span> <span id="s147">This was allowed by the...by the Germans.</span> <span id="s148">Nobody didn't know exactly why it was allowed, but it was.</span> <span id="s149">And many of those things which I at that time done were not pleasing to the Germans of course, but they didn't object.</span> <span id="s150">Un later on many of those things were hidden but uh at that time it it it was alright.</span> <span id="s151">The statistics had to be delivered and everyday on the German Komandatur; and uh at the time the the leader of the the German main, the uh the uh how could I say, the main leader of the Germans was uh was Seidl.</span> <span id="s152">But the uh unpleasant thing was delivering all of the of the strips, the statistics to the Kommandatur, to uh... And...and what happened one day, uh about seven people were called because uh they either got from outside some cigarettes, or they wrote letters.</span> <span id="s153">And those seven people were uh were hung.</span> <span id="s154">And uh I had at that time...in the morning, I..</span> <span id="s155">.</span> <span id="s156">I had to deliver the numbers with uh the uh uh Jewish leader, Edelstein, to the Kommandatur and uh and delivered those numbers.</span> <span id="s157">You had to push them in the opening of the...you know, he had just a _____ on the wall; and, of course, the Germans were mad at us.</span> <span id="s158">I expect they were kicked us out, out of the Kommandatur.</span> <span id="s159">But there were other uh quite interesting things which were happening in the ghetto which are probably known today to everybody, uh that uh that the uh what they were concert given, they were uh they were also uh... What I want to say?</span> <span id="s160">Besides that, there were other different cultural things happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Could you tell us a little about the paintings that you were making, and those that your colleagues were making?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: The paintings uh actually today exist in...in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s163">A whole department, a museum, where they where they are showing all...all...many of those paintings which were saved among the people who _____(ph), and [Bed_ich] Fritta and [Otto] Ungar, and others who became to the... Under Czechoslovakia, they became national painters.</span> <span id="s164">They were, of course, uh my, my... Pardon me, uh my father worked at that time also in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s165">Just later on when my brother came, he was also working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s166">And uh, if I recall, my father was... he was a supervisor.</span> <span id="s167">But there was a..</span> <span id="s168">.</span> <span id="s169">what was happening there was a big uh fuss because of many things they did disappeared from the kitchen.</span> <span id="s170">People were stealing, and so on; and he was very much against it, so he was thrown out.</span> <span id="s171">Those people who did uh who did steal, of course, they stayed.</span> <span id="s172">Nothing happened to them.</span> <span id="s173">But what was happening was uh that the life in Theresienstadt was, in a way, it was quite bad for elderly people.</span> <span id="s174">For the people who were still young and quite strong, it was not that bad.</span> <span id="s175">They could, they could survive, because the work was not that difficult.</span> <span id="s176">But it... the possibility of surviving for young people was quite a good one.</span> <span id="s177">With the elderly, it was a difficult situation because they were under the roofs of the uh of the barracks.</span> <span id="s178">In day, it was either cold or hot; and many of those people died.</span> <span id="s179">When the beginning the city had some, let's say, some six thousand people.</span> <span id="s180">These either soldiers and many prostitutes too.</span> <span id="s181">The population was uh...of Theresienstadt, was uh...was uh...send other parts of Czechoslovakia; and all the Jews were, we were.</span> <span id="s182">They took over the highest, probably.</span> <span id="s183">There were about uh sixty, I think...I don't... fifty or sixty thousand people living in the...in the city.</span> <span id="s184">Which was originally about for six thou...six thousand people before.</span> <span id="s185">Therefore, it was quite difficult uh...what quite difficult conditions for people to uh to uh to to exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: How long were you in that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: In the camp, I was only from from the December [1941] 'til uh...'til uh January...I think, 11th, '42.</span> <span id="s188">Something like three quaters of a year.</span> <span id="s189">And uh at that time, what happened uh that people who were in the...were indispensable, they could stay.</span> <span id="s190">They would stay, and save their family with them.</span> <span id="s191">Uh I tried that my... I gave my name just the same that I will go with my family uh if I can...I would go by my there with my family.</span> <span id="s192">That way, my ...I saw that my job is so indispensable that they wouldn't take me, and save my family, too.</span> <span id="s193">But uh this was...it was that uh uh painter Fritta, who was my relative, that he tried all night...was standing there inside to get me out, and my family too.</span> <span id="s194">But it didn't work out.</span> <span id="s195">So I went...so I went to uh...with, with the train to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: And in Auschwitz, what did you find?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: In Auschwitz, uh the first...the first thing which was that the train in which we went...was...every train had a leader.</span> <span id="s198">I became one of those ... And uh took care of the...the wagon.</span> <span id="s199">And every, every wagon had their leader.</span> <span id="s200">And uh the first thing, the first impression was the toilet.</span> <span id="s201">There were only end of barrels there, you know.</span> <span id="s202">There were kids or grown-ups or whatever; and the first thing, was there was an old man who was sitting there, and he died just... We, we saw the first man died like that in the train.</span> <span id="s203">It was a very bad, horrible impression, for...for the elderly people, mainly.</span> <span id="s204">Uh, we travelled uh about two days to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s205">We did not know where we ...where we were; and uh after questioning where we were, he said ... Uh, the German soldier said, in Honolulu - it's very very hot here.</span> <span id="s206">Then as the leader of the...of the wagon, I had to take uh care of to to get all all the people out of the...out of the wagon; and the sick one or the dead one, to get them out.</span> <span id="s207">And this was the first time I lost my family, because I didn't see them.</span> <span id="s208">I saw only that they...that they had to get out, and this was the end what I saw.</span> <span id="s209">I tried, and still...because I did not know what it is, I tried to uh to carry my rucksack and my luggage.</span> <span id="s210">And I could only hear or saw some SS men, you know, beat people and try that they would leave the luggage there and...and run.</span> <span id="s211">Uh, I..</span> <span id="s212">.</span> <span id="s213">I did not.</span> <span id="s214">I..</span> <span id="s215">.</span> <span id="s216">I tried still to carry the luggage.</span> <span id="s217">And some SS men kicked me and ran me out, so I I I did...I did uh fall.</span> <span id="s218">I had... I had to go where they were showing me.</span> <span id="s219">And there were two groups of people.</span> <span id="s220">There were the young...young men, and uh elderly men; and the same thing with women.</span> <span id="s221">And also there were some kind of a truck or what for, for people that were sick.</span> <span id="s222">So, uh I..</span> <span id="s223">.</span> <span id="s224">I just saw the man standing there.</span> <span id="s225">So I I got in the group without really knowing what...what it meant, of course.</span> <span id="s226">And this was uh...then we had to march.</span> <span id="s227">We marched to the barracks in Auschwitz, and uh I had... Uh, we got uh the uh we got to the bathroom there.</span> <span id="s228">Or two different kinds of...there were some different rooms.</span> <span id="s229">There was a pandemonium, because uh people were scared and they were without uh ... They they felt that this is the end of the world, because because they were screaming and beating and so on.</span> <span id="s230">And also there was...it was there were inscription: whoever has any money, or or stones or anything--I mean precious stones--they should give it away.</span> <span id="s231">Uh I had some money, so the...if if I recall still, I didn't know where to put it.</span> <span id="s232">One couldn't throw it anywhere, so there were four sets in...one's a toilet.</span> <span id="s233">And I rolled all the money and pushed it in the faucet.</span> <span id="s234">Then we went also from from there on we went to the barracks and uh where we should stay.</span> <span id="s235">We got some soup to eat.</span> <span id="s236">Of course, the soup was so horrible; and of course we didn't eat.</span> <span id="s237">We just _______ .</span> <span id="s238">We give it to to to the other häftlings, meaning uh the prisoners, and they were very happy.</span> <span id="s239">They they told us we need don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s240">We are going to eat it very soon.</span> <span id="s241">Which was, of course, true.</span> <span id="s242">And in Auschwitz, I stayed from uh quite... Actually, Auschwitz as such was uh it was uh a city, it was a city by itself, more or less.</span> <span id="s243">There was Auschwitz No. 1 and Auschwitz No. 2, 3, and Buna, where I later was.</span> <span id="s244">This was uh Auschwitz No. 3.</span> <span id="s245">, meaning Buna...meant Buna _______, they made other... What they wanted to do, they wanted to uh have a factory uh to to make artificial rubber.</span> <span id="s246">And uh in uh Auschwitz uh I stayed, as I said, almost about a week.</span> <span id="s247">Uh there was uh I worked on a..</span> <span id="s248">.</span> <span id="s249">on this a a (pause) uh worked on on on the road by using a big roller, the big roller.</span> <span id="s250">Then I was now in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s251">It's still standing there.</span> <span id="s252">It was enormous kind of a roller which had to be pulled or pushed by the people.</span> <span id="s253">Of course, who got underneath were killed very easily.</span> <span id="s254">And uh I stayed uh in Auschwitz uh about about a week.</span> <span id="s255">Every day, there was uh uh practically pandemonium because nobody didn't know what really happening more or less.</span> <span id="s256">Everybody was out of his wits.</span> <span id="s257">And nevertheless, then after...after a week we were put again in a group; and we were marched to to uh we we marched to Buna, which was uh very... Buna as such really didn't exist yet.</span> <span id="s258">It was only part; the barracks were built, but the rest of the city didn't exist.</span> <span id="s259">First thing what we had to do really was so called "[planien (ph)]," which meant straightening out the ground.</span> <span id="s260">And uh besides they didn't have any equipment.</span> <span id="s261">They didn't have any tractors, or very few ones; and the railroad was there, but uh everything else must have been done by hand.</span> <span id="s262">So the first day, what we really did was were just working on the on the grounds try try to straighten it or making holes and cover them up again.</span> <span id="s263">Just a..</span> <span id="s264">.</span> <span id="s265">just a job so uh we would we would do something.</span> <span id="s266">Uh it was also very distressing to uh to get perhaps numbers to be tattooed, and so on.</span> <span id="s267">To get the numbers, we did not know what the reason was we are doing; because they just called the number and you got some two pieces of of uh of uh linen.</span> <span id="s268">Uh, written on it, you know, your number; and they...you should, you should have it put on your trousers or on your on your coat.</span> <span id="s269">And uh uh after...after that, we uh we were...uh we, we got numbered in the barracks where we could stay.</span> <span id="s270">We every every barrack uh had its uh uh... (pause) Every barrack was uh...had bunks uh... (pause) I mean, beds; and uh there were about five people, I don't know anymore whether they were five or six people on each on the levels to be uh (pause) where where the people could sleep.</span> <span id="s271">I don't know if I pronounce it properly.</span> <span id="s272">Anyhow ... (pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s274">Would you like to take a drink of water now, just for a moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: I can ______.</span> <span id="s276">(Drinking)</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Let's start thinking back now to what you were just describing as your experience in Buna, as a..</span> <span id="s278">.</span> <span id="s279">as a camp.</span> <span id="s280">The kind of work you were doing...</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: ...what life was like, and how long you stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s284">In in Buna, I stayed from the 28th or 27th October 19 uh 40 40...</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: It doesn't matter the year.</span> <span id="s286">Just ...</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: It...it was until...until year '45.</span> <span id="s288">And uh from the beginning, I was uh (pause) ______ didn't have any special job, just just straightening the uh ground.</span> <span id="s289">But later on, by sheer incident [NB: accident], they were looking for somebody who would who who could paint uh...who could paint the arbeit...(ph), who was a uh SS man who took uh who took care that people would be working or what kind of recommend they got their kommando and so on.</span> <span id="s290">How how would...where they would be working.</span> <span id="s291">And uh uh since I was... by sheer incident or luck, I I got some pencil and some piece of paper.</span> <span id="s292">And I painted the SS man; because he was always riding a bicycle, and I I painted him.</span> <span id="s293">This really should have been some gift to him, on a on a a bike...like for children, on a tricycle.</span> <span id="s294">Of course, this was a joke.</span> <span id="s295">And if he didn't take it as such, you likely could have been destroyed.</span> <span id="s296">And...but luckily, it didn't happen; and uh he was very happy with it, and I got a job in a in a uh barrack where there were painters who had painted.</span> <span id="s297">And also they worked in a in a in a building where...where they were making numbers for for prisoners.</span> <span id="s298">So the the first thing, for about a week or two weeks, I was making numbers for for prisoners.</span> <span id="s299">And these will take quite nice job.</span> <span id="s300">Later on, I was uh I was uh replaced by uh by a by a German uh German opera singer from Munich.</span> <span id="s301">His name was Kiep (ph); and because he was German he he got the better kind of a job.</span> <span id="s302">But...and I was...but I was told in the evening, if I want to I can come by my free will...I can paint still the number.</span> <span id="s303">Which was a very good thing to do, because what happened uh--not that every every every häftling or every prisoner had to have...had to have a number--but the number was extremely important because if it was stamped, it was a big number.</span> <span id="s304">But you could have a smaller number done by hand, and the smaller numbers meant you became...you were more or less prominent.</span> <span id="s305">The SS knew about it, that it is uh that uh something like that exist.</span> <span id="s306">But somehow they did let it go, and people were very often treated according to what kind of a number they had.</span> <span id="s307">What I did, I used to come then.</span> <span id="s308">And in the evening, when I was...after after work, and work and worked there probably two hours.</span> <span id="s309">For that, I got more soup.</span> <span id="s310">And uh having more soup was a quite...a quite uh, I think, important; because you lived a little bit better.</span> <span id="s311">Not only that, you could...that I could uh have twice as much, but I could have... I did have also a uh a friend who was who was taking care of me otherwise.</span> <span id="s312">He darned my uh my uh my socks, or whatever I needed; and I gave him again the soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: You mentioned that you stayed in Buna until 1945.</span> <span id="s314">What happened then to cause you to leave Buna?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Oh, what (stutter) because on the 18th of January, the uh... Pardon me, '45, uh came the...the Russians came quite close, and therefore I had to leave Buna.</span> <span id="s316">But they...actually, what mattered in in Buna the life was not only like that... Uh, I don't know if I should have said, perhaps, that I got uh uh I got a Czech kapo for whom I made a uh number.</span> <span id="s317">And he was...he was a communist; and I asked him if I could work for him.</span> <span id="s318">And uh the Czech kapo uh was quite good man.</span> <span id="s319">He he didn't beat his people, and uh it it did.</span> <span id="s320">And I got...he got the first kommando; and the first kommando was divided among people who worked in the in the electro magazine, part of them, and the second part were...were the...the musicians.</span> <span id="s321">The musicians were many of outstanding musicians who played all over Europe, but there they were playing only for people who were working in the morning.</span> <span id="s322">So they gave their coming in the evening.</span> <span id="s323">And since they were quite prominent people--meaning that they had a better clothes a little bit--we had a little bit better clothes just the same as they did.</span> <span id="s324">Uh and uh what...what happened was uh many different events did perhaps the kapo in the in the in the Malerei [NB: paintshop, or artists' studio], where they make where they were making the the uh uh (pause) ...the numbers.</span> <span id="s325">He was... he was changed from uh...from uh...because he was half Jewish, and they had uh they they were told in the cases they would prefer to be Germans.</span> <span id="s326">They would have the possibility to become if they would _____ also; and uh there was not everybody... Uh, no, wanted say that uh it was there was perhaps a bordello in the camp.</span> <span id="s327">I mean, these were the funniest things what what happened too.</span> <span id="s328">Not only the horrible things.</span> <span id="s329">And then he became a German the next day, for which he could go to the bordello.</span> <span id="s330">And uh there...there, he told to to the girls there.</span> <span id="s331">And he suddenly discovered that she's from the same city, and they know each other; and he didn't perform as he should.</span> <span id="s332">So the SS man started to scream at him.</span> <span id="s333">And uh anyhow nothing happened; but I mean just as a funny thing, what what which were happening there.</span> <span id="s334">Uh another thing is, there was even also an opera in camp, for... Not for everybody, but more or less for the prominents of the...of the prisoners, and the SS.</span> <span id="s335">And the operetta was "Rosamonte."</span> <span id="s336">And uh I had another friend who was uh painter, who became also the kapo of the painters.</span> <span id="s337">He painted like in...like a magician some pictures; and nobody didn't know what was what was happening.</span> <span id="s338">I mean, what was on on on it.</span> <span id="s339">And then he turned it around, and he painted the whole thing upside down.</span> <span id="s340">And he painted some pictures, you know.</span> <span id="s341">Another funny thing was when uh they were uh uh uh... Pardon me...(pause) I wanted to say, there was a dentist and uh he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s342">And one day, there were...there were...there were SS men going with one of those prostitutes, and he had to have his teeth uh redone or something.</span> <span id="s343">He had to... Anyhow, he was sitting there; and the prisoner told him--the SS man--he should open his mouth, which he did, and keep it like that.</span> <span id="s344">The girl was in the...in the other room.</span> <span id="s345">And uh so they...so the häftling went to to to the girl.</span> <span id="s346">They had their business done, and the SS man was still sitting there with with his mouth open.</span> <span id="s347">Another SS man walked by and looked at it, and he started of course to scream.</span> <span id="s348">I don't know what really happened to the prisoner, but this was kind of a funny thing what happened.</span> <span id="s349">On the other hand, horrible things did...did happen.</span> <span id="s350">If somebody did escape, there was uh uh... Did happen a couple of times that people did escape, but very seldom anybody was saved.</span> <span id="s351">But anyhow we had to stand for, of course, for hours until the guy was caught.</span> <span id="s352">And it took hours and hours.</span> <span id="s353">Anyhow, they caught the man.</span> <span id="s354">And uh all...we we were standing there, and he was he was sitting on the edge of the camp.</span> <span id="s355">They poured cold water on him.</span> <span id="s356">And it was, you know, in January.</span> <span id="s357">You can imagine.</span> <span id="s358">He didn't last too long, but he he froze to death.</span> <span id="s359">And the all...all kommandos, all the häftlings had to walk in front of him and uh see the the...how how horrible the end is for anybody who tries...who tries to to escape.</span> <span id="s360">And there were various people who did try to escape.</span> <span id="s361">And I think some did.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Well, as we speak of escape, perhaps you can recall how you left the camp, Buna.</span> <span id="s363">And how you eventually found your way to freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Uh to get out of Buna, uh this was uh on the 18th of January.</span> <span id="s365">It was freezing, and uh the Russians were coming much closer to Buna than the Germans expected.</span> <span id="s366">They were doomed.</span> <span id="s367">And uh actually what happened, my...where I was working in the electro magazine--this was where the Czech kapo existed--uh, the situation was quite good, at least for me.</span> <span id="s368">And I could...I had enough of food that I could ____ uh for for lunch or something, that I could also get couple more uh prisoners who would...who got some soup and so on.</span> <span id="s369">Because I was working there in the office, which was uh very uh uh... I mean, it was an excellent job to have under those conditions.</span> <span id="s370">The only way probably how how I did survive, because I was in the office there.</span> <span id="s371">In the office, I could uh uh...I could quite uh move around.</span> <span id="s372">And I also painted some pictures for the uh for the civilians there.</span> <span id="s373">Because there were civilians uh and uh ...</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: When the Germans realized that the Russians were getting closer...</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: ...what did they do at that point that allowed you to leave Buna?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: They...they didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s378">I mean, uh the Germans... they said, "Alright.</span> <span id="s379">Pack your things, and let's go!"</span> <span id="s380">But because uh, I..</span> <span id="s381">.</span> <span id="s382">I had many uh...I..</span> <span id="s383">.</span> <span id="s384">I knew many of the civilians in the... in the...in the job, they called me on the side and they gave me some some bread and some butter and uh uh they gave me goodbye.</span> <span id="s385">And this was the only thing they could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: And then you started to walk...</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: And then we started to walk to Gleiwitz.</span> <span id="s388">The the thing is that generally prisoners had a long coats, which were... I mean, they were very poor quality; uh but the striped coat... But I had only a short one since I didn't walk.</span> <span id="s389">And what was prohibited, I had under the uh some uh some pieces of of rags or whatever sewn in the coat.</span> <span id="s390">So it was a short one, but it was it was twice as warm as the others.</span> <span id="s391">And uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: How far did you walk, and how long did it take?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: That's what I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s394">From there on, uh we walked to to Gleiwitz, which was about two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: And eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: But we had...we had to walk, we had to walk, and... Which was very difficult; because not only that many prisoners couldn't stand it any more and died on the road and were shot, but many SS men did the same, too.</span> <span id="s397">So it was not only the...it was not only the prisoners who were who were under such a stress.</span> <span id="s398">Even the elderly SS couldn't...couldn't...couldn't stand it themselves.</span> <span id="s399">We got to Gleiwitz, and in ____... There was a pandemonium, really; because nobody didn't know what was happening and they did not know whether should people should con...continue with with their kommandos as they were or not.</span> <span id="s400">And I..</span> <span id="s401">.</span> <span id="s402">after two days... Well, I was not really deranged...doesn't seem like anybody else decided I had to move, so I did.</span> <span id="s403">And moved with them.</span> <span id="s404">We got on a train.</span> <span id="s405">And on the train, and we traveled for about ten days.</span> <span id="s406">The only thing is uh the bread what I had from the from the people in the uh in the electro magazine, where I used to work; and then what we got on the road.</span> <span id="s407">And on the road, we had only some a half of a loaf and some marmalade, and this was it.</span> <span id="s408">And the water, we didn't get; because it was in January, and what we got was only when the snow was coming down and we we had some uh some water.</span> <span id="s409">I was still in a pretty reasonably good shape, because I had some bread and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: But it sounds like that's a fantastic story that you're into now.</span> <span id="s411">We're going to have to pause here for a moment while the tape is being changed, so if you'd like to take another drink of water and ....</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s413">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s415">Mr. Bruml, if you'd like to remember again where we were talking just a few moments ago about the train ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Now if I recall, there are too many things which happened on the train is if very few I can I can recall because the situation was such that people who were uh for for many days without food.</span> <span id="s417">They were dying.</span> <span id="s418">They were laying on the ground of the of the wagon, and many of those other people that uh the the wagon was not that big.</span> <span id="s419">It was a cattle wagon, an open one.</span> <span id="s420">And you can imagine that we didn't have any water.</span> <span id="s421">The only water was the snow which was coming down.</span> <span id="s422">But somehow, I don't recall that much because it was every day was the same - it was pandemonium.</span> <span id="s423">Uh on one side of the of the wagon, were sitting the painters.</span> <span id="s424">On the other side of the wagon were the uh gardeners.</span> <span id="s425">There was another comp...uh and we know each other uh another group, I mean the gardeners.</span> <span id="s426">And in between was the main pleps (ph) of the prisoners who were so called musselmans.</span> <span id="s427">They...we were undernourished, but they were even much more so.</span> <span id="s428">They had only generally a very few days to to to survive; and out of the uh transport of five thousand people, probably only two, two and a half thousand survived.</span> <span id="s429">There were there were very often killing each other, because they thought that somebody was dying already.</span> <span id="s430">They took his shoes, and uh the situation was very horrible.</span> <span id="s431">But even if I talk about it, somehow it is like pulled together in a way that you really don't recall.</span> <span id="s432">Every day was the same.</span> <span id="s433">Every day was so horrible that you don't remember the day before.</span> <span id="s434">Uh after, and we went through Czechoslovakia going to the south.</span> <span id="s435">Some people did throw - they were standing on bridges and they threw some food so the people behaved quite well because what what happened really we went through Czechoslovakia going from the north to the south in Austria, and uh we stopped at Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s436">They thought that they will get rid of us in Mauthausen, but the Mauthausen camp was already, it was a horrible camp.</span> <span id="s437">Very few people did did survive.</span> <span id="s438">The, later on when I, when we were in Mauthausen, uh they told us, there was inscription on it how each nation, how long the people survived, and I think Jews were I think only two uh two uh weeks.</span> <span id="s439">They thought them, anyhow, we were very lucky not to be denied the entrance and we continued with the train.</span> <span id="s440">After ten days we we stopped and uh we were in Dora- Nordhausen.</span> <span id="s441">This this was uh first we were dosed with some uh petroleum, with water, you know, the disinfection, in January and standing there for hours so you can imagine not that many people survived after that.</span> <span id="s442">Uh but uh in Dora-Nordhausen was established really as uh as a camp where they were making uh parts.</span> <span id="s443">It was done under under the mountain.</span> <span id="s444">The camp and people were making, they they had - pardon me - they also railroads there and they were working on the V-2.</span> <span id="s445">Uh anyhow, what happened with me I got uh I didn't uh, I I got in a barrack and I was told not to uh try to uh just try to escape, to work, which I did.</span> <span id="s446">The the ________ probably very seldom that somebody was running around and uh didn't work, but somehow I did, I I managed to do that.</span> <span id="s447">I had a broom and I was cleaning and doing things like that.</span> <span id="s448">But finally they caught on me and they, I was told I was in a transport going to another camp by the name Ellrich.</span> <span id="s449">Luckily, I had uh uh some uh German kapo who told me--uh he was from Elsass-Lothringen [NB: Alsace-Lorraine]--that I would not under any circumstances go with with this group, because they go to a camp by the name Ellrich, and out of that nobody comes generally.</span> <span id="s450">Uh later on I did...I did see it, because when I was standing there I saw wagons of people bloodied, just cadavers and going out of there.</span> <span id="s451">So I didn't get into that; and uh whatever...what happened, I hid myself in a stack of of uh uh uh under some stack.</span> <span id="s452">And uh I hid until...</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Was that a haystack?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: A haystack, right.</span> <span id="s455">That that's what they call it.</span> <span id="s456">I was looking for the word.</span> <span id="s457">And uh I..</span> <span id="s458">.</span> <span id="s459">I stayed there 'til the morning, when the...when all...all the...disappeared.</span> <span id="s460">They were at some two prisoners set on me, so I had to get out.</span> <span id="s461">Which I I did.</span> <span id="s462">And uh I I had some uh prisoner, who who whom I knew he was a kapo.</span> <span id="s463">I shouldn't go there under any circumstances.</span> <span id="s464">And tried to avoid it, which I did.</span> <span id="s465">And uh I I saw some people writing some some names.</span> <span id="s466">So, I am...I just went there and put my name on it, too.</span> <span id="s467">And uh I said I couldn't go with it because I just keeled over, and I just cannot remember what would happen.</span> <span id="s468">So they sent me to a barrack.</span> <span id="s469">And this was a typhus barrack; which I of course did not know.</span> <span id="s470">But I had injection before I didn't get anything.</span> <span id="s471">And since they...I had a friend there again who knew the kapo and said I am a painter.</span> <span id="s472">So what happened, they opened the...the windows and let me out every day; and I used to go to another barracks, and painted pictures.</span> <span id="s473">Uh, they were horrible pictures like uh swans, and... and sun, and...

Uh, you could see the reflectors on the plane; and they started to bomb.</span> <span id="s535">And uh we could jump out of the train; but SS was already out of the train, and they would they would shoot anybody who would run away.</span> <span id="s536">But uh we did finally arrive in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s537">In Bergen-Belsen...uh there, it was...I think, most of the...of the camp was uh uh German inhabitants.</span> <span id="s538">Pardon me, uh German uh women women inhabitants.</span> <span id="s539">And uh (pause) the the events were not, this this was really the last more or less to date in in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s540">So then there were already inscription that it is under the Red Cross, but the SS was still there.</span> <span id="s541">They...they could...could shoot.</span> <span id="s542">Finally uh we saw the uh the the English, who came in.</span> <span id="s543">And they put in charge, because there were very few people with tanks.</span> <span id="s544">So they put in charge SS; but the Hungarian SS.</span> <span id="s545">The Hungarian SS was not exactly much better than the than the German one, but still they they knew that this is the end.</span> <span id="s546">Anyhow, so they didn't do that much.</span> <span id="s547">Some people tried to escape.</span> <span id="s548">These was the Russian, through the canalization...through the canals; and uh they were shooting in.</span> <span id="s549">So I don't know that anybody survived, but I did.</span> <span id="s550">Uh the the door was not anymore, uh the current was cut off, but the door was still there.</span> <span id="s551">So with couple of friends, we jump on the on the door and tried to get over.</span> <span id="s552">Which we did.</span> <span id="s553">And uh run run in the woods.</span> <span id="s554">Finally, we got uh many of those prisoners were running around in the in the farms and so on.</span> <span id="s555">The farmers of course they knew that this is the end so they gave us food and so on and uh many of those prisoners ate as much or tried to gorge themselves as much as as they could, and they got very sick because all the time what we were eating was uh, there was only bread or or soup which was _____ soup, so any any little bit of fat was uh really dangerous to to your intestines.</span> <span id="s556">Uh after that uh the the British came and people were still running around trying to get to the farms, and they took some uh some uh radios and oh some uh some coats and so on what they got.</span> <span id="s557">Some they didn't get.</span> <span id="s558">Something like after every war, people don't behave normally and rationally as they should.</span> <span id="s559">Uh I know we were in some in some family.</span> <span id="s560">They were quite nice people, so they they told us we can lay down on on the bed and sleep, and that was quite nice of them, and uh then we uh then I got back again to the camp because we were told by by the by the British we had to go back again so we did, and uh I got uh a job with the British.</span> <span id="s561">I I got uh in with some paper that I was serving of uh I was working for the UNRRA and uh I stayed with with the British till the I think the July because uh there was a magazine they had some shirts and whatever, some uh uh (pause) underwear and so on.</span> <span id="s562">And I had to to supervise it.</span> <span id="s563">I had to and since I knew Czech and some some uh and I knew German, some some English I could uh I was working for for the British all the time.</span> <span id="s564">And I was also the leader of the Czech barrack and uh I could uh by uh...
