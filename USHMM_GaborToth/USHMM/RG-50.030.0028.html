Saturday, Friday in the evening and the next day Saturday, the town was quiet because it was a holy day, like nobody in the town except in the evening.</span> <span id="s37">I remember Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s38">You could feel it in the air.</span> <span id="s39">You could see the people moving by to...to the Beis Medresh...or to the temple, to the shul.</span> <span id="s40">It was deeply orthodox.</span> <span id="s41">There were a few which did try...uh...to reach out.</span> <span id="s42">For instance, my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">01:03:38 In our town everyone had a name; on top of it, he had a special name given.</span> <span id="s44">For example, if he does...he didn't have a leg, they called him [Leme Yoine (ph)].</span> <span id="s45">[Yoine (ph)] was his name, because uh...my father, why I'm telling him was because my father was already what you call "free thinker."</span> <span id="s46">He did try to move out from the orthodox ways, so they called him [Leibele Goy (ph)].</span> <span id="s47">It was..., my [NB: his] first name was [Leibele (ph)], he was Goy because he did...uh...smoke cigarettes sometimes Saturday.</span> <span id="s48">They did know it.</span> <span id="s49">You can't sneak...you can't smoke cigarettes in Izbica but when the...the shutters in the the home weren't closed, all the peoples in the neighbor did know that my dad was smoking cigarettes Saturday because of it.</span> <span id="s50">I remember mine...if you talk about my childhood.</span> <span id="s51">I will tell you a story which will give you an idea.</span> <span id="s52">Uh...For example, my father had a Polish friend, a Christian.</span> <span id="s53">He send him out to buy pork meat usual; because...uh...nobody could see my dad be going into...uh...to buy pork meat, of course.</span> <span id="s54">So he sent this Christian friend.</span> <span id="s55">And I..</span> <span id="s56">.</span> <span id="s57">once I remember and my father told me, "Try it."</span> <span id="s58">And I tried it and I liked it.</span> <span id="s59">But in that time they used to live in so-called, in a [Urisha (ph)].</span> <span id="s60">You know what [Urisha (ph)] is?</span> <span id="s61">[Urisha (ph)] is a house because it was built maybe 50, 80 years ago by my grand, grand, grandparents and later when the children did get grandchildren, they get married and so on, they divided this house.</span> <span id="s62">So...uh...finally when I..</span> <span id="s63">.</span> <span id="s64">was already over there, when I was about 10 years old, this whole house was divided with partitions that everybody could hear everybody across the wall.</span> <span id="s65">So mine...mine aunt did hear me...did hear the conversation with my dad and she noticed by listening in that time, I'm eating pork meat.</span> <span id="s66">So what...the next thing I remember she opened the door where my father lived and said, "Tom."</span> <span id="s67">"Toivi," not "Tom."</span> <span id="s68">Not Tom.</span> <span id="s69">"Toivi, you eat pork meat?"</span> <span id="s70">I said, "Yes, Mimi, I ate."</span> <span id="s71">"You know what [Streicher(ph)] is?"</span> <span id="s72">"Yes, I know what [Streicher (ph)] is."</span> <span id="s73">"You will go to Hell."</span> <span id="s74">I know about Hell because my uncle told me stories, how they burn people and everything else.</span> <span id="s75">"Promise me, you wouldn't eat any more."</span> <span id="s76">So I say I wouldn't.</span> <span id="s77">And she left.</span> <span id="s78">And I was such...so scared about Hell and everything else that immediately...it was a shock to me I remember...what I remember is I..</span> <span id="s79">.</span> <span id="s80">I was in a high fever and laid down the sofa and my whole head was just like a..</span> <span id="s81">.</span> <span id="s82">like a mill.</span> <span id="s83">And I was sick for about two days.</span> <span id="s84">They called the doctor and that time, you know, the doctor...doctors used to come to the home, and he said, "Give him aspirin.</span> <span id="s85">I don't see anything."</span> <span id="s86">And finally when my Mimi did come to visit me, and I remember the first thing what I ask her was, "Mimi, will I go to Hell?"</span> <span id="s87">And she probably understood what the problem is; that I simply, that I'm that scared.</span> <span id="s88">I'm sick from being scared.</span> <span id="s89">And she said, "Oh, Toivi, you know, don't worry because when your Bar Mitzvah will come, God will forgive you everything."</span> <span id="s90">Now, this...this had a fourfold effect because I wasn't afraid anymore.</span> <span id="s91">I was okay, but I again I did...when mine...the next time my dad did ask me if you want a piece of pork meat, I said "Yes," because anyway, in about two, three years God will forgive me.</span> <span id="s92">So anyway, I just tell you a little picture it was.</span> <span id="s93">Some people they tried to get out from the circle of...uh... orthodox behavior, but it was very...it was trying.</span> <span id="s94">But...I otherwise, actually it was a deeply Jewish town....</span> <span id="s95">uh ...with a very big respect for the Rabbi.</span> <span id="s96">The Rabbi was our authority.</span> <span id="s97">And...uh...Friday, with the shochet and everything else.</span> <span id="s98">And so it was 'til 1939, when the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">01:07:58</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Uh...I remember the town...you know, we didn't have...uh... radios in that time, so any news 1 He may be using the Yiddish word "treife" here.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">was...uh...transmitted by person who had a big...uh...drum...uh...Jewish guy.</span> <span id="s103">His name was [Hydel (ph)], and he did go to the middle of the town to the marketplace and drummed up until all the people had come together, and now he said, "Hello, hello.</span> <span id="s104">This is the news..." and so on.</span> <span id="s105">He did say that a war started.</span> <span id="s106">Hitler invaded Poland, and a mobilization is in order and...uh...he was the latest news from the Burgermeister's office, Mayor's office, I would say.</span> <span id="s107">And he advised to glue in strips of paper on the windows so they shouldn't shatter if the bombs fall down, and that was the news.</span> <span id="s108">So people start to pick up newspapers, cut it in strips, and glue in and some people did prepare dry bread; and so it was in our place too.</span> <span id="s109">And later I remember planes coming.</span> <span id="s110">I remember Polish plane shot down, and the next I remember my family was moving out from the town, hiding in a village from the bombs.</span> <span id="s111">We were afraid that Izbica will be bombed because there was a big factory, a military factory in Izbica uh producing material for fortification purposes.</span> <span id="s112">So I went to this village, Panska- Dolina.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">01:09:57 Over there, I remember Polish soldiers and I remember when the news arrived that the Soviet Union is fighting against Poland, too.</span> <span id="s114">I remember the speech from the Polish officer, that they have, they are stabbed in the back by the Soviet soldiers and now they will fight to the last drop of blood.</span> <span id="s115">And ...uh...later I remember the rumor, the Germans are coming, and now we are a group of people about 25.</span> <span id="s116">We don't know what to do, scared in the forest.</span> <span id="s117">The young people say, "Oh, we will run away from the Germans.</span> <span id="s118">We are going across the river Bug to the Russians."</span> <span id="s119">The older people, mine parents included...my father, "No, we're going back to Izbica.</span> <span id="s120">Germans.</span> <span id="s121">Of course, they're anti-Semites, but they're also people."</span> <span id="s122">And I remember we split then.</span> <span id="s123">It was in the night.</span> <span id="s124">I remember the stars and could be about maybe 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, like a..</span> <span id="s125">.</span> <span id="s126">like a film, like a movie, we departed.</span> <span id="s127">And the sons did walk to the east, and some parents did go back to Izbica.</span> <span id="s128">And I went back with my parents.</span> <span id="s129">We come to Izbica and now...uh.</span> <span id="s130">.</span> <span id="s131">(chuckle) interesting news.</span> <span id="s132">The Germans are leaving.</span> <span id="s133">So I said, "The Germans are leaving.</span> <span id="s134">I didn't see a German soldier.</span> <span id="s135">I must see a German soldier."</span> <span id="s136">So I went down looking for a German soldier.</span> <span id="s137">"Oh, there're two German soldiers still in the bakery buying bread."</span> <span id="s138">So I went to the bakery and I seen in front of them two German soldiers with bikes and talking and they...they sound like Yiddish because German is pretty close to Yiddish.</span> <span id="s139">So I was wondering...take a look, they're speaking my language.</span> <span id="s140">(laughing) And...uh...I did say hello to them.</span> <span id="s141">We did talk a little bit.</span> <span id="s142">I Yiddish and they're German.</span> <span id="s143">There's nothing wrong with it.</span> <span id="s144">And they left.</span> <span id="s145">Uh...A day later the Russians arrived.</span> <span id="s146">What it was in the beginning, that the Germans simply did go too far and later did...did come to agreement about the...the demarcation line, and they moved out.</span> <span id="s147">And the Russians arrived.</span> <span id="s148">In that time the local communists organized their own militia and they were in power for about two weeks and later again, it's a mistake.</span> <span id="s149">The Russians are leaving again.</span> <span id="s150">The Germans are coming.</span> <span id="s151">So again what should we do?</span> <span id="s152">My mother told my father, "Listen, Let go out.</span> <span id="s153">I know Russian.</span> <span id="s154">I know the language.</span> <span id="s155">Let go out from here."</span> <span id="s156">And my father said, "No."</span> <span id="s157">Actually he bought a horse and carriage already.</span> <span id="s158">And later he said, "No, I was born here.</span> <span id="s159">I could die here."</span></p> <p><span id="s160">01:12:49 And my father for some reason, which saved me later in my life I could say, he was in a way a Polish patriot.</span> <span id="s161">He was a volunteer in the Polish legionnaires, so called Pi_sudski's army...uh...uh...in the First World War.</span> <span id="s162">He was wounded.</span> <span id="s163">He was a invalid.</span> <span id="s164">And...uh...which was, you know, a very horrible in that time.</span> <span id="s165">So he...and he said, no, he will stay here.</span> <span id="s166">He was born here and he...he could die here.</span> <span id="s167">And he stayed.</span> <span id="s168">And this was...and this sealed our future, our destiny.</span> <span id="s169">So I've seen the Russians going, and a lot of Jews did, runned after them close by the...the regular army soldiers, everybody going east.</span> <span id="s170">And I was a child 12 years old, but I felt that something historical happened, that something...I felt something is wrong.</span> <span id="s171">We should go.</span> <span id="s172">But we didn't.</span> <span id="s173">The Russians left and Izbica was a no-man's land.</span> <span id="s174">No Russians.</span> <span id="s175">No Germans.</span> <span id="s176">The Germans did come.</span> <span id="s177">But they stopped about 12...12 kilometers before Izbica in a district town of Krasnystaw.</span> <span id="s178">Izbica was nobody.</span> <span id="s179">So two...the third night, sitting in my room I hear a big explosion.</span> <span id="s180">And suddenly screaming, yelling, "What's happened?"</span> <span id="s181">A group of Jews stood on the street outside talking, and some Poles throw a grenade at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">And they killed a few and they wounded a few.</span> <span id="s183">So we start to be terrorized by the Poles.</span> <span id="s184">So people were scared to go outside the town and there's another legation did form, a Jewish delegation, under the leadership of Miss Roetenstein.</span> <span id="s185">Still I remember her name.</span> <span id="s186">By the way, this is the same, this is my Mimi (chuckle) which she told me I shouldn't eat...I shouldn't eat unkosher.</span> <span id="s187">Under...under her leadership, they went to Krasnystaw.</span> <span id="s188">Actually, to invite Germans to come to Izbica because it...it is no law in Izbica and we are afraid and that they must come in.</span> <span id="s189">So Germans did come into Izbica to protect the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">01:15:18 No, you must understand that there were no Gestapo in the first days.</span> <span id="s191">There were simple Wehrmacht soldiers.</span> <span id="s192">And there was also called an Ortskommandantur Wehrmacht, a local command...command of the soldiers arrived and they patrolled the streets so they were pretty quiet.</span> <span id="s193">As matter of fact, the Jews used to do business... uh...with the soldiers.</span> <span id="s194">I remember a..</span> <span id="s195">.</span> <span id="s196">kids did go out and buy from them cigarettes and sold...uh...different stuff.</span> <span id="s197">It...it was rather peaceful with them, until Gestapo arrived.</span> <span id="s198">There were two of them.</span> <span id="s199">Ludwig Klein and Karl Engels.</span> <span id="s200">Both survived the war, and I was a witness against both of them at Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">They both committed suicide in...in Hamburg after the war, being in jail.</span> <span id="s202">Well, anyway, these two SS were a terror in Izbica.</span> <span id="s203">Every day, before breakfast, they went out, killed five, ten Jews; and later they ordered breakfast.</span> <span id="s204">It was unbelieve...unbelievable and we realized, finally, that we have no rights.</span> <span id="s205">And many times we wished that if the first Germans which arrived, if they would kill a 100 Jews, if they would terrorize the town, it would be a blessing because everybody would escape with the Russians.</span> <span id="s206">You understand?</span> <span id="s207">In the beginning!</span></p> <p><span id="s208">But, unfortunately, for us the first Germans were good Germans, so- called.</span> <span id="s209">So...now it was too late, and we were in a trap.</span> <span id="s210">In that time, again, compared to the future, it wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s211">There were still families.</span> <span id="s212">Some people were killed because of Engels, but otherwise it was possible to live.</span> <span id="s213">There were...uh...there were labor camps and Jews were forced to go to work in labor camps.</span> <span id="s214">In the beginning, they were forced to work on the streets from 8 o'clock in the morning til 7 o'clock in the evening, and they were released home.</span> <span id="s215">Later, as I said, there were labor camps where they went out for a month or for a week.</span> <span id="s216">They worked.</span> <span id="s217">Later they...they were exchanged.</span> <span id="s218">New Jews did come and they were let home.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">01:18:06 Uh... Now on that point, I must tell you that the Germans in that time established Jewish Councils, so-called "Judenrat."</span> <span id="s220">And through the Judenrat, they were able to execute their orders, so the Judenrat sent people to work in the labor camps and the Judenrat also after a month or so sent new people.</span> <span id="s221">The old ones...the first ones should be released.</span> <span id="s222">So it wasn't a order.</span> <span id="s223">Now, everybody, according...according the rules, everybody was supposed to go for one month to the labor.</span> <span id="s224">But again, if there was a rich fellow in the list he was able to pay the poor...to pay the poor fellow, and he did voluntary go.</span> <span id="s225">But as the time progressed, it was worse and worse.</span> <span id="s226">We heard about beating.</span> <span id="s227">We heard about torture, and people refused to go.</span> <span id="s228">In that time the first so-called "Aktions" happened.</span> <span id="s229">"Aktion" is a roundup.</span> <span id="s230">It started with roundups to the labor camps.</span> <span id="s231">They would come in the morning and told the Jewish Council to deliver 500 men or 200 men.</span> <span id="s232">If the Jewish Council wasn't able to deliver through their own police, they started indiscrimate to go from house to house, beat, shot... Ukrainians, which worked with the Nazis together.</span> <span id="s233">And they...they caught...they simple caught people on the streets 'til they get the amount of 500 people and they took them away.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">01:19:48</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: What were you and your parents doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: I was a goy in the picture and later got to the .</span> <span id="s237">So in that time, I was already in danger.</span> <span id="s238">I was, of course, 12, 13 years old, 13.</span> <span id="s239">So my father looked for protection.</span> <span id="s240">What about my family in that time?</span> <span id="s241">My mother, of course, was a housewife.</span> <span id="s242">My father lost his business, He had from before, as a legionnaire, he had a liquor store business, so-called "monopol koncesja" in Poland, uh...as a veteran from the legionnaires.</span> <span id="s243">Lost my [NB: his] business, but still he was able to make a living.</span> <span id="s244">He was very well known.</span> <span id="s245">He has done some business with the Polish farmer, even if it was illegal; but he did look to protect me.</span> <span id="s246">So he made a deal with a Pole of German origin, Mr. [Platow (ph)].</span> <span id="s247">Mr. [Platow (ph)] had a blacksmith shop.</span> <span id="s248">He made with him a deal that I will work for him.</span> <span id="s249">So I should be employed in case the Germans are looking unemployed, because in the beginning they took so-called unemployed Jews.</span> <span id="s250">I went to work about 8 o'clock in the morning til 5:00.</span> <span id="s251">It was hard work because in that time we had a lathe, I remember; and the lathe, it's not like now--you put in an electric motor, and the lathe is running.</span> <span id="s252">I did need to move everything by myself, and many times I thought I..</span> <span id="s253">.</span> <span id="s254">I will collapse but then my boss said, "You turn.</span> <span id="s255">Just turn."</span> <span id="s256">And I thought I..</span> <span id="s257">.</span> <span id="s258">I must turn because this is my protection.</span> <span id="s259">I must turn the wheel even if I wasn't able to breath anymore.</span> <span id="s260">But I managed.</span> <span id="s261">(Pause) When the Gestapo arrived, they went...they had two motorcycles and a car and they...and they need a repair shop.</span> <span id="s262">So they went to another mechanic, blacksmith.</span> <span id="s263">His name was [Solecky (ph)].</span> <span id="s264">And the motorcycles were over there, always, for the night to be cleaned or the car was over there...the Gestapo car.</span> <span id="s265">And once in the evening I was going by, the boss, Mr. [Solecky (ph)] from this...uh...repair shop told me, "Tom, would you like to help me?</span> <span id="s266">I have a lot of work; stay overnight and put together a motorcycle."</span> <span id="s267">So I said, "Okay, I will just tell my dad."</span> <span id="s268">Told my dad that I will be a whole night working in Mr. [Solecky's (ph)]...I will call it from now on "garage," because Americans are familiar with what a..</span> <span id="s269">.</span> <span id="s270">what a garage is.</span> <span id="s271">And while I was working next day, he said...[Solecky (ph)]..."Listen, why don't you work with me.</span> <span id="s272">Leave Mr. [Platow (ph)].</span> <span id="s273">Come to me."</span></p> <p><span id="s274">01:22:55 And I thought it was a good idea.</span> <span id="s275">First of all, I will be protected by Gestapo, clean the motorcycles, and I agreed.</span> <span id="s276">And from that time on, I started to work...uh...for Mr. [Solecky (ph)] and it was dangerous because the motorcycles of the Gestapo need to be cleaned, you know, spotless.</span> <span id="s277">And I worked very hard and I done a good job.</span> <span id="s278">And as I see it now, it was a good choice because later when the death camps did come, I was protected practically... practically the last minute, and I was able to see how town is sinking down, myself being protected.</span> <span id="s279">I didn't need to hide like another people that hide in that time.</span> <span id="s280">I've seen it.</span> <span id="s281">Okay.</span> <span id="s282">Going back to the labor camps.</span> <span id="s283">Suddenly, transports arrived from...uh...Pozna_...from west...from the western part of Poland...Pozna_, Ko_o, Konin, and lot of Jews arrived; we divided...the Judenrat divided the people to different houses and that time I did get very close with...uh...[Jussik Bresler (ph)], who was...uh...a dentist's son from Ko_o.</span> <span id="s284">In our place used to live a man, his name was Kohn, with his wife.</span> <span id="s285">Once I remember...it was the evening...I still remember my mother standing close...close to the window with Mr. Kohn and his wife, and discussing a letter.</span> <span id="s286">And I listen: "gassing people, gassing...." And my mother I remember saying, "It's impossible.</span> <span id="s287">It's a fantasy.</span> <span id="s288">Can't be."</span> <span id="s289">So a lot of time parents don't even realize how much children could listen in, pretending doing something else.</span> <span id="s290">And I did.</span> <span id="s291">What I understood, and later I find out more is Miss [Mrs.] Kohn, received a letter from her son in Ko_o, which was still in Ko_o, that in a place called Chelmno, they're gassing people.</span> <span id="s292">He wrote about this.</span> <span id="s293">But, as I said, it was dismissed.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">01:25:24 By the way, her son who wrote the letter survived and he lives in [Holland (ph)], in Israel.</span> <span id="s295">And I later talked to him when I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s296">And I was in the South, reminding him about this letter he wrote.</span> <span id="s297">Anyway, so this was a bad signal, but later quiet down.</span> <span id="s298">At least I didn't hear...at least I didn't hear anything.</span> <span id="s299">But once was some "Akcja."</span> <span id="s300">The SS arrived in the morning, did...uh...asked the Judenrat to deliver 2,000 people to the marketplace.</span> <span id="s301">And the Judenrat did go home to home and delivered, but a lot of people already were afraid about the torture, about the beating, and hide.</span> <span id="s302">So the Nazis themselves start to look for them and collected them in the marketplace.</span> <span id="s303">After such a "Aktion," after the...uh...the desired amount of Jews were concentrated in the marketplace, everybody else could go out and uh...town was like normal.</span> <span id="s304">The people were over there, then later they were taken to the station, there were already wagons for them loaded and taken away.</span> <span id="s305">Like they took them away before to labor camps close to Zamo ...was a labor...labor camp, [Mokre Zdanow (ph)].</span> <span id="s306">They left.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">But usual, in a case like this, they took away some family...family members, and the family which was left usual...usually sent some Poles, Christian Pole, a friend, to go after the train to see the destination.</span> <span id="s308">And so after this transport left, some people...Polish people went after them with a bike or with...uh...either way, with another train tracing this train.</span> <span id="s309">The same night...uh...I..</span> <span id="s310">.</span> <span id="s311">a day later, I remember I was at home and I heard some knocking in the window.</span> <span id="s312">It was already after the curfew...curfew time.</span> <span id="s313">But nevertheless, many times I did sneak out after curfew time.</span> <span id="s314">But I hear some knocking, and as I go to the window and...uh...there was a knock like I had...uh when I went to my friend [Jussik (ph)], I knock the same way...three times long and three times short it was.</span> <span id="s315">I recognize as my friend [Jussik (ph)] from...from Ko_o.</span> <span id="s316">So I opened the door, go out, sneak out, you know, because Jews are not allowed outside, and hidden behind this house I say...I noticed [Jussik (ph)] standing by.</span> <span id="s317">I said, "[Jussik (ph)], What's the urgency?</span> <span id="s318">What is so..." "Tom, I must tell you something.</span> <span id="s319">Tom, you remember [Ruza (ph)]?"</span> <span id="s320">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s321">"She was taken before yesterday."</span> <span id="s322">"Yes."</span> <span id="s323">"She's dead."</span> <span id="s324">I mean, "What do you mean, she's dead?"</span> <span id="s325">"I mean...you remember the transport which left with the trains...the last transport of 2,000 Jew?</span> <span id="s326">All of them are dead."</span> <span id="s327">"What do you mean, all of them are dead?"</span> <span id="s328">"Tom, you don't know?"</span> <span id="s329">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s330">He said, "There's a place call Belzec, and I have a friend who just come back and he told me that all the Jews, not only from Izbica, every day, thousands of them are coming in to this camp Belzec, and this camp should be overflowing but nobody comes out.</span> <span id="s331">Only people are going in.</span> <span id="s332">And night time is a big fire, and they're killing people there.</span> <span id="s333">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s334">They say by elect...electrocuting them."</span> <span id="s335">Because in the beginning, they didn't know the method.</span> <span id="s336">"But they're killed."</span> <span id="s337">I said, "[Jussik (ph)], you are dreaming."</span> <span id="s338">"That's what I want to tell you."</span> <span id="s339">He left.</span> <span id="s340">I didn't tell this my parents because I didn't want to scare them.</span> <span id="s341">But the next time the whole town did know, that there's a death camp, Belzec, 35 miles from Izbica, and they're killing people over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">01:29:52 So everybody start to build hiding places.</span> <span id="s343">Before the...we had hiding places before too, but they were primitive, only to...to hide themself in case they.</span> <span id="s344">.</span> <span id="s345">they want to take them to labor camp.</span> <span id="s346">But now the stake was life, and they...they start to build very elaborate hiding places.</span> <span id="s347">In that time the Mayor of the city...in that time was a German Mayor of the city, a Polish German, "Volks..."--so-called "Volksdeutsch."</span> <span id="s348">He decided to move to better location.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Before the war, he did live in some kind dingy, a little rundown house, but now he want a better house, so he moved exactly in the same house where we....we did live.</span> <span id="s350">It was like...you would call it in...in America, apartment house like on the .</span> <span id="s351">In Poland, it was really a little house where few families lived together.</span> <span id="s352">So he did become our...our neighbor.</span> <span id="s353">In this particular house, which was a long building...we...we had about eight families, but by him moving in, we did join the same attic.</span> <span id="s354">The attic over this house, part was on his...on top of his apartment and part of our apartment, so what we have done...we ask a mason to take a part of this attic, build a double wall.</span> <span id="s355">We made a hiding place over there.</span> <span id="s356">The entrance was from...was from our room upstairs.</span> <span id="s357">They build a little opening, a little door, maybe three feet by two.</span> <span id="s358">We squeezed in, went into the attic, and we were actually on...on Mr. Schultz, which was the mayor, on his.</span> <span id="s359">.</span> <span id="s360">on his property; so when we put against the wall our little cabinet, it did cover the entrance and we were safe, and this was our hiding place.</span> <span id="s361">The drawback was that we did need a guy from outside to...but this I have done because when was...I was already protected.</span> <span id="s362">I told you which way.</span> <span id="s363">So I have done run back to the...uh...the garage.</span> <span id="s364">Anyway, now the second Akcja did come, and the third.</span> <span id="s365">Izbica was empty.</span> <span id="s366">Soon transport from Nuremberg, from Czechoslovakia, from Slovakia....</span> <span id="s367">Why I say Czechoslovakia separate and Slovakia separate?</span> <span id="s368">Because the Czech Jews, they're completely different...uh...than the Slovakian Jews.</span> <span id="s369">The Slovakian Jews looked more like the Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s370">Same type of people; and... uh...(pause) from Berlin...some people.</span> <span id="s371">In...from, practically, from a low population, Izbica did grow to about 15, 20 thousand; so it was even people...even the street was ...were too many people to move around.</span> <span id="s372">So again a Akcja and again did go down to 10,000...</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: What is your point?</span> <span id="s374">What....</span> <span id="s375">Describe you... 01:33:31</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: I will go to it.</span> <span id="s377">I will go; I can't describe every akcja...I will describe one big one...one where they took me to Sobibór.</span> <span id="s378">I will tell you about one Akcja.</span> <span id="s379">If I will describe, if I will try to describe everything, it will be miserable, terrible, and would take me a long, long time and probably you would be exhausted and I would be exhausted.</span> <span id="s380">I will tell you about the typical Akcja.</span> <span id="s381">It always started about, about 4 o'clock in the morning with a shot in the air.</span> <span id="s382">They had some shotting [shooting] and the whole town was surrounded.</span> <span id="s383">As I said, Izbica was in a valley.</span> <span id="s384">It was like a..</span> <span id="s385">.</span> <span id="s386">a trap.</span> <span id="s387">You didn't need too many soldiers on top of the mountains so anybody should be visible...the whole town should be visible.</span> <span id="s388">Nobody was able to go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">And another group of Ukrainians...Ukrainians that cooperated with the Germans, went in the town and they dragged people out.</span> <span id="s390">First, as normally before, the Judenrat call out to the Jews to go out to the streets and called, "Jews, Come out.</span> <span id="s391">You're going to labor."</span> <span id="s392">Uh...sometimes, even they lured them..."Everybody will get a half a bread...a half a bread on the...on the way."</span> <span id="s393">And so on.</span> <span id="s394">"Come out.</span> <span id="s395">Nothing will happen."</span> <span id="s396">That's what the German told him to say.</span> <span id="s397">And when then this didn't help because we did know the truth, the Germans and the Ukrainians dragged down the houses.</span> <span id="s398">When I heard the first shot...not...not only me...all over...all in the house heard the shouting, we immediately concentrated in our apartment.</span> <span id="s399">In that time we had a connection to the whole house.</span> <span id="s400">If there was no door to the next apartment, we made a door or opening so everybody was able to pass, to come to our ...and we went to the first floor into the attic and I put this against the wall and did run back to the garage.</span> <span id="s401">Oh, my boss, he was, of course, a Volksdeutsche; he was so happy because now he could make some money.</span> <span id="s402">He put on the red arm band with the "Hakenkreuz," with the swastika, took his rifle and went out with Germans to look for Jews.</span> <span id="s403">The Aktion was a whole day.</span> <span id="s404">When they had a group of about... about thousand people in the marketplace, they used to... uh...take them to the train station, which was about a mile away through the whole city, the main road.</span> <span id="s405">The main road was lined up on both ways by Poles, looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">01:36:16 At least, I talk about mine town.</span> <span id="s407">And I was standing between them.</span> <span id="s408">I was...I wasn't afraid because the Mayor of the city had a car.</span> <span id="s409">I was cleaning for him.</span> <span id="s410">The Gestapo wouldn't take me because I was cleaning their motorcycles, and the policeman did know him because they did come to salute him.</span> <span id="s411">Everybody did know I worked for [Solecky(ph)] ...for this Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s412">And even if they were...by chance somebody would take...take me, they would take me out from the circle.</span> <span id="s413">I was...I was sure about this.</span> <span id="s414">So I was just standing with the Poles looking.</span> <span id="s415">And once I've seen...I've seen many times cases like that, but this particular day was a kid, maybe...maybe seven years old which did run out, because not too many Ukrainians did guard this column of people.</span> <span id="s416">But maybe every...every hundred feet maybe a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s417">It was easy to run out.</span> <span id="s418">But the problem was a different problem.</span> <span id="s419">This boy run out.</span> <span id="s420">Three minutes later, he was taken back by Poles, and pushed him back in the column.</span> <span id="s421">The point is this, that in mine dreams I don't dream about the German peo..., about the Germans.</span> <span id="s422">I'm not afraid of about the Germans.</span> <span id="s423">The Germans didn't know who I was.</span> <span id="s424">I was afraid about my neighbors, the Poles.</span> <span id="s425">They were living...you see, the Germans...they didn't know Jews.</span> <span id="s426">Their vision of Jews was from the...Rosenberg's...Rosenberg?</span> <span id="s427">From his...from the propaganda.</span> <span id="s428">A Jew must have a long nose, and so on and so.</span> <span id="s429">But the Poles are my neighbors.</span> <span id="s430">They did live with Jews for hundreds of years, and I was afraid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Anyway, I was sitting back and observing.</span> <span id="s432">Nothing I could do.</span> <span id="s433">Transport finally...all the people were moved to the train station and they were...they weren't still enough people.</span> <span id="s434">Two trains already left for Belzec so the Aktion was, they take another night.</span> <span id="s435">And that time I told [Solecky (ph)] that I want to hide my brother.</span> <span id="s436">I want to take him away to a safer place.</span> <span id="s437">Mine brother was together with father in this attic, but I..</span> <span id="s438">.</span> <span id="s439">I was afraid about...uh...this place.</span> <span id="s440">So I took my brother out.</span> <span id="s441">I went over there.</span> <span id="s442">Took my brother out, and I took him with me to the garage.</span> <span id="s443">A whole night was going on screaming.</span> <span id="s444">I remember I..</span> <span id="s445">.</span> <span id="s446">this...this [Solecky (ph)], my boss, locked me in the garage, and in the garage was a Fiat, uh, the...the mayor's car, and I slept in this car.</span> <span id="s447">And that's a terrible sight.</span> <span id="s448">Outside was the screaming, shouting, "Shma Israel" and so on.</span> <span id="s449">I turned on the radio, and the radio...I still remember...the song.</span> <span id="s450">The radio....there was a station from Vienna and I remember the "Lily Marlene" song.</span> <span id="s451">And this was singing, and the screaming...it was a..</span> <span id="s452">.</span> <span id="s453">a terrible...I just turned on the radio to...to...should take over, but was impossible and I'm sleeping with my brother.</span> <span id="s454">My brother in the back seat, and I in the front and my boss had a..</span> <span id="s455">.</span> <span id="s456">a sense of humor, and every so often he did come and knock on the door.</span> <span id="s457">He did know I'm over there because he allowed me in the garage but he knocked, "Jews, Raus!</span> <span id="s458">Jews, Raus!"</span> <span id="s459">Just to scare me.</span> <span id="s460">Just for the fun, you know.</span> <span id="s461">And later, of course, he said, "Don't be afraid.</span> <span id="s462">Stay over there."</span> <span id="s463">And he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">01:39:47 Early in the morning, he opened the garage and I told mine brother to go in the...to hide between the junks and that in the corner.</span> <span id="s465">It was a little partition.</span> <span id="s466">And Ukrainians did come in, cleaning their rifles and cleaning their pistols, and here one of the Volksdeutsches, of the German collaborators, did come in...a guy who I know very well, and I cleaned his motorcycles always.</span> <span id="s467">And so I told him, Mr. Krauser, I did...did want to know my family's 2 Alfred Rosenberg was a leading ideologue of Nazi racist theories and served as the Reich Minister for the Occupied Territories in the East.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">still intact...I told Mr. Krauser, "Would you like to go with me to my home to see if everything is okay?</span> <span id="s469">They did...they didn't rob us or whatever?"</span> <span id="s470">So he said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s471">Come."</span> <span id="s472">And so I went with him and come into our home and, of course, the door is smashed open and in there was Ukrainians trying on socks, changed their socks...I remember still.</span> <span id="s473">He did find a pair of socks he was changing.</span> <span id="s474">In another room was another Ukrainian looking in there and the...Krauser, said to them "Raus!"</span> <span id="s475">He had a nice Hakenkreuz, you know, on his.</span> <span id="s476">.</span> <span id="s477">uh...shirt, the swastika, and he told them to get out.</span> <span id="s478">He was our authority, so they left.</span> <span id="s479">So while Krauser was down...uh.</span> <span id="s480">.</span> <span id="s481">I did try to sneak in upstairs to see the hiding place is still intact.</span> <span id="s482">He noticed it.</span> <span id="s483">So he said...so he said, "Tom, do you want to go upstairs?"</span> <span id="s484">So I said, "Aw, forget it.</span> <span id="s485">No.</span> <span id="s486">Let go back."</span> <span id="s487">I didn't want to take the chance.</span> <span id="s488">But he felt something and he said, "No, let go upstairs."</span> <span id="s489">I said, "No, Mr. Krauser, no let not."</span> <span id="s490">"Let go."</span> <span id="s491">He went up and I went after him.</span> <span id="s492">He looks around and he said, "So, Tom."</span> <span id="s493">I said, "Okay, everything is okay, let's go back."</span> <span id="s494">But he felt something.</span> <span id="s495">He wasn't so stupid.</span> <span id="s496">He looked around, knocked on the floor, knocked on the wall.</span> <span id="s497">And later he goes to this little cabinet and wanted to move it.</span> <span id="s498">And I grabbed him by the hand, "Mr. Krauser, please leave it."</span> <span id="s499">"No, Tom.</span> <span id="s500">What is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Don't be afraid."</span> <span id="s502">"This is a hiding place.</span> <span id="s503">My parents're over there.</span> <span id="s504">Don't go in because you will scare them."</span> <span id="s505">He said, "Don't be afraid."</span> <span id="s506">He moved away.</span> <span id="s507">And he found about hundred...over a hundred Jews over there.</span> <span id="s508">He goes in, comes out, moved back this cabinet and told me, "Tom...." They called me, that time they didn't call me Tom.</span> <span id="s509">"Toivi, don't be afraid."</span> <span id="s510">And he didn't betray it.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">01:42:33 Later, when the Aktion was over, the...and I did come to remove this cabinet and told them everything is over, and everybody went out, they made a collection of money to give him.</span> <span id="s512">But it was after...after that.</span> <span id="s513">So this was the Aktion.</span> <span id="s514">Later were another Aktions, basically similar.</span> <span id="s515">I remember my aunt from Krasnystaw was running wild on the street, breaking ...breaking his finger.</span> <span id="s516">She had one little boy, also called Toivi.</span> <span id="s517">And they took him away.</span> <span id="s518">He was hiding...he was...I don't how come, but they took him, they left her.</span> <span id="s519">And she was running wild on the street, breaking her fingers.</span> <span id="s520">"My Toivi, they took him away..." This I remember.</span> <span id="s521">And this was a typical Aktion.</span> <span id="s522">When Aktion, when they left there were windows broken in the Jewish houses, people did look for gold, and there was a lot of down on the street from the cut...they cut bedding to look for money and everything else...was like a ruin everything.</span> <span id="s523">And I just...I just went house to house to notice that my friends [Srulek (ph)] is taken, this guy is taken, mine...mine friend, a girl was taken, and nothing you could do.</span> <span id="s524">After each Aktion, we were promised this is the last time.</span> <span id="s525">Only unproductive Jews were taken.</span> <span id="s526">You see... hope.</span> <span id="s527">Hope could kill, and hope could save.</span> <span id="s528">If I wouldn't have hope, I would kill myself.</span> <span id="s529">So I..</span> <span id="s530">.</span> <span id="s531">but a lot of people, because they hoped, they didn't fight and they did go to death practically without...without resistance.</span> <span id="s532">Anyway, (sigh) that's another Aktion, another one.</span> <span id="s533">Later, we hear about Sobibór.</span> <span id="s534">Another death camp, built this time north, on the north side of Izbica.</span> <span id="s535">And again a Aktion.</span> <span id="s536">I mustn't talk yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">01:44:53 There is something which I could dwell on.</span> <span id="s538">In Izbica there were lot of Czechoslovak...Czech Jews, from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s539">They considered themselves, probably with German inspiration, that they are better than the Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s540">So they made their own Judenrat....</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Czechoslovakian Judenrat.</span> <span id="s542">And the next Aktion, the Czechoslovakian Jews did chase the Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s543">And there was special Czechoslovakian militia...Jewish...Jewish militia, which chased....that time being a Czech Jew or a German Jew was a permit to live.</span> <span id="s544">That was a Akcja.</span> <span id="s545">When this was over, the Polish Jews would get together...not the Jews, the Judenrat Polish.</span> <span id="s546">How do I know it?</span> <span id="s547">I know it because my uncle was in Judenrat.</span> <span id="s548">He did come to my home and talk with my father and I always had a..</span> <span id="s549">.</span> <span id="s550">and it was public knowledge too.</span> <span id="s551">The next...and so what's happened the Polish Jews did get...get together money and the Judenrat did bribe the Landrat, because Mr. Landrat is district officials--the German, you know.</span> <span id="s552">And when it was next roundup, before closing the wagons, the Landrat, the district official, told all the Czech Judenrat and the Czech militia to go on the wagons, and [they] take them away.</span> <span id="s553">And this was the revenge from the Polish.</span> <span id="s554">I just tell you...uh...uh...uh...you could take it out.</span> <span id="s555">But I just tell you the...the interaction, what it was.</span> <span id="s556">(sigh) So they played one against the other.</span> <span id="s557">(Pause) In 1942, so I was working in this garage for a long time, watching, seeing everything.</span> <span id="s558">Unfortunately, what...not being able to do anything.</span> <span id="s559">Once I think I helped, in a way, because there was a Aktion and like usual, in a Aktion...after the Aktion the Ukrainians, the SS, did come to Solecky's garage to clean the...the guns.</span> <span id="s560">So I overheard...uh...one Ukrainian, he said to Solecky, "Listen, prepare for me something...some kind of, I think it was a tire," because Wednesday, we coming back.</span> <span id="s561">So I was sure that Wednesday would be again so I put out the word that Wednesday will be again...again a Aktion; which was true.</span> <span id="s562">It was a Aktion next Wednesday.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">01:47:50 Uh...up til now, my family was still intact.</span> <span id="s564">This hiding place was perfect.</span> <span id="s565">He didn't betray, Krauser.</span> <span id="s566">(Pause) Uh...me, as a boy, in the evening...uh.</span> <span id="s567">.</span> <span id="s568">I used to go out after curfew to my friends and we had girlfriends from Czechoslovakia and we did get together in a hallway and we talk and...I, like any boys my age, 15 years, I did want to have my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s569">I was very shy, extremely shy, so finally, I..</span> <span id="s570">.</span> <span id="s571">I met mine counterpart, a shy Czechoslovakian girl.</span> <span id="s572">And we were just standing...nothing, just standing pretending to be grownup and later, I remember after Aktion I went to her and...uh...I went to the hallway, a dark hallway which always, there...when I did come to her place and she did come out from her room and is talking to me in the hallway, her mother...and every few minutes opened the door, looking what we are doing.</span> <span id="s573">And I come to the hallway's empty, the window's broken, and she's gone.</span> <span id="s574">They took her away, so I thought about her mother being so protective of her, and now is gone.</span> <span id="s575">And...uh...so slowly all my friends....kids are gone.</span> <span id="s576">And now comes the time when we know that we can't escape destiny and my father calls me and he said, "Tom, Toivi, you must leave."</span> <span id="s577">Says I, "What do you mean, 'leave'?"</span> <span id="s578">"Toivi, you see what's happened.</span> <span id="s579">The next Akcja will be Judenrein.</span> <span id="s580">That means no Jews could be.</span> <span id="s581">And this hiding place will not help anymore.</span> <span id="s582">So you have prepared Christian papers, so-called Aryan papers, and you will escape to Hungary.</span> <span id="s583">Your brother will be hidden here.</span> <span id="s584">I arranged everything by a Pole.</span> <span id="s585">Your mother has also false papers and she will go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s586">And I will hide someplace here.</span> <span id="s587">But you will go...you will...you must leave tonight."</span> <span id="s588">I don't want to go into any particulars about...the...false papers, but about 2 o'clock in the night time, I received my papers.</span> <span id="s589">I was...my name was Waldemar Ptaszek, and my mother's name was [Leukadia Stankewicz (ph)] and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">01:50:44 It wasn't much time to learn the new names because a half hour later, we suppose to go to the train station.</span> <span id="s591">Now, my mother was still...soon...soon came to my parents...I remember, a..</span> <span id="s592">.</span> <span id="s593">some gold coins.</span> <span id="s594">And I had about 100 mark in my pockets and a few Polish zlotys.</span> <span id="s595">And we eat sardines...I remember me and my mother and little brother and was another boy, [Velvole (ph)], from another family.</span> <span id="s596">He's supposed to go with me.</span> <span id="s597">We eat, and later I kissed uh my mother, my father, my brother; said goodbye, and...uh...I should go...in that time, it was agreed that I go to my neighbor, Schneider, wherever everybody who want to escape is concentrating.</span> <span id="s598">What it was was a group of about 12 people, Jews, with false papers and a Polish Christian guide supposed to lead them until the Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s599">Close to the Hungarian border, another fellow, Christian fellow, should take him over and try to sneak him into Hungary.</span> <span id="s600">Now...now we say, all going to Hungary...you know, .</span> <span id="s601">To understand the desperation of the time, you must understand this.</span> <span id="s602">To go out from the ghetto...first of all, to go out in curfew time, death sentence.</span> <span id="s603">To go out from the ghetto, death sentence.</span> <span id="s604">To be in a train, a death sentence.</span> <span id="s605">And you come to...to the (chuckle) to the border you can't go through.</span> <span id="s606">You must sneak through.</span> <span id="s607">On top of it, there were rumors that the Polish guides, they take you to the border and later they rob you.</span> <span id="s608">They make you first write a letter that you crossed nicely, to lure everyone, and later they rob you and they kill you.</span> <span id="s609">Now you understand this desperation that still my parents agreed to let me go.</span> <span id="s610">So I went out from this...from my parent's house to go to the Schneiders'.</span> <span id="s611">Half way...I still can't understand why, but half way to Schneider's house, I turn around and go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">01:53:08</span></p> <p><span id="s613">I..</span> <span id="s614">.</span> <span id="s615">I don't know...I think I was so much attached to my little brother...I think I did want to see my brother again.</span> <span id="s616">Went back and my father was angry.</span> <span id="s617">I think he was superstitious, and he said, "You shouldn't come back.</span> <span id="s618">It's not a good sign."</span> <span id="s619">It's some kind of superstitious.</span> <span id="s620">If you...if you go back, it's not good.</span> <span id="s621">Anyway.</span> <span id="s622">So I felt bad that my father was angry.</span> <span id="s623">I turned around and went back to Schneider's house, and there about four girls and was some men called Rappoport from Zamo dressed as Polish peasant.</span> <span id="s624">Time comes close, and we are sneaking out slowly to the train station, watching that no German patrol should see us.</span> <span id="s625">By the way, the Germans they...they walk so loud that we could hear them a half a mile away, but still it was dangerous; so we sneaked into the train station but we are not...we can't go into the train station because there are lamp post and it's a little town.</span> <span id="s626">They would immediately recognize us.</span> <span id="s627">So we're waiting in a ditch till the train comes.</span> <span id="s628">The train arrives and before moving out, we did jump in in the last wagon.</span> <span id="s629">And this way we were on...on our way to the Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s630">By the way, tickets were bought by our guide beforehand; he did give us the ticket for riding the train.</span> <span id="s631">On the way, I encountered...already in the beginning, but the first 20 miles past Izbica a problem which I don't feel is so important to dwell on it, so I will skip it.</span> <span id="s632">But finally, after about an hour's drive...uh...on the road, I see people closing the windows, starting to lit cigarettes.</span> <span id="s633">I hear some talking to themselves quietly.</span> <span id="s634">I see something change in the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s635">And suddenly, there's a train station and the train slowed down and the left side...as if would have been a big fire, and I could feel the smell.</span> <span id="s636">It was all over.</span> <span id="s637">And I understand, they're talking...they was talking...there's been Jews, "Spalenie _ydow" [Translation: "Burning Jews"] and so on, in Polish.</span> <span id="s638">And I look and there's Belzec...passing by Belzec .</span> <span id="s639">Not knowing that a year later, we'll be in a place like this.</span> <span id="s640">And I..</span> <span id="s641">.</span> <span id="s642">I was starting to shake.</span> <span id="s643">We passed Belzec.</span> <span id="s644">The train did not stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">01:55:58 In the middle of the way, close to Lwów [L'vov], something happened.</span> <span id="s646">All eight Jews, they're sitting in the same train...in the same wagon, and there was one fellow, Rabinowicz, who was always moving between us.</span> <span id="s647">Next to us were sitting, next to me, [Velvole (ph)], Polish farmers were sitting.</span> <span id="s648">And I heard one woman talking to another one that this one which is roaming, which is going around must be Jewish.</span> <span id="s649">And I was already scared, but so happens, this Rabinowicz comes to me and tells me, "Tom, [Guyosh (ph)]," which is our guide, "he wants more money.</span> <span id="s650">Otherwise, he's leaving us."</span> <span id="s651">So I told him, "Listen, Rabinowicz, you must run.</span> <span id="s652">Now we have really problems because next door is the woman who is suspecting you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s653">Now you did come to me, and there's problems."</span> <span id="s654">So he immediately told that...told another one, and in the next station, it was night time, we all left the train and we managed to go, mingled with lot of people go to the front, and we went on the same train except on another wagon.</span> <span id="s655">And we managed to come to close to Lwów.</span> <span id="s656">Now it was agreed before we left Izbica not to travel through the main station in Lwów, because there are rumors that the Gestapo is searching terrible this place.</span> <span id="s657">And they're checking everybody.</span> <span id="s658">The best place to go out a station before Lwów, go through Lwów by foot, and later the next station, pass Lwów, and go on again to the train.</span> <span id="s659">And the guide will be waiting already this station past Lwów.</span> <span id="s660">So we go out and the...place called Kleparów [NB: Polish spelling].</span> <span id="s661">And I remember they were building some roads, so we need to go single file; and over there had a problem with a Ukrainian guard who stopped me but he asked me if I am Jewish and I said no.</span> <span id="s662">Why did he...he didn't actual stop me.</span> <span id="s663">We were single file in a..</span> <span id="s664">.</span> <span id="s665">in front of us a Ukrainian militia man was riding a bicycle.</span> <span id="s666">And while he was passing our line and he stopped.</span> <span id="s667">And he was yelling, "Eh, you, come raus!"</span> <span id="s668">I wasn't sure if he yelled at me or he yelled somebody else.</span> <span id="s669">But...but nobody did go out from this...from the people moving, so I turned around and went to him.</span> <span id="s670">So he asked me...looked at me and asked me, "Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s671">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s672">"Show me your papers."</span> <span id="s673">I showed him the papers: Waldemar Ptaszek.</span> <span id="s674">In the train, I had already time to repeat "Waldemar Ptaszek, born here and here, and my father's so and so."</span> <span id="s675">"So what do you have in your rucksack?"</span> <span id="s676">So I said, "I have something...I have uh... food which I bought to...to take to my parents.</span> <span id="s677">I am just smuggling.</span> <span id="s678">If you want to give me a fine, I can't help it but I don't have money."</span> <span id="s679">He looked at me and said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s680">Go."</span> <span id="s681">Later...uh...I realized our mistake.</span> <span id="s682">I realized why...the... the...the Christian Poles recognized us as Jews on the train.</span> <span id="s683">You know why?</span> <span id="s684">We went into a train for smugglers.</span> <span id="s685">And everybody was dressed like smugglers.</span> <span id="s686">And now the few Jews are coming dressed in their best because we are going for a trip.</span> <span id="s687">In the best...I had my shoes polished.</span> <span id="s688">We were...we just stand up like a sore...like a sore thumb how they say it in.</span> <span id="s689">.</span> <span id="s690">in English so this was our... and probably this the reason he called me.</span> <span id="s691">I was nicely dressed.</span> <span id="s692">We did stood out from the rest of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s694">At this point...excuse me...we need to stop and pause and change tapes.</span> <span id="s695">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s696">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">01:59:54</span></p> <p><span id="s698">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s700">Continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">02:00:27</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: So, after the Ukrainian let me go back, I was walking.</span> <span id="s703">We were all together but basically mixed with another population walking the streets of L'vov [Polish: Lwów] in 1942.</span> <span id="s704">I was walking my friend [Velvole (ph)], farther with him, 10 feet behind us was Rappoport and farther, mingled with another people.</span> <span id="s705">And I remember passing the street Janowska .</span> <span id="s706">On Janowska street, there was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s707">And I remember looking through the wires at the Jews working, and their [eyes] because you could see it.</span> <span id="s708">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s709">I heard about Janowska lager, but I didn't know it was right in the middle of the town.</span> <span id="s710">So I..</span> <span id="s711">.</span> <span id="s712">I start to shake in that time too.</span> <span id="s713">I mean shake, being that scared.</span> <span id="s714">And....uh...later after walking along the...all the way through the town, I arrived in Skni_ów [NB: Polish spelling], a station past ...past L'vov.</span> <span id="s715">Now I must tell you something.</span> <span id="s716">I was a very naive child.</span> <span id="s717">I had a big fantasy.</span> <span id="s718">I always fantasied.</span> <span id="s719">Even being in that train, I fantasized.</span> <span id="s720">You see, I did read a lot.</span> <span id="s721">A lot of Jack London and all the books; and I was always dreaming of traveling, of adventures.</span> <span id="s722">And for some reason, I'm even ashamed to admit, I felt like I'm there...adventure.</span> <span id="s723">It was a mixture, being some hero of mine...from some book going to borders and...and feeling as a Jew, it's...it's a deadly game.</span> <span id="s724">It was a mixture.</span> <span id="s725">Anyway, when I come to Skni_ów, I..</span> <span id="s726">.</span> <span id="s727">I didn't even understood that now the biggest... the worst part is coming now.</span> <span id="s728">And I spent all my Polish money because I'm going on a train and we already close to the border.</span> <span id="s729">I spent...I had 500 zlotys, and I think it's 10 for something and...uh.</span> <span id="s730">.</span> <span id="s731">I went to going to the toilet, looking on the mirror and looked at me myself and thought, "How do you look, Tom?</span> <span id="s732">Face not bad.</span> <span id="s733">The nose, maybe a little bit too long, but also not bad.</span> <span id="s734">The hair, reddish.</span> <span id="s735">Not bad...." Everything was...in my opinion, I give...myself a plus...for...for the Aryan look.</span> <span id="s736">And...uh...the only trouble was...was with my Jewish accent, and I talked Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">02:03:04 Go back to the train, and now we have a big city street, and we suppose to go out in a town past the [Lsitvov (ph)] Street, and later go to the border.</span> <span id="s738">They're suppose to lead us to the border, ...our...our...our guide.</span> <span id="s739">Anyway, while the train is coming close to the gate...to the [Lsitvov (ph)] Street, something happened.</span> <span id="s740">There was a Jewish girl with us.</span> <span id="s741">Langer was her name.</span> <span id="s742">She was...she didn't have typical Semitic features cause none of us who did try to go on Christian papers had the Semitic features, but she was nevertheless dark, dark eyes, so she always did look out to the window when the train was moving so nobody should see her face.</span> <span id="s743">It wasn't as much as Semitic features than the look of a Jewish person in that time.</span> <span id="s744">This care look, and so on.</span> <span id="s745">It was difficult to get rid of.</span> <span id="s746">And the German conductor did come to her, checking the tickets, like to anybody.</span> <span id="s747">And when he asked her, "Bitte, die Fahrkarte," which "Please, where is your ticket?"</span> <span id="s748">, she did turn over and she said, "Bitte, Ich habe"-- "Yes, please, I have."</span> <span id="s749">If she would talk still German, it wouldn't be so bad.</span> <span id="s750">But later she understood that she should pretend that she doesn't know German.</span> <span id="s751">And she started to back off...she was a pretty girl and he did want to talk to her and she start to talk half German 'til she learned a few words in school.</span> <span id="s752">Anyway, she convinced the German that she doesn't know German much and so he left.</span> <span id="s753">The Germans weren't so really sharp, but she arose the suspicion of the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s754">We're traveling with those.</span> <span id="s755">And soon Ukrainian militia man did come asking her for the papers and I have done a basic mistake.</span> <span id="s756">Up 'til now, if I say a lie, I start to get red.</span> <span id="s757">I start to stutter.</span> <span id="s758">Even now, I start to stutter.</span> <span id="s759">And when I was a kid, I was very shy.</span> <span id="s760">In that point, when they start to look for more Jews because they discover this girl, instead to...to look around like another my neighbors did look, you know...the passengers, I start to sweat, perspire.</span> <span id="s761">My face did get...my face did get red and I didn't know what to do so I took a newspaper, pretend like I'm reading.</span> <span id="s762">And this was even worse because then everybody was looking around and here's a guy reading a paper.</span> <span id="s763">And didn't take long when my paper is taken away and I see in front of me a Ukrainian militiaman.</span> <span id="s764">"What's your name?"</span> <span id="s765">"Me.</span> <span id="s766">Waldemar Ptaszek."</span> <span id="s767">And I remember I added, "But in home they called me 'Waldek.'"</span> <span id="s768">I told him this to make it more...at least I thought so, more truthful.</span> <span id="s769">He took my paper.</span> <span id="s770">He asked me for a document with a pictures which I don't have because I'm not full aged.</span> <span id="s771">I'm under age.</span> <span id="s772">I have only my birth certificate.</span> <span id="s773">So he didn't know if I am Jewish or not, so he told me, "Come with me to the toilet."</span> <span id="s774">They had a proof...to check and see if you are circumcised because in America everybody practiced.</span> <span id="s775">In Poland, only a Jew.</span> <span id="s776">So they took me to the toilet and told me to pull down the pants.</span> <span id="s777">pulled down the pants.</span> <span id="s778">They are looking.</span> <span id="s779">Still can't find out.</span> <span id="s780">Something is wrong here.</span> <span id="s781">What was wrong?</span> <span id="s782">Why weren't they able to find out?</span> <span id="s783">Because two weeks before escaping, I did try to correct what my Rabbi or shochet, ....</span> <span id="s784">Who's doing the circumcisium?</span> <span id="s785">I don't even know.</span> <span id="s786">A rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">02:06:56</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Usually.</span> <span id="s789">Rabbi or [mohel].</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Whoever it is.</span> <span id="s791">I tried to correct, what 13 years ago, 14 years ago, what somebody did do to me.</span> <span id="s792">So I did...I did try to correct it with a string and with a tool and tie it.</span> <span id="s793">The only result was in that time that everything was swollen and so they weren't able to...to recognize and it hurt me.</span> <span id="s794">I wasn't able to urinate.</span> <span id="s795">But.</span> <span id="s796">.</span> <span id="s797">uh...it was...wasn't able to see, but obviously they had seen that somebody was manipulated over there, so they started talk to each other.</span> <span id="s798">And after the professional...the professional result, the diagnosis was that Jew or not Jew, something is wrong, and he took me.</span> <span id="s799">They took me.</span> <span id="s800">Pulled back the pants.</span> <span id="s801">The train stopped.</span> <span id="s802">I went...they told us...they told me to go out and now I noticed they caught practically everybody...every one of us.</span> <span id="s803">The...the whole group was caught, except one little boy.</span> <span id="s804">[Velvole (ph)], he wasn't caught.</span> <span id="s805">I don't why.</span> <span id="s806">But he...he was caught later.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">02:08:02 Anyway, they took us to the...uh...uh...SS office where Gestapo is over there.</span> <span id="s808">Stryy [Polish: Stryj] is a big city and there was one Gestapo is there and there was about five Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s809">They told us to undress.</span> <span id="s810">We undressed.</span> <span id="s811">And at that time one Ukrainian hit me in my throat with the fist and I was start to choke and when he want to hit me again, the Gestapo man start to yell at him, forbid to hit.</span> <span id="s812">Yah.</span> <span id="s813">It's true.</span> <span id="s814">So he didn't beat us anymore when he forbid to beat us.</span> <span id="s815">And after they checked our clothing and discovered some money, told us again to dress.</span> <span id="s816">And they led us to...uh...like a little jail.</span> <span id="s817">We went in.</span> <span id="s818">Locked the doors.</span> <span id="s819">It was dark inside.</span> <span id="s820">They didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s821">Sitting up about an hour, the door opens a little bit, and you see a Ukraine...Ukrainian guard in front and he said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s822">If you will give me some money, I will give you good advice.</span> <span id="s823">I know, no matter what still something...he said, you still hide some money.</span> <span id="s824">After all this...." Which was true.</span> <span id="s825">I had some money (laughing) still hidden where they weren't able to discover in...uh...but anyway Rappoport hearing this, had a glass case.</span> <span id="s826">Opened the glass case and he put away this little lining and picked up about 50 marks or so hidden behind the lining of the glass case...eye glass case.</span> <span id="s827">And did give...give it this Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s828">Now the Ukrainian's giving us the advice.</span> <span id="s829">He opened more the door...a little bit more, so the light did come in.</span> <span id="s830">And he said, "Look behind you."</span> <span id="s831">Behind us was...was a window...a bar window, with bars.</span> <span id="s832">And something was hanging from the bars.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">He said, "You see it?</span> <span id="s834">This is long underwear.</span> <span id="s835">Yesterday, they arrested a Jew like you are now arrested, and he hanged himself.</span> <span id="s836">So my advice is you hang yourself.</span> <span id="s837">One after another one, it will be better than this what is waiting...awaiting you when the boss will come."</span> <span id="s838">The big shot.</span> <span id="s839">Anyway, he closed the door.</span> <span id="s840">And we didn't take his advice.</span> <span id="s841">In the evening they told us to go out and...uh.</span> <span id="s842">.</span> <span id="s843">we were about 12 people, and after a warning that we will be shot if we try to escape, they led us through the town of Stryy [Polish: Stryj] to another jail.</span> <span id="s844">People seeing us reacted different.</span> <span id="s845">Some did laugh.</span> <span id="s846">Some did joke.</span> <span id="s847">Some did spit.</span> <span id="s848">I've seen some faces which did maybe feel for us.</span> <span id="s849">And finally, they took us to another jail for criminal police.</span> <span id="s850">This was...another jail was a jail which did belong to so-called "Kripo."</span> <span id="s851">"Kripo" is Kriminalpolizei.</span> <span id="s852">Because they were the people arresting us, which I found out later.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">02:11:42 And...uh.</span> <span id="s854">.</span> <span id="s855">over there, the same Rabinowicz who on the train... uh...was talking with me, was moving back and forth...he was a hyper always.</span> <span id="s856">He told me and another friend, [Velvole (ph)], that if you have some still money, we should give him, he will bribe the guard.</span> <span id="s857">Maybe we could sneak out.</span> <span id="s858">And we have seen him a few times going out through the door with a guard and coming in so I did give him some money.</span> <span id="s859">I still had some hidden money, and I cut off the seam and took out.</span> <span id="s860">I just mention it because later it will come up again.</span> <span id="s861">Being in this jail for a couple of days, they again transferred us to the big city jail, big four-story building.</span> <span id="s862">In the city jail, we were in that time about eight people.</span> <span id="s863">The woman they took someplace else.</span> <span id="s864">And was in the third floor, cell number 27 or 37.</span> <span id="s865">I think 27.</span> <span id="s866">And...uh...who was in this cell?</span> <span id="s867">Were about four Jews...one...two Ukrainians, one person we didn't know he's Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s868">Weren't able to discover, so he was...uh...he did get soup...Red Cross soup.</span> <span id="s869">Because the Red Cross helped us with food, but only for the Christians--not for Jews.</span> <span id="s870">So he received it.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Some people recognized...some from the jail...did hold him for a Christian, some not.</span> <span id="s872">Anyway, he had...he wasn't established, not there...not there.</span> <span id="s873">He was sick.</span> <span id="s874">He was laying in the corner.</span> <span id="s875">And there was a German.</span> <span id="s876">I'll tell you about this German.</span> <span id="s877">It was big cell, pretty clean.</span> <span id="s878">We had four mattresses from straw, stacked a whole day one atop of another one.</span> <span id="s879">In the night time, we did lay it on the floor, and we slept.</span> <span id="s880">(Pause) And it was...it was also...it was there a lawyer from the city of Stryy [Polish: Stryj]--a Jewish...Jewish lawyer.</span> <span id="s881">He...I remember he had a talent...uh...he took a..</span> <span id="s882">.</span> <span id="s883">a..</span> <span id="s884">.</span> <span id="s885">a..</span> <span id="s886">.</span> <span id="s887">comb.</span> <span id="s888">He was able to play a comb.</span> <span id="s889">And when he played the Ukrainians would listen in especial; night time they always asked him...knocked on the middle of the door, "Play a little bit."</span> <span id="s890">And because of it, they next day they did give us more soup or whatever.</span> <span id="s891">So he has done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">02:14:38 But...uh.</span> <span id="s893">.</span> <span id="s894">later, we had a custom...especially, the first days to tell stories of our past.</span> <span id="s895">And everybody tell...told his story.</span> <span id="s896">When it became my turn, I told him.</span> <span id="s897">I didn't have much to say.</span> <span id="s898">I was born Izbica and I am out from Izbica.</span> <span id="s899">But Alvin Lippmann had an interesting story to tell.</span> <span id="s900">Alvin Lippmann...uh...he was about...over 50 years old, very straight.</span> <span id="s901">I mean he kept himself straight, slim, always his...his...coat, had a coat was buttoned and every day, he get up in the same hour and he was really...could be a military man.</span> <span id="s902">Now at that point...I hate even to tell the story.</span> <span id="s903">I hate to tell my whole story, to tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s904">I must again interject something.</span> <span id="s905">Why do I hate to tell?</span> <span id="s906">Because there's so many unbelievable scenes and situations that if I tell everything, my whole story be...becomes unbelievable.</span> <span id="s907">So this is one of these...of these stories which I usually hate to tell, but I will tell it to you.</span> <span id="s908">You know what?</span> <span id="s909">I wrote my story in...in...in ghetto.</span> <span id="s910">I wrote it in the forest.</span> <span id="s911">I wrote it in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s912">It was many times lost, discovered.</span> <span id="s913">When I went out, I wrote again.</span> <span id="s914">They promised my story to hide pages so I could recover after the war, which I did recover about 30 percent of it.</span> <span id="s915">In 1952 from the 30 percent I..</span> <span id="s916">.</span> <span id="s917">I did special...applied a job I should have a lot of time.</span> <span id="s918">And in Poland I used to work as a social director.</span> <span id="s919">In the months of.</span> <span id="s920">.</span> <span id="s921">uh...uh...November, October, there wasn't...there was really quiet in the resort places.</span> <span id="s922">So I..</span> <span id="s923">.</span> <span id="s924">I did fill in mine diary.</span> <span id="s925">And later, Poland...they want to publish it.</span> <span id="s926">But they did want to make so many corrections that I didn't allow it.</span> <span id="s927">And later when I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s928">They made me...let me go but this manuscript should stay in the country, so I managed to smuggle out a manuscript to the Jewish...uh...consulate in...in Poland, and I later picked it up in...in Israel.</span> <span id="s929">But why I am telling you this story.</span> <span id="s930">Now I have a diary which I've written, in the dangerous, places my whole life.</span> <span id="s931">What should I do with it?</span> <span id="s932">So I go to a Jewish survivor from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s933">Actually, he was the Secretary of the Jewish organization of the Auschwitz people in Haifa.</span> <span id="s934">I go to him and said, "Listen, I would like you should look it over, read it over and tell me what you feel about this."</span> <span id="s935">Three weeks later I visit him</span></p> <p><span id="s936">02:17:32 and ask him, "So, what do you think?"</span> <span id="s937">And he looks at me and said, "Oh, Yah.</span> <span id="s938">Yah.</span> <span id="s939">You have a fantasy.</span> <span id="s940">Never heard of Sobibór.</span> <span id="s941">Revolt?</span> <span id="s942">Never heard."</span> <span id="s943">I was beaten many times in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s944">Beaten by the SS.</span> <span id="s945">It didn't hurt me as much as if he was.</span> <span id="s946">And what as if he was done?</span> <span id="s947">He done this: that for another 20 years, I didn't touch it.</span> <span id="s948">So, if he didn't believe me, who could believe me?</span> <span id="s949">But later, I come to understand that people being in Auschwitz and Buchenwald, they were actual limited.</span> <span id="s950">They have seen only their own circle.</span> <span id="s951">And in many cases, ours like hiding in the forest, hiding and hiding was much worse than...than...than a camp, than a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s952">Depends which kind.</span> <span id="s953">So anyway, but nevertheless it had such an effect that I put it away for 20 years.</span> <span id="s954">I didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s955">Still in America, when the Holocaust film did come out, I felt maybe I should do it.</span> <span id="s956">So I started on it.</span> <span id="s957">Now, why also...I hate ...I hate to...to publish it or whatever, because it's so...a story like this.</span> <span id="s958">It's hard to believe which I will tell you.</span> <span id="s959">Alvin Lippmann, his story.</span> <span id="s960">Alvin Lippmann was a German officer, a Hauptmann [NB: Captain].</span> <span id="s961">He fought in the Polish campaign, '39.</span> <span id="s962">He fought in the Russian campaign; but unfortunately, he had a Jewish wife and two children.</span> <span id="s963">His wife in the beginning of the war--this his story--in the beginning of the war, was under the protection of the Wehrmacht because her husband was a German officer.</span> <span id="s964">There was a time when the families were under protection.</span> <span id="s965">So later the Gestapo told him, "Either divorce your wife.</span> <span id="s966">It's okay.</span> <span id="s967">Or get out from the Wehrmacht."</span> <span id="s968">He decided to get out.</span> <span id="s969">They let him from the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s970">The moment he went out from the Wehrmacht, his...his family was not protected anymore.</span> <span id="s971">And when they resettled the Jews to Poland, they settled his wife and children to Zamosc.</span> <span id="s972">And he left with them.</span> <span id="s973">He didn't want to leave his family, and they let him go.</span> <span id="s974">In Zamosc, they made him a commandant of the Jewish police, militia.</span> <span id="s975">Until...and he did survive until the last Aktion.</span> <span id="s976">The last Aktion was, they took away his wife and children, but they let him go.</span> <span id="s977">He was a German.</span> <span id="s978">So he wasn't able to protect either his wife or his children.</span> <span id="s979">That time he did try...he didn't want to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s980">He did want to go to Czechoslovakia, and he did try to make his way to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s981">Anyway, he was in Stryy when they arrested him.</span> <span id="s982">And he told us this story.</span> <span id="s983">Not only this, now the point--which is all--he taught...when General Ludendorff made this "Putsch" with Hitler, you know this story, ...he took with him a company of German soldiers.</span> <span id="s984">Who was in this company?</span> <span id="s985">The jung Leutnant [NB: Lieutenant], Alvin Lippmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">02:20:55 So after the war, when Hitler was in the power, he did send a letter with his signature, probably wasn't an original.</span> <span id="s987">It was a stamp.</span> <span id="s988">It was from the headquarters of NSDAP, the Nazi organization.</span> <span id="s989">A thank you letter to...to the old fighters, all the Kamaraden.</span> <span id="s990">A thank you letter for his work for the Nazis, so he did get this letter.</span> <span id="s991">So he tells us this story, and the Jewish lawyer was immediately excited, said, "Listen, well, we have the documents.</span> <span id="s992">He has all the evidence.</span> <span id="s993">He has a Iron Cross.</span> <span id="s994">He has everything!"</span> <span id="s995">And so he...he told him, "Listen, you better write a letter to General Governor Frank in Krakow and you should be ...first of all, you're a German."</span> <span id="s996">Second, he explained...he explained away this.</span> <span id="s997">And he wrote a letter.</span> <span id="s998">Now, I must go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s999">While we are...in this...while we are in this jail, in this room, we were very hungry.</span> <span id="s1000">We didn't get much food, but it was quiet.</span> <span id="s1001">Nobody did bother us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">No...no... nobody did beat us.</span> <span id="s1003">But once a nighttime, we heard a scream.</span> <span id="s1004">Outside.</span> <span id="s1005">So I went to the window and looked down and right a big jail was another...uh...uh...house, two-floor house.</span> <span id="s1006">And I observed once in awhile that some people are brought in and...uh...and there was a rumor that they are Jews caught on Aryan, Christian papers or otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">And...uh...til...til except when the jail would be full, when there would be Aktion to Belzec, or to another place, they take them out.</span> <span id="s1008">So the scream was exactly from...when they tried to take them out from this jail to the...to the yard, some woman started to scream.</span> <span id="s1009">And I was looking down and I was wondering, "Oh, God, Why we are separate?</span> <span id="s1010">I'm a Jew too, but they keep us separate ...God forbid they should take us...they should attach us."</span> <span id="s1011">They took all...all of them away, but our room.</span> <span id="s1012">Our cell wasn't touched.</span> <span id="s1013">Now I'm going back.</span> <span id="s1014">Now, Alvin Lippmann's letter goes out.</span> <span id="s1015">Not long, about three days later, we heard some steps in the hallways of the jail.</span> <span id="s1016">Even this jail, we talk only Polish or Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1017">There were no Germans personnel.</span> <span id="s1018">Once in awhile a German showed up so the whole jail was under guard.</span> <span id="s1019">And we heard....we could... we could hear some changes.</span> <span id="s1020">Everybody "Achtung!</span> <span id="s1021">Achtung!</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Achtung!"</span> <span id="s1023">in the hallways and we understood some big shots are coming.</span> <span id="s1024">There are steps and steps and the steps stopped in front of our cell.</span> <span id="s1025">Cell's open, and there are two tall guys with the...uh...death head on their caps.</span> <span id="s1026">You know it's SS, or Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1027">And they opened the door, look at us and immediately "Herr Lippmann.</span> <span id="s1028">I understood immediately that there's something...they don't talk...they don't say to a guy they want to kill "Herr."</span> <span id="s1029">"Herr Lippmann," so he immediately stood up and they told him, "Take your stuff and come with us.</span> <span id="s1030">Please take your stuff."</span> <span id="s1031">And so he took whatever he had with him and another look around</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">02:24:29 and they asked Mr. Krewl (ph) ... Krewl (ph) was the head of the jail, Pole.</span> <span id="s1033">They asked him, "What are the other people doing here doing?"</span> <span id="s1034">And he explained that this cell belonged to the criminal police and...uh...they are two Ukrainians and one, we don't know who it is, and there are four Jews and so on and so.</span> <span id="s1035">So the SS immediately put everything in order.</span> <span id="s1036">They told the Ukrainians to leave them and this guy who was not a Pole, not a Jew, they tell him he's Jewish...they didn't care.</span> <span id="s1037">If they kill....even they kill a Pole, what do they...what do they mean.</span> <span id="s1038">What do they care?</span> <span id="s1039">They classified him as a Jew, and they told all of us to go to the...they should transfer us to the to another building which in between time was again collecting some Jews.</span> <span id="s1040">And you wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1041">When they took us in, me and [Velvole (ph)] and another one to the other cell.</span> <span id="s1042">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s1043">I remember it was one room maybe like this.</span> <span id="s1044">Full of people.</span> <span id="s1045">Dirty.</span> <span id="s1046">Was no toilet, but there was a barrel from herring.</span> <span id="s1047">Empty barrel.</span> <span id="s1048">And this used...this was as a toilet.</span> <span id="s1049">I think it was a couple dead bodies laying by it.</span> <span id="s1050">I still remember if it was...it was a Christian.</span> <span id="s1051">I don't know if it was a Pole or a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1052">I think so, a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1053">It was already the winter time and he was with this peasant coat, and he was praying to "Matka Boska [the Mother of God]," to Mother Mary.</span> <span id="s1054">And praying and praying.</span> <span id="s1055">The whole day he was praying.</span> <span id="s1056">He was treated with deep...deep respect.</span> <span id="s1057">Uh...We had people, strong men, in our cell.</span> <span id="s1058">When lunch time did come and they threw in a sack with bread, and the strong man, he's supposed to divide.</span> <span id="s1059">He didn't give everybody what belongs to him, a quart...of loaf of bread, but he put in his hand and right he breaked up at least half.</span> <span id="s1060">But he can do anything.</span> <span id="s1061">He was the law of the fist.</span> <span id="s1062">But this man, the Christian man, he was so much respected because he helped the Jews that he...he didn't even need to stand in line for this bread.</span> <span id="s1063">It was delivered to him.</span> <span id="s1064">Uh...uh...He wasn't biggest.</span> <span id="s1065">I mean, we respected him because he did help us.</span> <span id="s1066">Try at least.</span> <span id="s1067">Now he's in the same... Well, I remember this.</span> <span id="s1068">Now, I didn't tell you this, but back still in the big cell...in the first cell, I did become very friendly with a person called Zellinger.</span> <span id="s1069">He was a very rich fellow from the ghetto of Stryy.</span> <span id="s1070">He was arrested.</span> <span id="s1071">I don't know from what reason.</span> <span id="s1072">But he received packages from his wife in ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">And he helped me.</span> <span id="s1074">When he...ever he received, he did give me...the package.</span> <span id="s1075">And we became very friendly.</span> <span id="s1076">His wife bribed the [Ogelobo (ph)], [Ogelobo (ph)] is like the guard...the Ukrainian guard, and he received many times letters.</span> <span id="s1077">The guard called him out, give him the letter...called him outside.</span> <span id="s1078">Anyway, he immediately...they let him come out...when...when they took him out, they did give him a better room, a better cell.</span> <span id="s1079">But me, the rest of them, the rest of us, were in this particular, miserable room.</span> <span id="s1080">Next day, they called my name.</span> <span id="s1081">They called [Velvole's (ph)] name.</span> <span id="s1082">We were called outside and pushed into another cell where Zellinger was.</span> <span id="s1083">What happened?</span> <span id="s1084">Zellinger did give a bribe to them....</span> <span id="s1085">The other cell was already a cell for people which had the means--doctors, lawyers from the ghetto--and there was no hunger over there.</span> <span id="s1086">It was clean, and there was some business going on with the Polish prisoners.</span> <span id="s1087">We put in a..</span> <span id="s1088">.</span> <span id="s1089">a..</span> <span id="s1090">.</span> <span id="s1091">a pot with the string down and the Polish prisoners put in some...uh...meat or whatever, sausage, and we threw out the money.</span> <span id="s1092">It was some business.</span> <span id="s1093">So it was a different atmosphere.</span> <span id="s1094">So Zellinger helped me.</span> <span id="s1095">Once I remember a fellow in this particular room.</span> <span id="s1096">We were waiting for a next transport.</span> <span id="s1097">We know that the next time will be we will be killed the moment the transport is ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">02:28:52</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: We need to keep moving a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1101">Okay.</span> <span id="s1102">So, I will skip this story.</span> <span id="s1103">The point is this.</span> <span id="s1104">Once Zellinger received a letter from his wife through the guard that...uh...tomorrow a doctor will come asking for sick people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">What's happened?</span> <span id="s1106">We did get sick...sick on the...typhus that broke out.</span> <span id="s1107">But we were afraid that if we tell the doctors that some people..., the Germans that some people are sick, we...we know what kind of medicine they have for us.</span> <span id="s1108">So we were afraid, but we notified the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1109">And the...the Judenrat bribed the...the...the Germans...it's look like, they should allow to take out a few people from jail.</span> <span id="s1110">Anyway, Zellinger did received a letter from his wife that when the doctor comes, he should not be afraid to say he's sick.</span> <span id="s1111">And Zellinger told me that.</span> <span id="s1112">And when the next day, the doctor did come, I did go to the doctor time, and told them that I am sick.</span> <span id="s1113">The doctor looked at me and he said, "Oh, there's more sick than you."</span> <span id="s1114">Up 'til now, the Germans they didn't know, because when there was a roll call in the morning, everybody was able to support.</span> <span id="s1115">Was sort of a tight room, anyway.</span> <span id="s1116">Uh...So I pushed my way...I took a thermometer and rubbed it in my shirt and I knocked it down [up] to about 41 celsius; I should be dead in that temperature, but was so scared to start to get it back and anyway through my manipulation the silver inside did break down in a few places.</span> <span id="s1117">So...but, I was...very panicky, but I managed to put put it at 38 celsius, and I go back to the doctor and the doctor still didn't want to accept me so I went to his helper and I remember I had 20 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1118">I did give him 20 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1119">I remember punching my chest to make red spots because I know my brother was sick of the typhus in ghetto that the symptoms for typhus is red spots on the chest.</span> <span id="s1120">Anyway, the 20 zlotys helped me.</span> <span id="s1121">He pushed me outside.</span> <span id="s1122">They were allowed to take out a certain amount of people, about 20 people from that jail.</span> <span id="s1123">So I was, Zellinger they didn't accept him, but they accepted me.</span> <span id="s1124">And now they were going to take us out.</span> <span id="s1125">The gates from the jail opened, and they take us to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1126">Now, the...the jail didn't have a hospital.</span> <span id="s1127">But the ghetto had.</span> <span id="s1128">And while the ghetto was shrinking, the Stryy ghetto, the hospital was out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1129">So they took us to that hospital.</span> <span id="s1130">In one room or two rooms, they did...they restrict only the people from the jail.</span> <span id="s1131">And the rest was...uh...locked up and guards were standing around now, too... Jewish guards, Jewish policja.</span> <span id="s1132">So...but now we're going outside and it was winter.</span> <span id="s1133">I remember going through streets of Stryy and thinking, "Should I run now?</span> <span id="s1134">Should I...." because the Jewish policia...they were only guarding.</span> <span id="s1135">There was no Germans.</span> <span id="s1136">But they were in front with the Jewish...uh.</span> <span id="s1137">.</span> <span id="s1138">nurses, and they didn't give a damn about us, thinking that we are sick.</span> <span id="s1139">And was a ideal time to jump out and just go.</span> <span id="s1140">But I..</span> <span id="s1141">.</span> <span id="s1142">I did look for a partner.</span> <span id="s1143">I didn't have a penny and didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s1144">So I noticed another fellow who I thought maybe he is simulating sicknesses too, and I told him, "Listen, do you want to run?"</span> <span id="s1145">And he told me, "Don't do it now.</span> <span id="s1146">Let go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1147">My father's in the ghetto and my father will come.</span> <span id="s1148">He...will have money and everything else."</span> <span id="s1149">So I..</span> <span id="s1150">.</span> <span id="s1151">I listened to him.</span> <span id="s1152">So now we're in this hospital I explained, this room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">02:32:32 Visitors from the city were able to come in, but we weren't able to go out with the Jewish militia... uh... uh ...watch us.</span> <span id="s1154">It didn't take long.</span> <span id="s1155">He was really sick.</span> <span id="s1156">So I wasn't able to go along later.</span> <span id="s1157">I was sick.</span> <span id="s1158">I don't want to go into any particulars, but I was sick.</span> <span id="s1159">(Sigh) Now, one evening at 4 o'clock, the doctor comes in without his hat.</span> <span id="s1160">I still remember.</span> <span id="s1161">And he said, "All prisoners from jail should go out from the room and go across the yard to the next...uh ...next apartment...next house... house.</span> <span id="s1162">So I wanted to get up and I did get up and this was about January 8, 1943.</span> <span id="s1163">And I go out and I..</span> <span id="s1164">.</span> <span id="s1165">I don't remember now what's happened, what's make me to turn back.</span> <span id="s1166">I had a big white skirt--shirt, long shirt--and go out and it was cold and I remember I felt my feet were...my sole was like burning from snow, from the frost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Either this make me turn back or I notice a German soldier standing next to this next building.</span> <span id="s1168">Anyway, I turned back, went back to my bed and hide under the bed.</span> <span id="s1169">Hide under the bed; takes maybe three minutes, I hear somebody comes in.</span> <span id="s1170">I looked from under the bed, and I see a Jewish policeman.</span> <span id="s1171">Now it's a Jew, no matter what.</span> <span id="s1172">I did move out and said, "Listen.</span> <span id="s1173">What's happened here?"</span> <span id="s1174">He told me, "You here?"</span> <span id="s1175">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1176">He said, "Well, then, don't be afraid.</span> <span id="s1177">You will hear some shooting, but be quiet."</span> <span id="s1178">He went out, and later was some shooting, screaming.</span> <span id="s1179">And nobody did come back; except a couple of hours later, I see the doctor comes back.</span> <span id="s1180">And like a..</span> <span id="s1181">.</span> <span id="s1182">before the doctor come back, I was ready to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">What's happened?</span> <span id="s1184">When we were in hospital...in the hospital, everybody was forced to give up the clothing to the dis... disinfection, but I managed not to give up.</span> <span id="s1185">I did give up a shirt, but the rest was hidden under my mattress with...uh ...my idea to escape.</span> <span id="s1186">So while...shooting was finished and nobody...uh...did come in, I did dress myself slowly from the stuff under the mattress.</span> <span id="s1187">It was no militia now watching us because everybody's supposed to be killed, and I want to go out, but I was so shaky that my movement...I still was sick, that I..</span> <span id="s1188">.</span> <span id="s1189">I've seen that I wouldn't go too far.</span> <span id="s1190">They will recognize me immediately, so I went back under the bed.</span> <span id="s1191">Later, I see that the doctor comes in.</span> <span id="s1192">So I move out and say, "Oh, Doctor."</span> <span id="s1193">And he asks...sees me and said, "Oh, How...what are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s1194">And I told him what I have done.</span> <span id="s1195">And he said, "No, it's...it's impossible."</span> <span id="s1196">Because they killed everybody from jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">There were 20 people.</span> <span id="s1198">They killed everybody.</span> <span id="s1199">So he started to check.</span> <span id="s1200">What's happened?</span> <span id="s1201">When it's the high point of the typhus, there's a time when people run like in high fever.</span> <span id="s1202">They lose their conscious.</span> <span id="s1203">They just run.</span> <span id="s1204">I think it is about the tenth day of the sickness when the crisis comes.</span> <span id="s1205">And many times while we were in this...uh ...in this hospital, from the neighboring rooms because neighboring rooms was Jews from the city, they did try to run in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Many times they did run in.</span> <span id="s1207">.</span> <span id="s1208">in our restricted room, but the Jewish policja pushed them back.</span> <span id="s1209">Probably every day happened something like that.</span> <span id="s1210">They would start to run so when the doctor was checking, he noticed that a bed from the adjoining room is empty because he counted the bodies.</span> <span id="s1211">There was 20 bodies.</span> <span id="s1212">If the Germans would kill only 19, they would look for me.</span> <span id="s1213">But they were 20.</span> <span id="s1214">So what's happened...what's happened is this.</span> <span id="s1215">.</span> <span id="s1216">is the doctor figured out....that cell...this guy, Ledermann and I..</span> <span id="s1217">.</span> <span id="s1218">we didn't know...he...many times he did try to get in the last few days to our... everybody's gone.</span> <span id="s1219">There was no guard.</span> <span id="s1220">He's gone.</span> <span id="s1221">And he took my place.</span> <span id="s1222">So he told me, "Tom, you go in Ledermann's bed, and from now on you're not Blatt.</span> <span id="s1223">You're Ledermann.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">02:37:15 So in this way, I managed to go out from the jail, and not be a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1225">Later, I don't want to go into details again, I was healthy already and was ready to go out from this hospital and the moment I did go out...I was ready to go out, the Jewish policeman did come.</span> <span id="s1226">He practically see me every day that I can go out from the hospital.</span> <span id="s1227">I must give him money.</span> <span id="s1228">I says, "But listen, I don't have money."</span> <span id="s1229">"No.</span> <span id="s1230">You don't have it?</span> <span id="s1231">Try to steal.</span> <span id="s1232">Do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s1233">I need money.</span> <span id="s1234">Because I saved you."</span> <span id="s1235">I said, "How did you save me?</span> <span id="s1236">I did see you and did come out for help to you.</span> <span id="s1237">You didn't save me."</span> <span id="s1238">Anyway, this policeman, this militiaman was my tormentor.</span> <span id="s1239">And...uh...I wasn't able to go out from the hospital.</span> <span id="s1240">And the doctor told me I must go out.</span> <span id="s1241">You...you can take...we need the place for somebody else and I tried to avoid him, but he took away this bed from me and he took away the food from me, so I was stealing in night time.</span> <span id="s1242">Finally, they caught me.</span> <span id="s1243">They grabbed me and they simply threw me out from jail.</span> <span id="s1244">I didn't even go 200, half a mile when a militia man, another militia man I didn't never know...a Jewish militia man did run after me.</span> <span id="s1245">"You dirty...you go go back.</span> <span id="s1246">What do you mean?</span> <span id="s1247">You will escape from us?"</span> <span id="s1248">And (laughing) took me back to this hospital.</span> <span id="s1249">Not only they took me back, but listen.</span> <span id="s1250">They had again a group from jail.</span> <span id="s1251">Separate.</span> <span id="s1252">He put me with them, where I was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1253">Anyway, as I start to cry, and the doctor comes to visiting and he noticed, "Listen, I just threw you out.</span> <span id="s1254">What are you doing?"</span> <span id="s1255">So I start to cry, "What's will happen, will happen?"</span> <span id="s1256">And told the whole story.</span> <span id="s1257">Told the whole story, so he called up Mr. Stark.</span> <span id="s1258">He was the head of the Jewish...this probably you could check with any sources....</span> <span id="s1259">He called out the Jewish militia, and Mr. Stark, the commandant, did come and I remember he called in this...this tormentor of mine, the Jewish policeman who didn't let me out, and he beat him up over there.</span> <span id="s1260">Yah.</span> <span id="s1261">And they told me I could go.</span> <span id="s1262">And I..</span> <span id="s1263">.</span> <span id="s1264">then when everything is legal.</span> <span id="s1265">I asked him even for my jacket which I..</span> <span id="s1266">.</span> <span id="s1267">which the janitor used to wear.</span> <span id="s1268">Okay.</span> <span id="s1269">I went out to the ghetto and was a free man in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1270">I mean free, I was not anymore a jailman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">02:39:35 Now I find out that Izbica are still Jews and my parents are over there.</span> <span id="s1272">So I wrote them a letter.</span> <span id="s1273">I find this out while...when I was still in jail.</span> <span id="s1274">I wrote them a letter and give the address to the...the hospital.</span> <span id="s1275">And there was a answer.</span> <span id="s1276">Even when I was in the hospital, there was a answer.</span> <span id="s1277">But my name wasn't that time Blatt.</span> <span id="s1278">It was Ledermann.</span> <span id="s1279">And I forgot to tell this my parents.</span> <span id="s1280">Anyway, I wrote another letter, another letter.</span> <span id="s1281">In that time the ghetto of Stryy was half empty.</span> <span id="s1282">And I did live with that Czech boy in one apartment.</span> <span id="s1283">I didn't need food because if some reason even in that time was so many food in empty houses..., it was an Aktion in between time which I survived by hiding in somebody's hiding place.</span> <span id="s1284">But I did want some money to buy a ticket to go back to Izbica, and I didn't know how to get the money.</span> <span id="s1285">So I did go to the Judenrat, and told one official over there if he could help me.</span> <span id="s1286">My parents are alive in the ghetto and I..</span> <span id="s1287">.</span> <span id="s1288">I need some money.</span> <span id="s1289">I need 20 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1290">"Why do you need it?"</span> <span id="s1291">"I want to buy food."</span> <span id="s1292">He went in.</span> <span id="s1293">He came out with a paper that I could have free food for two weeks in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1294">Now, I wasn't able to...I didn't tell them I want to escape.</span> <span id="s1295">I took this paper.</span> <span id="s1296">I never went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1297">That particular...I have a strong intuition always.</span> <span id="s1298">That particular morning, and I'm a long sleeper...that particular morning I did get up...I remember 7 o'clock in the morning and said, "I'm going to the hospital."</span> <span id="s1299">I started the foot go...and I didn't even wait for a Jewish militia man to take me to the hospital because the hospital was outside the ghetto and you were not allowed to go alone, only on the assistance from Jewish militia.</span> <span id="s1300">I went alone.</span> <span id="s1301">Come to the hospital and looked for some people which I will get...get friendly before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">02:41:45</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Let's stop [and pause please.</span> <span id="s1304">We need to stop anyway.</span> <span id="s1305">Let's take a break for a moment.]</span> <span id="s1306">[NB: text in preceding brackets not apparent on videotape]</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1308">Let's pick it up now where you left off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1310">So I didn't receive any money from the Judenrat but... uh.</span> <span id="s1311">.</span> <span id="s1312">this...uh...paper that I could eat, if I want to, in the hospital and in that particular day, I had some feeling I must go to the hospital and went to the hospital to visit my friends which I know from before.</span> <span id="s1313">And I..</span> <span id="s1314">.</span> <span id="s1315">going toward a office to ask for somebody and I notice over there some people, I notice a woman sitting and I'm going out.</span> <span id="s1316">While I'm going in the hallway, somebody is behind me, running behind me..."Mister!</span> <span id="s1317">Mister!</span> <span id="s1318">Wait a second!"</span> <span id="s1319">I stopped and this was the doctor who in the beginning, who changed my name to Ledermann, and I told the story.</span> <span id="s1320">I said, but he didn't remember already my first...my true name.</span> <span id="s1321">He said, "Aren't you...what's your name?" "</span> <span id="s1322">Blatt."</span> <span id="s1323">"Oh, yah.</span> <span id="s1324">Blatt.</span> <span id="s1325">Aren't you Blatt?" "</span> <span id="s1326">Yah."</span> <span id="s1327">"Oh.</span> <span id="s1328">How are you son?</span> <span id="s1329">Listen, go to the office.</span> <span id="s1330">Somebody is waiting for you."</span> <span id="s1331">So I go to the office and he said, "The lady is waiting for you."</span> <span id="s1332">I look at the lady.</span> <span id="s1333">I don't know her.</span> <span id="s1334">And she looks at me.</span> <span id="s1335">She doesn't know me either.</span> <span id="s1336">So she told me to sit...sit down and she said, "You know who I am?</span> <span id="s1337">I'm Ola.</span> <span id="s1338">I was your nanny when you was a baby...milk nanny...nanny.</span> <span id="s1339">I mean, probably my mother didn't have milk or whatever.</span> <span id="s1340">And I remember as a child.</span> <span id="s1341">I remember some Ola, Ola, they mention in our house.</span> <span id="s1342">"I'm Ola."</span> <span id="s1343">So she said, "uh...First you must prove to me that you are really Toivi."</span> <span id="s1344">So she start to ask me how is Izbica look like and how my mother and my father look like and I passed the test, obviously, and she said, "Toivi, you sent a letter, and...uh...from the hospital.</span> <span id="s1345">Your mother answered immediately, and the hospital answered immediately again that 'Tomasz Blatt died January... January 8, 1943, in the Jewish hospital in Stryy,'" because this way it was written in the... in the books.</span> <span id="s1346">"And later, you wrote another letter and another letter and your parents were sure that somebody want to...to get some money, blackmail.</span> <span id="s1347">But your brother was so sure that you are alive that he didn't let your parents in peace.</span> <span id="s1348">So your parents decide to send me out to find my...find by myself.</span> <span id="s1349">And while I was sitting here, asking the doctor told me that he remembered something about Blatt... Ledermann...something, and later you walk in and you walk out and the doctor was running after you."</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">02:44:50 So this is another of these stories unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1351">But I tell you, every survivor has unbelievable story because it was un...unbelievable circumstances, the survivor's life.</span> <span id="s1352">Anyway, so she had some money she did give me immediately.</span> <span id="s1353">And she did give me a watch which my brother had.</span> <span id="s1354">And this...this was his treasure.</span> <span id="s1355">In fact I can remember the watch.</span> <span id="s1356">He wouldn't even let anybody touch, but he'd give it to her she should give it to me.</span> <span id="s1357">He was sure I am alive.</span> <span id="s1358">So she says, "Now, we'll tell your parents and your parents will be in touch with you."</span> <span id="s1359">And she left.</span> <span id="s1360">The same day I went outside, the watch was taken by the Jewish policeman.</span> <span id="s1361">He met me.</span> <span id="s1362">He said, "Oh, you have a nice watch.</span> <span id="s1363">Give it to me."</span> <span id="s1364">And I did give it to him.</span> <span id="s1365">I didn't ask.</span> <span id="s1366">Now I was waiting.</span> <span id="s1367">I..</span> <span id="s1368">.</span> <span id="s1369">I was sure that something will be done and it didn't take long.</span> <span id="s1370">Some middle...not the middle of the night...about 10 o'clock, a knock in the door.</span> <span id="s1371">Somebody comes in.</span> <span id="s1372">Who comes in?</span> <span id="s1373">Krauser.</span> <span id="s1374">The same... (laughing) Volksdeutsch who once didn't betray us.</span> <span id="s1375">He said, "Toivi, Toivi.</span> <span id="s1376">Oh, how are you doing?</span> <span id="s1377">Toivi, listen.</span> <span id="s1378">I did...I'm coming to take you to your parents."</span> <span id="s1379">I'm sure my parents paid him a lot of money to do it.</span> <span id="s1380">And he had actually a paper from the Landrat, from the district officials, that I'm allowed to travel with the train.</span> <span id="s1381">Everything was legal.</span> <span id="s1382">So I, he...and they let me out through the gate to the main gate because I was with a German.</span> <span id="s1383">And we went to the train station.</span> <span id="s1384">I was with the star...the Star of David and while I was waiting for the train, hidden in a little house close to the train station, the shadow...uh...he went in to buy the tickets.</span> <span id="s1385">Soon he comes out and says, "Listen, Toivi, there's a train leaving in a half an hour.</span> <span id="s1386">A regular train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">He stops in any stations.</span> <span id="s1388">Some little Ukrainians, but I don't know if I will be able to protect you if something happened.</span> <span id="s1389">You were paid.</span> <span id="s1390">You could travel the train, but nevertheless.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Now, there's another..." I mean this was a train was leaving in about two hours.</span> <span id="s1392">"But there's another train," it was leaving in about 20 minutes, "which is a German train from the Eastern Front only for Germans.</span> <span id="s1393">If you want to go, just throw down you Star of David.</span> <span id="s1394">Come with me."</span> <span id="s1395">And he said, "It's actually more secure in the den of the lions than it is..." And I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1396">Threw down the Star of David and went with him in, and a lot of hundred soldiers from the Eastern Front...must have been 1943...we went in a compartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">02:47:46 I still remember a woman.</span> <span id="s1398">She was from the Todt Organization.</span> <span id="s1399">And there was two gendarmes in the green uniforms....I know the gendarmes and the SS...I did know by the skull on the hat.</span> <span id="s1400">And they were sitting and talking and the woman did talk about...one guy was from Essen.</span> <span id="s1401">I know they did talk a lot about from the city of Essen.</span> <span id="s1402">But very shortly, and later they switched to the...to Tunis, what there was in that time...they did win some territory in Tunis.</span> <span id="s1403">Anyway it was still going on...later the woman asked me if I want tea.</span> <span id="s1404">And he told me, Kraus[er], "Don't talk much."</span> <span id="s1405">So I said, "Danke schön."</span> <span id="s1406">And he was angry I even said "Danke schön" there.</span> <span id="s1407">I mean in the eyes of Krauser....</span> <span id="s1408">But "Danke schön" was okay.</span> <span id="s1409">They didn't notice anything.</span> <span id="s1410">Uh... Until later, they...across me, the soldier did pick up a piece of chocolate he did give me, and everybody fall asleep.</span> <span id="s1411">So as a German I arrived, because this was a fast train.</span> <span id="s1412">He didn't stop in any station.</span> <span id="s1413">He didn't stop in Izbica either, because it was a small stop.</span> <span id="s1414">We stopped past Izbica 12 kilometers, Krasnystaw.</span> <span id="s1415">Over there we went down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">And here the...Krauser said, "Tom.</span> <span id="s1417">Now here we must part.</span> <span id="s1418">You must go by foot 12...12 kilometers and I can't be with you anymore...anymore because everybody knows me there."</span> <span id="s1419">So...but he forgot to tell me that my parents moved.</span> <span id="s1420">So I went to Izbica night time, come to my home and knock in the door and there's a voice, "Who is it?"</span> <span id="s1421">I say, "It's me.</span> <span id="s1422">Open."</span> <span id="s1423">I didn't recognize in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1424">Well, inside they recognized me and said, "You dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s1425">Run away.</span> <span id="s1426">You don't live here anymore.</span> <span id="s1427">Go over there."</span> <span id="s1428">So we were living in that time in a rundown place, so I come to this place.</span> <span id="s1429">It was everything night time.</span> <span id="s1430">It was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1431">Knock on the...there was some shutters, so I putted my finger behind the shutters because it was everything dried out.</span> <span id="s1432">You know the rundown houses; knock slowly in the window.</span> <span id="s1433">I didn't want to scare my parents.</span> <span id="s1434">And heard a voice, "Somebody's knocking."</span> <span id="s1435">Later, I've seen light and later, I say "It's me.</span> <span id="s1436">Toivi."</span> <span id="s1437">And hear mine brother screaming, "Toivi!</span> <span id="s1438">Toivi!"</span> <span id="s1439">and the doors open in the back and I go in, and my mother kissed me.</span> <span id="s1440">My brother jumped on me.</span> <span id="s1441">He didn't want to let me...but the next question was whether you have your watch.</span> <span id="s1442">(laughing) "Give me back my watch."</span> <span id="s1443">And...uh...my father, he pretend...uh...he didn't...he...he was rather a hard type.</span> <span id="s1444">He pretend he didn't cry but I..</span> <span id="s1445">but I've seen him...I've seen red eyes.</span> <span id="s1446">And now the story was going on a whole night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">02:50:45 Their story, to tell in a few words.</span> <span id="s1448">After this, after I left, they made Izbica "Judenrein;" by that time my brother and father were hidden.</span> <span id="s1449">My mother was in Warsaw, also escaped.</span> <span id="s1450">Soon after I escaped.</span> <span id="s1451">Later, they made Izbica again a "Judenstadt."</span> <span id="s1452">And actual when I researched the German document...there's a document which Izbica... there's a nation...Izbica is to be a "Judenstadt" again.</span> <span id="s1453">And...uh ... first my father returned, later and other people returned and again, I don't want to give...there's a few interesting stories about this, but they will drag on so I will miss it.</span> <span id="s1454">Just tell you that Izbica did again become Judenstadt.</span> <span id="s1455">My father returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">My brother returned.</span> <span id="s1457">My mother returned.</span> <span id="s1458">And...uh...of course, now I am back.</span> <span id="s1459">More people did come back.</span> <span id="s1460">My mother had a beautiful job as a..</span> <span id="s1461">.</span> <span id="s1462">in a German company as a bookkeeper in Warsaw, as a Christian girl.</span> <span id="s1463">She was blonde, thin, short nose.</span> <span id="s1464">Very Aryan-looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Unfortunately, they told me later that my little brother wrote her a letter that my father is going with another woman or sounding like that, and they told me she returned.</span> <span id="s1466">She was jealous or whatever.</span> <span id="s1467">So now I'm in Izbica.</span> <span id="s1468">In the morning, I go out to my Izbica, I'm back in my town.</span> <span id="s1469">Go out and the first guy I see is a good acquaintance of my family from the...the coop...cooperative [spó_dzielczo or landszo (ph)] and I say, "Oh, hello.</span> <span id="s1470">How are you?"</span> <span id="s1471">And he looks at me, "You dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s1472">You are still here?"</span> <span id="s1473">I can't believe it.</span> <span id="s1474">I met another one good.</span> <span id="s1475">He said, "Oh, your time will come soon."</span> <span id="s1476">And I feel it's not my Izbica anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Maybe it never was.</span> <span id="s1478">So I go around into houses.</span> <span id="s1479">There were 200 Jews and they live about 10 Jews to one room in a little area.</span> <span id="s1480">There was a tannery where most Jews lived.</span> <span id="s1481">And...uh.</span> <span id="s1482">.</span> <span id="s1483">I felt something happens.</span> <span id="s1484">Something will happen and I want to go to the Partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">02:53:05 So I go to the Partisans.</span> <span id="s1486">They told me, "You can't go without a gun."</span> <span id="s1487">They wouldn't take you without a weapon.</span> <span id="s1488">So I went to buy weapons.</span> <span id="s1489">I don't have money.</span> <span id="s1490">But I have a friend.</span> <span id="s1491">[Izick (ph)] And I tell him, "Listen.</span> <span id="s1492">Let's buy a gun."</span> <span id="s1493">He didn't have money either.</span> <span id="s1494">So I told my father, "Listen, I don't want to sleep in this room.</span> <span id="s1495">There's too many people.</span> <span id="s1496">I want to sleep in the attic.</span> <span id="s1497">Could you give me a blanket?</span> <span id="s1498">And could you give me a coat, a winter coat?"</span> <span id="s1499">He said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1500">So I took it and sold it.</span> <span id="s1501">I still didn't have enough for a gun.</span> <span id="s1502">(Laughing) So finally [Izick, Izick (ph)] did have the money, bought a gun and he hide it.</span> <span id="s1503">He hid it in the...in the straw, in a place over there in the tannery.</span> <span id="s1504">In the tannery was a horse who did work in this...this...in this towel I hid the gun.</span> <span id="s1505">One day...but I was so in love with the gun that many times I kept it in my pocket.</span> <span id="s1506">Once I go with my...once there was a rumor that the Germans asked how many Jews are in Izbica.</span> <span id="s1507">And that time my father was the Judenrat, the head of the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1508">The 200 Jews, were three people in Judenrat...my father was...another one was Blanck and Kornfeld.</span> <span id="s1509">So I did know immediately.</span> <span id="s1510">So I remember walking with my father to a Polish lady...was in Kovin, and I still remember the road, and I said to my father...that...they asked for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1511">"Isn't that something dangerous?"</span> <span id="s1512">He said, "God knows...knows."</span> <span id="s1513">I said, "Dad, Let's buy a gun."</span> <span id="s1514">He says, "No.</span> <span id="s1515">You can't buy a gun."</span> <span id="s1516">I said, "Dad, I have a gun already.</span> <span id="s1517">In fact in my pocket."</span> <span id="s1518">And he looked and he could see this...uh...outline and he said, "Be careful.</span> <span id="s1519">Be careful.</span> <span id="s1520">Don't...uh...we could get killed."</span> <span id="s1521">But the way he said it, I've seen that is really the tragedy.</span> <span id="s1522">Another time...maybe a half a year ago, he would say, "Tom, hide it.</span> <span id="s1523">Throw it away."</span> <span id="s1524">He didn't say this anymore.</span> <span id="s1525">He let me keep it.</span> <span id="s1526">He just says, "Be careful."</span> <span id="s1527">The gun didn't help...help me anyway because when the time did come, I remember I heard a big shot, jumped from the attic down.</span> <span id="s1528">I hurt my back.</span> <span id="s1529">Until now, it's hurting me.</span> <span id="s1530">Did run to the hiding place.</span> <span id="s1531">As I said, Izbica was in a valley.</span> <span id="s1532">A lot of houses were built in the hills so one wall was actually a built in the...in in the hill.</span> <span id="s1533">So one wall of this tannery was built in in the hill, so what we have done, we moved a panel and digged a very big cave for about a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1534">And was so nicely done nobody did notice this entrance and we hid over there.</span> <span id="s1535">We heard the Germans coming in, looking.</span> <span id="s1536">They went out.</span> <span id="s1537">They can't find us.</span> <span id="s1538">We so happy.</span> <span id="s1539">Next we hear again coming.</span> <span id="s1540">Polish voices.</span> <span id="s1541">"No, they must be here!</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">They must be here!</span> <span id="s1543">They are here!"</span> <span id="s1544">And the Germans start look again.</span> <span id="s1545">And these...the Polish helpers start to help them, rip out the...the panels.</span> <span id="s1546">And I still remember being over there sweating.</span> <span id="s1547">It was hot.</span> <span id="s1548">And while they were pulling the panel, flashes of daylight did come in in this cave.</span> <span id="s1549">And the panel was like a spring.</span> <span id="s1550">It didn't want to give in, like she would like to save us.</span> <span id="s1551">Unfortunately, crack!</span> <span id="s1552">The panel went up, and they told us to go out.</span> <span id="s1553">I remember I went out and I had only one shoe.</span> <span id="s1554">And I was asking the German if I could go back to this...uh...to pick up another shoe.</span> <span id="s1555">He allowed me to do it, and now they took us outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">02:50:55 And outside was many Jews already con... congregated and they surrounded by a few Ukrainians there.</span> <span id="s1557">But by being covered I managed...I actually managed to sneak out from this...from this circle group, and I went outside and I had the knowledge that I cannot go out...I can't go outside from the town because on top of the hills is a ring with soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Izbica's surrounded.</span> <span id="s1559">I had a notion that I must hide on the foothills where the Christians' house are.</span> <span id="s1560">Izbica...himself...the valley was...down was only Jews, but in the foothills, where they're going to the top of the hills were Christians' houses...uh...farms.</span> <span id="s1561">So I went into a blacksmith's shop and he said, "Tom, Go out.</span> <span id="s1562">Go out.</span> <span id="s1563">I'm afraid."</span> <span id="s1564">I went out.</span> <span id="s1565">I went up farther.</span> <span id="s1566">Look happened and I met...I met my schoolmate, Janek Knopczik.</span> <span id="s1567">"Janek, hide me.</span> <span id="s1568">Please."</span> <span id="s1569">"Yah, sure, of course, Toivi.</span> <span id="s1570">Go into the barn.</span> <span id="s1571">Fast."</span> <span id="s1572">So I went to the barn.</span> <span id="s1573">And he went...and he left.</span> <span id="s1574">Well, I got to the barn.</span> <span id="s1575">There's a padlock.</span> <span id="s1576">I can't go in.</span> <span id="s1577">So I start to look for a place to go in, and there's a Polish Christian woman asked...yelling, "Tom!</span> <span id="s1578">Over here!</span> <span id="s1579">Run away!</span> <span id="s1580">Run away!"</span> <span id="s1581">So I asked, "Why shall I run away?"</span> <span id="s1582">"Because he's coming...coming."</span> <span id="s1583">"Who's coming?" "</span> <span id="s1584">[Knopczik."</span> <span id="s1585">So Knopczik will come.</span> <span id="s1586">He will open the...the...the padlock.</span> <span id="s1587">And I didn't run away.</span> <span id="s1588">And here's Knopczik coming with a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1589">"Take him.</span> <span id="s1590">He's a Jew."</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">02:58:24</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Stop.</span> <span id="s1593">Perfect.</span> <span id="s1594">Let's change tapes very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">TAPE #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">03:00:27</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1598">We are ready.</span> <span id="s1599">A: So where am I.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: Alright, you had just been...</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: So he had... so he said...so he said to this Nazi, "Take him.</span> <span id="s1602">He's a Jew."</span> <span id="s1603">So I said, "Janek!</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">You're mistaken!</span> <span id="s1605">He's joking."</span> <span id="s1606">"No, he's a Jew."</span> <span id="s1607">So, and the Nazi said, "Come."</span> <span id="s1608">So Janek Knopczik also said, "So, okay, I will see you in a shelf in a soap store."</span> <span id="s1609">Because there were rumors they are make soap from...from Jews.</span> <span id="s1610">So his goodbye was: "I will see you in a shelf in a soap store."</span> <span id="s1611">Okay, and I left and to make it short, I can't tell you more because there's still some going on; but finally, I find myself with the rest of the Jews on the marketplace surrounded by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1612">There was a woman I remember.</span> <span id="s1613">While we were sitting on the marketplace, on the cobblestones, there was a woman crying and running from one Ukrainian to another one.</span> <span id="s1614">"I am not a Jew.</span> <span id="s1615">I am not a Jew.</span> <span id="s1616">I am not guilty.</span> <span id="s1617">Please, I'm a Christian lady.</span> <span id="s1618">I'm not a Jew.</span> <span id="s1619">Is I'm not guilty at all."</span> <span id="s1620">And they let her out.</span> <span id="s1621">She was a mistake.</span> <span id="s1622">They grabbed her, too.</span> <span id="s1623">So she was not guilty being a Jew.</span> <span id="s1624">I remember my school teacher, Steidel (ph).</span> <span id="s1625">Very fine Pole.</span> <span id="s1626">He...he was there, the head of the school.</span> <span id="s1627">I remember while I was sitting on the cobblestones, I remember him walking...uh...uh...on the sidewalk, and he didn't want to look at us.</span> <span id="s1628">And I felt...I still don't know why, this a little thing.</span> <span id="s1629">So many other things to remember and I remember him.</span> <span id="s1630">I remember his face.</span> <span id="s1631">I remember he was feeling for us.</span> <span id="s1632">When another Pole did stare at us.</span> <span id="s1633">Talking ...he did walk by like we didn't exist, and his head turned away.</span> <span id="s1634">And I remember this picture.</span> <span id="s1635">And I remember it was a beautiful April day, April 28, and I was sure I will die.</span> <span id="s1636">Finally, two trucks arrived.</span> <span id="s1637">They told us to step in.</span> <span id="s1638">We went in the trucks.</span> <span id="s1639">The trucks were covered with canvas.</span> <span id="s1640">It was dark inside, and the trucks started eastward and now there's hope.</span> <span id="s1641">Maybe, it's not so evil because in the road from Izbica, there's two concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1642">There's Trawniki [NB: labor camp for Jews, subcamp of Lublin].</span> <span id="s1643">There's Zawada [NB: labor camp for Jews] .</span> <span id="s1644">We passed the turn off to Zawada and our hope is down.</span> <span id="s1645">People are praying.</span> <span id="s1646">They passed the turn off to Trawniki, and now we know in front of us is Sobibór, and we know what Sobibór is.</span> <span id="s1647">And some people...and everything is in the dark...uh....uh... in the truck.</span> <span id="s1648">It's dark.</span> <span id="s1649">And I hear voices, "Let fight.</span> <span id="s1650">We will die anyway."</span> <span id="s1651">I know the voices.</span> <span id="s1652">"No, we will die anyway.</span> <span id="s1653">Let's die together with the families."</span> <span id="s1654">But they mood is that we will...when we stop, we will throw ourselves on the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1655">Finally, the truck stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">03:03:41 And I remember still a voice.</span> <span id="s1657">Somebody cut the...I remember still while driving... my... my...in fact, my father's face...he was sweating terrible.</span> <span id="s1658">I remember wiping my father's...wet forehead.</span> <span id="s1659">It's wasn't completely dark.</span> <span id="s1660">It was still...from the front some light coming.</span> <span id="s1661">And I remember the voice, and finally the truck stopped....stopped and I hear a voice.</span> <span id="s1662">Somebody cut open the canvas and noticed...looked outside that and said, "Ist schwarz von Ukrainen."</span> <span id="s1663">"It's black from Ukrainians."</span> <span id="s1664">Now this meant Ukrainians...the Nazis...they walked with...because they walked with nothing...they had black uniforms.</span> <span id="s1665">When he said, "It's black," he meant it was so many of them.</span> <span id="s1666">It's no use.</span> <span id="s1667">And he told us to go down.</span> <span id="s1668">And we go down and really, there were many Nazis.</span> <span id="s1669">We were surrounded very tight with machine guns and everything.</span> <span id="s1670">Probably the Nazis did...had experience.</span> <span id="s1671">They did know that this a crucial time when people coming and seeing there in front of Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1672">So we stood up.</span> <span id="s1673">We get out and we stood in front of the gate.</span> <span id="s1674">What did I see?</span> <span id="s1675">I see a big fence camouflaged by pine branches, braided in...in the barbed wires, and a gate.</span> <span id="s1676">On top of the gate a big sign, black and white, "SS Sonderkommando."</span> <span id="s1677">"Sonderkommando" meant special command.</span> <span id="s1678">The gate opened.</span> <span id="s1679">We go in.</span> <span id="s1680">They told us to go in.</span> <span id="s1681">I go in, and I can't believe it.</span> <span id="s1682">I..</span> <span id="s1683">.</span> <span id="s1684">my dreams and my nightmares...what I had about Sobibór...I imagined Sobibór's a Hell.</span> <span id="s1685">Belzec's a Hell.</span> <span id="s1686">Sobibór a Hell.</span> <span id="s1687">It looked like a Hell.</span> <span id="s1688">And how's a Hell?</span> <span id="s1689">I have it from my...my aunt's descript...descriptions.</span> <span id="s1690">Dark, and people running around with tar and with whatever.</span> <span id="s1691">It's miserable.</span> <span id="s1692">What did I see?</span> <span id="s1693">A beautiful, little place.</span> <span id="s1694">Lawns, beautiful flowers.</span> <span id="s1695">A nice train station.</span> <span id="s1696">Nice little houses.</span> <span id="s1697">"Schwalbennest" was the title of one house.</span> <span id="s1698">It means...uh...uh... "Schwalbennest" [Translation: "Swallows'Nest]...uh...how is it in English?</span> <span id="s1699">Anyway, and...uh...they told us to stop; and I think, "This can't be a death camp.</span> <span id="s1700">How could such a place be a death camp?"</span> <span id="s1701">Birds are whistling.</span> <span id="s1702">Nice trees.</span> <span id="s1703">I still will remember the shape of the...of the sky...of the...uh....(pause) Oh, what is in the sky?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">03:06:26</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: The clouds?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: The clouds!</span> <span id="s1707">And I didn't want to die.</span> <span id="s1708">But I've seen the fire.</span> <span id="s1709">From...there was far away, farther, there was a..</span> <span id="s1710">.</span> <span id="s1711">where they burned the people.</span> <span id="s1712">I've seen the fire from behind...was again a fence camouflaged.</span> <span id="s1713">And I could feel the smell.</span> <span id="s1714">And I thought and strange enough, I wasn't afraid of dying.</span> <span id="s1715">I was afraid of being burned.</span> <span id="s1716">And...uh...suddenly a voice, "Men right, woman, children should go left."</span> <span id="s1717">And then I was always now with my mother when we went down from the...from the truck.</span> <span id="s1718">And that age when you are 15, you could pretend to be a..</span> <span id="s1719">.</span> <span id="s1720">a child or you could be a man already.</span> <span id="s1721">But instinctively I felt it's better to be with men, so I kissed my mother goodbye.</span> <span id="s1722">I said a few foolish words.</span> <span id="s1723">[I still regret it, trying to figure out why did I say it?]</span> <span id="s1724">It's still bothering me.</span> <span id="s1725">I will tell you.</span> <span id="s1726">I said, "And you didn't want....you didn't let me drink the milk yesterday."</span> <span id="s1727">And she said, "That what you have to say in that minute?"</span> <span id="s1728">And this is bothering my whole life.</span> <span id="s1729">Why is it...?</span> <span id="s1730">You see a day before, we had a little wooden... uh... box with ice, and the milk was over there.</span> <span id="s1731">So I opened...I was first opened, I start to drink the milk.</span> <span id="s1732">And my mother opened the door from the room.</span> <span id="s1733">She said, "Leave it for tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1734">Don't drink everything."</span> <span id="s1735">And...and now I..</span> <span id="s1736">.</span> <span id="s1737">in this moment, I did come back to it and said such a foolish thing which is still bothering me, and left to mine father and mine little brother left to my mother.</span> <span id="s1738">We did cross each other.</span> <span id="s1739">(Sigh) (Long Pause) (sigh) Now (sigh) the German...when everybody went to their way, the German Frenzel [NB: Oberscharführer Karl Frenzel], with who I after the war I had a interview.</span> <span id="s1740">He told the woman and children go the direction of this fire.</span> <span id="s1741">He left.</span> <span id="s1742">And now he start to ask the men who's a carpenter.</span> <span id="s1743">Who's a mechanic?</span> <span id="s1744">And I was no mechanic.</span> <span id="s1745">What could a 15 year old boy be?</span> <span id="s1746">But I did want to live so much.</span> <span id="s1747">And wherever the Nazi moved, my eyes went after him.</span> <span id="s1748">And I really believe...(quavering) I really believe that...uh...my strong...I believe that people could be influenced, that something is between people, some interaction.</span> <span id="s1749">You don't need to say it.</span> <span id="s1750">And I felt that actually I influenced the German.</span> <span id="s1751">When he was moving back and forth and our eyes met and my strong will said, "Please take me inside."</span> <span id="s1752">He stopped, looked at me, and said, "Come out."</span> <span id="s1753">...the Ukrainer.</span> <span id="s1754">I should come out.</span> <span id="s1755">And I still believe this was my strong will.</span> <span id="s1756">I..</span> <span id="s1757">.</span> <span id="s1758">something was which emitted from me to him.</span> <span id="s1759">I still really truly believe.</span> <span id="s1760">And...uh...he told me to go out.</span> <span id="s1761">My father did want to go out.</span> <span id="s1762">He beat him, and later when he assembled about 40 people, he told the rest to go in the same way that woman and they left.</span> <span id="s1763">In this way I started to work in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1764">Now Sobibór story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">03:10:13 When they made a film, "Escape from Sobibór," and I was a consultant, I was accused even by people knowing the history of the Holocaust ... even in Poland by Poles...I wonder how should survive in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1766">A Buchenwald survivor told me, "What a horrible film.</span> <span id="s1767">A typical horrible film.</span> <span id="s1768">Look, the prisoners are going with the woman.</span> <span id="s1769">Take a look how they look like.</span> <span id="s1770">We know how prisoner in a concentration camp did look like.</span> <span id="s1771">Skinny, emaci... uh.</span> <span id="s1772">.</span> <span id="s1773">worn out.</span> <span id="s1774">Take a look there here how they look.</span> <span id="s1775">It's...it's not a true picture of a..</span> <span id="s1776">.</span> <span id="s1777">a Nazi camp."</span> <span id="s1778">Unfortunately, it was.</span> <span id="s1779">There's a difference between a concentration camp and extermination camp.</span> <span id="s1780">I don't want to go in anymore.</span> <span id="s1781">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Just tell us where you were.</span> <span id="s1783">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: Don't worry about the film.</span> <span id="s1785">Don't worry about...</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1787">That...that what I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s1788">So I remember I lay down.</span> <span id="s1789">It was...in the barracks, there was a fellow called Josel (ph).</span> <span id="s1790">He did come write down my name, everybody's name, and told me to pick a place to sleep.</span> <span id="s1791">From...all the...the three lines are free for you.</span> <span id="s1792">I didn't know that the day before they killed 72 Dutch Jews because they did try... supposedly try to escape.</span> <span id="s1793">So I immediately picked on the third floor right in the corner far away from the door.</span> <span id="s1794">And ...uh...soon as I put away...I had a little bit in the hand which I took from the home.</span> <span id="s1795">I don't know what I had...a piece of bread or whatever, I put it away in my place.</span> <span id="s1796">I did lay down for a minute.</span> <span id="s1797">Later I did go out to the yard.</span> <span id="s1798">And I didn't know what it was, but my whole feelings about my family, I just lost them... they were probably burning in that time.</span> <span id="s1799">I didn't think.</span> <span id="s1800">I didn't think at all.</span> <span id="s1801">I didn't think about mine parents or myself, later; about my family until the end I was in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1802">Maybe this was from the nature some kind of shield, but I didn't.</span> <span id="s1803">Must admit.</span> <span id="s1804">I didn't see anybody cry in Sobibór either.</span> <span id="s1805">It was a different...people changed, with changed.</span> <span id="s1806">Everything changed.</span> <span id="s1807">Go out.</span> <span id="s1808">Try to look.</span> <span id="s1809">They have singing.</span> <span id="s1810">Sobibór, singing.</span> <span id="s1811">Happy songs.</span> <span id="s1812">Gate opens, and there're groups of people marching in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Young people.</span> <span id="s1814">Good dressed.</span> <span id="s1815">Then again in front of them, I find out later it was a Kapo--a man dressed better with a big whip--and he commanded "Abteilung, Halt!"</span> <span id="s1816">which means "stop."</span> <span id="s1817">Everything was in military fashion, and later they dispersed.</span> <span id="s1818">While looking around I hear a voice, "Toivi."</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">03:13:22 Turn around and this was [Jussik Bressler (ph)] from Ko_o, my friend, who was caught a year earlier.</span> <span id="s1820">Now I have a friend.</span> <span id="s1821">He was taken out as a dentist, not here but last Aktion from Izbica when they took.</span> <span id="s1822">It was...uh...half a year earlier.</span> <span id="s1823">And I go with him and he tells me about Sobibór and later, we go behind the tailors' shop and there's a group of Jews playing their harmonica and playing the fiddle.</span> <span id="s1824">And I'm shocked I hear music.</span> <span id="s1825">"How could you play here in this place?</span> <span id="s1826">Take a look at the fire."</span> <span id="s1827">They said, "Tom, we are dead anyway.</span> <span id="s1828">You know how they...they call...the Germans are calling us here? '</span> <span id="s1829">[Nassersecker (ph)].'" "</span> <span id="s1830">[Nassersecker (ph)]"--"bed bugs."</span> <span id="s1831">"You're only a bed bug.</span> <span id="s1832">And...uh...we will be dead anyway so you will get used to it, you see?</span> <span id="s1833">Fires burning, you don't cry even now.</span> <span id="s1834">You see, your parents are burning over there."</span> <span id="s1835">Yah.</span> <span id="s1836">Different people.</span> <span id="s1837">You wouldn't wonder.</span> <span id="s1838">Some of the first day maybe.</span> <span id="s1839">And I didn't wonder later what I was seeing...the...it was couples, even Sobibór, uh... girls and men connecting.</span> <span id="s1840">As a matter fact, one...one couple lives here not far from Washington...survived both together.</span> <span id="s1841">And...uh... this way I started to work.</span> <span id="s1842">This...uh... The same night in the morning, about 2 o'clock I hear a whistle.</span> <span id="s1843">"Everybody out.</span> <span id="s1844">Everybody out."</span> <span id="s1845">I go out with another people from the barrack because they're yelling...the kapos with whips.</span> <span id="s1846">They're chasing out, we go out.</span> <span id="s1847">It's a night.</span> <span id="s1848">Stars.</span> <span id="s1849">The moon, night.</span> <span id="s1850">And I hear something, "Friseurs, here!"</span> <span id="s1851">"Friseurs" means like barbers [Translation: "Hairdressers"].</span> <span id="s1852">And the...as a group they call themselves "Friseurs."</span> <span id="s1853">And later they call a group "Gepäckenträgers" [Translation: "Porters"].</span> <span id="s1854">The kapo called.</span> <span id="s1855">I see another group goes to another place, assembles.</span> <span id="s1856">The kapo looks at me.</span> <span id="s1857">"Go to the Gepäckenträgers," because I didn't know where I should go.</span> <span id="s1858">So I go to the Gepäckenträgers, the people carrying luggage back.</span> <span id="s1859">They called them "Gepäckenträgers" in German.</span> <span id="s1860">And now...and the rest...well went back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1861">Well, later they led us...they led the barbers, the Friseurs so-called, someplace else and my group is led to a big, huge barrack with two gates, entrance gate and an exit gate.</span> <span id="s1862">The gates are open and while we're waiting inside with other boys.</span> <span id="s1863">I was told to call in Dutch where the handbags should be left.</span> <span id="s1864">And here people start to come in.</span> <span id="s1865">Very well dressed.</span> <span id="s1866">There was...uh...uh....uh...a transport from Holland.</span> <span id="s1867">And they didn't know where they are coming.</span> <span id="s1868">They did come in passenger trains, and no idea.</span> <span id="s1869">And they left the big luggage on the train station, being sure that they will be delivered.</span> <span id="s1870">And now the handbags.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">But here I notice some kind...that they had a strange feeling, because a woman...what does a woman have in her handbag?</span> <span id="s1872">Most precious things.</span> <span id="s1873">She hate to part, and now they tell her to part with this.</span> <span id="s1874">But there was a German immediately.</span> <span id="s1875">She resisted, she was beaten.</span> <span id="s1876">And one person said...have seen she was beaten, volunteered to give up the handbags and they led them out to the exit gate, and later they went to a yard where they were told to undress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">03:16:58 And we...our group was still waiting in this barrack, even when the people went through.</span> <span id="s1878">But five minutes later, the Nazi calls us to the yard where the people undressed.</span> <span id="s1879">Were undressed, but now there's no people; but heaps of clothing.</span> <span id="s1880">They told us...the Nazi tell us to...told us to pick up the clothing and take it to the storeroom.</span> <span id="s1881">So I picked up the clothing, took it to the storeroom.</span> <span id="s1882">It was a special storeroom.</span> <span id="s1883">And now another transport, another group is coming ...another 500 people.</span> <span id="s1884">So I must run again to the first barrack.</span> <span id="s1885">Take the handbags, and later again to this.</span> <span id="s1886">And later when the whole transport went through, the SS Frenzel told...took a few of us...need to, "Now, come with me."</span> <span id="s1887">He led us about five meters from the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1888">It was a barrack where woman were coming in to cut the hair.</span> <span id="s1889">He...he did give us those scissors to help another one to finish up cutting the hair.</span> <span id="s1890">I didn't know how...first of all, I never seen a woman nude.</span> <span id="s1891">I was...even that situation, I was very ashamed.</span> <span id="s1892">I didn't want to look.</span> <span id="s1893">I looked down, but I did get once a whipped so I picked up my head and took the...the shears and he told me I don't need to cut close.</span> <span id="s1894">Just...uh...uh...If I have somebody has a pigtail, cut the pigtails off.</span> <span id="s1895">And there they was suspicious because the Germans told them, when they undressed before the Germans told them that they are going for a sanitary reasons to a barber to...to..., but...uh...some suspicion.</span> <span id="s1896">But still they didn't think they were killed.</span> <span id="s1897">As a matter of fact, I am sure when they were in the gas chambers they didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1898">When the first gas did come in, probably they didn't...under...understood what's happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">After I finished cutting the hair, they told us to go out, and...uh...while I was still on the way back to my...to ...to the camp, the barracks, I heard already the motor, the gas motor working with a high....</span> <span id="s1900">You know, at that time, the gas motor...they screamed.</span> <span id="s1901">They started...they started very loud like "Ahhhh....," even louder than the motor.</span> <span id="s1902">They had a big motor there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Later about 15 minutes down...down and until quiet was.</span> <span id="s1904">This was Sobibór.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">03:19:17 I was working over there for 6 months.</span> <span id="s1906">I could...I could tell the story of...uh... one ... one escape and another one.</span> <span id="s1907">It will drag on too long.</span> <span id="s1908">Because while over there, I..</span> <span id="s1909">.</span> <span id="s1910">I survived a execution.</span> <span id="s1911">Two people escaped and the barbed wires were cut, and the kapos immediately notified the Germans and the Germans did come and Frenzel made immediately a roll call and he picked up every 10[th] person to be executed.</span> <span id="s1912">So this was story.</span> <span id="s1913">I could go on, so let's stop here.</span> <span id="s1914">I went through this.</span> <span id="s1915">Later a group working so-called "Wald"..."Waldkommando," working outside the camp cutting wood for the pyre, for the cremation.</span> <span id="s1916">They escaped.</span> <span id="s1917">They made a revolt.</span> <span id="s1918">And...uh...later...uh...they caught a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1919">They brought them back, and I was witnessing their execution.</span> <span id="s1920">Things like that which I could talk a whole day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">But I will go now to the revolt.</span> <span id="s1922">Or a little bit about myself.</span> <span id="s1923">Being in Sobibór, I always did want to escape.</span> <span id="s1924">And I..</span> <span id="s1925">.</span> <span id="s1926">for...for some strange reason, I always felt I will survive.</span> <span id="s1927">I had always something in me that I will survive.</span> <span id="s1928">But I was looking.</span> <span id="s1929">Once they did need people to go to W_odawa to take apart some bakeries.</span> <span id="s1930">They did need fireproof bricks.</span> <span id="s1931">So the...the Germans asked for volunteers.</span> <span id="s1932">Who wants to go?</span> <span id="s1933">So I did go.</span> <span id="s1934">Thinking that maybe in W_odawa I will be able to run away.</span> <span id="s1935">But W_odawa was a situation that even the fellow prisoners did...did watch me because they did know if I escape or anybody else escape, they would be killed.</span> <span id="s1936">So one watched another one.</span> <span id="s1937">We weren't able...but what's happened over there...there were about 150 Jewish girls working in the ghetto, sorting some stuff.</span> <span id="s1938">You could see them from far away.</span> <span id="s1939">And while working, when we were able to get closer to them, we showed them that we are hiding money for them.</span> <span id="s1940">So we...we have done it for about week, leaving money in the ruins of the ghetto to help the...the W_odawa girls.</span> <span id="s1941">Nevertheless, most of them were later brought to Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1942">This didn't help.</span> <span id="s1943">Later was the...the barrack...Waldkommander thought maybe I could work over there.</span> <span id="s1944">In the beginning, it was very nice because I had a method.</span> <span id="s1945">I noticed that the Germans like clean people.</span> <span id="s1946">They like people going straight fast.</span> <span id="s1947">The moment you see a run.</span> <span id="s1948">.</span> <span id="s1949">rundown Jews, broken-down Jew, they killing him.</span> <span id="s1950">So always I kept myself clean.</span> <span id="s1951">I put even my pants under me when I slept.</span> <span id="s1952">They should be ironed with my body, straight.</span> <span id="s1953">I didn't need to do this too because clothing, I could go any day change shoes or shirts or... because I was working sorting, and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1954">But I always looked a open area.</span> <span id="s1955">So I did go to work for the Waldkommando.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">03:22:39 The foreman...the Kapo, was a good acquaintance of mine, and I asked him and he said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s1957">You could come me."</span> <span id="s1958">We cut the wood.</span> <span id="s1959">Later, ...uh...they're building a road over there.</span> <span id="s1960">And the German noticed me, Dachsler (ph), old German.</span> <span id="s1961">And he said, "Listen, Kleiner, take a..</span> <span id="s1962">.</span> <span id="s1963">take this group of people and go cut straight trees because we need it for the road to put on top."</span> <span id="s1964">So I had a group of people and...uh...and this was a good place to work because this German didn't beat.</span> <span id="s1965">So anyway, going farther...so my way of surviving was stay away from the German.</span> <span id="s1966">If you sleep in the barrack, take a..</span> <span id="s1967">.</span> <span id="s1968">a..</span> <span id="s1969">.</span> <span id="s1970">a..</span> <span id="s1971">.</span> <span id="s1972">a..</span> <span id="s1973">.</span> <span id="s1974">place far away from the entrance door, right in the corner, on the top floor even if you need to crawl...to...to it's difficult to get up, do it.</span> <span id="s1975">Keep yourself clean.</span> <span id="s1976">Keep yourself straight.</span> <span id="s1977">You see a German, go somewhere.</span> <span id="s1978">And...uh...and...uh... a lot of miracles.</span> <span id="s1979">And this way I was existing Sobibór.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Uh...What also it was, I made a deal with a guy who sorted luggage.</span> <span id="s1981">Because you sort luggage, you could make labyrinths.</span> <span id="s1982">And I was sorting food.</span> <span id="s1983">So I told him, "Listen, I bring you some food.</span> <span id="s1984">You let me rest in your labyrinth to eat."</span> <span id="s1985">So I was ...uh...taking a few canned food to him, and I was eating; and later he was happy and I was happy because I was always tired and sleepy.</span> <span id="s1986">Over there was a chance.</span> <span id="s1987">I will skip little stories like this, but why I mention about this guy because he will come up again.</span> <span id="s1988">Once in the middle of the night, my friend shaking, "Tom.</span> <span id="s1989">Listen.</span> <span id="s1990">Listen.</span> <span id="s1991">What's happened?"</span> <span id="s1992">What's happened, he...he had a big barrack.</span> <span id="s1993">And the one part was...uh...uh...sectioned off for the kapos.</span> <span id="s1994">And the door was open, and I heard some talking inside, so I did get up.</span> <span id="s1995">I've seen something is going on, and I did go to my friend in the [bank (ph)] kommando.</span> <span id="s1996">And I go to him, and it was dark in the barrack because what I know in which bunk he is, and I tell him, "Listen, Shmu[el], Hear what's going on?</span> <span id="s1997">Something...something is happening here."</span> <span id="s1998">So instead to answer me, he hit me in my face with a..</span> <span id="s1999">.</span> <span id="s2000">with something...some kind of metal, I know.</span> <span id="s2001">So I thought "If he knows and he doesn't care, it's okay."</span> <span id="s2002">So the next day there were rumors that the Kapos did plan to escape, but more people find out and they did...uh...want to go too.</span> <span id="s2003">Anyway, I told you.</span> <span id="s2004">But again, by working...in that time I used to sort clothing...uh...I've seen the whole Kapos, a whole group of kapos being taken to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s2005">So I was wondering what's happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">But again, a little bit later, I see this Berliner, the guy who used to...uh...the Lager, he used to sort luggage, has the uniform of the head Kapo, and did become the head Kapo and it was obvious that he did betray the action.</span> <span id="s2007">But to make it short again, we killed him later.</span> <span id="s2008">Before we made the revolt.</span> <span id="s2009">He was...uh...killed by...uh... prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">03:25:51</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: Tell us about the revolt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2013">Now, the situation was, of course, we were sure we will die.</span> <span id="s2014">When...uh...even if the...the war would stop right now and then the concentration camp could be free, we will be killed.</span> <span id="s2015">So this was a terrible feeling, there's no way out for us.</span> <span id="s2016">Everybody did want to escape.</span> <span id="s2017">I think that whatever I was thinking to run away always, everybody had in his mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Although some people were resigned.</span> <span id="s2019">They were Orthodox Jews, which nevertheless, even with this terrible situation did pray.</span> <span id="s2020">I remember Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s2021">And they did fast, and they did say all the prayers and...uh...they were very observant Jews, and they still had their trust in God and their tradition everything else.</span> <span id="s2022">Now, there always was...I wouldn't say organization...there were a few people, influenced people in Sobibór...respected people.</span> <span id="s2023">It was a Hazzan, I remember.</span> <span id="s2024">I don't remember his name.</span> <span id="s2025">And was Leon Feldhandler.</span> <span id="s2026">His father was a Rabbi and he was...actually he was a member of the Judenrat in Zolkiewka, in this town.</span> <span id="s2027">And there were some talks...talks about the revolt.</span> <span id="s2028">I was close to Feldhandler because he was a friend of my father in Izbica.</span> <span id="s2029">He was in Izbica ghetto.</span> <span id="s2030">He was taken to Sobibór from Izbica ghetto in the time when I escaped to...to Stryy, and they caught me in jail.</span> <span id="s2031">But it wasn't until a transport from the Soviet Union arrived.</span> <span id="s2032">When the Eastern Front was coming nearer, the Germans eliminated the ghettos, Minsk and so on.</span> <span id="s2033">And that time they took all the Jews from Minsk, and from Lida and they brought them to Sobibór.</span> <span id="s2034">I mean not all of them.</span> <span id="s2035">A lot were killed on the spot, but a lot of...some transports come to Sobibór.</span> <span id="s2036">And in that...in this particular transport they included quite a few Jewish prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s2037">Soviet prisoners of war, Jewish.</span> <span id="s2038">Because they recognized as a Jew.</span> <span id="s2039">In that time we had a lot of work and the Germans picked up another 80 people to help us from this particular transport from Minsk.</span> <span id="s2040">Unfortunately, for them they picked up a few former POWs trained in the art of fighting.</span> <span id="s2041">Former soldiers.</span> <span id="s2042">And they picked up a man called Pechersky.</span> <span id="s2043">He was a officer in the Soviet Army, and ...to work with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">03:28:38 Pretty soon, Leon Feldhandler recognized this potential material and he contacted, Leon Feldhandler, and Leon Feldhandler contacted Sasha Pechersky and...uh...again, I don't want to dwell much on it, they formed a organization.</span> <span id="s2045">From that time on some concrete things happened.</span> <span id="s2046">I find out about a week before about the revolt.</span> <span id="s2047">Uh...That time I was working as a Feuermann.</span> <span id="s2048">How did I come to be...to get this job?</span> <span id="s2049">Feuermann is like firemeister...master.</span> <span id="s2050">All the documents, heaps of documents, passports, pictures, books, soiled clothing was burned.</span> <span id="s2051">While they were burning it, when I was sorting, I put the papers in a big blanket.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Later with the blanket was still full, I put it on my shoulder and take it to the fire.</span> <span id="s2053">Taking it to the fire, I started to get familiar with the guy working over there.</span> <span id="s2054">Did bring him some food.</span> <span id="s2055">And slowly by slowly, I start to helping him; and later, when they built a bigger oven, I was working over there as a steady personnel.</span> <span id="s2056">My idea was to work in a..</span> <span id="s2057">.</span> <span id="s2058">to be enclosed, out of the view from the Germans.</span> <span id="s2059">I could see them.</span> <span id="s2060">They can't see me.</span> <span id="s2061">From the window, I was able to see.</span> <span id="s2062">But once I wasn't able and there was a terrible beating.</span> <span id="s2063">But anyway, so...they planned to kill a German in my place.</span> <span id="s2064">So this way...but I did need to be contacted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Otherwise, I would...some stranger comes into this place, I would chase him out, being afraid myself.</span> <span id="s2066">So he calls me in the evening and tells me, "Toivi, I must tell you something.</span> <span id="s2067">I know you.</span> <span id="s2068">I know your father.</span> <span id="s2069">I will tell you something, but keep your mouth shut.</span> <span id="s2070">We need your place to kill a German."</span> <span id="s2071">I was shocked.</span> <span id="s2072">Later, I find out about what's happened.</span> <span id="s2073">And I was informed on the purpose.</span> <span id="s2074">I..</span> <span id="s2075">.</span> <span id="s2076">I understood that something is going on, and I was informed about Sasha.</span> <span id="s2077">Especially I was a guy...I was a guy in Sobibór which always did run around.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">You know, I didn't keep in a place.</span> <span id="s2079">I was always hyper and would just run.</span> <span id="s2080">I did want to know everything like I would be...go out and I'd write book, which I've done, actually.</span> <span id="s2081">(laughing) I was always a very...boy who...I want to know everything.</span> <span id="s2082">So in this way I did become, I was involved in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">03:31:42 So I know the first plan was...there were different plans.</span> <span id="s2084">The first plan was to dig a tunnel from the blacksmith shop through the barbed wires to outside.</span> <span id="s2085">But when they analyzed it, it's did come out that we need to work many, many days, nights to dispose of this very dangerous dispose of the soil.</span> <span id="s2086">They need to find a way.</span> <span id="s2087">And when...let's assume everything is okay.</span> <span id="s2088">Six hundred people should go through the tunnel single file without quarrel will take a whole night.</span> <span id="s2089">Isn't practical.</span> <span id="s2090">They threw it away.</span> <span id="s2091">The next one was to poison...to kill all the Nazis while they're in bed, because there was a group of young kids like me, they called "putzers," which each morning 4 o'clock they're allowed to go out from the barrack to go to the Germans and while they are in the bed, clean their shoes, clean their belts and so on.</span> <span id="s2092">This time to smuggle in instead a such a young boy should go a little bit older, at night and kill in bed and get their weapons.</span> <span id="s2093">But they did...they discon...they disregarded because they didn't...they weren't able to depend on young people doing such an important job.</span> <span id="s2094">Anyway, a plan was accepted...the final plan, to kill all the Germans in a matter of one hour, between four and five.</span> <span id="s2095">We based our success on the German punctuality...punctuality.</span> <span id="s2096">Discipline.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">And the plan was that the heads of the workshops because besides the people working in conjunction of the extermination, there were workshops.</span> <span id="s2098">Tailors, shoemakers working for the Germans only, because there was...so much... they had a labor force.</span> <span id="s2099">Why not?</span> <span id="s2100">So they established a few small workshops for themselves.</span> <span id="s2101">And always a German have something...made something for himself, a uniform or shoes; or the...heads of the shop should make appointments with the Germans to come on that particular day, October 13, for appointments between 4 and 5 o'clock.</span> <span id="s2102">And over there there would be some people which will... which will kill them.</span> <span id="s2103">So I know about this plan.</span> <span id="s2104">And this should happen between 4 and 5, and the whole lager should look normal.</span> <span id="s2105">We should not...we should not use the weapons which we get when we kill Germans so not to...before the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">03:34:07 I remember I was in that time waiting and mine fire place...in mine place...where I burned ...where the oven was.</span> <span id="s2107">I pushed all these papers against the window so nobody should be able to look in because in, because in the sides when did people did bring me documents, papers, we threw in in the sides, and the the oven was in the middle, and I just later burn it.</span> <span id="s2108">So anyway was a window so I blocked the window and was waiting.</span> <span id="s2109">And.</span> <span id="s2110">.</span> <span id="s2111">uh...now I see a group...uh ... because they were divided.</span> <span id="s2112">The organization had about six fighting groups of three people and located in different places in the camp waiting for the Germans to be lured over there.</span> <span id="s2113">So I see the group is supposed to come to mine place coming to my direction, to my oven, but they're passing me.</span> <span id="s2114">They're going in a different way.</span> <span id="s2115">So I was panicky, but pretty soon a Jew called....from _ód_, Sender, comes to me and said, "Tom, they decide not to do anything to your place because the guard...the tower guard was very close."</span> <span id="s2116">I was very close to the fence and he could notice a German comes in, doesn't go out and could be suspicious.</span> <span id="s2117">"We rather...we'll kill him in the men's storeroom."</span> <span id="s2118">Then he told me to go over there, and over there my job in that time was to stay guard on the...on the gate leading...connecting Lager l and Lager 2, because also we was connected...was divided in so- called four lagers, like l, 2, 3 and 4.</span> <span id="s2119">In Lager 1 were the building where they used to sleep and these workshop.</span> <span id="s2120">Lager 2 we sorted, and Lager 3 we did burn, and Lager 4, we were building something over there.</span> <span id="s2121">So anyway I was suppose to stay guard and because this gate was very close to the storeroom I just seen them both coming in.</span> <span id="s2122">He was called in.</span> <span id="s2123">.</span> <span id="s2124">in to try on a leather jacket, because it exactly his size.</span> <span id="s2125">And he did go in and suspected nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">While he put his hands in this...now this I haven't seen.</span> <span id="s2127">This...the moment he was killed, he did come out...the guy which I know and he told me that while he was coming in, the Jewish prisoner said, "Achtung!"</span> <span id="s2128">immediately.</span> <span id="s2129">"Attention."</span> <span id="s2130">And start attention, took this leather jacket and he immediately...he hold it for him and while he put in the hands in the leather jacket, his arms very immobilized like....like in a straight jacket, and he was killed with an ax and we had a first gun.</span> <span id="s2131">I was scared up to that point.</span> <span id="s2132">I remember when he was killed and the guy who killed him did come out.</span> <span id="s2133">He's a little bit blood on his shoe.</span> <span id="s2134">He patted his pocket like to say, the gun is here.</span> <span id="s2135">I..</span> <span id="s2136">.</span> <span id="s2137">my whole ...I wasn't scared any more.</span> <span id="s2138">I did want only to know what will happen to me a half an hour later.</span> <span id="s2139">That I did want to know.</span> <span id="s2140">And I..</span> <span id="s2141">.</span> <span id="s2142">I..</span> <span id="s2143">.</span> <span id="s2144">I did know there's no way back.</span> <span id="s2145">This is it.</span> <span id="s2146">They killed...as long as we didn't kill the German, everything could be....</span> <span id="s2147">And later they called Beckman, and Beckman I remember he went to...to the door over the barrack and like whatever feeling he did turn around and went back and they killed him anyway in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">03:37:24 And to make a long story...and I..</span> <span id="s2149">.</span> <span id="s2150">and I at that point, I remember there was a little train, like a miners train, for the miners.</span> <span id="s2151">Little wagons with a little electric engine.</span> <span id="s2152">And the German who was the head of this little train which connected all the Lagers with Lager 3, was already killed.</span> <span id="s2153">But inside I notice there's canned food.</span> <span id="s2154">So a few cans, put into my pocket.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">And I remember I had friend, Linda Karoten (ph), Linda .</span> <span id="s2156">And she said, "Tom, you're preparing like for a picnic."</span> <span id="s2157">And I said, "If we will survive we will need it."</span> <span id="s2158">And later I..</span> <span id="s2159">.</span> <span id="s2160">I..</span> <span id="s2161">.</span> <span id="s2162">I eat.</span> <span id="s2163">I ran in the forest.</span> <span id="s2164">I reminded him this, that he said I'm preparing like a picnic because we used it later.</span> <span id="s2165">We're so hungry and I had it.</span> <span id="s2166">Anyway, now I remember the foreman was a French Jew...Jacov Dunietz [NB: Joseph Dunietz], and the foreman from the group did come to me, "Tom, maybe you have some money?"</span> <span id="s2167">Because many times when I did burn in my oven the soiled clothing...when the clothing was burned or books, some money did come through in the ashes.</span> <span id="s2168">And when I cleaned the ashes, I find some gold always.</span> <span id="s2169">It did lose the luster, but it was not....</span> <span id="s2170">So...uh...he did know I could have it, so I did give him some money.</span> <span id="s2171">And the Germans were killed.</span> <span id="s2172">Nobody did know.</span> <span id="s2173">I was wondering that...this was like normal.</span> <span id="s2174">First of all the Kapos...the Kapos which were...there were two Kapos in the organization...and they were instructed to use the whip to beat us like everyday.</span> <span id="s2175">And they have done it.</span> <span id="s2176">And I remember like every day, singing.</span> <span id="s2177">We went back to Lager 1 for...uh...supper.</span> <span id="s2178">And now the biggest shock.</span> <span id="s2179">And this was I think was the...the most important ingredients of the success was so few people did know.</span> <span id="s2180">There were...we were about 600 people.</span> <span id="s2181">And this was the time before the roll call when we stand in line in front of the kitchen to eat.</span> <span id="s2182">Believe it or not, practically the whole camp was still like every day standing in the line.</span> <span id="s2183">Maybe about 50 people were missing, the people which did know.</span> <span id="s2184">But soon one told another one, "Listen, forget about supper.</span> <span id="s2185">Something is going on.</span> <span id="s2186">Let us grab an ax.</span> <span id="s2187">Grab anything and be prepared."</span> <span id="s2188">Now the dangerous moment did come because up 'til now...the...the Germans were free to go and come.</span> <span id="s2189">Each German has a place to watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">The sorters, where clothing was sorted, there was a German standing.</span> <span id="s2191">But he was allowed to go for a cup of coffee or whatever he want.</span> <span id="s2192">And another German ...let say...from the shoe sorters, the place they sorted shoes, did come by and he didn't notice the German who's suppose to be by sorting clothing.</span> <span id="s2193">He wasn't suspicious.</span> <span id="s2194">He thought, "Oh, maybe my friend went for a cup of coffee."</span> <span id="s2195">But now, 5:30.</span> <span id="s2196">Well, the...the time did come close when all the Germans supposed to be in this place, Lager Ein, to...they witnessed the roll call.</span> <span id="s2197">And now if a German is missing, they will look each other.</span> <span id="s2198">So we did know that the crucial time is coming and... uh...uh...the line in front of the kitchen start to...to dwindle and I remember a shot and I remember Sasha Pechersky jumping on a table.</span> <span id="s2199">And why I..</span> <span id="s2200">.</span> <span id="s2201">now...a one Kapo whistled a whistle, like for a..</span> <span id="s2202">.</span> <span id="s2203">like for a roll call.</span> <span id="s2204">Normal.</span> <span id="s2205">And made it a little bit earlier.</span> <span id="s2206">The original plan was actually to march...</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: Stick with what happened.</span> <span id="s2208">03:41:20</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s2210">The original plan was to march out to the front gate, but we heard a shot and the plan was disregarded to march out to the front gate because probably the...the guard wouldn't know what's happened and we could go too close, very close maybe to them also.</span> <span id="s2211">But I heard a shot, Sasha jumping on the table and he start to talk, "Listen."</span> <span id="s2212">Something in this sense.</span> <span id="s2213">"Listen to me."</span> <span id="s2214">I remember only one sentence from the whole talk.</span> <span id="s2215">It was very short.</span> <span id="s2216">"The time did come that we will take revenge.</span> <span id="s2217">We killed practical all the Germans.</span> <span id="s2218">Now let's stood up and fight our way out."</span> <span id="s2219">In this sense...but the sentence I remember exactly what he said was: "If someone, if you will survive, he should remember to told...to tell the world the story of Sobibór."</span> <span id="s2220">And that what I did never forget, and that what I am doing.</span> <span id="s2221">And suddenly...I don't know if this was arranged, prearranged or not, but while he was still talking somebody yelled, "Hoorah!"</span> <span id="s2222">from the people standing.</span> <span id="s2223">And another one picked up, "Hoorah!"</span> <span id="s2224">; and the third one, and suddenly everybody, "Hoorah, Hoorah," and start to run.</span> <span id="s2225">I didn't want to carry an ax, so I picked up a knife.</span> <span id="s2226">I prepared a knife from before.</span> <span id="s2227">It was easy to hide a knife.</span> <span id="s2228">Was a knife somebody probably from some...somebody brought us...to Sobibór maybe a rabbi or so...or so, because had pearl handles and the on.</span> <span id="s2229">.</span> <span id="s2230">on the handle was written Kusheshov Paisach (ph) [NB: Kosher for Pesach].</span> <span id="s2231">It's some kind traditional knife.</span> <span id="s2232">Was big, so I took it.</span> <span id="s2233">My knife in the hand and start to run with it and biggest group to the gate leading up to Lager l, and over there I remember one Ukrainian did come by accident...did start to drive in with his bike, and he was thrown immediately from his bike, and I remember the bell was cut immediately with the gun.</span> <span id="s2234">And while running through I know...I remember and on the left side, a Ukrainian guard with his rifle standing like that...like a..</span> <span id="s2235">.</span> <span id="s2236">like a fixiated and just turning around himself.</span> <span id="s2237">He could use the rifle and shot, but he was handling it like a stick, like somebody hold...hold a can...cane, and just turning around.</span> <span id="s2238">He didn't...he didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s2239">And I was running to go with the people to the front gate and half way I heard some whistles...shot was all the time, but I heard whistles like from bullets whistling and I noticed and I, on the left side behind a barrack is a German with a machine gun shotting at us.</span> <span id="s2240">And here two my friend fall down, another one third.</span> <span id="s2241">And I started to back up.</span> <span id="s2242">I did run back.</span> <span id="s2243">While everybody was running...running to the front, I did run back.</span> <span id="s2244">And...uh... some way I find my way to a little gate in a hallway for the guards, because between the fences guards were walking, this time empty.</span> <span id="s2245">Probably I went into that gate.</span> <span id="s2246">Luckily, I had behind myself...I left one barbed wire fence and another barbed wire fence.</span> <span id="s2247">Now I had only one barbed wire fence in minds.</span> <span id="s2248">Come to the fence, the last fence...the freedom is, only the fence.</span> <span id="s2249">I can't go through because I had a knife.</span> <span id="s2250">If I had a ax I would cut a hole.</span> <span id="s2251">Instead, I don't know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">03:44:37 And here close me was Sasha Pechersky and Shlomo Szmajzner [NB: Stanislaw Szmajzner; surname also spelled Sjmyzner].</span> <span id="s2253">Now, Shlomo Szmajzner had a rifle, and I remember what...this a minute later.</span> <span id="s2254">And Sasha was with a knife only.</span> <span id="s2255">And sudden, and suddenly a man appeared with a..</span> <span id="s2256">.</span> <span id="s2257">with a ax and start to cut.</span> <span id="s2258">He made a hole in...in the fence.</span> <span id="s2259">Now...but more and more people come and they don't wait in the line when machine guns are shotting at us to go through the hole.</span> <span id="s2260">They start to climb on top of the fence.</span> <span id="s2261">In that time exactly when I was halfway going through the hole, the fence collapsed from the heaviness of the...of the...from the weight of the people which actually I thought that time...and it was over me, and that time I thought this is the end of me.</span> <span id="s2262">But actually, this saved me.</span> <span id="s2263">Because the first few went through I could see why the people is depending on me.</span> <span id="s2264">The mines exploding and bodies flowing there.</span> <span id="s2265">And finally when...when everybody when through at least at that part of the fence and I can't go out...from ...from the fence because the barbed wire did go in in the clothing.</span> <span id="s2266">So I left my coat.</span> <span id="s2267">By the way, I had a leather coat from...I took it the last minute from the storeroom.</span> <span id="s2268">It was also maybe lucky because the...the barbed wire wasn't able to go in too deep to the...my shirt or whatever.</span> <span id="s2269">Anyway, I just slid out from under my coat and start to run.</span> <span id="s2270">I fall down a couple of times.</span> <span id="s2271">I thought I'm shot and I wasn't.</span> <span id="s2272">I start to run until I reached the forest.</span> <span id="s2273">Now, I'll really speed up.</span> <span id="s2274">Come to the forest.</span> <span id="s2275">We are wandering about the day, the next day we come to a point and we under...I already understood that it's not good to run there.</span> <span id="s2276">We are about 50 people.</span> <span id="s2277">The next day we met another 30 people.</span> <span id="s2278">So, and I've seen that we are too many and must...something must be done.</span> <span id="s2279">But...uh...we still kept together until one...until early in the morning.</span> <span id="s2280">I remember we stopped out of the forest and Sasha said that we must go out to check where we are, and they need money.</span> <span id="s2281">So whoever had the money to give money to buy food.</span> <span id="s2282">And all the men with rifles did left.</span> <span id="s2283">Nine people with weapons left.</span> <span id="s2284">We were against it.</span> <span id="s2285">We understood that something is wrong.</span> <span id="s2286">Only Shlomo Szmajzner was left, only because the rest of us surrounded him that we must have a guy with a rifle left.</span> <span id="s2287">And he promised he will come back.</span> <span id="s2288">He did never come back.</span> <span id="s2289">I talked with him later after the war.</span> <span id="s2290">Or maybe I shouldn't go into this.</span> <span id="s2291">He said when I met him that this was his soldier duty to go back to...to the army.</span> <span id="s2292">Anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">03:47:33 So when he left there was real tragedies because groups start to form.</span> <span id="s2294">The weak people did want to go with the strong ones.</span> <span id="s2295">And it was unforgettable...unforgettable scenes, which I won't even to go in it.</span> <span id="s2296">Finally, I took two boys and we left.</span> <span id="s2297">Shmuel Wycen [NB: Samuel Weitzen], who used to work with me as a fireman, and his friend, Kostman, Fredrick.</span> <span id="s2298">We eluded the guards.</span> <span id="s2299">We eluded the...the Germans and we made it to mine hometown, Izbica.</span> <span id="s2300">Over there, I thought I have a Polish friend who was a good friend of my family who will hide us.</span> <span id="s2301">The two boys didn't want to go into the town.</span> <span id="s2302">They were in the forest.</span> <span id="s2303">But I left to the town in the evening, hoping that nobody will recognize me.</span> <span id="s2304">It was sort of dark.</span> <span id="s2305">I come to the Polish lady.</span> <span id="s2306">She didn't want to hide me.</span> <span id="s2307">So I left back and told the guys, "Listen, it's no way.</span> <span id="s2308">We must look for another place.</span> <span id="s2309">But you know what?</span> <span id="s2310">Let go first eat.</span> <span id="s2311">We're hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Come."</span> <span id="s2313">Not far, we have seen light from a little farm.</span> <span id="s2314">And we go to this farm.</span> <span id="s2315">We were afraid to go in the villages.</span> <span id="s2316">But these were farms.</span> <span id="s2317">.</span> <span id="s2318">were little farms...little houses ... uh...single houses.</span> <span id="s2319">So we were not as...not as scared so much.</span> <span id="s2320">We went into this little house, little farm, we have seen from the forest.</span> <span id="s2321">We come.</span> <span id="s2322">There's light.</span> <span id="s2323">We go into the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2324">There's food on the table, but no people.</span> <span id="s2325">We call...I call, "Farmer, Farmer."</span> <span id="s2326">In Polish: "Dzier_awca."</span> <span id="s2327">Nobody answered.</span> <span id="s2328">Finally, we go back to this room and start to eat.</span> <span id="s2329">We go back out again and finally, I see a little boy.</span> <span id="s2330">We asked him, "Listen.</span> <span id="s2331">Come here.</span> <span id="s2332">Where your father?"</span> <span id="s2333">And he comes.</span> <span id="s2334">He recognized we are Jews.</span> <span id="s2335">And he said, "Oh, my father and mother are scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">They thought you are...you are bandits.</span> <span id="s2337">And they're robbing so much here."</span> <span id="s2338">So he called the parents.</span> <span id="s2339">The parents did come down with his sister.</span> <span id="s2340">I recognized his sister.</span> <span id="s2341">I used to go to school with mine... with...with me.</span> <span id="s2342">And the atmosphere start to get warm, and later I told him, "Listen, Mr. Bojarski, what would you take to hide us?</span> <span id="s2343">You are far away from the town.</span> <span id="s2344">Close to the forest.</span> <span id="s2345">No neighbors.</span> <span id="s2346">We will pay you good.</span> <span id="s2347">And I have a house.</span> <span id="s2348">After the war, I will give you this house we have in Izbica."</span> <span id="s2349">"I will think about it.</span> <span id="s2350">Go back to the forest."</span> <span id="s2351">To make it short, in a couple of days he agreed to hide me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">03:50:11 We did put in so much gold and diamonds, and he was excited.</span> <span id="s2353">His wife took a ring.</span> <span id="s2354">His daughter, earrings.</span> <span id="s2355">"Take it.</span> <span id="s2356">Keep it.</span> <span id="s2357">Fine."</span> <span id="s2358">He built a hiding place in the barn.</span> <span id="s2359">In the corner in the barn, he put in a table, covered it with a lot of straw.</span> <span id="s2360">From outside, you had a panel which he opened to give us food.</span> <span id="s2361">(Sigh) Okay.</span> <span id="s2362">We were...I will skip also my adventures in this hiding place and the way I did try to go out because I recognize it's late.</span> <span id="s2363">And I will go to a point where once in the nighttime, we hear some...the dog barking.</span> <span id="s2364">People screaming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">Finally, we heard people coming in in the barn and yelling to him, "Tell me, where do you have the Jews?"</span> <span id="s2366">Show me the Jews."</span> <span id="s2367">And he...we recognized the voice of the farmer, "There's no Jews here.</span> <span id="s2368">No, there're no Jews."</span> <span id="s2369">"Yes, we know there're Jews."</span> <span id="s2370">"No, there're no."</span> <span id="s2371">"So tell me...where do you have...so nice, from where do you have so nice clothing?</span> <span id="s2372">You go to church nicely dressed, and your wife...." Well, I understood.</span> <span id="s2373">We were so happy that he didn't drink.</span> <span id="s2374">Because a lot of Poles are drinking.</span> <span id="s2375">He didn't.</span> <span id="s2376">But what he has done, he [loved nice] clothing always.</span> <span id="s2377">Shoes for his sons, pants, sweaters; so this was noticible.</span> <span id="s2378">So anyway, and they start to look for us in the straw.</span> <span id="s2379">They didn't find us and they left.</span> <span id="s2380">After they left he did come in in the hiding place.</span> <span id="s2381">"You see what's happened?</span> <span id="s2382">What would happen," he said, "he did discover you?</span> <span id="s2383">They would kill you.</span> <span id="s2384">They would kill me.</span> <span id="s2385">And the worse is that...what a shame would be to my family when they...they did find out that we're hiding Jews."</span> <span id="s2386">Now I..</span> <span id="s2387">.</span> <span id="s2388">I didn't have formal education, as I said, but I did read a lot.</span> <span id="s2389">And he had a big cross on.</span> <span id="s2390">.</span> <span id="s2391">on his chest and asked him, "Mr. Bojarski, why are you ashamed?</span> <span id="s2392">Why...why should your family...should family be ashamed?</span> <span id="s2393">You know Jesus Christ was a Jew."</span> <span id="s2394">For him it was the biggest insult.</span> <span id="s2395">To accuse Jesus Christ of being a Jew!</span> <span id="s2396">And probably when I told him...on top of it, I told him the picture, "Last Supper," he has in the kitchen: All 12 apostles are Jews.</span> <span id="s2397">And the...it was that a insult to him that I accused the apostles being Jewish.</span> <span id="s2398">Anyway, he went out mad.</span> <span id="s2399">Couple of days later he comes, "Guys, I have for you guys a hiding place.</span> <span id="s2400">Because I find out that the Germans will search for Jews in any farm which is close to the forest.</span> <span id="s2401">So only for 3 days I made another hiding place."</span> <span id="s2402">And one evening, he did come.</span> <span id="s2403">He told us to go out.</span> <span id="s2404">And I expected hiding place if he's so afraid he will do it, he will make it some place far away from him in the forest, I mean.</span> <span id="s2405">But he made it right out behind the barn.</span> <span id="s2406">It was already suspicious, but I still didn't suspect.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">03:53:07 We didn't remember he....</span> <span id="s2408">When I went behind the barn, I noticed ...uh...a little carriage with two wheels.</span> <span id="s2409">Two wheel carriage.</span> <span id="s2410">No?</span> <span id="s2411">Like a platform with two handles.</span> <span id="s2412">On top of it was a big millstone, a stone we'd make flour with it, in the old type mills they have grinding stones.</span> <span id="s2413">Anyway, a big stone.</span> <span id="s2414">I didn't know it.</span> <span id="s2415">It was standing....</span> <span id="s2416">Later, I connected it.</span> <span id="s2417">Now, he picked me up here by mine waist and pushed me in that hole, and later he pushed in another one and later we did ask him for a kerosene lamp which he did give us.</span> <span id="s2418">Put in...have the kerosene and looking.</span> <span id="s2419">We're were in a hole about a meter and a half, a square meter and a half.</span> <span id="s2420">The roof was...I've seen it from inside, a 2 by 4 long and across were pine branches and some straw.</span> <span id="s2421">The opening was a round opening maybe a square foot, a foot round or maybe a little bit more.</span> <span id="s2422">We barely squeezed in.</span> <span id="s2423">Was now pushed in straw on it.</span> <span id="s2424">And so on.</span> <span id="s2425">We are sitting inside and later we hear and that they're pushing something hard and something fall...very heavy on top of the hiding place.</span> <span id="s2426">And what's happened, the 2 by 4 break down like a letter V.</span> <span id="s2427">So we said, "Oh, God.</span> <span id="s2428">Is broken down.</span> <span id="s2429">Must go to him and tell him that everything is breaking...is breaking down.</span> <span id="s2430">So we tried to push out the straw.</span> <span id="s2431">Kostman was actually over there pushing out the straw.</span> <span id="s2432">He said, "I can't push out the straw."</span> <span id="s2433">Now the lamp start to flicker...flicker, flicker and goes down.</span> <span id="s2434">And what is interesting.</span> <span id="s2435">I didn't feel shortage oxygen, but the lamp didn't want to burn anymore.</span> <span id="s2436">I put in a match, start again to burn for a second, and out.</span> <span id="s2437">Later, even the match didn't want to start and I start to feel, you know, [not] enough air.</span> <span id="s2438">And all the time the third one--Wycen, Shmuel--was holding with his arm the 2 by 4, it shouldn't break down.</span> <span id="s2439">He was supporting it.</span> <span id="s2440">So (clearing throat) Fredrich was, so Wycen screamed, "Pull down the straw!"</span> <span id="s2441">So we pulled down, still no fresh air.</span> <span id="s2442">He said, "Something is blocking the entrance."</span> <span id="s2443">Finally, we hear something sliding and...and this breath of fresh air comes in.</span> <span id="s2444">And he opened it.</span> <span id="s2445">And now we are going out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: Tom, we have about 4 minutes and what I need quickly is what happened and how did you get liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">03:56:00</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2449">He did try to kill it.</span> <span id="s2450">He didn't make it.</span> <span id="s2451">He did give us...still we didn't believe it really.</span> <span id="s2452">We did go to the old place.</span> <span id="s2453">And one...it didn't take much, but three days later, he did come with helpers.</span> <span id="s2454">Shot at us.</span> <span id="s2455">Shot at my two friends.</span> <span id="s2456">Shot at me.</span> <span id="s2457">I pretended to be dead.</span> <span id="s2458">Later when he took the...our clothing, and saying, "Now we will check the Jewish clothing for money," when they went to the house, I did get up and run away.</span> <span id="s2459">After I run away, I was in the forest for awhile.</span> <span id="s2460">Later, but he was...he didn't know I'm alive and if I'm alive he'll be in trouble.</span> <span id="s2461">Later and so he always watched us.</span> <span id="s2462">I was always a step in front of him.</span> <span id="s2463">And finally I did run away in a different area where a few Poles did...did know my father, as a Polish...what would I say?</span> <span id="s2464">Patriot...and helped me into...go into a Polish partisan organization called "Bataliony Chlopskie," peasants battalions.</span> <span id="s2465">And I worked over there as a courier until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2466">This the whole story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: Tom, thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: You're welcome.</span> <span id="s2469">How long did we talk?</span> <span id="s2470">Q: It's three hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: Good.</span> <span id="s2472">I did good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">Q: Yah.</span> <span id="s2474">Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">03:57:25</span></p></body></html>
