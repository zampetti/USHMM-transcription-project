SB: Mr. Pais, tell me when and where you were born and the name you were born with.
TP: I was born (cough) August 25, 1915 in St. Peters- burg, Russia. My name was Pais--same as in United States. The only thing I used to spell it--I am from Lithuania so the name use to be spelled P--E--I--I--S.
And the first name in Russian they used to call me different; Ted--I was changed my name when I came to the United States and my name--my Jewish name was
Taschum, T--A--S--C--H--U--M.
SB: And tell me about how you ended up in Kovno.TP: Well that uh--one of the reasons I was born in--in St.
Petersburg--in Russia because in 1914 when the first World War broke out, the chief--the commander of the Russian army was Painsnipnicareyenicareyeshvitz, it was the brother of the Czar issued an order that all Jews, living in a Baltic countries, had to go deep, Russia because they were accused of being German spies.

Bradley Wentworth Films, Inc. 9400 Kendale Rd, Potomac, MD 20854 TIMECODE NOTES: just--he came back from South Africa with a lot of money and he--he use to open the mill but he had to move to Russia. And in--in uh Russia, Jews were not allowed to live in big cities--only in little Stetchla- hoisers, nothing special. Because my grandfather had money, so he was allowed to stay in St. Petersburg and the war was on, so he opened a factory where they manufactured what I think--eh for army like holsters and all kind of acts-acts military things. So, that's why I was born in Russia--it was my grandfather and grandmother and it my mother and father they all moved to Russia. Now from there, we lived until 1918, be- cause really he's not from Lithuania. In 1918, Lithua- nia became independent and if the if they revolution, we all moved back to Lithuania. And my grandfather continued his business. And I--my father worked for this business manager and I worked uh--I went to school there--I graduated at uh Lithuanian high school and from there I went to university in Kovno that's Kovno's, they called it in Lithuania. So uh later on in the 1940, when the Soviet Union occupied the Baltic countries, my grandfather lost his business because it was nationalized and I uh my mother--my father was work--ing in Kovno--he had a job because before--6 months before that, the mill burned down and my father got a job in Kovno and I was already going out with this girl and I met--I was in University but we got married. So this is the reasons we wound up in Kovno.
That we lived in Kovno and that's where the Germans got
me.

SB: Um, and so on the eve of when the Germans came in, how did things change in Kovno?
TP: Well, the Germans--the Germans came--the worst start when the Soviet and Germany broke in June the 22nd, 1941. I was married and I was still going for last year in university and my wife was a nurse working in a hospital. And I remember Friday, it was June the 21st-eh uh the 20th--yeah the 20th. If you were plan- ning with a few more couples to go to a picnic, next day which is the 21st and the uh course that the um there was--we lived by a river.

I turned on the radio and--and I heard Molatoff make this speech that the Germans invaded the Soviet Union and you know then--but there are experiens who--who will survive and who will defeat them and so forth. Now, I went out and dressed and went out in the street there was Russian troops are marching from all states--everywhere. And it felt like they were retreating us. Stopped to for a drink of waters--soldiers just--just. So they ask a hammer are you? And they the Soviet Union, you called everybody Comrade. He says, 'Are you Jewish.' I says 'Yes.' Said, 'You better run because the Germans, right behind us and you know what to expect if the Germans will come here.' And I went out in the street, I thought well maybe they're just were gonna glance over so I rode my bicycle in a road to the railway station. I though maybe I could catch a train and go deeper into Russia, somewhere. But I wasn't kidding so that there were people on top the work house and eh everybody was running so I was I just came home and but I noticed already that we--we didn't see anymore po- liceman--uh u--uniformed policeman of the state. We saw already some kind of hooligans you know wearing kinda of a arm bands carrying riffles, you know. I didn't like the looks of them, you know. They were already taunting, 'You Jews,' that's, 'Your end is coming. The German army's right is advancing here'--I think so, we already felt what this--what's going to happen.

You all come into the house because things don't look to good because this is death--death suburb was uh this little Lithuanian partisans not scal--liberators and organized and so we can see these people can took a scene and somehow we lost my mother in law and we lost my brother in law. They disap- peared. There was no way we were later when we came back home we found that they we home--they'd been back home. So to spend the 3 days and the Lithuanian's partisans came the took us to work. Remember they took us Tuesday.

Well, I didn't recognize the Soviet occupation for Lithuania. Right eh--eh you know you want to save your lives you try to save you sister.
'What do you have?' I showed him the discharge papers from the Lithuanian army. So he looks at it and says, 'Oh, you--you served in the first infantry regiment in a such and such company. I served that too.' He says 'You remember the name of the Sarge?' I says, 'Yeah, I do!' 'Oh, I remember it too.' He says you know, 'You're not a communist.' I says, 'No, I'm not a communist. I was never a member of the party and I was just a student, university student.' So he says, 'What--what is your address?' I says, 'I live in the city of Kovno.'

SB: So back up just a little bit to where you were
showing your papers--papers.
TP: Yes, so in a way by showing him these papers, I kind of saved my life because all these people--there were hundreds and hundreds of these armed Lithuanian uh partisans who were Nazi collaborators. They were--the same day, they murdered many Jews already and at the same city. So that he assigned an armed guard to take me back where I was staying, I felt like well maybe that saved my life. At the moment he did and he took me through side streets because he heard the radio, the German marches playing and soldiers marching and there was an order from the German high command that no civilian people would be in the street when they march in or everybody will be shot. So, because I knew about the order already. So they dropped me out there and went so, that's what the Germans arrived already. Now, that was Tuesday. We stayed another day or two with those people. They were very nice to us. They fed us.

So the started they went home getting their belongings again but all this sol- diers did was German military personnel. At one place--if--if my uh wife's grandmother was with us, and eventually an officer with her you know we felt, as Jews, already that we don't belong to any of them--there gonna kick us out but the--the army--the combat troops--they had nothing to do with the Jewish they batik. A couple of officers apologized--they were blocking our way in the sidewalk. So we came home, we found our my wife's mother with her brother. They went home the same day and they were safe--nobody touched them. Well, and then our troubles started. The Lith- uanians started to drag people from every--everywhere and then take them to different execution places. The felt free--the uh--they felt so free to do what they--what they want to do because that's was the first of the post of the uh General Ye--Yeager, from the S.S.
that he stops in Lithuania for the killing the Jews was easy because due the collaboration of the local people.
So if some eh leader says Jewish community went to the German high command, they could talk to some of them and say they had nothing to do with the local people.
The local people want to murder you just stay bactisow.
So we knew that we are also the lower level you gonna protect us. So then they started to issue all kinds of ord--first of all there was they, or the rabb--food rationing.

And the Jews came to--to--the Jews couldn't stand in the same line with the 'Gent-tiles.' So, uh, and then issued there was the order issued that you that we half to where a yellow Jewish star on the left side of the your chest and--and--and one on the back too. We can not walk on the sidewalks and uh a few days came out the order that all Jews had to move out of the city to a ghetto. And that was they called it the Vililampolay or Slobatka they called it in Jewish. That was a--a suburb where mostly Jewish people live in it. So but Jewish people did who lived--they had houses in the city. They had--they--but some gentiles live there had to trade houses for a little check they gave a big building away. Hell, there was no papers thrown up--nothing because the German military installation wrote the whole thing. So then we had to move--that they gave us a rule that we have to move to the ghetto
by August 15th--

The German army didn't do anything to the Jews--nothing until the--there were special groups assigned to--to beat the Jews but the Lithuanian took care of many Jews already. So that he came out the Jews have to move to the ghetto. So they had to find a place where the--the ghetto could only--there was at that time, in Kovno, was about, I would say, around--30,000 Jews when the war broke out and I think you probably know the percentage--maybe 3 or 4 thousand of these survived in concentration camps and so forth.
So, so the time my parents tried to find a place where to live and so my wife and I and her parents. So scattered my uh wife and I found everywhere were some relatives and my parents found some other place and my father and mother in another place and finally eventu- ally later we joined up together so but the--but the situation the city was terrible. The Lithuanians use to grab you's who moved into the ghetto moving around and they use to take him to the different river by the Fort. We had several forts: number 4, number 5th and number 9th Fort. So uh this is all Russian Fortresses where the under the Czar they built it for military purposes. So the before we moved to the ghetto. We didn't yet moved to the ghetto, they built a fence--a barbed wire fence and I participated in building the fence too; dig holes and all that; they carried the lumber and. And August 15th was the day when the locked up the ghetto. They could not go without armed guards and so we thought we were protected now.

I mean they knew what they wanted to do to them. And the--the fought the Jewish adminis- tration there were eh Jewish litgesvages--nice people but--but not everybody wanted to help the Jews; be in the Jewish administration because there are all have to take orders from the Germans. What happens when they ask for a hundred or thou--or thousand people to be killed. The life in the ghetto was not easy. We lived in very crowed conditions because that time it was late summer so it uh we didn't need any uh heat in the house but the rations that they gave us were meager but whatever people tried to prepare food for what they call the prences my mother would play the piano. So my mother--we were not allowed to take musical instruments into the ghetto so she sold the piano to some Lithuani- an family and she use to work everyday. Jews were not allowed to take any public transportation. Unless horse and wagon if you could find one. And they uh, she walked many many miles everyday carrying bundles of flour or potatoes or all kind of stuff she could get.
Sold it and money they--they couldn't do nothing with money anyway. They didn't have a value with money. So uh we started work after we the fence was built and the ghetto was locked up and then we started form all kinds of uh labor groups to work with the German army. I went to work for the German army with to build--in Kovno they had an airport but a small airport but the Lithuanian aviation had only about six or seven planes Video Tape No. ____ Camera Roll No. ____ Sound Roll No. ____ KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/TED PAIS page 13 Interviewed (5-6-97) by Sandra W.

And they uh there's no runways to first were the German needed to see little concrete runways for there liftrafa, that the Air Force. That when I was exposed to the first time to the German Air Force. Incidently, from the first days though the day I was liberated I was working for the German Air Force. So it was very hard work. It was 12 hours and the two shifts--day shifts and night shifts and--and four was a problem it was raining and the had the didn't use any bulldozers. They had the Jews to did with shovels with and you know what happens to clay when it gets wet. We could uh lose our shoes uh and it was terrible. So I worked there for the airport for the rest--several months and it was very hard. My wife worked in a uh--there was an infirmary and a hou--so she worked part time in a hospital. Course there was no pay but just to do something for the people, you know. My father got a job to work for the food distri- bution center and how could you get a job that you knew little. Because there was no employment office some- thing like but is was established an employment office.

And what they needed 600 or 500 people to work in some archives and uh it was people were in order would be nice. We wouldn't have to did ditches and work in the airport and later. So my father and I decided to go too. And my mother was preparing sandwiches for us because you had to have something to eat you know. Mothers always worry. So by the time my went we didn't have any other refrigeration to keep perishable foods in the cellar so my mother went down to the cellar to get some pickles for the sandwiches.

They don't need anymore. There they started to force them back off.
You know, you have to go back to work in the airport.
So that they started spread rumors all of the people are working. They work in Germany. They work in different places. They are doing some nice work there, you know. Nice uh lodging. Gestapo were spreading the rumors that so and so got a letter from her husband...so an so got a letter from her son. And she specifically asked and I say did you ever see your girl here. No. They killed them the same day. And the Fort number 4 that was in the outside of Kovno. There was a little Jewish society when the upper contactals and the professors and teachers and doctors that were they asked that they should of been intelligent, edu- cated, well-dressed. So that's where they--I always wondered why they did they want this is well I would think this is because uh because intelligent people, educated people are the ones who would revolt. Not that the revolt that I think there are a couple ghettos and the Warsaw ghetto. The couldn't--the thought that--that a couple time is Kovno they called us one day, the same place where the Big Action on the October the 28th. The called us the people who would come out and they're going to talk to us about uh black outs.

So came the large action that time they told everybody to get up and everybody to assemble in the they call it the Democratu Iksteadi. The uh square of the Democrats. And every- body had to be there and they could Gestapo. Gestapo men were there and the started to direct whether to go to the right or to the left. We didn't know which is the good side, which is the bad side. But we saw that once they went to the one side they took them back to the small ghetto--there was a ghetto--first it was divided in two parts and they build a bridge to go from one ghetto to the other one. And then the Jews were evacuated from the ghetto one day on the right and were killed. So some of the people, when they took the right action to go to the left, they took them to the--to the small ghetto. And people started to fight a little they gonna have apartment or nothing but the next morning we saw they were all going up the hill toward the 9th Fort--the direction of the 9th Fort.
And they were all killed. The had I would say between 10 and 12 thousand were killed the same day.
SB: You saw them going up the hill?
TP: Yes I saw it--the next morning. And the guards--the Germans and Lithuanian guards.

TP: I guess they knew where they were going because the 9th Fort was the only way. They know that was the direction of the 9th Fort. I was never in the 9th Fort until--until March 1944, when they arrested me with the Jewish Police. Then--then I was there for 3 days.
SB: Um, okay let's get to that in a little while.
Let's um did you get--did your wife have a baby any-
time?
TP: Yes. My wife became pregnant in the ghetto. There was a dead line when women can bear children. After dead line, babies had to be aborted. But my baby didn't want to go through it an abortion. And the baby was born after the dead line. But the papers regis- tered in the ghetto records, it was born before the dead line. It was born--the baby was delivered by a mid-wife because my wife knew what from the hospital, she was an excellent mid-wife. The next morning out beared the placenta in the back yard. And I didn't witness but I time, I heard the birth of the baby but I uh the baby looked healthy and you know it was fine.
But the baby didn't know what is what he was what kind of life he was coming to but the little. So the baby was born I would say October the 42--something like that. So when the baby was killed he was about 2 and a half years old or something like that. The wife with the baby went to Studhoff--that's where they took the women from Kovno ghetto before they took the men to Dakow, they took them to Studhoff.

SB: Um, so how did you keep the baby in the ghetto?
TP: Well, it was hard. You couldn't get uh milk. My brother worked--worked in a place use to sometimes the Germans gave a little milk. It was hard. It was rough to raise a child. Clothes--there was no baby clothes they have here. They had to take some old clothes and make it--cut it down and make fit for a baby or uh shoes--it was very hard. I think that people here who live in the worst economic conditions in slums, things like that, had a much easier way to raise baby then it was in the ghetto. And you know, here we spoke Yid- dish. Everybody spoke Yiddish. And they spoke a lot but German. You know when he started--the baby started to talk and understand a little bit, he use to say, 'I'm afraid there's a German. I'm afraid there's a German.' In Yiddish, he use to say it. And he--and I built an underground he--to hide ourselves because we thought--we knew that the war is coming to an end and the Russians are coming closer. So in a couple days we could hide over here. So at night I used to dig it and take the dirt throughout not the Germans could see it.
And the rest that was the uh ghetto police and a stay and stay oysh and my wife kept the baby in the cellar.
It was kinda a sickly temp--than going into a cabinet that in order for the baby not to cry, she gave him injections in his thigh. I don't know what injections were but the baby acted terrible after it was, I came back from the 9th Fort because the Germans did come.

get food.
TP: Well, they gave us rations; very small rations; how much bread that we eat and so much flour; never got any sugar or never gave us salt and once in a while they use to give us horse meat.

SB: Um, tell me how you became a ghetto policeman?
TP: Oh. Well, it was--ra--get--when I--in 19 forty...three--forty three--only before. There were rumors started circulated they um--the Germans want to take most of the people who worked for the air port.
You see they didn't have enough uh guards to guard us from--there was a shift--was a shift--there was a thousand people they use to go work, you know. They need almost a--a regiment of soldiers to accompany them because there were so many Jews and so many soldiers guarding--like that. So they wanted to build barracks at the airport. They should live in the airport.
Women separate from the men and work right there. We had a family. We didn't want to be separated, so if we got--I tried to use the influence, what I had from my father in law, what he knew very important people and says uh. As a matter of fact, I wanted to become a policeman when the ghetto first started. I was not accepted. You're too educated for it. We need rough characters you know. But later I don't--they cleaned the ranks of the policeman because they didn't--they misbehave you know.

So I was accepted and they uh--and they gave me a--a job with the to be at some ghetto shops. Where they use to bring uh German army uniforms to wash them and clean them and mend them and--and so it was like a plant guard. So that was that. That was easy. You worked for 12 hours and 12 hours you--you go home. So that's how I became a policeman. Until--until the day when they arrested the Jewish policeman. I have to give--the reason why they just--the Jewish police.
That was already 19 forty...end of '43 and '44, when the ghetto was converted--instead of a ghetto and a concentration camp. When the S.S. when they became the head of the ghetto. See before they had was they--they--the district commission of the S.A. was the member but then the S.S. took over. That's why the concentration camp had the Daskimblovia or Gulka maybe that his name. He was a uh S.S. colonel. So uh--so you figure--so why do we have policeman--yes there was an underground movement. People use to go into fights you know--fight the Germans, the Partisans and then of course, a certain people the police knew about the underground movement but the guards wouldn't here a thing like that. So they called the police that par- ticular day--that was in a--that was the day of the uh--I think was in March 1944. That was the took the children and old people away.

We knew who he was. He was also policeman. I says, 'What happen to you.' They beat him up because they all before the war, his parents owned a very elegant fur shop. They use to sell their furs and before they went to the ghetto, he gave--they gave their furs to some Lithuanian people they know and so she couldn't go out of the ghetto and they were gonna pay them back with food--I think like that. So sometimes she went to the walls and they refuse to give them more food or money whatever it was. So he says--she says she is going to complain to the Gestapo about you. Don't go complain to the Gestapo about Lithuanians. So they got--they get a very important the Gestapo, that his wife was there and they accused him that they stole their furs and I think like that.

He was supposed to meet somebody but they was Gestapo, there were traitors you know and but I think there was an underground movement. I thought that certain people were growing beards and mustaches and things like that. And I knew it this--uh this for a reason not to be recognized and to look differently. But so when I was a guard, of that in that uh factories where they had the--the

That they supplied the uni--the German army uniforms for the partisans.

But when the Germans came and they take them--they say they take a thousand people to work with them. We tried to believe that they came to work but we never heard from them anymore.
But they tried to do the best job under the circum- stances. I guess that they had uh--in the ghetto court, if somebody was caught stealing--we had a little ghetto jail. A couple times I was watching the guys in jail who arrested--a thing like that. Well there were even a couple guys that uh--a couple guys murdered a family and robbed them their money and the police

So the ghetto administration put up a rule that these people who worked ev--on those easy jobs should give one day a week to work at the airport so the people from there could be relieved, you know. So it was like this.
Like my sister worked on time in a--in a German mili- tary hospital. She was a medical student but she use to wash--uh wash floors over there you know. Because that was an easy job. They use to give her food over there and there was work indoors. So my sister had to go for one week and work at the airport to relieve some women to relieve some women who worked seven days at

I think it's kind of a rug or something I put there, nailed it down. And I cut out a hole in the floor that when they opened the cabinet door, you could climb into the hole in the cellar. I even brought an electric-- a wire for electricity. We had electricity in the ghetto for light. And there was kind of a uh air hole and little windows. I made it bigger to get air you know. And uh--and I made it so that the floor was a cabinet. I nailed down a couple pots, you know, so when you climb into this--to this hole, you can take this wooden floor, with these nailed in pots to it, so they open the door and see it's just a cabi- net wit pots on the uh. That was to camaflouge it.
However, my wife told me later that the soldiers came there and pounded in the floor and I did something else to the hidden cellar. I think I put some extra dirt under the floor or something. They should of they heard a pounding with a--with a riffle--they didn't
come out there.
SB: What did you do with the dirt?
TP: The dirt we use to put in pails and we use to throw a little by little outside, you know, and the had--there's no guard. It was just dirt inside so we sent the dirt and try not--not to show any puddles. If you saw The Great Escape, the movie. Did you see The
Great Escape?

SB: Yeah.
TP: How the British uh filled up to their pockets.
They took the dirt in their pockets and they use to uh hold their pockets and pull a string and the dirt used to go down their pants and the dirt so it was what I did is uh take it out to them. Take it in a bucket. A little bit with my fist; I use to distribute it all in different places so that there was no--uh pile of dirt.
SB: And um when you got arrested with the other police, they took the, they took your shoe laces and glasses. Tell me about that.
TP: Yes, the took the--that's right, the took it was far most of them were boots. But they took my eye- glasses away. They had knifes; if anybody had little scissors--something like that. They said we have any bullets with you. You can not speed up your death with us. They took the glasses away because, you know, at least you can cut your--tried to commit suicide. And uh--and uh belts, suspenders, anything which you can make uh hang yourself or something.
SB: And did you get told, while you were there, that you weren't going to live very longer?
TP: Well, when they first took us. When we first came to the 9th Fort, so that the S.S. and the German police guards were there look in the book he says.

And I quoted the German, 'From--from here come Canacksoleek, nobody returns from here. So then he stood to the others said then took us in--into the cell. The cell was almost knee-high of water. There was so full. I don't know where the water was from and we stood there. But then, you know, we are no more than humans, we have physio- logical functions to take care of. We have to go to toilet. So myself with somebody else started knocking on the door. The guards would come. Say, 'What do you want.' I says, 'We have no toilet.' 'Then do it right here because you won't live long.' So that what we did. But later is was getting dark already and I had one little electric bulb there burning and they open the door and he says, 'Five men out.' So I said we took five men and I was one of the five to whom I volunteered. So I figured well if there are going to execute that they took a few people at a time to exe-
cute them.
Hear me, I might as well die now. If I live so I live.
And they took us to another cell. There was light and there was kind of a sleeping bunks, you know, for sleeping and there was uh pails for taking care of you toilet habits, you know. And there was drinking water, a thing like that. And the table with benches. And then they brought us bread and soup and I--I--and that's how they brought us to the cell, five men at a time.

SB: Okay, um, I think were just about out. The hanging
of Mac.
TP: Yes I knew about it and I saw him hanging there when we came back from the airport from work. They put in such a place that the people will go back to their houses and 'Yes, I saw him hanging.' I was not there when he was hung but I saw him hanging there. They did it purposely that everybody should see it. Yeah I knew what happened. I knew about it. I knew he was.
