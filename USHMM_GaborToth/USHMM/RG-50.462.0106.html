id="s2">EM: Edith Millman interviewing Mr. Daniel Goldsmith.</span> <span id="s3">Today is February 6, 1995.</span> <span id="s4">Mr. Goldsmith, could you tell me when and where you were born, and a little bit about your childhood and about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">DG: OK I was born in Antwerp on December 11, 1931 to my parents who were originally from Poland.</span> <span id="s6">My father was Chaim Goldschmidt.</span> <span id="s7">He was from Rymanov, Poland.</span> <span id="s8">And my mother was Ruchel Goldschmidt, originally, her maiden name was Münzer, and she was from Przemyszlany, Poland.</span> <span id="s9">They both met in Antwerp and got married and that’s where they lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">EM: Could you tell me when they migrated to Antwerp?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">DG: My mother migrated to Antwerp in 1930, my father migrated to Antwerp in 1928.</span> <span id="s12">My father had his own business.</span> <span id="s13">My father was a plumber, and he had his own business.</span> <span id="s14">He lived all the years that--of my childhood, we lived on one street in three different houses but on the same street, which was Korte Kiebit Straat [see pgs.</span> <span id="s15">7&amp;8] in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s16">That was in the Jewish section of Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">EM: Was your father and mother religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">DG: Yes.</span> <span id="s19">My father and my mother were both Orthodox, modern Orthodox.</span> <span id="s20">My father didn’t have the beard, but he was Shomer Shabbes.</span> <span id="s21">And my parents kept a kosher home, as well as they sent me to a yeshiva.</span> <span id="s22">Because I went to a yeshiva by the name of Tachkemoni, which I believe is still in existence today.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">EM: Was this in addition to your regular school?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">DG: No.</span> <span id="s25">No, I had both my secular and my religious education at the same school.</span> <span id="s26">It was an all day yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">EM: Oh.</span> <span id="s28">Do you know if your parents had to pay for you to go to the yeshiva?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">DG: Yes, they paid.</span> <span id="s30">My parents I would say basically were middle class people, so they had to pay for that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">EM: Did you have any siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">DG: Yes, in December, 1939, the 26th of December, 1939, my sister was born.</span> <span id="s33">Actually, in between my sister and I my mother had a miscarriage.</span> <span id="s34">But my sister was born at that particular time.</span> <span id="s35">So when the war started, it had already started, you know when she was born, because we look at the war having started in September, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">EM: Tell me, did your parents have contact with their family, if any, in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">DG: Yes.</span> <span id="s38">As a matter of fact, when I was small, my mother made a trip back to Poland to visit both my father’s family and her own family.</span> <span id="s39">And I, as a matter of fact, I have some pictures, you know, that show me being in Poland.</span> <span id="s40">And they were constantly in touch with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">EM: Were any other members of your parents in Antwerp?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">DG: No.</span> <span id="s43">My mother and my father were alone in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s44">My father’s family--most of my father’s family was here in the United States.</span> <span id="s45">He had one sister--my father was one of nine children--so my father, one of his sisters, and his younger brother were the only ones that were left.</span> <span id="s46">And his younger brother had just also gone to the United States.</span> <span id="s47">So there were just my father and his sister that were left.</span> <span id="s48">The sister was left in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">EM: OK Could you tell me a little bit about antisemitism in Belgium, if any, as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">DG: I have to say that having gone to a yeshiva, and having lived in a Jewish area, OK, for the few--in my younger years--remember I was only nine years old--you know, when my father got taken, or actually eight years old when the war started.</span> <span id="s51">I encountered very little antisemitism.</span> <span id="s52">Even though the street that we lived on was a half Jewish and a half non-Jewish, the people were basically nice to us, so that I did not have any problems.</span> <span id="s53">And of course, all my friends were, most of my friends I should say, you know, were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">EM: Were Jewish, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">DG: So I didn’t encounter as a little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">EM: So you didn’t have much contact with non-Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s57">DG: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">EM: ...frie-, people.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">DG: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">EM: How about your parents?</span> <span id="s61">Do you think that they had much contact with non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">DG: Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s63">They--my father being a plumber, OK, did work in a lot of the non-Jewish houses.</span> <span id="s64">My mother was very friendly with the non-Jewish people, you know, on our street.</span> <span id="s65">So they did have quite a bit of contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">EM: OK Do you happen to know if your parents were Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">DG: Yes.</span> <span id="s68">My parents were very strong Zionists.</span> <span id="s69">Matter of fact that’s why, that’s where I got my feeling for Zionism, you know, from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">EM: From there.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">DG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">EM: Were there any Zionist organization that would take children as young as you, you know, to group meetings or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">DG: No, I was actually--we talked about that, you know, but I really was too young, you know, to go to attend any of those meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">EM: OK What was the language of instruction in the yeshiva?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">DG: The language of instruction in the yeshiva was Flemish for the secular course and Yiddish for the Jewish instructions.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">EM: So there was secular instruction...</span></p> <p><span id="s77">DG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">EM: ...at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">DG: At the same time, yes.</span> <span id="s80">Of course we learned Hebrew in the yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">EM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s82">How--do you know how old you were when you started school?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">DG: Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">EM: You were six.</span> <span id="s85">What are your earliest memories of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">DG: The earliest memories of the war actually were the discussions that my father and mother had, because living in Antwerp—Antwerp at that particular time was a very big port of exit, and many, many people that my mother and my father knew from home, meaning from Poland, came through Antwerp to leave, basically, for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">EM: Do you know if your father tried to get an exit visa for...</span></p> <p><span id="s88">DG: Yes, yes, my father, as a matter of fact, tried very, very hard, you know, to get his family that was over here, you know, to send him an exit visa.</span> <span id="s89">And the family apparently did not take it as serious as my father took it, OK?</span> <span id="s90">Because they said, you know, “Why do you want to come over here?</span> <span id="s91">You know, you have a successful business over there.”</span> <span id="s92">Of course, you know, in retrospect you can also say that nobody knew what was going to happen of course, you know.</span> <span id="s93">It was just another war so to speak at that particular time.</span> <span id="s94">Although my parents sensed that it was much more than that because of the stories, you know, that people would tell, you know, coming through, of what was happening in Germany and what was happening in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">EM: Right.</span> <span id="s96">What happened when the Germans invaded Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">DG: When the Germans invaded Belgium, we fled, like most of the Belgians actually did.</span> <span id="s98">We fled south.</span> <span id="s99">We went towards Ostend, you know, which is the seashore, you know, of Belgium, and then south towards France.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">DG: But the war in Belgium lasted a very short time.</span> <span id="s102">It was only two weeks.</span> <span id="s103">And so we were in Calais, which is in France, near the Belgian border, when the Germans caught up with us.</span> <span id="s104">And when that happened, there was nothing else that we could do except go back to Antwerp.</span> <span id="s105">And the ironic part of the whole thing is that it was at that particular time, just before the Germans invaded Belgium, that finally my father received the papers to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s106">By that time it was too late already, because the last ship had left and he couldn’t leave anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">EM: So he did get the papers...</span></p> <p><span id="s108">DG: Eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">EM: But it, eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">DG: It was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">EM: When you came back to Amsterdam, did you go ba-...</span></p> <p><span id="s112">DG: Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">EM: To Antwerp, I’m sorry, did you go back to your own apartment, to your own house?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">DG: Yes.</span> <span id="s115">Yes, we went back to the house, because that was like in 1940.</span> <span id="s116">And actually life basically went back to normal when we got back, meaning my father went back to work and I went back to school and everything was OK, you know, for a few months.</span> <span id="s117">And then after that little by little the sanctions started.</span> <span id="s118">You know we had heard...</span></p> <p><span id="s119">EM: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">DG: Sanctions.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">EM: Sanctions against the...</span></p> <p><span id="s122">DG: Against the Jews.</span> <span id="s123">In other words we had curfews...</span></p> <p><span id="s124">EM: This, the curfew was different for you than for the Belgians?</span> <span id="s125">Or was there no cur-...</span></p> <p><span id="s126">DG: It was only for the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">EM: There was no curfew...</span></p> <p><span id="s128">DG: For the Belgians.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">EM: ...for the...</span></p> <p><span id="s130">DG: Yes, it was only for the Jews.</span> <span id="s131">Then they started closing down the schools.</span> <span id="s132">Teachers couldn’t teach.</span> <span id="s133">Doctors, you know, couldn’t practice anymore.</span> <span id="s134">My father couldn’t do any work anymore.</span> <span id="s135">We had to wear the yellow star.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">EM: You had the yellow star, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">DG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">EM: It was on the chest and on the...</span></p> <p><span id="s139">DG: It was on the chest on the jacket, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">EM: Jacket.</span> <span id="s141">On the jacket.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">DG: Yeah, the yellow st-, we had to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s143">We couldn’t go to the theater anymore, you know.</span> <span id="s144">All the civil rights were taken away, you know, little by little.</span> <span id="s145">And this went on until August, 1942 when my father received a notice to report to the train station for--I mean to go to a labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">EM: Was this the first time that you or your parents heard about labor camps or about people being taken to labor camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">DG: It, it--yes.</span> <span id="s148">This was not the first time in other words that my parents had heard, I mean, that there were labor camps.</span> <span id="s149">But this was the first time, I mean, that you know, he heard, you know, that they were going to take Jews away, you know, to labor camps in northern France.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">EM: In northern France.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">DG: Yes.</span> <span id="s152">In other words he knew he was going to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">EM: Oh, he knew that he was going to, he had to go to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">DG: To France.</span> <span id="s155">My father and my mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s156">EM: Were there any people, Jewish people, shipped out from Antwerp at that time, I mean to, young people?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">DG: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s158">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s159">They had thousands of them that were shipped out.</span> <span id="s160">There were, if I’m not mistaken, a couple of transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">EM: That were going where?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">DG: That were going to, supposedly, to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">EM: Oh.</span> <span id="s164">Were these mostly young people?</span> <span id="s165">Were they men and women or just, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">DG: Men.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">EM: Only men.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">DG: Men.</span> <span id="s169">I don’t know about how young they were, but that they were men.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">EM: Men, men.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">DG: My mother and my father had discussed, you know, because at that particular time, you know, a lot of people were starting to think about hiding, leaving the country by any which way, you know, and my father and my mother talked about it saying, well, he was in very good health.</span> <span id="s172">My father was, I’m trying to remember he was like 40 years old, 42 years old.</span> <span id="s173">He was in good health.</span> <span id="s174">He said: “You know, the war has already been on for over two years, you know.”</span> <span id="s175">He says, “How much longer can it last, you know?”</span> <span id="s176">He says, “I--you know, I think I’ll go, you know, and I’ll be back shortly.</span> <span id="s177">It’s not gonna last very long.”</span> <span id="s178">That, I have to say that at that particular time, we had not heard about concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">EM: And that was in 1942 or ‘43?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">DG: Two.</span> <span id="s181">We had not heard about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s182">We had heard about labor camps but not the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s183">That’s the reason, you know, why my father actually decided to go.</span> <span id="s184">We went to the train station...</span></p> <p><span id="s185">EM: Do you remember what month it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">DG: August.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">EM: It was in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">DG: August, 1942.</span> <span id="s189">August-Sept-...</span></p> <p><span id="s190">EM: Right after, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">DG: August-September, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">EM: Yeah, OK OK</span></p> <p><span id="s193">DG: We went to the train station.</span> <span id="s194">The--this is the time that I really remember quite vividly.</span> <span id="s195">[pause; tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s196">EM: We have to interrupt for a while.</span> <span id="s197">Mr. Goldsmith is overcome by emotion.</span> <span id="s198">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s199">DG: We went to this train station.</span> <span id="s200">My mother, my father, and my little sister and I.</span> <span id="s201">The train station in Antwerp is a huge, I mean huge, train station, a covered train station.</span> <span id="s202">And there were thousands and thousands of people, same as us, you know, saying good-bye.</span> <span id="s203">And my father said to me, he says, “You’re now the man in the house.”</span> <span id="s204">[weeping; tape off then on] Anyway, he said, “You’re the man of the house now.”</span> <span id="s205">And he says, “You’ll have to take care of your mother and your sister until I come back.”</span> <span id="s206">And I told him I would.</span> <span id="s207">And that was the last time I saw my father.</span> <span id="s208">We heard from him a little bit later on.</span> <span id="s209">We received a post card which said that he was in France near Boulogne and that he was OK</span></p> <p><span id="s210">EM: And that’s all it said, that card?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">DG: That’s all it said.</span> <span id="s212">I’ll show you the card.</span> <span id="s213">And we went back to the house.</span> <span id="s214">We tried to live the normal life as possible, which was difficult, because, you’ve got to remember my sister was a year-and-a-half old.</span> <span id="s215">And we were not used to all these restrictions, you know, which had been imposed.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">EM: How about financially since your father couldn’t work much the previous year?</span> <span id="s217">Were you OK financially at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">DG: Well, my mother was strapped financially, because--but we did have some money.</span> <span id="s219">And what she wound up doing is as she needed some money she would sell some of my father’s tools, things like that, things that were precious.</span> <span id="s220">She had some sort of a foresight, I don’t know, it’s like a sixth sense.</span> <span id="s221">She figured, you know, things were gonna go wrong.</span> <span id="s222">And so she went across the street.</span> <span id="s223">We had this non-Jewish family that lived and had a grocery store.</span> <span id="s224">And she gave them our pictures.</span> <span id="s225">She asked them to hold onto our pictures.</span> <span id="s226">And she went to a couple of other neighbors and gave them our silverware to hold onto that, and gave to some other neighbors dishes, and to some other neighbors some of my father’s tools so that they would be saved.</span> <span id="s227">Not everybody would have everything at the same time.</span> <span id="s228">And when my father would come back, you know, it would be enough, you know, that we could start over, over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">EM: Could you tell me if at that time the Germans would come into Jewish homes and rob their houses or...</span></p> <p><span id="s230">DG: Well, they did more than that, because very shortly after my father left, there was a raid on our street.</span> <span id="s231">Now we lived in the Korte Kiebit Straat.</span> <span id="s232">It was a..</span> <span id="s233">.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">EM: Korte, what do you, how do you spell it or how could you...</span></p> <p><span id="s235">DG: Korte Kiebit Straat?</span> <span id="s236">It’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s237">EM: Korte Kiebits-...</span></p> <p><span id="s238">DG: Korte, which is, it means “little bird” I believe.</span> <span id="s239">It’s a kiebit bird.</span> <span id="s240">Korte, or “short” it’s actually.</span> <span id="s241">K-O-R-T-E, and Kiebit, K-I-E-B-I-T...</span></p> <p><span id="s242">EM: OK</span></p> <p><span id="s243">DG: Straat is “street.”</span></p> <p><span id="s244">EM: Oh, is street.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">DG: It was actually row homes.</span> <span id="s246">They were all attached.</span> <span id="s247">You know, two stories high.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">DG: And what happened very shortly after that was in the middle of the night sudden--we heard commotion.</span> <span id="s250">We, our house was #34, which was not at the end of the street.</span> <span id="s251">It was like towards, somewhat in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s252">So they, the Germans had blocked off both ends of the street.</span> <span id="s253">And what we heard a commotion was the yelling and the screaming that was going on, you know, when they came and they just took people right out of their beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">EM: But you said it was a little mixed neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">DG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">EM: Did they take the Belgians too?</span> <span id="s257">Or just...</span></p> <p><span id="s258">DG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">EM: The Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">DG: No, they didn’t, because that’s when the true colors showed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">EM: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">DG: Several of the non-Jews showed the Germans where the Jews lived.</span> <span id="s263">And when the--where the non-Jews lived, and they helped them.</span> <span id="s264">With that, I don’t know, my mother was, was a woman, you know, that had a good head and was also very heroic.</span> <span id="s265">She quickly took my sister and I and took us upstairs.</span> <span id="s266">We lived on the--it’s like the steps going up and we lived on the first floor.</span> <span id="s267">There was a second floor above us where, where there was a skylight, you know, that you could push up.</span> <span id="s268">She got a ladder and we climbed up onto the roof, you know, through the skylight.</span> <span id="s269">She got rid of, she knew, she pushed the ladder away.</span> <span id="s270">And we went and we hid.</span> <span id="s271">And the roof was slightly tilted, slightly tilted.</span> <span id="s272">And the front had a stone wall.</span> <span id="s273">And we hid...</span></p> <p><span id="s274">EM: Behind that...</span></p> <p><span id="s275">DG: Behind that wall, stone wall.</span> <span id="s276">It was very difficult of course because my sister was a little baby, you know, and you know, my mother was saying, “Shh, be quiet and don’t make any noises or anything like that.”</span> <span id="s277">In the meanwhile we could see and we could hear all the yelling and screaming that was going on of all the people that were being dragged out of their houses.</span> <span id="s278">And we saw some of them being beaten up.</span> <span id="s279">And we could finally hear, you know, where they came to our house.</span> <span id="s280">Because they rang the bell and when nothing happened over there they bashed in the doors, you know, and they came running through the house.</span> <span id="s281">And they didn’t see any, of course we weren’t there.</span> <span id="s282">They did go upstairs but when the skylight opened up, you know, we were here.</span> <span id="s283">The pitch was this way.</span> <span id="s284">The skylight opened up this way.</span> <span id="s285">And they just looked around and they didn’t see anything, fortunately for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">EM: So they didn’t take the ladder to go up there or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">DG: They did take the ladder...</span></p> <p><span id="s288">EM: They did take the ladder?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">DG: But they didn’t go onto the roof.</span> <span id="s290">They just poked their heads through and shown their flashlights.</span> <span id="s291">But they didn’t see us.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">EM: So that was at night you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">DG: At night, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">EM: At night, at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">DG: It was three, about 3:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s296">So, they left.</span> <span id="s297">And as soon as my mother made sure, you know, that it was safe to get back into the house, you know, we went back inside.</span> <span id="s298">And it was an absolute mess.</span> <span id="s299">They ransacked the whole house.</span> <span id="s300">There was no furniture that was left, you know, that wasn’t broken or anything like that.</span> <span id="s301">I mean it was a real mess.</span> <span id="s302">Because, we heard the whole commotion, you know, but we just didn’t know what was happening.</span> <span id="s303">And we couldn’t get out, because they had barricaded the door.</span> <span id="s304">You know, they had nailed the whole front shut.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">EM: Of the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">DG: Of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s307">EM: Of the apar-...</span></p> <p><span id="s308">DG: The door, the door of the house was nailed shut, because they had smashed the door in.</span> <span id="s309">And they nailed it shut.</span> <span id="s310">Now we lived behind the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s311">Remember I mentioned to you it’s a very, very--at that point we did not live too far from the train station.</span> <span id="s312">So at that point, you know, you have all the different tracks, you know, that are coming and so it’s a very wide...</span></p> <p><span id="s313">EM: Area?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">DG: Area.</span> <span id="s315">And our house was behind the railroad tracks and we had the house and the little backyard where we had the outhouse, because we didn’t have any indoor plumbing at that particular time, although we did have water.</span> <span id="s316">But we didn’t have a bathroom.</span> <span id="s317">So we used to take, you know, in the olden days, my mother had this big, I don’t know what you call it, the pan, a big pan or the vat, whatever it is, and she used to boil the water, you know, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s318">EM: And that’s how...</span></p> <p><span id="s319">DG: We would sit in it, you know, and that’s how we would get our baths.</span> <span id="s320">But anyway, when everything was quiet, you know, she told us not to make any sounds, you know, and not to do anything.</span> <span id="s321">And my mother left, at night.</span> <span id="s322">And my mother had already at that particular time...</span></p> <p><span id="s323">EM: What, did she get out through the window or...</span></p> <p><span id="s324">DG: She went out through the back yard.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">EM: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">DG: The back yard which was not, you know, the front was...</span></p> <p><span id="s327">EM: Was shut.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">DG: Shut, you know, but the back was not.</span> <span id="s329">And she was able, I don’t know how in the world she managed to climb up, you know, onto the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s330">But she did that and she was able to contact the underground.</span> <span id="s331">My mother had made, already had started, had enough sense to make contact with the Belgian underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">EM: Were these gentile Belgians, or were they Jews or mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">DG: Some, some of them were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">EM: Some of, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">DG: Some of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s336">That’s how she made contact with them.</span> <span id="s337">And what she was able to do, was able to make arrangements to place my sister and I in a convent.</span> <span id="s338">That was the first place, while she, you know, the convent was away, you know, from Antwerp, and it would be a safe place.</span> <span id="s339">So that’s where we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">EM: Who brought you to the convent?</span> <span id="s341">Did...</span></p> <p><span id="s342">DG: My mother did.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">DG: My mother did, and, and the, like I said the underground people helped her.</span> <span id="s345">Because they, they were the ones that brought the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">EM: You went by car?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">DG: We went by car.</span> <span id="s348">And all this was done at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">EM: Was that many days after that action that they had in--when they got all the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">DG: Yeah, it...</span></p> <p><span id="s351">EM: Was it several days later?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">DG: Several days later, yeah.</span> <span id="s353">Several days later.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">EM: But up to that time you stayed in the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">DG: In the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">EM: In the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">DG: Yeah.</span> <span id="s358">And we, we ate whatever food, you know, was left, you know, I mean that they didn’t break or anything.</span> <span id="s359">Because they just left a mess.</span> <span id="s360">I’m talking about, you know, everything was splattered on the floor, you know.</span> <span id="s361">Everything was broken.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">EM: Do you happen to know how many people were taken that day, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">DG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">EM: Were there any Jews left in...</span></p> <p><span id="s365">DG: Yes.</span> <span id="s366">There...</span></p> <p><span id="s367">EM: Antwerp after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">DG: Yeah, yes, there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">EM: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">DG: But they were like, sudden raids.</span> <span id="s371">They--I think there were several of these raids, you know, that happened, one after another.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">EM: Do you know where these people were taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">DG: No, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s374">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">EM: But they were all taken families.</span> <span id="s376">I mean women and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">DG: It was everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">EM: Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">DG: Everybody was taken out.</span> <span id="s380">Everybody was taken out.</span> <span id="s381">And what hurt, what hurt were these non-Jewish people that helped.</span> <span id="s382">Not, now I have to say this not everybody did.</span> <span id="s383">The people I was telling you about, the grocery store and all that, those people were wonderful people, and they did not help the Germans at all.</span> <span id="s384">They were decent people.</span> <span id="s385">But there were other people, there was one in particular I remember.</span> <span id="s386">And he was a policeman, that family that lived there.</span> <span id="s387">And they were going around, you know, showing the Germans, you know, where the Jews lived.</span> <span id="s388">So, we went to that convent and we didn’t stay there very long.</span> <span id="s389">We only stayed there for a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">EM: Did the people in the convent knew that you were Jewish, that these were Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">DG: There were very few people that knew.</span> <span id="s392">It was the Mother Superior.</span> <span id="s393">The Mother Superior knew, and a few nuns knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">EM: Were there many children in that convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">DG: Yes, there were a lot of children.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">EM: Mostly, many Jewish children do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">DG: No, there weren’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s398">EM: Or you don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">DG: Yes.</span> <span id="s400">There were some Jewish children, because what happened was in December suddenly my mother shows up and takes us out of there and as well and warned...</span></p> <p><span id="s401">EM: That was in, excuse me, that was in 1942, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">DG: December, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">EM: 1942.</span> <span id="s404">OK</span></p> <p><span id="s405">DG: December, 1942.</span> <span id="s406">My mother is, has been told by the underground that the Germans found out that there were Jews being hidden there and they were going to raid...</span></p> <p><span id="s407">EM: The convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">DG: The convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">EM: So she warned the Mother Superior.</span> <span id="s410">All the Jewish children were taken out of there.</span> <span id="s411">And so now my mother had the problem, you know, of being responsible for us again, you know, and then doing something.</span> <span id="s412">So she hid us, you know, with some Christian people that she knew.</span> <span id="s413">But we couldn’t stay there for very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">DG: Tell me, these non-Jewish people that took you in, were they being paid or did they do it for nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">EM: They did it for nothing.</span> <span id="s416">The people that my mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s418">EM: This is tape one, side two, interview with Mr. Daniel Goldsmith, Edith Millman interviewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">DG: So again I’ll repeat.</span> <span id="s420">The people that my mother dealt with, they did it without any pay.</span> <span id="s421">They were humanitarian people.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">EM: Was there any punishment if they had been caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">DG: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s424">It would have been, it was death.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">EM: Was the dea-...</span></p> <p><span id="s426">DG: Death.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">EM: Did they threaten with death or...</span></p> <p><span id="s428">DG: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s429">Because they, part of the edicts, you know, which came out, you know, when the, all the restrictions were coming, after the raids, OK, the edict came out you know that, you know, you can not deal with a Jew.</span> <span id="s430">You can not hide a Jew, you know, on the punishment of death.</span> <span id="s431">So, through them, my mother decided, through them meaning the Belgian underground, my mother decided to split my sister and I up.</span> <span id="s432">And so what she wound up doing is placing my sister with a private Christian family.</span> <span id="s433">And myself, she wound up placing me in an orphanage.</span> <span id="s434">The orphanage was run by a Father Cornelius, who had several orphanages.</span> <span id="s435">He was a very good man, but he also was a Catholic man.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">EM: It wasn’t a monastery or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">DG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">EM: It was an orphanage run...</span></p> <p><span id="s439">DG: It was an orphanage for boys.</span> <span id="s440">Orphanage for boys, where the first orphanage where they took me, you know, which was in Weelde, you know, was actually a very nice place because...</span></p> <p><span id="s441">EM: You, you’re talking about the convent now?</span> <span id="s442">Where was the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">DG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">EM: Where is the...</span></p> <p><span id="s445">DG: I don’t know where the convent was.</span> <span id="s446">That’s one thing I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">EM: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">DG: I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s449">And neither did my mother.</span> <span id="s450">Otherwise I would have made a point...</span></p> <p><span id="s451">EM: Con-...</span></p> <p><span id="s452">DG: You know, to find out.</span> <span id="s453">But she just couldn’t remember where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">EM: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s455">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s456">DG: But...</span></p> <p><span id="s457">EM: So then you went to an orphanage.</span> <span id="s458">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s459">DG: And then I went to an orphanage, right.</span> <span id="s460">And this orphanage, like I said was in Weelde.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">EM: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">DG: That’s W-E-E-L-D-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">EM: OK.</span> <span id="s464">OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">DG: Weelde.</span> <span id="s466">And like I said, you know, it was run by Father Cornelius, oh, not Cornelius.</span> <span id="s467">Cornelissen, Cornelissen.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">EM: Cornelissen.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">DG: C-O-R-N-E-L-I-S-S-E-N.</span> <span id="s470">Cornelissen.</span> <span id="s471">And it was a very nice place.</span> <span id="s472">I’m talking about the place, you know, where you learned farming, you know, where you were out in the open air, where you raised animals, particularly pigs.</span> <span id="s473">Things like that, you learned, you learned quite a bit over there.</span> <span id="s474">One thing I have to say is that he also was a Catholic priest, you know, and he tried very hard to convert me.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">EM: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">DG: But I would not convert.</span> <span id="s477">Because with--I always had with me a siddur [Hebrew prayer book].</span> <span id="s478">This was the one thing that I always had with me, a siddur.</span> <span id="s479">And he was not successful, you know, in converting me.</span> <span id="s480">However, he had to make sure, you know, that I was not conspicuous, you know, with the other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">DG: OK, because he was the only one that knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s483">No one else knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">EM: Do you know if you were the only Jewish child?</span> <span id="s485">Or do you think there were...</span></p> <p><span id="s486">DG: In that orphanage, I think I was.</span> <span id="s487">There was a second orphanage which I know I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s488">And I’ll explain that to you later on.</span> <span id="s489">The--what he did, you know, is he made me go, you know, into Catholic school, like with the other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">EM: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">DG: And that kind of made things, you know, a lot easier.</span> <span id="s492">But he wasn’t, he didn’t want, you know, to leave things alone because he wasn’t too sure, you know, if I would be found out or what, you know.</span> <span id="s493">So he moved me.</span> <span id="s494">After a while he moved me to the other orphanage, which was in Mechelen.</span> <span id="s495">That particular orphanage...</span></p> <p><span id="s496">EM: He was also in charge?</span> <span id="s497">I mean he...</span></p> <p><span id="s498">DG: Yeah, he was in charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">EM: He had connection with...</span></p> <p><span id="s500">DG: He had...</span></p> <p><span id="s501">EM: Both orphanages?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">DG: Yeah.</span> <span id="s503">That one, you know, however, I didn’t know it at that particular time but I found out later on that there were more Jewish children there.</span> <span id="s504">And there, not only did I go to Catholic school, but I went to church.</span> <span id="s505">I became an altar boy.</span> <span id="s506">I learned everything about Catholicism.</span> <span id="s507">And, oh...</span></p> <p><span id="s508">EM: What was the name of that orphanage, do you remember?</span> <span id="s509">The second orphanage.</span> <span id="s510">Or do you know where it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">DG: In, I only know the name of the orphanage was in Mechelen.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">EM: In Mech-...</span></p> <p><span id="s513">DG: Mechelen.</span> <span id="s514">It’s spelled M-E-C-H-E-L-E-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">EM: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">DG: But I don’t remember exactly the name of it per se.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">EM: OK, if it doesn’t come...</span></p> <p><span id="s518">DG: But that was an orphanage in Mechelen where--and by the way, what he also did in order to make things a lot more, let’s say right for the outside world, is he created false baptismal papers for me.</span> <span id="s519">This is, again, he was trying to get them legitimately by converting me.</span> <span id="s520">But since I didn’t, you know, he finally did agree, you know, to make the false baptismal pa-, and also changed my name.</span> <span id="s521">And my name at that--when I was in the orphanage, was Willie Peters, which is a typical Belgian...</span></p> <p><span id="s522">EM: Willie.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">DG: Willie Peters, a typical Belgian name.</span> <span id="s524">In there, like I said, everything--I went to school--and everything, you know, seemed to be basically normal.</span> <span id="s525">Now we’re talking already about, you know, going from, you know, in the first orphanage it was in 1943, OK?</span> <span id="s526">Now we’re talking about the end of 1943 is when he put me in the other orphanage.</span> <span id="s527">And now we’re talking about the beginning of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">EM: So that that time you were about 13 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">DG: No, 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">EM: 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">DG: 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">EM: 12, OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">DG: 12 years old.</span> <span id="s534">Because I was born in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">EM: Oh, I see, OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">DG: OK, of the year, so I was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s537">And then everything was coming along okay until one day suddenly the Germans showed up, under the clear blue sky.</span> <span id="s538">And what they did is they gathered all the boys--it was a very simple thing for them to do--and they made everybody undress.</span> <span id="s539">And everybody that was Jewish was circumcised.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">EM: And the Belgian usually don’t circumcise?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">DG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">EM: They’re not circumcised.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">DG: They’re not circumcised.</span> <span id="s544">There was one other little boy that had a problem because he did have an operation on his penis, but it was not a circumcision.</span> <span id="s545">But they took him anyway, you know, because they weren’t sure, you know.</span> <span id="s546">But, here we were, you know, all the Jewish kids, even though we didn’t know by ourselves, you know, that we were Jewish, amongst ourselves.</span> <span id="s547">But the Jewish kids were circumcised.</span> <span id="s548">And nothing helped.</span> <span id="s549">The papers didn’t help, you know, the name didn’t help.</span> <span id="s550">All the witnesses didn’t help.</span> <span id="s551">And nothing helped.</span> <span id="s552">So they took us to prison.</span> <span id="s553">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s554">EM: How many children were with you, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">DG: Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">EM: Six boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">DG: Six boys.</span> <span id="s558">They took us to prison and over there, you know, they tried to, you know, to find out, you know, if we knew more, you know.</span> <span id="s559">There was questioning going on.</span> <span id="s560">By that time, by the way, it was May...</span></p> <p><span id="s561">EM: Of ‘44?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">DG: May of ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">EM: ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">DG: May ‘44.</span> <span id="s565">And none of us knew, you know.</span> <span id="s566">So they had no use for us anymore.</span> <span id="s567">And so what happened was, you know, they put us on a train.</span> <span id="s568">And they put--but, in the prison, you know, I met other children.</span> <span id="s569">I mean it wasn’t just us, you know, there were other children that were there.</span> <span id="s570">They put us on a train.</span> <span id="s571">And we started going, we didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s572">But there was this one young boy, you know, who was older than we were, you know, who was a real fighter.</span> <span id="s573">And he says, “You know, we have to escape from the train.”</span> <span id="s574">And that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s575">We escaped from the train.</span> <span id="s576">Twenty, about twenty children, you know, were able to leave...</span></p> <p><span id="s577">EM: Was it a regular train or was it one of the cattle car trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">DG: Yeah, one of those cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">EM: Cattle, a cattle car train.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">DG: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s581">EM: How did you escape?</span> <span id="s582">How did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">DG: He did it by, I don’t know where he got hold from, we got a hold of a piece of iron.</span> <span id="s584">And he was able to, to--now, the other thing that I want to say, even though this was a train, you know, it was apparently, apparently it was not as well guarded as you would--some of the other trains were, because, I don’t know for what reason.</span> <span id="s585">But whatever it was it wasn’t as well guarded, so that he was able to take the metal piece that he had with him and break the piece of wood enough, you know, for us to slide through.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">EM: Well was the train moving or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">DG: Yeah.</span> <span id="s588">But what he did is he waited, you know, for when the train was slowing down at a curve.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">DG: And then it’s when he said, “Go!”</span> <span id="s591">So that’s how we escaped.</span> <span id="s592">Now, once we all got back together again, because we all got, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s593">EM: They jumped out at...</span></p> <p><span id="s594">DG: We jumped at different places.</span> <span id="s595">We all got back together again.</span> <span id="s596">And the first thing that we did is, again, two things.</span> <span id="s597">It happened at night, OK?</span> <span id="s598">And fortunately for us, we were near a group of trees.</span> <span id="s599">It was not a forest per se, you know, but certainly a group of trees, you know, where we were able, you know, to get in there and hide.</span> <span id="s600">But we didn’t know where we were.</span> <span id="s601">We didn’t know where we were.</span> <span id="s602">So we decided, you know, to hide during the day and at night, you know, to, like a couple of us, you know, older ones, you know, would go out and try to find out, you know, where we were.</span> <span id="s603">And try, we couldn’t talk to anybody, but at least, you know, if you could see a sign, you know, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">EM: Were you still in Belgium?</span> <span id="s605">In...</span></p> <p><span id="s606">DG: Yeah, we were still in Belgium.</span> <span id="s607">And what we wound up doing, once we found out we were in Belgium, the oldest boy went to a church.</span> <span id="s608">I mean it was very, very risky, you know, but we felt, you know, we had no other choice.</span> <span id="s609">Went to a church, spoke to the father over there, and we hit it lucky.</span> <span id="s610">He took us in, and what he did is he placed every one of us with a Christian family, but nobody knew where anybody was.</span> <span id="s611">And the other Christian families didn’t know that there were other children, you know, in town, being hidden.</span> <span id="s612">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s613">Nobody knew, only the priest.</span> <span id="s614">And I was placed with this one family, Monsieur and Madame Botier.</span> <span id="s615">And what they did is they hid me in the attic.</span> <span id="s616">One of the good things about this, though, was that--I couldn’t show my face, of course, you know, I couldn’t see or hear anything--was that they had a, again, this is one of these little villages, you know, where all the houses are attached.</span> <span id="s617">So you have long, deep gardens, you know, they had.</span> <span id="s618">So I was able to at least go out at night because there was no light.</span> <span id="s619">And I had to do it very quietly.</span> <span id="s620">And I spent some time outside at night.</span> <span id="s621">But during the day I was up in the attic.</span> <span id="s622">People were very, very kind to me.</span> <span id="s623">They were older people.</span> <span id="s624">They had two daughters.</span> <span id="s625">At that particular time one was 18; I believe the other one was about 20.</span> <span id="s626">And they kept me there until we got liberated.</span> <span id="s627">Now remember, I’m in Belgium, OK?</span> <span id="s628">So we got liberated in September, 1944.</span> <span id="s629">Remember, June is when the invasion started, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s630">EM: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s631">DG: And we got liberated in September, 1944.</span> <span id="s632">And I even have a couple of pictures I brought with me.</span> <span id="s633">They’re not very good pictures but that was the liberation of the town.</span> <span id="s634">And, OK, let me regress a little bit, OK?</span> <span id="s635">My mother knew where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">EM: How...</span></p> <p><span id="s637">DG: But she also found out that, through the underground, of course.</span> <span id="s638">You know, she knew the priest, you know, and she knew through the underground, you know, where I was.</span> <span id="s639">But she also found out from the underground that I had been captured.</span> <span id="s640">So she started looking for me, because she didn’t know where I was.</span> <span id="s641">And my mother was in a--looking for me through another priest, a wonderful, wonderful man by the name of Father André.</span> <span id="s642">And this is in the city of Namur, which is also in Belgium.</span> <span id="s643">Just a side note: Father André was recognized as a Righteous Gentile.</span> <span id="s644">[pause; tape off then on] He was recognized as a Righteous Gentile and his picture is one of the pictures that are on the United States Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s645">And of course his picture, I have a picture of him, you know, when he was much younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">DG: But now he’s passed away since.</span> <span id="s648">But he’s much older...</span></p> <p><span id="s649">EM: So, he must have been in touch with the underground...</span></p> <p><span id="s650">DG: Yes he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">EM: At the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">DG: And he saved a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s653">He was a wonderful, wonderful person.</span> <span id="s654">Here’s another person, you know, he didn’t take any money.</span> <span id="s655">And he helped a lot of Jews after the war also.</span> <span id="s656">Anyway, my mother was looking for me.</span> <span id="s657">And she was in a city in Namur.</span> <span id="s658">And there was an air raid, an Allied air raid.</span> <span id="s659">And my mother got caught in that air raid.</span> <span id="s660">And she lost a leg in the air raid.</span> <span id="s661">As a matter of fact, she was the only person that survived in that building.</span> <span id="s662">But she almost died because she was bleeding, you know, and her leg had been severed from her.</span> <span id="s663">And they took her to the hospital.</span> <span id="s664">And so when--this happened just before the liberation.</span> <span id="s665">And after we got liberated, Monsieur and Madame Botier, you know, they got in touch, you know, with the underground and they were trying to locate my mother.</span> <span id="s666">And they finally found my mother in the hospital.</span> <span id="s667">And I went to see her.</span> <span id="s668">And I almost didn’t recognize her.</span> <span id="s669">She aged twenty years.</span> <span id="s670">I mean she was white as a sheet and her hair was gray.</span> <span id="s671">And of course she was in terrible shape, you know.</span> <span id="s672">But eventually, you know, everything worked out OK and she came out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">EM: Tell me, all this time was she on false papers?</span> <span id="s674">Or how did she go about, you know, who was hiding her or [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s675">DG: She was, all this time, I mean, she was actually working with the, with the Belgian underground.</span> <span id="s676">She had false papers also.</span> <span id="s677">She was caught--I can’t believe this--four times, and escaped four times.</span> <span id="s678">She was just absolutely heroic.</span> <span id="s679">And all this, I have to tell you this, all this was because of the light at the end of the tunnel, which basically was the hope, you know, that my father would come back, you know.</span> <span id="s680">We would be able, you know, to start a family again and be a family again.</span> <span id="s681">Later on she told me if she had known my father had been killed she wouldn’t have done all this.</span> <span id="s682">And I believe her.</span> <span id="s683">I believe her.</span> <span id="s684">So, she moved around.</span> <span id="s685">She was never in one place, you know, for very long.</span> <span id="s686">She moved around a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">EM: Tell me, now, tell me about, well, first of all, what happened to you later?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">DG: Oh, after...</span></p> <p><span id="s689">EM: So you were liberated when, in ‘44?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">DG: In September, 1944.</span> <span id="s691">And then very shortly after that the--I forgot the, it’s a French committee, you know, for, you know, that helps Jewish children--went ahead and started collecting Jewish children from the Christian homes, and to try to bring them back together again, to try to reunite them with a, you know, with whatever family there would be later on, OK, and also to try to start a new life.</span> <span id="s692">I mean, after all, all these children, you know, missed several years, you know, of their childhood.</span> <span id="s693">So we were first put in a place called Hommes de la-bas, which again was a chateau.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">EM: Was that in France or in...</span></p> <p><span id="s695">DG: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">EM: Belgium.</span> <span id="s697">In Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">DG: This is always in Belgium.</span> <span id="s699">Hommes de la-bas was in Belgium, which was a chateau.</span> <span id="s700">Actually it was a big chateau, because half of the chateau, I’ll never forget this, was occupied by us, and the other half was occupied by American troops.</span> <span id="s701">And I remember very vividly Thanksgiving 1944, because we had never heard, you know, of Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s702">It was the first time we saw white bread, you know, and how you celebrate and how the Americans were celebrating the...</span></p> <p><span id="s703">EM: Thanksgiving.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">DG: The Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s705">And little by little, you know, we, they were bringing us together.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">EM: But at that time you knew that your mother was alive.</span> <span id="s707">You were in touch with your mother at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">DG: Yes.</span> <span id="s709">At that time I knew my mother was alive and also that my mother couldn’t take care of me, you know.</span> <span id="s710">But so...</span></p> <p><span id="s711">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">DG: You know, because she was in the hospital for a very, very long time, a very long time.</span> <span id="s713">It was not only, the reason she was in the hospital for a long time was not only because she had lost a tremendous amount of blood, and that’s how close she was to death, but she had to regain her strength.</span> <span id="s714">And then she wound up having, literally having a peg leg, because she had a very, very short stump left, you know.</span> <span id="s715">She didn’t have an awful lot of her leg left.</span> <span id="s716">She had a very short stump left and it would have been very difficult, you know, for her, you know, to learn how to walk, because of the short stump.</span> <span id="s717">So they kept her in the hospital for a long time.</span> <span id="s718">Anyway, after they got us, you know, from the Hommes de la-bas, we stayed there for a few months and they started bringing in other children.</span> <span id="s719">Now these were children now that were starting to come in, you know, from Holland, from Germany, from Czechoslovakia, from Hungary, from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s720">These children actually were, this is why, what I mean by displaced persons camp, OK?</span> <span id="s721">Because it was not the same thing as they had in Germany but this was strictly for children.</span> <span id="s722">But these children knew for a fact, you know, they had lost their families.</span> <span id="s723">There was no place for them else to go.</span> <span id="s724">So, once we were a fairly large group, then they transferred us to another place, which was this place Aische En Refail, OK?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">EM: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">DG: Aische En Refail, it’s three words.</span> <span id="s727">It’s Aische, A-I-S-C-H-E, En, E-N...</span></p> <p><span id="s728">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">DG: Refail, I believe it’s R-E-F-A-I-L.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">EM: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">DG: You know, Aische En Refail.</span> <span id="s732">And that was a house, a fairly decent large house in which they took all of us children, OK?</span> <span id="s733">This is the place actually, it was in the country, it was on top of a hill.</span> <span id="s734">It had a beautiful view of the surrounding, you know, countryside.</span> <span id="s735">And this is the place where we started to learn how to live again.</span> <span id="s736">It was run, you know, by a doctor and his wife.</span> <span id="s737">And we started to learn...</span></p> <p><span id="s738">EM: Were they Belgian or French, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">DG: No, they were Belgian, Belgian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">EM: Belgian.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">DG: Belgian Jews.</span> <span id="s742">Where we learned the basics of life so to speak, again.</span> <span id="s743">They separated us in groups of, in different groups in different ages, you know.</span> <span id="s744">We started learning things again.</span> <span id="s745">At the same token, at the...</span></p> <p><span id="s746">EM: The same...</span></p> <p><span id="s747">DG: At the same time, I should say, the Palestinians, Jews, the Haganah, actually, sent people over to help us learn Hebrew, and to start learning, you know, what is called Hachsharah, which means, you know, to learn, work, you know, in the fields, you know, and agriculture and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">EM: So were children being taken out from there through the Aliyah Bet, through the illegal Aliyah [immigration to Palestine], to go...</span></p> <p><span id="s749">DG: Some of them wound up in the illegal Aliyah, yeah, eventually.</span> <span id="s750">I didn’t see anybody go, OK?</span> <span id="s751">But some of them did wind up, because most of these children wound up in Israel.</span> <span id="s752">You know, they did...</span></p> <p><span id="s753">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">DG: A lot of them wound up in Cyprus, until they finally got to Israel.</span> <span id="s755">How I know that is really because the correspondence I used to have with them, you know, after the war.</span> <span id="s756">Unfortunately a lot of the correspondence got lost, but I do have some pictures so I can show you that.</span> <span id="s757">We had the pleasure of seeing the Jewish Brigade.</span> <span id="s758">I don’t know whether you’re aware but the Jewish Brigade, you know, was the Palestinian, you know, Jewish soldiers, you know, that fought with the British?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">EM: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">DG: And they came to see us and we went to see them.</span> <span id="s761">And so we started living again.</span> <span id="s762">I’m talking about we started keeping Shabbas again, you know.</span> <span id="s763">We started davening [saying prayers].</span> <span id="s764">We started learning.</span> <span id="s765">We started going places.</span> <span id="s766">We started life again, except it was just amongst us none of us had any parents, you know, to go to.</span> <span id="s767">We didn’t know, you know, what was happening, whether we were going to have any parents.</span> <span id="s768">Because believe it or not, for us this was the most difficult part of the war, because now, you live for hope, OK.</span> <span id="s769">And now, the end has come.</span> <span id="s770">The war end has come, and now you’re trying to hope, you know, and making sure, you know, that so-and-so is coming back and so-and-so is coming back.</span> <span id="s771">Those were very, very, very difficult times.</span> <span id="s772">Most of us never saw our parents again, most of us.</span> <span id="s773">In my case, of course, I saw my mother, you know, but my father, you know, didn’t come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">EM: Now tell me about your sister.</span> <span id="s775">What happened with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">DG: Oh.</span> <span id="s777">My sister was with a Christian family, which was very, very good to her.</span> <span id="s778">They really raised her.</span> <span id="s779">But there is a sad part to this story, and that is it’s, it happened many times over and over again.</span> <span id="s780">When you give a family a baby, like remember my sister was a year-and-a-half, almost two years old, and she spends two, two-and-a-half years with them, they become very, very attached to her, which is very, very understandable.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">DG: And so, it was 1945.</span> <span id="s783">So you’re talking about my sister basically spent three years with them.</span> <span id="s784">In 1945, before my mother finally had enough energy and strength, you know, to come out of the hospital, at that point she is looking to claim her child.</span> <span id="s785">The problem is, you know, these people didn’t want to give her up.</span> <span id="s786">It’s a tragedy.</span> <span id="s787">It’s a tragedy, I mean, you know, for the people who actually, you know, treated her very, very nicely.</span> <span id="s788">They, she became part of their family.</span> <span id="s789">But it’s also my mother’s child and she wants her back.</span> <span id="s790">So, it became a battle.</span> <span id="s791">Fortunately, unknown to us, my father’s younger brother, the one that I had talked to you about that was the last one to leave home, came to Belgium as an American soldier, and started looking for us.</span> <span id="s792">And he found us.</span> <span id="s793">He found us just about the time, you know, when my mother was having a hard time, you know, with these people.</span> <span id="s794">And so this is my uncle Moishe.</span> <span id="s795">And he used his influence as an American and as a, with American authority, you know?</span> <span id="s796">And he took my sister away from them.</span> <span id="s797">So here is...</span></p> <p><span id="s798">EM: Did your sister have a rough time adjusting to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">DG: She, it’s, it's yes and no.</span> <span id="s800">Yes, because my mother in essence was a stranger to her, you know, at that particular time.</span> <span id="s801">But no, because when they took my sister away from them, you know, they put my sister with me.</span> <span id="s802">And that was with--in the home that I was in, OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">EM: Oh, OK</span></p> <p><span id="s804">DG: Which is the home that I was telling you about in Porfancar, in Aische En Refail.</span> <span id="s805">And there she was with other children, you know.</span> <span id="s806">And myself, you know, being able, you know, to tell her, you know, who she is, etc., etc., it made things a lot easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">EM: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">DG: OK?</span> <span id="s809">And after my mother got out of the hospital, she still couldn’t take care of us, because she couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s810">She was in the process, actually, with the help of Father André, in trying to get an artificial leg.</span> <span id="s811">So she had a hard time with that.</span> <span id="s812">So they transferred us from, now from this home to another home which was the Hachsharah of Marquin.</span> <span id="s813">It was like a school, again, a very, very large place.</span> <span id="s814">This was more religious.</span> <span id="s815">It was more Orthodox.</span> <span id="s816">And the same thing, it belonged to B’nai Akiva.</span> <span id="s817">But the point was, you know, to teach us a trade, to teach us how to take care of the land, you know, to prepare us, you know, to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s819">EM: Edith Millman interviewing Mr. Daniel Goldsmith.</span> <span id="s820">Today is February 6, 1995.</span> <span id="s821">This is tape two, side one.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">DG: OK, so now we’re talking about already in 1947.</span> <span id="s823">And in Marquin...</span></p> <p><span id="s824">EM: How do you spell Marquin?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">DG: Marquin is M-A-R-Q-U-I-N, Marquin.</span> <span id="s826">In Marquin, you know, I started to learn machine shop and also, you know, agriculture.</span> <span id="s827">Also, you know, within that period of time my mother was getting much better.</span> <span id="s828">And what I didn’t know is that my mother had been in touch, you know, with my father’s family.</span> <span id="s829">And again, you know, she had been trying, you know, to get us to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s830">And sure enough, you know, by the end of 1947, you know, she had gotten all the necessary papers, you know, to go to the States.</span> <span id="s831">So, it was actually in 1948, April, 1948, that we immigrated, you know, from Belgium--my mother, my sister and I--to the United States.</span> <span id="s832">And we went to New York, you know, where we met my father’s family.</span> <span id="s833">They’re the ones actually that sponsored us.</span> <span id="s834">And what they wound up doing, though, you know, was not to our liking, which basically was, here we thought we were going to live as a family.</span> <span id="s835">As it turned out, when we got to the States they split us up again.</span> <span id="s836">They put my mother with one aunt and uncle and my sister with another aunt and uncle and myself with another aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s837">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s838">EM: These were siblings of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">DG: Yes.</span> <span id="s840">These are, all...</span></p> <p><span id="s841">EM: Yeah, all...</span></p> <p><span id="s842">DG: Brothers and sisters of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">EM: Brothers, sisters, OK</span></p> <p><span id="s844">DG: Older brothers and sisters of my father.</span> <span id="s845">I had an occasion, you know, to be at a dinner, you know, with all the family, you know, when they wanted to find out from my mother, you know, what happened during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s846">And she told them about it.</span> <span id="s847">And I found out right there and then that they didn’t understand by my uncle, who was the patriarch of the family, you know, after my mother finished talking.</span> <span id="s848">He said, “You know,” he said, “you know, we suffered over here also.”</span> <span id="s849">And my mother said, “In what way?”</span> <span id="s850">He says, “We had a Depression over here.”</span> <span id="s851">And that’s when I turned to my mother and I said, “Mom, they don’t understand.”</span> <span id="s852">So, my mother, you know, being an invalid so to speak, because she could hardly walk, I mean it was very difficult for her to walk, she was trying to get the family, you know, to help her, you know, to get established and all that.</span> <span id="s853">And they just wouldn’t do anything for her.</span> <span id="s854">So finally one day, you know, she decided, I mean, enough is enough.</span> <span id="s855">We didn’t come to the United States, you know, to live in three separate areas.</span> <span id="s856">She went to HIAS and they put us up in a hotel while she went and looked for an apartment.</span> <span id="s857">And she finally found an apartment, even though it was a cold water flat in Brooklyn, it was good enough for us because we were gonna be together, you know.</span> <span id="s858">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s859">We moved to Brooklyn and from there, you know, my mother became a merrow operator.</span> <span id="s860">I don’t know if you’re familiar with that.</span> <span id="s861">You make sweaters...</span></p> <p><span id="s862">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">DG: You have to sew the collars and the sleeves and the rest, the pockets and everything.</span> <span id="s864">That’s what my mother did.</span> <span id="s865">You know she, you know that was all that she could do, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">DG: And we lived in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s868">I started being, you know, going back to school, you know, and being educated, and my sister the same thing.</span> <span id="s869">And that’s how we lived after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">EM: OK Now, when did you, you did get married, correct?</span></p>

the way they did it in those days was they made you spend a month, sometimes two months in various different departments so that you know, you know, how each department works, OK?</span> <span id="s898">And that’s what I was doing at that particular time.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">EM: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s900">DG: And that’s when we decided to move to North Bellmore where we bought our first house.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">EM: OK.</span> <span id="s902">Now, your children are married, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">DG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">EM: And

with a few other things.</span> <span id="s917">But right now basically that says it all in a nutshell.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">EM: There, one thing that I would like to come back to is your experience with the clergy, the Catholic clergy.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">DG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">EM: So and, overall it was a good experience now, mainly?</span></p> <p><span
