not Sibyl --</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yes, but you know, it’s Sibylle, really, I be -- in this country, I prefer to be called Sibylle.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Sibylle.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s31">And when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: On the 10th of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: And the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: 1923, okay.</span> <span id="s36">Somehow I thought it was 1924.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: But no, it’s 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I was born Potsdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: And did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: The cradle of Prussian military.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Yes?</span> <span id="s45">And how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Until I was two and a half years old, that’s when my family moved to -- my father had a new position, and we moved to Berlin, but not to Berlin Dahlem yet, but we stayed in -- in another half suburb of Berlin, which was known for being nice, and quiet, and cheap.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s48">So tell me -- I would like to get a sense of your family.</span> <span id="s49">Tell me about your mother first, and then we’ll go to your father, and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: -- and what the home life was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Oh, by the way, since you asked my -- my names, I was not -- the authorities have to come to my parents after my birth to tell them what my name was going to be.</span> <span id="s53">They had not counted on a girl.</span> <span id="s54">I was to be -- I was to be a boy because my father had lost his three brothers --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: -- in the first World War, which was such a tragedy.</span> <span id="s57">And here comes a girl, so not everybody was terribly amused.</span> <span id="s58">My mother -- I was my mother’s second child, because she had been married before, she wa -- married at age 19, a Baron von Hornstein, who not only had a Jewish grandmother, but was the rightful heir to the name -- I’m sorry, he was the child -- he was the great, great grandchild of Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton.</span> <span id="s59">That’s the one thing I en -- I always envied my sister who -- my stepsister -- half sister, who is 10 years older than I am, always envied her for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: So your mother married into that family?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: My mother married into that family, that was a zo -- the -- they are -- that was old nobility around Lake Constance, and very Catholic, so she had to agree that in case my half sister was born as a boy that he had to be brought up Catholic, which is, I think, a very brutal decision to split a family that way.</span> <span id="s62">Well but so he was bor -- he was baptized in the Protestant faith, and then my mother lost her husband during the first few weeks of the first World War, and became very ill with tuberculosis, which meant she -- thanks to the help of the friend of the family, the victor -- Queen Victoria’s great grand-nephew, the count of Coburg and Gotha -- not count, I’m sorry, the duke of Coburg and Gotha saw to it that she was put in a -- in a -- a sanitorium, and she survived very well.</span> <span id="s63">She died at 93.</span> <span id="s64">My mother’s family is by far -- is lo -- a lot older than my father’s family.</span> <span id="s65">My father’s family, of which I’ll talk later, they were really newcomers to nobility, meaning they were mor -- they were nobilized in 1657, while my mother’s family goes back to -- to Charlemagne, documented.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s68">And they were partially -- they we -- they came from the east, how much Slavic influence there was, we can only guess.</span> <span id="s69">A lot, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Well, I -- sometimes, you know, the Vens, that Slavic tribe that ruled Germany between the river Rhine and the -- and the -- or not -- not the Rhine, the Elba, and the Oda, they ruled in Germany, a wild tribe, for three to 400 years.</span> <span id="s72">So everybody has Vendish, Solbic, Serbic blood in them.</span> <span id="s73">And my mother was born -- my mother’s father was a Prussian general, and he had been one of -- his name was von Brauchitsch, Brokovitce, you know, God knows what it was originally.</span> <span id="s74">And my -- my grandfather was a Prussian general, as was my father’s father.</span> <span id="s75">And he was one of 23 children.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: 23?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes, his father had married several times, and there were your children, my children, our children.</span> <span id="s78">And there are funny legends going around about that family like a -- a Brauchitsch officer stopped the little guy on -- in -- in a military school, asked for his name and then found out they were brothers.</span> <span id="s79">How many of them are true, I never -- I call them legends.</span> <span id="s80">So they were -- they didn’t have much money of course, and my -- my --</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So being nobility didn’t mean that you had money?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Oh, absolutely not --</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: So you had privilege?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: -- I mean, that’s how the Crusades once started.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Get the second and third son, get them out of the way, give them something to do.</span> <span id="s87">And no -- and the -- the -- my oldest uncle, my mother’s oldest brother, he inherited this fabulous castle, the Rimburg, which is on the border from Germany to Holland, to the Netherlands, and the n -- Holland claimed it after this last war, and my uncle was very happy about it, but then the Germans got it back.</span> <span id="s88">And my mother had -- there were six or seven children.</span> <span id="s89">Uncle Siegfried was the oldest, and my grandmother was 18 years old, and she had the baby, as was done in those days, at home, but thank goodness with the help of a -- of a doctor.</span> <span id="s90">And he wa -- wa -- held the baby and declared him dead, and put him on a chair, and after awhile that dead child began to howl and yell, and he -- he lived.</span> <span id="s91">And the -- the doctor told my -- my grandfather that that was to be the first and only child.</span> <span id="s92">Oh, the -- she had a Caesarian, which in those days, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s93">And after the Caesarian she had right away one more child after the other, seven altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s96">And died completely exhausted and spent at age 49.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: So this was your mother’s mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: That’s my mother’s mother.</span> <span id="s99">I never met her, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s101">Now was your mother educated?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No.</span> <span id="s103">Girls in those --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Girls were not educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: -- days, girls in those days were pitifully off.</span> <span id="s106">Really, she went to a -- she went to a girl’s school, I suppose, in wherever they lived.</span> <span id="s107">Oh my -- my grandfather had been the commander of Colmar, Alsatian Colmar, which then was German, which as a consequen -- which had a cra -- had a confer -- consequence.</span> <span id="s108">About 20 years after this past war, let’s say in 1965 or so, the French government offered French citizenship to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yeah, which was very nice, but my mother said, no, I’m 80 years old, you know, I might as well stay who I am and where I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: But she felt very much like li -- very Alsatian and spoke French with a strong Alsatian accent, which is funny.</span> <span id="s113">And from there he went to another military g-garrison in Silesia and finally to Potsdam and in Potsdam it was time for the girls.</span> <span id="s114">After school my mother had -- had finishing school, one year in a finishing school in Geneva.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: So this was a finishing school in order to be it -- to come out --</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Presentable, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: -- and -- oh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: I mean, her knowledge of things, be it mathematics, or -- or history, forget about it.</span> <span id="s119">She was -- and that -- that led to her debut before -- before the emperor, and that was mandatory.</span> <span id="s120">Otherwise, you -- she would never catch a husband.</span> <span id="s121">And so, you know, th -- how they managed, with their meager income, it was at that time meager because my -- my grandfather had to retire at age 55 because during a hunt, a hunter has mistaken his head for a hare, and put a load of what do you -- what do you call the BB gun --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Buckshot?</span> <span id="s123">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: -- BB in there, which he was not mortally wounded, but to get all the little pieces out of his scalp was impossible, so he could never wear a steel helmet again.</span> <span id="s125">A general without a helmet?</span> <span id="s126">Unthinkable.</span> <span id="s127">So he had to retire and live off a meager pension.</span> <span id="s128">They had just barely enough to eat and so did the ba -- the servants, you know, the life without food was thinkable, but not without servants.</span> <span id="s129">And then the -- my mother was taken to that wonderful ba -- ball of the year, and was pres -- officially presented to the majesties, and then other balls -- dances, followed, during which she met her first husband.</span> <span id="s130">Erich Baron von Hornstein, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: And is that when she becomes a baroness?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No, no, no, she had been a baroness.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Okay, she’s a baroness anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I -- only -- only -- only noble -- no -- people of nobility were invited there, others did not exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Exist, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Of course the -- the -- there was the so-called briefadle, which was the -- many of those which the Kaiser bestowed upon a person with great merits.</span> <span id="s137">But those were people that were looked down upon, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Yeah, because they were not true nobility.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: And among my ancestors is not a single bourgeois, not a single one.</span> <span id="s142">I mean, as far as we can go back, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s144">It’s all nobility [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: All nobility because they didn’t meet anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s147">So how did your mother meet your father?</span> <span id="s148">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Oh absolutely, my father and my mother -- of course, he was old nobility too [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: And they --</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: But not quite as old.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Not quite as old, but that was, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Didn’t -- that didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: That didn’t, no, no, you know.</span> <span id="s156">And they met socially in Potsdam.</span> <span id="s157">He was a very outstanding young officer.</span> <span id="s158">He had been put in military school with all his brothers at age eight, and that was a brutal education for this very sensitive boy.</span> <span id="s159">And he knew one thing, never mind what his father wanted, or what his -- his -- the plans that he had made for him, he will not enter the military as a -- choose the military as a career.</span> <span id="s160">His aim was become a diplomat and at a very young age, he became the adjutant of the then Reichschancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg.</span> <span id="s161">And in that capacity he -- he -- for instance, he took -- he took the declaration of war to the Kaiser personally to be signed.</span> <span id="s162">And he had -- he was a very promising young man who had probably become a vi -- finance mis -- minister or something like that.</span> <span id="s163">And then the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: And we’re talking World War І, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: World War І, of course.</span> <span id="s166">And my -- my brother and his -- my -- my father and his brothers went to war, and they all die -- they were all killed except my father, who had a terrible, terrible shrapnel wound right above the eye -- the ear, the left ear.</span> <span id="s167">And spent a year or so in military -- in military hospitals.</span> <span id="s168">Was operated on under brutal circumstances.</span> <span id="s169">And then he came home, and he found a mother who had, you know, who had been a proud woman with her beautiful four boys, and her -- her husband, a general for a husband.</span> <span id="s170">She was completely broken, of course, and ma -- and my grandfather, not as a consequence of that, but soon after the war, was hospitalized with what probably was Alzheimer, and he -- he lost his mind and he died be -- six months before I was born, to be his first grandchild.</span> <span id="s171">That was tragic.</span> <span id="s172">And my father’s family, they were all military.</span> <span id="s173">And -- and his grandfather was not only a general too, of course, but he was the -- in the cabinet of the duke -- of the Duke of Meklinburg, which was one of the states in Germany before the unification in 1917.</span> <span id="s174">But th -- and he was highly regarded, but the -- the -- the duke forgot something very important which he did with other people, to give him an estate for -- you know, as a thank you.</span> <span id="s175">So he was -- he was receiving a pension and there was no money there.</span> <span id="s176">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: So if nobility are not necessarily wealthy, do nobility have privilege?</span> <span id="s178">Is there -- is there something that comes?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Well they -- first of all they think they are better than others, of course, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Yes, that’s a self privilege, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: And -- and it car -- came close to it -- close to serfdom in many provinces.</span> <span id="s182">Not as badly as in Russia, but -- and some of them were -- were very, very good to their people, and I guess I learned from my -- my father how to treat people below you, always with the greatest respect.</span> <span id="s183">Never let them feel you’re in a bad mood, or that -- always say please and thank you and I still remember my father when our nanny, who was then a cook, when she approached a door with a full tray, he would jump up and open the door for her.</span> <span id="s184">And that was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: That was not typical?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Well, probably not.</span> <span id="s189">Not in my mother’s family, they weren’t that nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s191">Ho -- wh-what are your earliest memories as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Well, the birth of my brother, I was two and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: You do remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: I remember my br -- clearly my mo -- my brother, a yellow little something lying there, and I had not been prepared.</span> <span id="s195">You know, in those days you weren’t, because I mean, dis -- pregnancy was something very indecent.</span> <span id="s196">And -- but I remember my disappointment tha -- when they told me the stork had already le -- had already left -- the stork who brought my brother had already left, but he left me, as a present, a huge bag of candy.</span> <span id="s197">And what came out first was a wolf-like red -- Little Red Riding Hood wolf made of chocolate.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yeah, and that wa -- made it easier for me to accept my brother.</span> <span id="s200">And he is still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: And now I’m his younger sister, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Even though you were the older sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s206">This is Everhard?</span> <span id="s207">Is -- what [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: No, that’s -- it’s Freiderich Wilhelm.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Freiderich, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Freiderich Everhard --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Is the -- is --</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: -- was my mother’s youngest brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Y-Youngest brother, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And how do you remember your parents when you were so young?</span> <span id="s216">I mean di -- were you close --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Well, I remember my -- my mother as being almost aloof, very cool.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Cruel?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Cool.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Cool.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Very cool, and I never -- I cannot remember one single occasion where I sat on her lap.</span> <span id="s222">She couldn’t -- she never received love at home, so she couldn’t give love to her children, which was tragic.</span> <span id="s223">She had a horror of men because her father was -- had been after the daughters, which --</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Sexually.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s226">And it must have come to a scene once where my mother overheard her mother behind a closed door yelling, “And if you do that once more, I’m going to divorce you.”</span> <span id="s227">I mean, he never really touched them, you know, but it came pretty close.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: So how did you find out about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: My mother told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Later?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes, much later when I would understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: So she was afraid of her father?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: She was afraid of her father and in consequence of -- of all men, including God.</span> <span id="s234">She was afraid of God.</span> <span id="s235">She could deal with Jesus Christ, but not with God himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Did you ever see her be affectionate with your father?</span> <span id="s237">A: I don’t think once.</span> <span id="s238">Not even once.</span> <span id="s239">She was affectionate with my little brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: She was?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yes, and of course that made it very hard for me --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: For you.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: -- because I -- I was always told how homely I was.</span> <span id="s244">I had very little hair, the hair came late, and I was spindly little legs, you know, fresh.</span> <span id="s245">And I once overheard a terrible thing, which I -- at the time I couldn’t really interpret.</span> <span id="s246">Behind a -- a paravol, I overheard, in somebody else’s house, people talking and si -- once one lady said to, was it her husband, saying, “Unbelievable, that child and this beautiful mother?</span> <span id="s247">Those poor people.”</span> <span id="s248">So that was me.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: So you grow up feeling unattractive?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Unattractive and that lasts for quite a long time, until I found out at age 18 that I had something that my mother didn’t have.</span> <span id="s251">And that was called sex appeal.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s253">Now how did your father make you feel since you were much closer to him, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: My f -- fa -- father, as soon as he was home I climbed on his lap and he kissed me and Sunday mornings, I’ll -- I’ll sit at the foot of his bed and for -- for -- for -- for hours he would tell me stories, and never wo -- I would have done -- have been in my mother’s bed, unthinkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Now, did they sleep in separate rooms?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: This was -- this was what was done?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: That was -- yeah, that was done in our circles.</span> <span id="s259">Most of them slept in different room, but with door open so my father can -- could come and help my father.</span> <span id="s260">My father suffered from the most terrible nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Not only as far as the past was concerned, but it always ended with a horribly -- with this hoarse voice he’d say, “They are coming for me, they are coming for me.”</span> <span id="s263">“Sie holen mich, sie holen mich.” Well, one day they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: And it was -- and do you think at that point he was thinking of the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Very definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: And I was very surprised when I -- to find out someday that other people’s fathers didn’t have these nightmares.</span> <span id="s270">They didn’t yell out at night, he woke up the whole house.</span> <span id="s271">It happened at least once a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: It was that loud?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: It was the past that --</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: And would you run into his room?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: No, no, I knew my mo --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: You wouldn’t?</span> <span id="s277">So your mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: But I would -- I would get up at times because I heard my mother trying to comfort him.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: And to wake him up and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: But it was taken for granted.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Do you -- a-as you look back, as a young person, not as a -- not when you were a teenager or older than that, did you think that they had a good marriage, or was this not what one thought about very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes, I thought it was.</span> <span id="s285">They never fought, they were very respectful to -- to one another, but there was no -- no tenderness --</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: -- no -- no, it wasn’t -- just somehow -- I -- I could compare because th -- I-I adopted a family in the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: I talked about --</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Ditte, your friend.</span> <span id="s291">Ditte -- or Ditte.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Ditte.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Ditte.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: She is still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: And Ditte’s mother was Jewish.</span> <span id="s297">Of course, in those days denying she was, she looked like -- you would s -- notice it right away.</span> <span id="s298">But they had a regular Jewish family life, wonderful.</span> <span id="s299">And they adopted me, and I really -- you know, from a certain age on, from age nine and 10 on, was never anything but politics discussed at the dinner table.</span> <span id="s300">The atmosphere was grave at home, if not black.</span> <span id="s301">And we grew up without supervision, too, you know my mother could -- we were sent out into the street, I was a regular little Berlin street girl, unusual for our circles, very unusual.</span> <span id="s302">And -- but home, my home was with the Nickel family, really.</span> <span id="s303">The Nickels.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: So when did you f -- when did that start?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: That started -- we -- we entered -- we entered the lyceum, the high school together at age -- I was nine, Ditte was 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: So that’s when that started?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: That’s when that started, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: But now all through -- all through your childhood -- the Nazis don’t take over until ’33.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: But there’s a lot of ferment in Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: But there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: -- and a lot of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: -- yeah, there wa -- the -- the -- he was co -- Hitler was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I remember a scene in a nearby street, the street on which Martin Niemoeller lived, and the -- and the -- the -- the St. Anne’s church was on that.</span> <span id="s316">One Sunday the SR -- the SR was marching outside, singing, chanting, you know, howling one.</span> <span id="s317">And I looked -- I said to my father, “Who are they?”</span> <span id="s318">And my father s -- it must have been in ’32.</span> <span id="s319">And my father said, “Well, that’s a terrible gang, and -- and,” -- and I said to him, “Why -- who allows them to do that?”</span> <span id="s320">“Well, th-that’s their leader.”</span> <span id="s321">And I said and what was going to happen, and he said, “Well he -- he wants to be the -- the head of the German government, and if he ever comes to power,” -- I said, “What -- what will happen then?”</span> <span id="s322">And he said, “May God help us all.”</span> <span id="s323">So I remember that, I’ve never forgotten.</span> <span id="s324">They did that in front of the church, to -- to disturb the services.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: In Dahlem?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: In Dahlem.</span> <span id="s327">That already --</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s329">You moved there --</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: -- we had -- we had moved to Dahlem, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: -- a number of years before.</span> <span id="s332">So ag-again, a little bit pri -- prior to the ’32 and ’33, is it a very religious home that you grew up in?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: No.</span> <span id="s336">There was prayer at lunch.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: And you all ate lunch together?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: My mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Father?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: -- and my -- no, my father was -- worked an hour away.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: He was then in the same pos -- in the position with the Hohenzollerns, the keeper of the privy -- purse, you know, the -- under a ruling monarch that would have been finance minister.</span> <span id="s343">And he took care -- administered the -- one of the biggest fortunes not only in Germany, but in the world.</span> <span id="s344">After the Kaiser abdicated and f -- not went, but fled to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: The German government took everything from him.</span> <span id="s347">But somehow things went large -- long trains went to Holland, where he had sought and received asylum.</span> <span id="s348">He received all his -- his personal belongings and -- and also his many, many estates.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: They were all back to his name there.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: So your -- and your father is taking care of all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: My father is -- not only administered the money, but made a lot of money for them.</span> <span id="s353">The Hohenzollern -- Hohenzollern family though, were imbeciles.</span> <span id="s354">Really.</span> <span id="s355">He did -- my father was not a monarchist.</span> <span id="s356">My father couldn’t ta -- stand the Hohenzollerns, who took advantage of him whenever possible.</span> <span id="s357">But he loved this old, old, confused old man.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Who had caused so much trouble in the world, but would never admit to it.</span> <span id="s360">Never one word.</span> <span id="s361">And who was easily influenced.</span> <span id="s362">When the Nazis came he had remarried.</span> <span id="s363">Remarried a princess, a widowed princess with four children, of -- two sons and two daughters, Princess of Schoenaich-Carolath, and who was 30 some years younger than he, and he fell in love, you know.</span> <span id="s364">His first wife, the Empress Auguste, who must have been an angel, she loved him.</span> <span id="s365">And she died literally of a broken heart after he went to Holland.</span> <span id="s366">And then he soon, within two years he was remarried and lived in his golden cage, and my father had his own apartment there, of course, and went -- stayed with him, I would say, an average of a week a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: And when him -- when my father left him, he had talked reason to him, you know, but he always knew, as soon as he turns his back, the old man would --</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Wish -- good -- would go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: -- fall prey to any bad influence.</span> <span id="s371">Poor man.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: He had a hard life, you know, growing up with wa -- only one arm, the other one crippled.</span> <span id="s374">For a Prussian, for a future emperor, he had hells on wheels.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s376">We have to stop the tape and change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: When does Anna come into your life as a housekeeper?</span> <span id="s380">Or what is she, actually?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: I -- I came into Anna’s life, so to say.</span> <span id="s382">Anna -- when my -- my father and my mother got married, they got in touch with je -- with each other while my mother was in the sanitorium for her lung disease and my father was in a military hospital.</span> <span id="s383">Somehow a correspondence began.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: And one remembered the other, and they really fell in love over -- they must have -- over the letters, because they already got -- he got out of the military and they married in May of 1919.</span> <span id="s386">My sister was always -- half sister was six months -- six years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: And then was the question what was he going to do with his life.</span> <span id="s389">He had -- he ra -- was a very good looking man, he had had his military -- military academy education, which I mean for those years were -- was a pretty good one.</span> <span id="s390">He was right away spotted as a very special -- very special man with a talent for finances.</span> <span id="s391">Well, they got married and even though they had hardly enough to eat, they had to have a servant who would cook.</span> <span id="s392">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Your mother didn’t go into the kitchen, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Oh, would sh -- well, first of all they -- they asked around in Potsdam and Anna’s name was given to them.</span> <span id="s395">She was -- Anna was born in -- in the 1980 -- 18 -- 1887, so she was already, you know, not very young for those days any more, and she was -- her -- her family, also noble, her family, von Massel -- I call them Shtraylo in my -- in my book, I believe.</span> <span id="s396">There were, due to the circumstances there was nothing to eat, it was dismal circumstances.</span> <span id="s397">They moved to one of their estates, they had an estate.</span> <span id="s398">So Anna could pick, you know, and she took one look at my mother and said this lady is not going to interfere with my housekeeping, you know.</span> <span id="s399">She was right.</span> <span id="s400">And no children, thank goodness.</span> <span id="s401">So she accepted for -- for, I mean, peanuts for pay, the position.</span> <span id="s402">My mother -- my mother and father had been assigned an ap -- miserable apartment, which is still standing in Potsdam facing a coal supply firm, and it was all windows going to the north, and there were -- was a bit wet, and but you -- what could they do?</span> <span id="s403">And that’s where I began my start in life.</span> <span id="s404">And when Anna heard that a baby was on the way, she seriously considered leaving.</span> <span id="s405">But then on the other hand, you know, maybe my mother had no interest -- as little interest in a child than she had for the household.</span> <span id="s406">She stayed, watched me being born and I was her baby.</span> <span id="s407">From the first day on, I grew up on Anna’s arms, and all the tenderness that I didn’t get from my mother, I got from Anna.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: So Anna became a kind of mother figure --</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Absol --</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: -- and still -- I still, when I think of motherhood and -- and of being on somebody’s lap, there is Anna, holding me tight like a -- like a gorilla holding her young, Anna.</span> <span id="s412">She would not even share -- share her with my mother.</span> <span id="s413">This -- when my mother three years later, two and a half years later, gave birth to my brother, she decided she’d let her keep that baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: So in some ways, Anna kept you from your mother, at a certain point.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Well, though, she didn’t have a hard time keeping --</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Keeping you, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Yeah, yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Explain to me what you mean by an apartment was assigned to your parents.</span> <span id="s419">Who assigned it?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: It was assigned, there was a housing office --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: -- because of the terrible shortage, like there was during the war -- World War ІІ, and after World War ІІ --</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: -- where you had a va -- you had a right to certain space and -- and that’s what they had to take, whether they liked it -- it was either that apartment or none.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s426">Now tell me something, Anna is nobility, but she’s working as a housekeeper.</span> <span id="s427">Now, is this odd?</span> <span id="s428">Or is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Wait -- what -- what -- whose --</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Anna.</span> <span id="s431">Anna you said had an -- estates, her family.</span> <span id="s432">Or am I wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Yeah, Anna came from the Vendish tribe.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: A Vendish tribe, and a very proud tribe, and the girls were all sent to work with -- to work in households.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: They couldn’t do anything else, th -- they had, according to German laws, which applied to them, learn German and -- and attend school until 14.</span> <span id="s438">But Anna would not have gone to a bourgeois family.</span> <span id="s439">First position she had at age 14 was with nobility and later my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: And why is that, because the ven --</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: A beca --</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: -- because of wu -- of the group that she comes from?</span> <span id="s443">The particul --</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: No, I don’t -- she identified herself so much with our family that y -- or later too, very few non-nobility people came into our house, and they had to make up for their terrible lack by titles like your Excellency, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s445">Or doctor, you know.</span> <span id="s446">But Anna knew th -- those were her circles, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s448">When you start going to school --</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Well, let’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: -- let’s mo -- move up.</span> <span id="s453">When do you first go to school, when you’re six?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: When I was six, I went -- of course, we were much too sn-snobbish a -- to -- snob is not a ver -- g -- good word, by the way, a -- but mainly thanks to Anna, her child would not attend a public school.</span> <span id="s455">So we -- th -- my parents joined other parents and they founded a school in the neighborhood, it took place in one room, and there were -- for the first three years of my life there was one teacher who had been retired, he came out of retirement.</span> <span id="s456">He taught us all, we were about 12 children.</span> <span id="s457">That was neat, that was neat.</span> <span id="s458">And then we -- even though I was so small and -- and I was sick very often, my parents insisted on me entering the so-called high school, the higher school, not at age 10, but at age nine.</span> <span id="s459">Which of course, as a consequence, I -- I was left behind when I was 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: In order to join up with the other kids, or because you weren’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Because I was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: You weren’t ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: -- not mature enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: And th -- that -- that school was just around the corner from us in Dahlem, we had moved to Dahlem, renting a beautiful house on the same street where we would later in 1932 and ’33, would build our own townhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: But you also said that that became a neighborhood where a lot of Nazis --</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: It was a n --</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: -- lived, or least some.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: -- a neighborhood where a lot of non-Nazis lived, but among the populati -- and film stars, movie stars lived there.</span> <span id="s472">But a lot of the highest Nazis -- Himmler had his house around the corner, the Minister of Economy, the Minister of Education, Woost, economy was Starrer.</span> <span id="s473">Goebbels was out in Wannsee.</span> <span id="s474">Oh yes, a lot of it was -- you know, all these beautiful villas where Jews had lived, that Jews had -- had built, had worked for, when they were expelled, before being dis -- deported and killed, those villas were taken by the Nazis and high military people.</span> <span id="s475">You know, I had one Brauchitsch, General Field Marshall -- Field Marshall Walter von Brauchitsch, a cousin of my mother’s, who was Chief of Staff of the German armed forces, of the German army.</span> <span id="s476">And he lived in one of these big villas, and was -- he had been a member of the Nazi party, with the golden bird.</span> <span id="s477">And even though he lived, walking, maybe seven minutes away, I not ever in my life set eyes on him.</span> <span id="s478">My father would not allow anyone even faintly resembling -- faintly connected with the Nazis, he would not allow it, but my mother was -- was my mother’s brother in a -- in -- a young o -- an older brother, of course, he joined the SR and the party.</span> <span id="s479">And you -- he didn’t -- didn’t come to the house after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Did your mother keep connections with the people who had connections with the Nazis, or were -- did she join with her father --</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: No, no, no, she joined --</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: -- or was it -- with her husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: -- absolute -- absolutely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: And on the other hand there was the other brother of my mother, who married a Jewish lady from --</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: -- from Russia, originally.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Now, when you first moved to Dahlem -- I don’t mean when you were two and a half, when you [indecipherable] you wouldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: No, to -- to -- to Dahlem, I moved at age six.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: At age six?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s492">To -- from Potsdam to Berlin --</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Ah, at age two and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: -- at age two and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Right, okay.</span> <span id="s496">So when you were six.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: When I was six we moved.</span> <span id="s498">That makes it 1929.</span> <span id="s499">We moved t -- to Dahlem, had that rented house.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Now, do you remember having Jewish friends as well as non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: The neighborhood is quite mixed, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Th-The school was -- yeah, my class was -- was -- was full of Jewish girls, and one by one they disappeared.</span> <span id="s504">But except for my dear, dear, dear friend Anita Frank, who was -- they were -- she and her brother were already orphaned at the time, she died in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s505">Reinhardt made it out of -- of Auschwitz, they all reached safety.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s508">For a very simple fact.</span> <span id="s509">Not only were the parents well informed, but they had a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Money.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: And they could get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: So they got out early.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: That’s why I never, except for once in Berlin during the day I saw an open truck loading Jews from house -- from a Jew house.</span> <span id="s516">Otherwise these sights were not -- you know, I was not familiar with that sight, because even if they had come for them, you know, with the wide spaces in between the houses, nobody would have known.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Did your father explain to you when people were leaving, why they were leaving, or were you reading the newspapers when you were nine or 10 years old?</span> <span id="s518">I mean, what did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: No, I wa -- I remember his growing interest when I said well, Ellen Ginsburg, or Alice Levy, or wa -- and he said, “They’re Jewish?”</span> <span id="s520">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s521">And behind that question was always, what can we do for them?</span> <span id="s522">That ha -- that happened very, very early.</span> <span id="s523">I remember the first incident at school where I didn’t even notice it, but my father immediately did, where we handed little forms indicating what religion we were, you know?</span> <span id="s524">Name, and -- and re -- what religion the parents were.</span> <span id="s525">And -- and what -- what heritage and all that, I remember.</span> <span id="s526">Suza -- Suzi Levy, Susannah Levy, si -- Ellen Levy, sitting behind me and showed me hers, and that said, we hereby testify that so and so is of purely Jewish background.</span> <span id="s527">It was the wa -- death verdict for them, you know?</span> <span id="s528">And I didn’t -- I didn’t find anything wrong with it, I thought that goes with school, they want to know.</span> <span id="s529">Boy, did they ever want to know.</span> <span id="s530">And then, you know, by -- by -- of course, I was taken out of that school, and by the time I was taken out in 1937, there were still -- even though there were Jewish schools in Berlin, there were still some Jewish girls in my class.</span> <span id="s531">And by the time I came back in 1939, there were -- I don’t know, all left, they were all gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: And I don’t have the f -- I was not a go -- very good friend with the exception to Anita and she in ’41 once rang our doorbell, you know.</span> <span id="s534">She’d been told that we were okay, and Anita I’ve never forgotten.</span> <span id="s535">She --</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: She was alone with her brother, her mother had been able to --</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: She wa -- her f -- her -- her -- she lived in -- they lived in Dahlem.</span> <span id="s538">How much money they had, I never knew.</span> <span id="s539">Very, very much.</span> <span id="s540">The mother, widowed mother, can you imagine such a thing, left the children.</span> <span id="s541">Anita was then 16 or so, and the brother nine, alone to fend for themselves.</span> <span id="s542">She left for Switzerland to marry a man, in the hope that she would dr -- get the children, too.</span> <span id="s543">That mother must not have been terribly bright according to what Reinhardt says.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: No.</span> <span id="s545">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: And of course they moved one -- from one relative to the other, from one Jewish school to the other, until a fa -- she finally -- were both finally caught by the -- by the Nazis and she became a nurse, a nurse’s aide -- she wanted to be a midwife.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: A nurse’s aide in the Jewish hospital, and took her brother an -- who was then 12, and allegedly av -- an -- a electricians assistant, and they -- they -- they lived there in the hospital, and one day -- and that’s when Anita came to visit.</span> <span id="s549">And Anita, I said, “What about going into hiding?”</span> <span id="s550">You know, and we ha -- gonna --</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: -- and she said, “No, I can’t do it because of my brother, he looks so Jewish.”</span> <span id="s553">Well Anita had looked like a country girl, you know, coffa -- kinky hair and brown eyes, and like a -- like an apple.</span> <span id="s554">And the little -- little Reinhardt, no, and she of cour -- felt responsible for him, Switzerland.</span> <span id="s555">And he told her, after I found him again in New York a few years ago, he told me that he was beseeching her to try and go across the -- the border illegally to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s556">And he said, “Wa -- wa -- all they can do is shoot us.”</span> <span id="s557">Because that little boy knew, obviously, and -- and she said no -- she was too Prussian, you know?</span> <span id="s558">No, no, things will -- wi -- wi -- will work out, and they were first sent to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s559">And Theresienstadt, oh there were -- they were reported to the Gestapo, you know, because they -- their position was somehow half legal.</span> <span id="s560">To the Gestapo, they are both deported to -- to Theresienstadt by a man by the name of Gottschalk, a Jewish spy of which Berlin was full.</span> <span id="s561">Remember what’s her name, Stella?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Stella, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Stella --</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: I forget her last name, but Stella --</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Gottschalk [indecipherable] Stella -- Stella Gottschalk.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: They both sent to Theresienstadt, and there they lived like everybody else, vegetated in the stadt -- in the city that the Führer had given the Jews, for -- meant for 3,000 people, and I think they had 45 in there.</span> <span id="s568">But you know, there were transports to -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: To Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: -- to Auschwitz all the time, and one day it was -- no, but I have to stop here, because a few weeks after they had appeared in Theresienstadt, who comes?</span> <span id="s571">Herr Gottschalk.</span> <span id="s572">His fate had caught up with him.</span> <span id="s573">And Reinhardt spotted him right away, and took -- was invited for a conference among the Jews, what shall we do with him?</span> <span id="s574">He deserves the death penalty, but he didn’t go to the -- he were -- they executed him.</span> <span id="s575">They were working -- Reinhardt was working in a chemical cleaners -- at a chemical clean -- for the SS you know, and they threw him in a cleaning machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: And when he came out he was very clean, but quite dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: And then he was -- Reinhardt was selected and put on the train for Auschwitz, and the last thing Anita said to him -- and that tells you how naïve she was, he said when you arrive -- she said, “When you arrive there, tell them you are only 11 and very sickly.”</span> <span id="s580">Had he followed her advice --</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Right, he would have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: -- they would have sent him to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s583">On the train he was told to say he was 17 and a learned -- and -- and a electrician.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: And that’s how he eventually -- and that’s a story by itself, survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: When the Nazis take over, and there is a boycott and then there is a book burning in 1933, are you conscious of this?</span> <span id="s587">You’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: And how.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: You are?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: And oh, every detail of it.</span> <span id="s591">It was -- it was -- you know, by that time, Martin Niemoeller had already entered our family --</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: -- who was very naïve, and thanks to -- thanks to my father mainly, I -- I like to think, he finally, when it hit home, he -- within a few months he was -- he was cured.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Because he was not against national socialism at first, at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s596">And he decided it would be good for the volken, whatever, and he -- he voted for Hitler in 1933 --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: -- something unthinkable for my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: And you meet him because he’s the pastor of the church, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I was the first of the family to meet him, because we’ve had a very, very nice old Pastor Lange, and Pastor Lange was supposed to retire.</span> <span id="s601">And I think we went there for Christmas and for Easter, that was about the amount of time my -- my parents spent in a church.</span> <span id="s602">And then my father heard there was a new pastor and that was the time he decided that his daughter should start going to Sunday school.</span> <span id="s603">And I attended the very first service Martin Niemoeller ever held in Dahlem.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s605">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: And I -- I had been taken there against my will, because I had a hockey game that day.</span> <span id="s607">They were always held on Sundays, much to my father’s chagrin.</span> <span id="s608">So he took me -- he dragged me, and -- and handed me over physically to one of the ushers, and I sat in the front -- front aisle.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: In the pew?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Pew, in the front, pew, and decided to behave as outrageously as possible, sticking my tum -- tongue out, and -- and I was full of freckles, you know, looking as unkempt as possible, even though I’d been forced to take a bath before.</span> <span id="s611">And there comes this good looking -- with our old, white haired Pastor Lange, comes that good looking, slender, very dark man, he had pitch black hair.</span> <span id="s612">Ver -- olive complexion, otherwise he reminded me of my father.</span> <span id="s613">And then he started to talk to us children, not about Jesus or v -- the Virgin Mary or anything, but about his time in World War І as a submarine commander.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: This was his first sermon?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: That -- very wise, because everybody was listening.</span> <span id="s616">And I decided I would love that man.</span> <span id="s617">But I didn’t let -- know of -- anybody of the family know.</span> <span id="s618">I came home and I dis -- my father I felt deserved punishment for -- for forcing me to go there, and my father asked, “Oh, how was it?”</span> <span id="s619">Oh, oh, was okay.</span> <span id="s620">“Who -- how was the new pastor?”</span> <span id="s621">Oh, he’s okay, you know.</span> <span id="s622">“And what did he talk about, what’s his name?”</span> <span id="s623">I said, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s624">I knew darn well, you know.</span> <span id="s625">But as time progressed, my parents went over to his house and I -- they came to our house, and I decided to try the Niemoeller children, but a minister’s children are notorious for being pious, and ha!</span> <span id="s626">Did I meet a bunch?</span> <span id="s627">Six children with a -- three of them black, like the father, and three of them blonde with blue eyes like the mother, and gorgeous children.</span> <span id="s628">And I fit in like th-the runt of the litter, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: The runt of the litter.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Absolutely, and I -- I lived in there and roamed around the vast parsonage, and there was -- that house was so noisy, you wouldn’t believe this -- once in awhile the door would open, and the pastor, with a stentoric voice would ask for -- for -- would demand silence, otherwise he would come and clobber us all.</span> <span id="s631">And the children all say, “He always says, he never does it,” you know.</span> <span id="s632">That was my first -- my first visit with Martin Niemoeller.</span> <span id="s633">Little did I know --</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Little did you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: -- that I was to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: So you were how old when you first --</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: I-I was nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Or even eight.</span> <span id="s640">That was before --</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: And he must have been in his --</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: He was -- he was 33 years older than I --</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Three -- right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: -- figure it out.</span> <span id="s645">Yeah.</span> <span id="s646">He was born in ’92, I was born in --</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Born in ’23.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: -- ’23, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Thirt -- 32 years old.</span> <span id="s651">And then I soon asked my parents to spare me that experience of -- of -- of children’s services, but let me go with them.</span> <span id="s652">Now they started going to church.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: As soon as the Confessing Church was founded by him, they -- and soon as I had been -- had been confirmed, I became a member -- we became member --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Of the Confessing Church?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: -- of the Confessing Church, yes.</span> <span id="s657">And now, in my eyes, I mean he was an endangered species of course, because I va -- Frau Niemoeller came all the time and told me the Gestapo had called, they had searched the house and all that.</span> <span id="s658">So I decided when the Gestapo comes, I will save his life.</span> <span id="s659">So I went to Woolworth -- and I got a very meager amount of money each week and bought a chain and a lock, with which I was going to -- what’s the English word?</span> <span id="s660">The Gestapo i --</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: You -- yo --</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: -- keeping him -- keeping them from -- from --</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Getting him?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Oh, you were going to lock him up, or you were going -- no, you were going to lock --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No, I was going to lock the Gestapo up.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Yeah, yeah, I was not modest in my exp -- but it never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Never happened, right.</span> <span id="s670">You didn’t have that chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: But I heard every one of his -- of his sermons.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: How old were you when you were confirmed?</span> <span id="s673">What is the age?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: I was 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: He was in the con -- I had hoped, while in boarding school, 14 - 15, that by the time I came out, he would be able to confirm me, but no such thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: But he wasn’t -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: So his -- his successor or hi -- rather his -- his -- yeah, [indecipherable] Helmut Gollwitzer, he confirmed me in his stead.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: By that time I had already witnessed Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: In Eberswalde.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s684">Well let’s -- let’s go back just -- just a little bit here.</span> <span id="s685">When you’re going to school, and there are Nazi kids, this is after ’33 --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Well, yeah, well there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Why did you hit Ribbentrop’s daughter?</span> <span id="s688">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Because she’d been fresh to me, an I remember s -- I had to climb on a -- on the bench in order to reach her because she was so big.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: You slapped her across the face?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: I slapped her across her stupid face.</span> <span id="s692">She was a nice girl, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: She was?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: But we -- but that, it was personal, that really was personal.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: That wasn’t political.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Bettina von Ribbentrop, and my father was so proud of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s698">What did the teacher do when you did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Teacher was not in the room.</span> <span id="s700">He was -- it was in dur -- during intermission, you know, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Over recess.</span> <span id="s702">And what -- and Scholz-Klink’s daughters were there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Both -- God, I completely forgot that.</span> <span id="s704">Both daughters of Madame Scholz-Klink, the Reichsfrauenfuehrerin, she attended -- was in my -- they were in my class, in the same classroom.</span> <span id="s705">Isolde, and I don’t remember the name of the other.</span> <span id="s706">Well, with them you really had to be careful.</span> <span id="s707">And the children --</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: -- of -- of -- of Himmler, the daughter of Himmler, Gudrund -- Gudrund, of course, she was a few years younger.</span> <span id="s710">And the children of Woost, two daughters, they were also in another grade, but you w -- w -- I saw them every day.</span> <span id="s711">They were -- they managed to get a teacher fired, but fortunately he did not end up in a concentration camp, the best teacher the school had.</span> <span id="s712">They told daddy about a few remarks he had made, daddy took care of them.</span> <span id="s713">It was -- you know, what I learned at home was to keep my mouth shut outside.</span> <span id="s714">You know, I was a blabbermouth, but not in these things.</span> <span id="s715">And I was revolting against -- rebelling against my parents except in that one field.</span> <span id="s716">And so what I was taught -- I always say that, was the meaning of conspirative behavior, very early.</span> <span id="s717">I mean, Jewish families can talk about their children learning it at a -- at a very early age.</span> <span id="s718">And the -- the meaning of your own conscience, how very, very important that was, that intact conscience.</span> <span id="s719">Never do u -- or -- o-or say anything that you might not be able to sleep at night.</span> <span id="s720">And that was key in both life, for me it was normal, was nothing.</span> <span id="s721">And I had Ditte, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: And she was at that school?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Ditte was next to me always.</span> <span id="s724">We were a feared duo.</span> <span id="s725">But she had to be much more careful because of her Jewish mother.</span> <span id="s726">What they left, that could only be done in -- in Dahlem, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s727">They left a very quiet life.</span> <span id="s728">The children, they didn’t even have piano lessons, nothing, you know?</span> <span id="s729">They lived the Jewish family life, and that’s how Ditte’s mother survived.</span> <span id="s730">With her looks, to me still a mystery.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: We’re going to have to change the tape, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Already?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s737">I will -- I -- I am going to ask you in a minute about something that you did with a ka -- with Kaiser Wilhelm, but I want to ask you, because you just ended talking about what you were taught at home about being at school.</span> <span id="s738">I imagine there is -- there are Nazi flags up, or there is a lot of -- you have to -- did you have to s -- s -- do the heil Hitler in the morning when the teacher comes in?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Not yet.</span> <span id="s740">That came as time went on.</span> <span id="s741">The first years -- few years, it was Gut Morgen.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: And -- yes, and I don’t remember the exact point in -- during which that wer -- heil Hitler was introduced.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: But even by the way, a teacher would greet the class with a German salute, you knew whether the -- she -- it was only female te -- no, no, we had two male teachers, whether they were Nazis or not.</span> <span id="s746">I -- I knew why, you know.</span> <span id="s747">I was brought up with that six and seventh and eighth sense, and which has led me through my life, by --</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: So what did -- what did you mean when you said what your -- your -- y-you were clearly a so -- sort of a wild kid --</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: -- or at least very devilish.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: But in this area --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: -- in the political area, you trusted what your parents said, and you followed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s758">That’s right.</span> <span id="s759">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: So were they telling you to be quiet in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: That is the most wondrous thing.</span> <span id="s762">I was never told, don’t repeat that outside of the house.</span> <span id="s763">I knew.</span> <span id="s764">I just knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: You just knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s767">Oh, by the way, that -- that -- there was a period of rebellion after I -- in ni -- in 1933 my father had taken us to Unter den Linden to see Hindenburg and Hitler.</span> <span id="s768">And on the way back I remember my brother and I, we both decided to count flags hanging out of the windows.</span> <span id="s769">And when we arrived home, I had more, but that -- it came out that I had counted the -- I -- th-the swastika flags, and my brother had counted the black, white, and red.</span> <span id="s770">And I se -- I count -- I have more, and for that fact alone, my mother slapped me across the face.</span> <span id="s771">Hakenkreuzfahen.</span> <span id="s772">You just never do that.</span> <span id="s773">And then that night I decided to become Nazi, and with the goal of eventually marrying Hitler, or becoming his cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: That’s quite an idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Well, you know Hitler -- and even my father was -- he w -- my father was so wonderful, he said, “Well, have you ever thought about the fact that when Hitler’s getting older, and you will have to wait for an awfully long time to marry him.</span> <span id="s776">Why don’t you plan to be his cook?”</span> <span id="s777">Okay.</span> <span id="s778">So every morning when he -- I came down, he say, “What would you like to cook for your führer today?</span> <span id="s779">Spinach?</span> <span id="s780">Brussel sprouts?”</span> <span id="s781">You know, he was a vegetar -- so that period did not last long.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: And your father didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: No, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: -- cri -- nobody criticized you, they just let you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: -- no, not at all, he re -- he seemed very str -- stern, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: -- very serious about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: And then something happened that made me change my mind, not my parents.</span> <span id="s790">I was invited to the home of a mutual friend notorious anti-Nazi, who had a tea party in her beautiful house.</span> <span id="s791">And since I often visited her, I rang the doorbell, and I said, “Can a -- can I come in?”</span> <span id="s792">And the -- the servant said, “No, you can’t come in today, Frau Pietschker,” -- ha -- was her name, “she has her tea party.”</span> <span id="s793">And sh -- there appears Frau Pietschker in a beautiful flowered dress.</span> <span id="s794">And she says, “Come in, come in, I want to show you to my ladies,” you know.</span> <span id="s795">And she had a beautiful oval salon, with tables like this, and a free room in the front.</span> <span id="s796">She drags me -- I was in leather pants, you know?</span> <span id="s797">No socks are on, just -- just sandals, not washed, nothing.</span> <span id="s798">And she puts me in the middle of the room, and says, “Ladies, just listen for one moment.</span> <span id="s799">This is Ulrich von Sell’s daughter.</span> <span id="s800">She is a Nazi.”</span> <span id="s801">I -- I hoped the floor would open and swallow me because the laughter that followed was -- would -- I know it would follow me for a lifetime, and it did.</span> <span id="s802">I went home and all the Nazi things that I’d gathered, everything with the -- with the swastika on it, I put in an old handkerchief, and carried them out to the garbage, but I threw them in somebody else’s garbage.</span> <span id="s803">That was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Now why was this the end, what -- what did it mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: I -- I was so -- that my father -- well, you know, I -- everybody knew my father, you know?</span> <span id="s806">It was so humiliating to me, that I didn’t show much character and stood up for the man I loved.</span> <span id="s807">I joined the other side.</span> <span id="s808">And that was the brief intermission, the brief period.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Now, were these people pro-Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: They weren’t.</span> <span id="s812">And so they were laughing because --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: No, that’s why they laughed.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: -- they couldn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: They just could not believe it.</span> <span id="s816">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: -- we never had an ow -- of course we di -- we never went to Nazi’s houses, nor did Nazis -- Nazi Germans, as one should really say, come to our house.</span> <span id="s819">It was just -- I -- I remember we were good friends, one of -- last German ambassador to -- Dickhoff was his name, he lived a few houses down the street.</span> <span id="s820">He came to dinner a few times, but then when Hitler progressed, he was persona non grata.</span> <span id="s821">I didn’t even notice, but you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: As a kid, let’s say up to the age of 15 -- 14 or 15, how did you understand what it was that your parents were against in terms of the Nazis?</span> <span id="s823">What -- what was it?</span> <span id="s824">Cause your father -- long time --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: It was really -- and the -- he foresaw, years before Hitler came, what would happen if he came to power, because Hitler didn’t fall from the sky like a meteor, you know?</span> <span id="s826">He had been a -- a known agitator on the political scene for 14 years.</span> <span id="s827">I was against everything that Hitler did or said, I didn’t specify, you know?</span> <span id="s828">I -- and then of course, were the Jews, the Jews, the Jews.</span> <span id="s829">We had Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Did you listen to Hitler’s speeches on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: No, no, no, Hitler’s speeches were not listened to in our house.</span> <span id="s832">It was on very early put on the BBC, and that too, my -- there my father instructed us, when you -- when you listen to -- found the station BBC, you ha -- after you turn off the radio -- radio entered our house late, in ’36 maybe, you have to put the knob back to anything else.</span> <span id="s833">Sure enough, when the Gestapo came to the house, it was after Martin Niemoeller’s incarceration, the first thing the f -- man number one did, go the radio and turn it on.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: To see what station.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s836">Was a German station.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: It was a German station.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s840">Now, we can go back a little bit because I know you want to tell the story about the Kaiser.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: I ca -- I have hundreds of stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: I know you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: But you wanted him to be your guardian, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Or your -- your --</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: My godfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: -- your godfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: But you know, girls are not godchildren of the Kaiser.</span> <span id="s850">So my brother for his birthdays received all sorts -- is beautiful pla -- silver -- pure silver things.</span> <span id="s851">And I never got anything, you know, so I decided if I’d ask my -- my father why da -- isn’t he my godfather.</span> <span id="s852">Because that’s only boys, and so on.</span> <span id="s853">So I decided as soon as I learned to write -- that had noth -- something to do with it, I would bring about a situation where he couldn’t say no.</span> <span id="s854">And then I thought -- I wrote, you know, like a child, and I addressed him Liebe Kaiser, dear Emperor, using no name, or majesty or some liebe.</span> <span id="s855">Some of them are -- one is printed in the -- in one of my books, you know, Liebe Kaiser, and then I -- I -- I se -- I didn’t really ask him, but you know, I know you are the godfather of my brother, can I be -- please be your godchild too?</span> <span id="s856">Something like -- and then I thought it would be very nice if I included a little present, something he could really use.</span> <span id="s857">And I just learned from my grandmother to crochet, a white potholder with a red rim.</span> <span id="s858">And I enclosed that, and I put it in an envelope.</span> <span id="s859">And next time my father went to Holland, I said to him, would he please -- I trusted him, would he please give this to the Kaiser?</span> <span id="s860">And my father did, you know, vastly amused, of course.</span> <span id="s861">My -- the Kaiser was vastly amused, and from then on, he sent me things for my birthday, but no silver plates or anything like that.</span> <span id="s862">A scooter.</span> <span id="s863">A dynamo light -- a dynamo light for my -- for my -- for my bicycle, stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: So really good things?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: And I was conv -- I was convinced that he had tried out the scooter himself, you know, in the -- in the -- he went to the store, you know, and o -- did that all himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: That’s a great story.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: He was -- he was -- yes, he called me the little monkey.</span> <span id="s868">Never referred to me by anything else.</span> <span id="s869">But there’s a story behind that.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Yes, do you want to tell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s872">Once we had the brother of the sis -- my sister’s fr -- girlfriend, who was then a young officer, must have been in ’37 - ’38, who came to visit, not beknownst to us, and at the table already ha -- he had developed Nazi ideas, and I saw my father’s face grow paler and paler, but fortunately the young man had to leave right after -- after dinner, and I was delegated to accompany hi -- him to the -- to the underground.</span> <span id="s873">And passing Martin Niemoeller’s church, there was a light -- it was already dark, there was a light in the church, and he said, “Well, this is Thursday evening, so what -- what’s -- what’s going on there?”</span> <span id="s874">And I said, “Well, those are the -- the prayer -- the -- the service is held every night for all the pastors in concentration camps.”</span> <span id="s875">And then he started, “What?</span> <span id="s876">That is a scandal.</span> <span id="s877">I, in a German uniform, trying to defend the,” -- and I was speechless, and then I looked up to him and I said, “You ze affe.”</span> <span id="s878">“You monkey.”</span> <span id="s879">And then ran away.</span> <span id="s880">We never heard from the young man again, fortunately.</span> <span id="s881">And my father told that story to -- to his majesty, and his majesty thought it was very amusing, called me little monkey.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Little monkey, right.</span> <span id="s883">Now you had governesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: And is that when you learned English, cause these were English governesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Th-That worked.</span> <span id="s888">You had a --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Three English governesses.</span> <span id="s890">Joy, the other one’s name I don’t remember, and Nell, the third one.</span> <span id="s891">All -- w-well the last one we kept connections until far after the war, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: And so you learned English from them, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s894">And I had a talent for si -- for -- for --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: For languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: -- languages.</span> <span id="s897">And of course then we had a f -- a bon -- a French mademoiselle.</span> <span id="s898">She couldn’t stand the food in the house, which was grim, you know.</span> <span id="s899">Prussian food?</span> <span id="s900">Forget about it.</span> <span id="s901">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: So did --</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: She couldn’t stand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s905">So is that why you ate a lot in Ditte’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Was always a place there for me.</span> <span id="s907">Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: You get very calm when you mention that family.</span> <span id="s909">You -- you felt very comfortable there.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Yeah, because that was my rock of Gibraltar, you know, that was -- I was -- everybody was so happy to see me.</span> <span id="s911">I was one of their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: So your house was a very serious and obviously --</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Sinister, almost, you know.</span> <span id="s914">You opened the door and the atmosphere was already coming at you.</span> <span id="s915">It was only forebodings of -- every day it was something new that Hitler had done, or order, whatever.</span> <span id="s916">And he -- my father had been right in everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: But it’s -- it’s also interesting because in this house that’s partially Jewish, because the mother is Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: -- they are not as -- it’s not as sinister, and they are more vulnerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Oh, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Or would appear to be more vulnerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Exactly, mommy -- I called her mommy.</span> <span id="s923">Mommy wanted -- she loved, she adored children.</span> <span id="s924">Every morning she would go to the bakery and buy heaps of -- of -- of cake, just in case the children brought home friends, and there should be enough to eat for everybody.</span> <span id="s925">But in -- you know, then came a time when they had to, except for the little boy, had to tell the three daughters what -- you know, th-the dangers they were in.</span> <span id="s926">And she -- they tried to get all the children out of the country.</span> <span id="s927">They succeeded with the oldest one, Eve.</span> <span id="s928">Eve still lives in England, she’s now 86 or 88, and it was too late for -- for the other ones to get out of the country.</span> <span id="s929">And the little boy, Herman, that was my so-called foster brother, he was the first German student to enter the United States after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Got a law degree, he married Phyllis Fritchie, does the name mean anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: So -- n --</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: He has the north -- had the North Virginia Sun, or something, newspaper man.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: And he was Stevenson’s campaign manager.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: And Herman wound up as the ambassador for the United States under Reagan in South Africa.</span> <span id="s938">That’s a career.</span> <span id="s939">But we got kind of, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Now, let me a -- the -- I don’t -- I don’t know if -- if you can even answer this question, do you think your house might have been severe -- y-you talk about a sort of Prussian atmosphere --</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Severity, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: -- even if there were no Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Good question, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: You don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: You think it really was this political --</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: My father tended to melancholia and to depression, that’s what I inherited from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Now, thanks to modern medicine, I don’t have that any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: And my mother was, you know, she was even, and lighthearted, and -- and she must have suffered like hell, too, you know?</span> <span id="s952">Always grim moods.</span> <span id="s953">And then, of course, being in the position he was in, whenever he was there, there were daily fights with the so-called Empress, who loathed my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: And my fa -- I say that in my books, too, it came to such a point that the -- that at night i -- th-the door to the apartment of -- there were -- there was a glass door, was not knocked but hammered on in the middle of the night and my father opened the -- the door, and outside stood a little man with his nightshirt on, and a f -- and a coat thrown over it, the Kaiser, in tears.</span> <span id="s956">He would say to my father, “She was so bad to me again.”</span> <span id="s957">“Sie war immer so schlecht zu mir.”</span> <span id="s958">She was absolutely wicked, and the ki -- my father said at one point to us children, and he had also made it known in Doorn that he would not even go take her for a wa -- go for a walk with her, because she is capable of jumping into the moat and tell the world I pushed her in.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Pushed her, right.</span> <span id="s960">Now there -- very early on, Gestapo comes to your house, your father isn’t there.</span> <span id="s961">This is in --</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: This i --</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: -- June of 1934 at the -- after the Night of Long Knives, when they kill --</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Oh, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: -- that early.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: -- the Gestapo didn’t come.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: They didn’t come?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Nothing happen -- nothing happened that night except for -- except for the fact that, you know, the next day we found out who had been killed, the man who constantly came to the house, the former Reichskanzler von -- von -- you know, I say the name, I can’t remember it now.</span> <span id="s969">Schleicher.</span> <span id="s970">He had been murdered, you know, the Gestapo came into his house, and they were having breakfast there, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.</span> <span id="s971">He and his wife, dead.</span> <span id="s972">And my father was in Holland at the time.</span> <span id="s973">He came back, you know, just for a few days, he came back, I sat on his lap, where I belonged, in his study, and the phone rings.</span> <span id="s974">And my father said -- he was so tired, he said, “You take it.”</span> <span id="s975">And on the phone, that must have been second of July, third of July, 1934, a fat voice --</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: A fat voice?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: A fat voice, not -- you know, I use -- they usually identify themselves, and this is so and so, can -- Herr von Sell!</span> <span id="s978">So I had the receiver to my father, and I saw, “Yes?”</span> <span id="s979">And then just a, “yes, yes.”</span> <span id="s980">And then he hung up.</span> <span id="s981">It had been Göring, telling him that he shouldn’t feel all too sure about his being safe, the next time they would get him.</span> <span id="s982">And from that day on, I was so afraid of my father’s -- of my father’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: And your father told you immediately, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Well, I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: 10 -- you were just 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: -- you know, this far from him.</span> <span id="s987">He was paralyzed, almost.</span> <span id="s988">That overwhelmingly fat -- it’s a fat voice, like nobody -- you know, high pitched.</span> <span id="s989">And because my father, of all the Nazis, he -- he hated th -- the one he hated the most was Göring, because Göring should have had [indecipherable] a flier, a gentleman, coming from a good family, he should have known better.</span> <span id="s990">Instead he played God, and the famous saying that, I decide who is Aryan or not, indicated that he was in the position to decide over life and death.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: And why would Göring be calling your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Because there was a list, obviously, and he was missed.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: He was missed?</span> <span id="s994">He must have --</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: He wa -- my father wa -- must have --</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: -- must have been on the list?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s998">And so he took the receiver himself and called my father up.</span> <span id="s999">There had been -- my fa -- Göring was a personal enemy of my father’s.</span> <span id="s1000">My father had two personal enemies under the -- among the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1001">One was Keitel, Field Marshall Keitel, and one was Göring.</span> <span id="s1002">And those days it was Göring who was much more powerful, you know.</span> <span id="s1003">Göring was, among other things, he was a big hunter.</span> <span id="s1004">And he would deal with my father for the permission to hunt at one of the estates that belonged to the Kaiser.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: And my father said nyet just a few times too often, until Göring didn’t have to ask permission any more, just went.</span> <span id="s1007">And not even -- he not only came back with the horns or whatever, but for th -- terribly precious pictures, carpets and so on.</span> <span id="s1008">But there was very little my father could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: And Göring once -- that -- that really did the trick.</span> <span id="s1011">When Göring came to a party of the Hohenzollerns to which he had not been invited.</span> <span id="s1012">Oh boy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: And he was asked to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: And your father was the one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: You know, there were Nazis among the Hohenzollerns.</span> <span id="s1019">Victoria Louisa.</span> <span id="s1020">The Kaiser’s only daughter.</span> <span id="s1021">The mother of the future queen of Greece, who went to school with me in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1022">She -- she was ready for the 80th birthday of her father, where the entire mishpowha came, to wear on her beautiful dress, a swastika of diamonds.</span> <span id="s1023">And my father stood in the door, and he said, “With that thing on, you have to step over my body.”</span> <span id="s1024">She took it off.</span> <span id="s1025">There was Prince Auguste Wilhelm, there were plenty -- and even the Crown Prince.</span> <span id="s1026">He came to the -- he came to the -- the Potsdam ceremony without being invited.</span> <span id="s1027">You know, to get himself in with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1028">He might be king one day, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: No dignity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Now, your father is clearly known as an anti-Nazi, the family is known as an anti-Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Yeah, yeah, oh absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: But there is no -- at this point, this is early on, ’33 - ’34 - ’35.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: There’s no resistance group of which he’s a part.</span> <span id="s1036">So he’s not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: There were -- well, there was no -- you know, there was no resistance movement in Germany because we couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s1038">The first batch of resisters that had been, th -- the feared Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: And the same time that Hitler, in Potsdam, said he would be a good and peaceful leader.</span> <span id="s1041">The first prisoners were marched into saxen -- in-into Sachsenhausen concentration camp, only a stone throw away.</span> <span id="s1042">It was the Socialists, the Communists, the trade unionists.</span> <span id="s1043">And that was all the resistance there was.</span> <span id="s1044">Then came that huge goo -- that group, sizeable group of those who said he won’t be so bad, you know, he’s -- he’s ra -- as a matter of fact, we’ll deal with him.</span> <span id="s1045">And then came the rather big group of those who decided to go into inner-emigration, be Nazi, and don’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1046">And those, after the war, were the most despicable ones, because they could -- they claimed they were not anti-Nazi -- they were anti-Nazis, but they didn’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: So you w --</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: And that’s when my parents decided to put up a fight wherever it was possible.</span> <span id="s1049">Getting to Hitler is as -- is as a -- was as impossible as it is now to get rid of Fidel Castro.</span> <span id="s1050">Once a dictator has established himself, it is almost impossible to get rid of him.</span> <span id="s1051">And so you must -- you -- there were plenty of things, especially helping, helping Jews.</span> <span id="s1052">And that developed slowly, until the Jews were really in vital danger, in mortal danger.</span> <span id="s1053">And that’s when the Countess Maltzan was one of them.</span> <span id="s1054">She worked with my fa -- oh, my father, I have to say, was inducted into the German army, even though he was so terribly wounded, and he was much too old, after -- a-at -- at the beginning of the war, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: In 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: -- in ’39, and wa -- and he was sacked by them in -- must have been ’42.</span> <span id="s1057">His -- his boss was Canaris, and at the same outfit where he was -- where he was working, there -- it was since -- censorship of letters.</span> <span id="s1058">And that is when he -- he and the ga -- Countess Maltzan -- and she only told me that after the war, and that’s where we got most of the Jews that came to the house, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: So Jews were being hidden in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: I -- they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Or passing through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: -- it wa -- passing through.</span> <span id="s1063">Our house could -- even though where there were no children in the house, i-it -- people could not be hidden.</span> <span id="s1064">They just -- they just pa -- they just received shelter for awhile, claiming to be a seamstress, a gardener.</span> <span id="s1065">And then of course th -- of the greatest help were the air raids, and the -- the destruction, so a man could turn up, unless he looked like -- like a Jew, and say all my papers were burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Right, right, so you didn’t have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: So we loved the British, especially the British, for -- you know, unloading their bombs over our heads, even though I must say I was terrified of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: I can imagine, I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Terrified.</span> <span id="s1070">Yet we blessed -- we blessed them every day, and prayed for their safe home -- home-going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: And that’s why -- it was as you d -- declare somebody as a -- as a cousin of a chauffeur of a something like that, wasn’t all too difficult.</span> <span id="s1073">Living in the house for any length of time would have been too -- too different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Well, especially in that neighborhood, I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: I mean, hiding -- and especially in that neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Hiding in the middle of the city, not so bad.</span> <span id="s1078">But in order to hide one Jew, that is not clear to everybody who just talks about it, you have to have -- first of all, no children in the house.</span> <span id="s1079">They blabber out --</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: -- the truth, you know, th-that new aunt of mine, you know, something like that.</span> <span id="s1082">And there has to be -- there have to be extra rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: So you have to -- the butcher, have grocer, a doctor -- something like that, and it’s a vast ho -- the smaller the cell, the better.</span> <span id="s1085">You are not supposed to know what the other one did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: I found out rather late about the Scholls in Munich.</span> <span id="s1088">Munich was a planet away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: There was nothing in the media, and that was -- it was, you know, that’s -- of course it -- word got around, but Berlin and Dahlem, and with these five families were wonderful, we were never found out.</span> <span id="s1091">Nobody was found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: And the Scholls, you’re talking about The White Rose, you’re talking about the students, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Yes, The White Rose, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1094">Cause th-the surviving sister came to visit Martin often after the war, after he -- when I was there in Wiesbaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: They were true heroes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Those were true heroes.</span> <span id="s1099">While the resistance group that concentrated, it must have been in ’38 - ’39, planning to get rid of Adolf Hitler, the 20th of July ’44 group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: You know how Hitler -- tha -- I don’t know how many there -- SS nation attempts there were against Hitler, it’s almost, you know -- several dozen, and they all failed.</span> <span id="s1102">Hitler had, first of all, had the instinct of an animal.</span> <span id="s1103">And my -- and a distant uncle of mine von Gasthof, he was a major in the army, and was supposed to receive Hitler rather late for -- 40’s, to visit a museum, that Zeughaus, the military museum in Berlin, and had stuffed himself with bombs, and he would -- was ready to embrace Hitler in a deadly embrace.</span> <span id="s1104">Hitler sh -- used another entry, and my uncle had a hell of a time disarming himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: But it happened again, and again --</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: -- and again.</span> <span id="s1109">And so then na -- by 1941 we started with the Jews, or na -- ’40 - ’41 - ’42, then came these many evenings in our house where visitors came at night, among them our neighbor Admiral Canaris.</span> <span id="s1110">General Oster, Count Henkel von Donnersmark, my two f -- cousins, Haeften, Ulrich von Hassel.</span> <span id="s1111">And they came at night, and my ma -- the first time they came, I asked my mother what are they doing?</span> <span id="s1112">And she said, “Sie morden.”</span> <span id="s1113">“They are committing murder.”</span> <span id="s1114">And then they would leave one by one, back of the house, and all that.</span> <span id="s1115">The only one who survived was the Count Henkel von Donnersmark.</span> <span id="s1116">And I saw him many times after the war, all the others were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: They were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: -- hanged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1120">We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: In 1937, you are sent to a boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s1127">Why did they send you away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Well, for two reasons.</span> <span id="s1129">First of all, I should get away from Ditte, my twin at heart, and I should meet girls from my own s -- from my own caste.</span> <span id="s1130">And that was a b-boarding -- elite boarding school, small, for daughters of -- for the noble names.</span> <span id="s1131">There were three girls there who were not members of nobility, and they g-got to hear it every day.</span> <span id="s1132">That really wasn’t fitting, you know, not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: So there’s a kind of meanness in this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Oh, a kind, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Well, anyway, I was there for t -- sent there for th -- the other was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Why were you ha -- why did you have to separate from Ditte?</span> <span id="s1140">Why -- were you two just crazy --</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: W-We were two -- we had a terrible influence on one another, you know, that’s why.</span> <span id="s1142">But it was a friendship that wouldn’t break to this day.</span> <span id="s1143">And -- and then the other reason was that the situation with the BDM or the Hitler Youth was getting more precarious every day.</span> <span id="s1144">So that was the beginning of a phase, you know, when I went to that school, later to other schools, where I trained myself -- or I s -- I thought of it myself.</span> <span id="s1145">When asked, are you in the BDM, I said, “Of course, in Berlin.”</span> <span id="s1146">You know, I mean, I’m here only temporarily, why should I -- you know.</span> <span id="s1147">And I did th -- I repeated that and it worked until shortly before graduation, they wouldn’t let me graduate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: Because they knew it was not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: [indecipherable] it wasn’t true, no, no.</span> <span id="s1150">Found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Now, how is -- how is Ditte surviving?</span> <span id="s1152">Do they know that their mother is Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: -- or they don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Yes, by that time they -- of Jewish extraction, you know, somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: So is she a mischlinge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: -- but Ditte -- she was a mish -- sh-she would have been called a mischlinge first --</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: First class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: First grade or first class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: And she even -- she went to st -- as a student to Heidelberg and -- and signed a document with her name that she was purely Aryan.</span> <span id="s1162">She was -- it was one miracle after the other.</span> <span id="s1163">And she did her own resisting in Heidelberg, my God --</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1166">The more you were in danger, the more you did.</span> <span id="s1167">You know, it became a sport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Why, because you think that some of these people had nothing to lose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Well, it c -- became -- I don’t know what it was, I don’t know what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: But that’s certainly not true for a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Oh, you better believe it, yeah, but through those inactive anti-Nazis, I have very little to s -- all this they have really good reasons to explain their inertia.</span> <span id="s1172">And those who said bad things will not happen in Germany because we wouldn’t let them do them, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1174">Were you very sad to leave, to go to boarding school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Oh, I hated it.</span> <span id="s1176">I hated it and I planned my escape from there to Holland, to the Kaiser.</span> <span id="s1177">And in my dreams at night, just before going to sleep, I would imagine how he would stand there, opening his arms, oh my poor, poor child, of course you can stay here.</span> <span id="s1178">But then behind him was that witch, and she’d say no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: And you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: -- and you knew that she would not approve, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Oh, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: But you still fantasized this escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: I met Kaiser in -- so-called majesty [indecipherable] only once, and there was instant loathing on both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: I wa -- of her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Of her, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: And -- and -- and she for me.</span> <span id="s1189">She later complained to my father, your daughter behaved in a terrible way, you know.</span> <span id="s1190">My father just smiled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: And how old were you when you met?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: 10 - 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Was in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Now you also had to leave Sunday school, so you couldn’t see -- because this is 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: No, but I -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Well, ’37 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: ’37 I’m --</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: -- he’s already -- is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: I was home for the first time from boarding school for summer vacation, and then came the news that he had been arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Rested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: And I remember jumping on my bicycle, going from friend to friend to friend, telling them all the terrible news, which was in the newspapers the next day, you know.</span> <span id="s1205">Awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Were you worried over the last few years both about your father and about Niemoeller?</span> <span id="s1207">Was he</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Niemoeller, yes, of course, I had fallen in love with Niemoeller at age 13 - 14, al-allowed myself to get a first rate crush on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Cause he would hardly notice me, you know.</span> <span id="s1211">And of course I was terribly worried.</span> <span id="s1212">And the whole family alone now, and my father went right over, he couldn’t go on summer vacation with us, because he felt he had to take care of the family, but they had -- they had many friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: They did not -- were not needy, I mean, in a -- i-i -- in a physical kind of way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: And where would -- where did the fam -- where did Mrs. Niemoeller and their six children at this point --</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: This -- they still -- they still lived -- they still lived in the parsonage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: In the parsonage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1219">And lived there until 19 -- until the time that Martin was transferred from Dachau --</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: To sa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: -- from -- sorry, from Sachsenhausen to Dachau, then she moved in with friends at Lake Starnberg so she could visit her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: And she was allowed to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Yes, once in awhile she could visit him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: That’s unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: There were di -- well, everything was unusual because he was Hitler’s only private pri -- prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Legally he could -- they couldn’t do anything about him at -- the highest German court had acquitted him, which at 1938 proved that there were judges in Germany who based their judgments, their verdicts on the law --</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: -- and on the law alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Which deeply disturbed Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1233">Now, when you’re at this terrible school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: You go for a walk.</span> <span id="s1236">You actually shake Hitler’s hand at the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1237">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Yeah, yeah, well that wasn’t -- you know, we were taken -- we were dragged on walks every afternoon, and what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: You were dragged?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: How do you know -- two by two --</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: -- and then -- and one day we did not go in the woods, we were j -- one of our classmates had had a -- an operation, I think it was appendicitis and we were supposed to visit her in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1243">That was in 1938 in the summer, I believe.</span> <span id="s1244">And we ma -- just four or six of us marched -- with a teacher, marched towards the town and in town, you know and the -- I still remember the street, I could find it again, with ugly apartment buildings.</span> <span id="s1245">Eberswalde is the name of the -- the -- the -- th-the t-town of 37.</span> <span id="s1246">Notorious now for anti-Semitism and anti-foreignenism, you know.</span> <span id="s1247">And the Nazism, of course.</span> <span id="s1248">And we -- about twice as far as from here to -- to that door, we see several huge limousines with -- open cars and limousines with swastika emblems and we stood still and the teachers [indecipherable] what might that be, you know?</span> <span id="s1249">And there was either policemen, I don’t -- uniformed men who kept us back, just a moment, you can’t pass through here.</span> <span id="s1250">And the very moment we had arrived, as close as now as from here to the door --</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: So about 10 feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: -- that door opens and out comes a group of men, and with them a li -- a man ma -- about my size, with a moustache and a va -- za -- Bavarian hat on, trenchcoat, no uniform, nothing.</span> <span id="s1253">And by Jove, it was Adolf Hitler.</span> <span id="s1254">And he sees us, and he thinks we’ve appeared in his honor, of course, you know?</span> <span id="s1255">And we just stood there, so he went fwa -- one -- one to one, shaking hands, and asking o-our names and where we came from and all that, and then he j -- just went in the car and drove away.</span> <span id="s1256">We didn’t -- we didn’t really b -- nobody believed us but the next day it was in the newspapers that Hitler had visited the widow of an old comrade in Eberswalde, so there was -- I’ll never forget his fishy handsa -- shake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: He had a fishy handshake?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: Fishy handshake.</span> <span id="s1259">And while my mother got sick while there wa -- once their eyes crossed in -- in an opera, during an opera visit, my mother became so violently ill my father had to take her home, she couldn’t sit thr -- through the opera.</span> <span id="s1260">And others were obsessed with his charisma and his blue eyes, I felt nothing.</span> <span id="s1261">There was a ver -- a vo -- a very ordinary man, and he was even smiling.</span> <span id="s1262">But I had no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1265">While one of the girls sank to the ground, and wanted to kiss the spot that Hitler’s foot had touched.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Well that’s -- well, that was my meeting with Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: But of course, you were primed for so many years against hi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Unlike my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: -- right --</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: -- classmates --</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: -- classmates, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: -- of cour -- I couldn’t believe [indecipherable] this man’s supposed to have to done so much evil.</span> <span id="s1274">Yes, and more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: So how were you with these girls at the school, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: I -- some of them, thi -- they were all -- all came, except for me and a couple of others who c -- were -- came from Berlin or Hamburg, they came from vast estates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Uh-huh, very wealthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: And never seen anything except foxes and hares and deer.</span> <span id="s1279">Well, well, was okay, I’m --</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Was there any indoctrination at the school, or -- is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: -- nothing, nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: This is just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: We knew the -- the -- the headmistresses both were very strong anti-Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Oh, they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1290">But they had -- for instance, they had to put up the swastika flag every day, and have it a -- just to s -- let the neighbors think we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: And did most of you realize that this was a kind of conspiracy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Most of them didn’t give a -- didn’t give a hang about it.</span> <span id="s1293">I was the only one who was politically informed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: The only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1297">So that must have also been difficult for you to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: All was di -- everything was difficult for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Everything was -- how was the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Gecchh!</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: You know -- yeah, it -- it was terrible, absolutely terrible.</span> <span id="s1303">Insufficient too, you know.</span> <span id="s1304">Cheap, and -- but that was Prussian, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: This was part of the Prussian upbringing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Part of the Prussian upbringing was also to be of nobility and not to wear glasses.</span> <span id="s1307">Can you imagine Frederick the Great, and Martin Luther with glasses?</span> <span id="s1308">Stupid.</span> <span id="s1309">Two of the girls were extremely short sighted.</span> <span id="s1310">Nearsighted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: But you’re not allowed to wear glasses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yes, they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: They were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: But they were put down every ti -- every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Oh I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: How I loved the day when I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: But were the classes good?</span> <span id="s1318">Were the teachers good?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: They were okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1322">Then we went the -- the second year we went to the local school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1324">Now where were you on Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: There.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: You were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: At the house, at the main house --</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: And did you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: -- we saw the -- the sky, the dark sky lighting up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: And then the -- the super’s wife came in and said, “There’s a fire in this -- in the town.”</span> <span id="s1332">And the headmistress, one of them, took th-the few -- they all wanted to -- to stay up there, nobody was interested, except for may -- three or four.</span> <span id="s1333">We went down and saw, and -- and -- and just -- you know, as soon as we reached the city, the real ci -- as much as or little as there was, did we realize how many Jewish shops there must have been.</span> <span id="s1334">There was of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: -- howling of people, chanting.</span> <span id="s1337">Broken glass, broken doors, everything.</span> <span id="s1338">And all of a sudden I found myself shoved and pressed against the -- the fence separating me and the -- and the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1339">And I was immediately -- I noticed that the fire brigade, the fire hoses were in this direction, one house, another house, in between was the burn -- burning synagogue, and outside later the -- the -- the si-silver items and the Torah scrolls which they had taken apart and trampled on by Hitler Youth and SR.</span> <span id="s1340">There was to -- there was no SS there, as far as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Now you’re 14 years old?</span> <span id="s1342">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: I was so shocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: This was a big impression on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: That was -- of course, I mean had I been at home in Dahlem, I wouldn’t have seen anything because there were no shops, you know, nothing.</span> <span id="s1350">None of my family saw anything, I was the only one, thanks to the fact -- and then Jews driven out of the synagogue, with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: And you saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: -- ye -- I -- oh, I saw the -- must have been the rabbi’s family and thrown on trucks, speeding away and that was it.</span> <span id="s1353">And I went home and that same evening I wrote a description to my parents ending with the words in German, of course, people behaved like wild beasts.</span> <span id="s1354">Yeah, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: And is this a turning -- for many people this is a turning point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Well, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: -- or was this something --</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Not for me, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Not for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: No, no, it would have -- course it was everything -- one hopes, especially as a child, that every deed like that will be the last one, you know?</span> <span id="s1361">Ha!</span> <span id="s1362">We hadn’t seen the beginning yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1364">Did your parents want to leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Never, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Never.</span> <span id="s1367">They never thought about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s1369">A country they -- their families, their clan had helped to build up over centuries?</span> <span id="s1370">Would have been desertion.</span> <span id="s1371">And there is the fact that once you’re out you can’t do anything any more.</span> <span id="s1372">No, no, they didn’t have to for racial reasons.</span> <span id="s1373">The Jews had nothing else to do if they wanted to save their lives.</span> <span id="s1374">Because the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: So there was a sense of responsibility to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1377">To be there, to stay there and take over once the time has passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1379">Did you expect war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: My father told in -- i -- said that in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: It would be war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: I remember him saying to my then brother -- no, he later became my -- my brother-in-law, my sister’s husband, and you will see that the day will come -- first of all, he was a paper manufacturer, that if you make toilet rolls this wide, and if you want to make them a little wider, you’ll be in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1383">And Hitler will start a war, he was only waiting for an opportunity.</span> <span id="s1384">Of course, that we always -- and you know when -- when -- when the war started, I was kind of elated, because I thought now that’s -- that’s the beginning of a -- of the end --</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Of the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: -- and the end will come soon.</span> <span id="s1387">Of course we had no idea of how short the blitzkrieg would be.</span> <span id="s1388">And I s -- I’ve seen my father crying three times in -- in my life.</span> <span id="s1389">One was when Uncle Eberhard’s wife, Maria died of blood poisoning.</span> <span id="s1390">He couldn’t grasp it.</span> <span id="s1391">The next time was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: And Eberhard is your mother’s brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Eberhard’s -- brother, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: She was from -- our family was from Odessa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Second time was when his beloved Rotterdam was laid into ashes by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1398">And the third time was when Hitler started his war against Russia.</span> <span id="s1399">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: So you were there at each of these times to see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Yes, yes, that’s when I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: So there may have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: I witnessed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: -- many more times that he cried, but you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: Probably, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: My father was so sensitive and so -- oh, well I sa -- I said to Elie Wiesel, you know, for 40 years, four oh years, I was not able to mention my father and his -- his -- not talk about ma -- about him at all, because I couldn’t, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1408">Even my own son was of the opinion that in the wake of the 20th of July, my father had somehow lost his life.</span> <span id="s1409">That was good enough for him, you know.</span> <span id="s1410">And then -- but after I met Elie Wiesel, he said -- it was up in his apartment on th -- still on the West Side, which was gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1411">Looking down -- it was April ’85, looking down on the -- on the park that ju -- was just beginning to bloom, and he said, you know, “And now you must tell me all about your father.”</span> <span id="s1412">And I said, “Elie, I can’t.</span> <span id="s1413">I haven’t done it for 40 years [indecipherable].”</span> <span id="s1414">And he said, “You must.”</span> <span id="s1415">And under streaming tears I told him the entire story.</span> <span id="s1416">After which he s -- Marion was there too.</span> <span id="s1417">After that he took me in his arms and comforted me.</span> <span id="s1418">And we were at Martin’s grave, by the way, in Germany, together.</span> <span id="s1419">And he said, “And now you have to learn to speak in public about that.”</span> <span id="s1420">I said, “I can never speak in public.”</span> <span id="s1421">“Of course you can.”</span> <span id="s1422">Then later -- a year later, I said -- and he said, “Now you have to write a book.”</span> <span id="s1423">“I can’t write a book.”</span> <span id="s1424">“Of course you can.”</span> <span id="s1425">And then I came to him one day and I said, “Elie, I’m going to be Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1426">And he said -- he left -- were two -- two words of, he said, “Of course.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Beginning and end of discussion.</span> <span id="s1429">But he has opened windows in my life that I didn’t -- doors of my -- in my life that I didn’t even know existed.</span> <span id="s1430">Bless him for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: And many other things.</span> <span id="s1433">Yeah, now I’m home, and I’ve been sacked from school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: You -- you were kicked out of school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Yes, I was kicked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Well, I was sent to one of my -- to -- out of the way, a-away, away, to an estate of friends -- of -- of -- of -- one of the many estates of family members and I stayed that -- there, until -- because -- yeah, I stayed there, helping in the household, you know, learning about household and all that.</span> <span id="s1438">And then I s -- decided to do something that would vastly amuse his majesty.</span> <span id="s1439">I declared to my father that I’m going to go be a -- a -- a -- an actress.</span> <span id="s1440">Go on sta -- an actress.</span> <span id="s1441">That had never happened in that family --</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Oh, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: -- to stoop that low, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: So he went to Holland.</span> <span id="s1446">Must have been before -- of course, before his death.</span> <span id="s1447">And he sa -- my father said to His Majesty -- I -- he had to tell him something personal and wanted his advice.</span> <span id="s1448">The little monkey -- no, my -- my ba -- Billa, he called me, she wants to go on stage.</span> <span id="s1449">The little monkey wants to be an actress?</span> <span id="s1450">And then he -- he hit my father on the shoulder, and he said, “And to you of all people this must happen.”</span> <span id="s1451">And he thought it was a marvelous idea, so my father came home in a different mood, and he said, “All right, if you pass the entrance exam of the state actors school, yi -- I will let you.”</span> <span id="s1452">And of course, then these things developed, I was accepted, and the Kaiser even lived to see it happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: So where did you get this idea that you wanted to be an actor?</span> <span id="s1454">How did that happen?</span> <span id="s1455">Or had you been doing it all your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Well, I w -- I was enough -- it was probably first of all to shock my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1457">But otherwise I wanted to be somebody, you know, by now it was clear that I would not always stay quite that homely.</span> <span id="s1458">And I had boyf -- men friends, always older men as boyfriends.</span> <span id="s1459">And I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Even when you were in boarding school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1464">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: No, once you have been kicked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Oh, after that, yes.</span> <span id="s1467">And then, you know, the stage was a very safe place for anti-Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: You were practically taboo.</span> <span id="s1470">Ye -- I didn’t have to go to the labor studio -- attend the labor service, nobody asked me about the BDM or party, nothing.</span> <span id="s1471">You were safe, you were on a different level.</span> <span id="s1472">And I knew that, of course, because I knew enough actors in Berlin now.</span> <span id="s1473">I had my two years in Berlin of ballet, and of -- education of -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: And when did you -- when did you go to the academy?</span> <span id="s1475">Was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: April --</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: It was after the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: Oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: After --</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: -- a-after my 18th birthday, in a -- in ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: In ’41 you started?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: I became th -- I -- the favorite student --</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Of Walter --</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Walter Franck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: -- Franck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: A very famous German actor.</span> <span id="s1487">One of the families who hid Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: Yes, he had a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: -- [indecipherable] his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: [indecipherable] wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Yes, and your -- and this is the group from which sometimes Jews would come to your house --</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: -- your families house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: Or -- or go vice-a-versa, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: And you had a relationship with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Oh yes, we had a loving relationship for two years, and he taught me the basics and everything.</span> <span id="s1498">And it’s still -- it’s still true, you know, what to do as a woman, too, and what not to do.</span> <span id="s1499">Of course, as an 18 year old -- he would never touch a -- a girl who had no experiences at all, but we were in a relationship, can say that, and two most happy years ended, hit -- it never -- it wa -- grew into a deep friendship, and ended only with his untimely death in -- in -- I don’t remember, ’68.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Did you live together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: Oh no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: -- he was very happily married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: He was 30 years older than I.</span> <span id="s1506">What else is new?</span> <span id="s1507">And he -- but he needed somebody on the side, always, whether that woman was Marlene Dietrich, or Elizabeth Bergner, or I, it was always a relationship that lasted two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Yes, very strange.</span> <span id="s1510">And his wife, I don’t know how much she knew.</span> <span id="s1511">She liked me, I liked her.</span> <span id="s1512">And well -- and then we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Was that odd for you as a young person, being with a married man, and knowing the wife, is that odd?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: But it came so easily --</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: -- if -- if somebody asked me was it odd for me to rav -- to -- to -- to convert to Judaism --</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: -- you know?</span> <span id="s1519">It was -- it came in such --</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: It was -- uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: -- it was done so tactfully, and s -- based -- it was based on friendship, and the same political opinion.</span> <span id="s1522">He was the fi -- that, he didn’t tell anybody, the first cousin of Field Marshall Kesserling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: And they looked alike.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Did you work with him on the stage, or was he no longer acting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Oh, yes, he was acting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: He was then acting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: As a -- only on the theater that was under Göring.</span> <span id="s1529">And ger -- and Goebbels was movies.</span> <span id="s1530">And those two had a very intimate enemy-ship, you know?</span> <span id="s1531">So Göring wouldn’t let anybody touch his theater, and in the -- and Goebbels, he struck him -- Walter Franck from the list of actors to appear in movies, because he had never b -- gone to one of his receptions, always inventing one ailment after the other.</span> <span id="s1532">So -- but you -- it didn’t -- didn’t disturb his theater career.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1534">Were you a good actress, you think?</span> <span id="s1535">Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: I loved it.</span> <span id="s1537">But I was then doing my first engagement in Danzig, Nazi town of the first caliber, which was -- I wasn’t used to that, you know?</span> <span id="s1538">I -- I began suffering from stage fright, and it became so bad that I -- aft -- then I went to Essen, and then came the 20th of July, and the theaters were closed, and Essen was in the war.</span> <span id="s1539">No Nazis, strangely enough.</span> <span id="s1540">But the east?</span> <span id="s1541">They got what they deserved, and they deserved what they got.</span> <span id="s1542">And the entire ensemble died, because they -- except me, because they tried to flee on the Gustloff, Wilhelm Gustloff, the ship that was sunk by a -- by a Russian torpedo.</span> <span id="s1543">And I would have be -- by God’s grace, I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1544">Yeah -- and no, but then, after the war, I became -- I became a -- an announcer -- a speaker on -- on the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: That I wer -- no problems at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Did your parents see you on stage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Yeah, my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Your mother saw you, not your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: No, he was already in prison, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1552">And did she enjoy that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: She did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: Very strange experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: And your brother?</span> <span id="s1557">Or was he in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: No, he wa -- my brother was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: He was away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: He was a soldier --</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: -- at age 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: But fortunately he was in Denmark, being stationed in the house of a pastor.</span> <span id="s1565">And there was a deep friendship, and he -- until the pastor died, visited him after the war, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Now, I understand that you, in a certain way rejected the confessing -- even the Confessing Church, at a young age?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: What they did, when they could have done something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Whey they could have done more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: What of -- something, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: Something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: Well that’s was, you know, the Stuttgart Declaration of guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Yes, explain that, what is -- what was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: That was -- well, when Martin returned from the concentration camp, livid --</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: This is after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1576">A terrible embarrassment for all the people who claimed they couldn’t have done anything, you know, and here he comes.</span> <span id="s1577">Oh, had he only died, they would have built a church with his name and all that.</span> <span id="s1578">But he came back just at the moment when they began business as usual, without a -- anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: So he forced the part, that Stuttgart Declaration.</span> <span id="s1581">But the most important sentences were stricken.</span> <span id="s1582">The church said we should ask forgiveness because they had not prayed enough, and not done enough.</span> <span id="s1583">And he said -- Martin said, bullshit.</span> <span id="s1584">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1585">They did nothing.</span> <span id="s1586">Which is true, after Hitler was very, very wise, taking him away from his flock, because -- which was supposed to become a resistance group.</span> <span id="s1587">They -- there were -- there were martyrs there of the Confessing Church, fa -- fal -- Snyder you know, and many others.</span> <span id="s1588">But -- excuse me, senior moment.</span> <span id="s1589">But as a group they arranged themselves, only to claim after the war that they hadn’t prayed enough.</span> <span id="s1590">Hah!</span> <span id="s1591">But you know, Martin was a thorn in their flesh from the f -- moment one to his death.</span> <span id="s1592">Before his death he said into movie cameras, television cameras, “And if I did not receive my pension from the church, I would become a Quaker.”</span> <span id="s1593">He wasn’t at the hierarchy, oh that bugged him.</span> <span id="s1594">He would not resi -- accept the title bishop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1596">[indecipherable] remained a pastor, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: He remained pastor and president, president of the church [indecipherable] Council of churches, and president of the -- of the church of Hessen and Nassau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1599">All right, we have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Sibylle, I asked you a question close to when we stopped, and I think you answered it in a different way than I asked it.</span> <span id="s1603">Why was it that you left the church when -- in your self description that you left the church when you were about 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: 18 - 19, because I realized there w -- it -- the Confessing Church would not live up to Martin Niemoeller’s expectations.</span> <span id="s1605">And they were inert, they did nothing.</span> <span id="s1606">And my [indecipherable] and to add something personal, you know there were three pastors in -- in Dahlem, and there was so much trouble between them, personal things, that my mother -- my mother and my -- I mean, leaving the church doesn’t mean that I declared my -- my -- excuse me, I -- I have to think.</span> <span id="s1607">No, my -- my parents also -- I didn’t go to church any more, and neither did they.</span> <span id="s1608">There were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: But you still felt that you were a Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Y-Yes, moderately so.</span> <span id="s1611">But you know then later, when I came to New York and lived among Jews, the church -- I didn’t -- I didn’t go back to the church there either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: And later when I ma -- ma -- I married Martin Niemoeller, he urged me to study about it more, and gave me books.</span> <span id="s1614">And what that led to was my conversion to Judaism, because it’s a logical way, you know?</span> <span id="s1615">I found my roots, that’s what -- how Elie Wiesel put it.</span> <span id="s1616">I -- I told him I’m going to be Jewish, and he said, “Of course, you want to go back to your roots.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1618">But during the war period --</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: -- that’s not the direction that you feel you’re going in.</span> <span id="s1621">You just simply are -- you’re angry at the church for what it’s not doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: No, I’m angry at the church, but I would never have formally left it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Because being a member of the Confessing Church was a sign, an outward sign that you were not for the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1626">No matter what it wasn’t doing, it still was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: -- clearly anti-Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1631">Now tell me just a -- a -- the little story about Leni Riefenstahl’s house and what was going on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Oh, yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: -- in the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1635">Well, after -- that must have been around the 20th of July, ’44, when my father -- first the Gestapo came and -- and took me on the 21st.</span> <span id="s1636">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Do you want to tell the story about the assassination plot, and then this -- and then go to Leni Riefenstahl, would that make more sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Oh no, we -- I can go back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: And -- and after my father -- it was -- must have been around that time that we stopped being -- being part of that circle hiding Jews because the Gestapo -- and they always come unannounced, were searching the house all the time, and nobody was served by that.</span> <span id="s1641">So, through a man I met on a train -- and my instinct always told me he’s okay, or she’s okay, or not, I found entry into a very interesting group of resisters in Dahlem who specialized in forging papers, forging money, and the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1642">And ha -- hiding people, or sending then into hiding, German army deserters, Jews, whoever came to their door, they were taken care of.</span> <span id="s1643">And that all took place in the gardener’s house, adjacent to Leni Riefenstahl’s beautiful villa, which reminded one of Hitler’s Berkoff.</span> <span id="s1644">It was probably built with B-Berkoff in mind.</span> <span id="s1645">I never saw the lady, she was out filming on th -- all through the war.</span> <span id="s1646">But she had just been married to a German officer by the name of Jarkop, he was a major.</span> <span id="s1647">And he popped up once in awhile, so we had to be very, very careful.</span> <span id="s1648">And I remember going there once, there was the so-called caretaker, with his so-called wife.</span> <span id="s1649">They weren’t married, you know, but they gained, somehow, Leni Riefenstahl’s trust, and were taking care -- you know, with all the bombing, care of the house and garden, and very fast through this -- this man, Hans Andres was his name, and he was a funny existence.</span> <span id="s1650">He was very much anti-Nazi, and -- but he was dealing on the black market, I think, and black market meant money, money, money.</span> <span id="s1651">And money was always needed.</span> <span id="s1652">And in the cellar of that house there were machine -- first of all there was an arsenal of weapons.</span> <span id="s1653">And then there was a money forging machine, and a money printing machine and -- and paper forging machine, and all that, and they -- they took me into that, you know, into their trust, they knew they could, and the s -- as soon as somebody had come, and there were -- usually they were received in the kitchen, and got something to eat and to drink.</span> <span id="s1654">And with the slightest noise that was not expected, there was an opening in the floor through which you could go down in the cellar.</span> <span id="s1655">They were quickly pushed down, and the carpet o-over them.</span> <span id="s1656">And one day I was there, the caretaker, Powell and I were there.</span> <span id="s1657">Powell was wearing an apron, green gardener’s apron when there was a knock at the door.</span> <span id="s1658">God, what is it now?</span> <span id="s1659">There were two deserters in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1660">Down with the deserters.</span> <span id="s1661">It was Leni Riefenstahl’s dear husband.</span> <span id="s1662">And Powell said to me, “Keep him out of the kitchen.”</span> <span id="s1663">And he pushed me -- bu -- bu -- bu -- made me drag him into the bedroom, you know.</span> <span id="s1664">I was red -- not ready, but prepared for anything.</span> <span id="s1665">And -- and he would -- and Powell said, “You know, we’ve just wiped the floor of the kitchen, just will -- if you give us a minute.”</span> <span id="s1666">So I went into the little bedroom with him.</span> <span id="s1667">An extremely stupid looking man by the way, and -- and then he just wanted to see if everything was in order.</span> <span id="s1668">Oh yes, of course, Herr Major, of course Herr Major.</span> <span id="s1669">At that time I didn’t know yet who he was.</span> <span id="s1670">There hadn’t been time, you know, was just somebody.</span> <span id="s1671">And then he came into the kitchen, looked around, everything seemed fine, everything had been pushed into drawers, and -- and bottles into the closets and all that.</span> <span id="s1672">And then he said -- and the car was -- staff car was waiting for him, and he said now he -- he had to go back to the front.</span> <span id="s1673">The front was probably 10 miles away, or 20 miles away.</span> <span id="s1674">And then Powell told me, “You know who that was?</span> <span id="s1675">That was Leni Riefenstahl’s husband.”</span> <span id="s1676">And that was the closest call I’ve --</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: That you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: -- that I remember.</span> <span id="s1679">And Hans was the one who furnished all of us with a weapon.</span> <span id="s1680">That weapon, a little Ortgiess [indecipherable] that saved my life and shot an SS man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: So that you got from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: I got that from Hans.</span> <span id="s1683">Because -- I write in my book it’s -- was my father’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: Yes, but it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: -- it really the -- no, my father had a similar one.</span> <span id="s1686">But it was Hans’ --</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: -- who suggested that I always carry it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Carry it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1691">In -- at the time I had been in -- I had been -- the theaters had been closed by the führer on the first of September.</span> <span id="s1692">I had never lived to see the opening night for “Taming of the Shrew” in -- in Essen.</span> <span id="s1693">And I was now a fr-free -- a free for all, what was I going to do?</span> <span id="s1694">They came and inducted me into the -- into the flak, the wom -- you know, the women for the flak, wh-what is the flak?</span> <span id="s1695">Anti --</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Anti-aircraft.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: -- aircraft.</span> <span id="s1698">And I went for -- for an interview there, I mean, that was demanded.</span> <span id="s1699">And a absolutely horrible woman, you know, a sergeant as a -- she was a Nazi, and she -- she really was -- was ready to let me have it as a daughter of a Junker, and -- and -- and a pra -- a jailbird and all that.</span> <span id="s1700">And so it was agreed that by the first of October, I would start there.</span> <span id="s1701">And I said to myself, no, I’m not going to do that.</span> <span id="s1702">And one day I opened a newspaper, and in the -- were few newspapers at [indecipherable] time because of the paper shortage.</span> <span id="s1703">And I opened the newspaper and there is an add that urgently girls -- females, were sought to replace men to go to the front, to train horses.</span> <span id="s1704">A remonté -- a remonté is a ho -- a young horse not trained yet.</span> <span id="s1705">So, outside of the Berlin there was the cavalries -- was the cavalry.</span> <span id="s1706">And I went for an exam, and I was accepted, and I went back and I went myself to tell this female sergeant that the cavalry outranked [indecipherable] you know [indecipherable] and she cou -- wouldn’t get me.</span> <span id="s1707">And then I went into the -- in the cavalry, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: And you were trained as a young -- this is one of the things your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Yeah, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: -- wanted you to learn to do is -- is ride horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: Yes, and I had a talent for riding, for dressage especially.</span> <span id="s1712">I was always afraid jumping, to jump, always.</span> <span id="s1713">Never lost that fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Yeah, I -- before I was thrown so many times.</span> <span id="s1716">Well, anyway, w-we -- and you know, training a horse from scratch is a very, very taxing thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: A horse doesn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: Not one bit.</span> <span id="s1721">But we had to do it, I had six or seven horses every day, si -- ride six or seven hours a day.</span> <span id="s1722">But you know, we were in a -- in a -- in a hut, in a barrack, with three bedrooms, all of us girls, and most of them were from nobility, because after all, who could ride, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: And they were all, with few exceptions, very, very nice.</span> <span id="s1725">I still have one I’m in contact with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: And it was very exhausting, but it -- I had a wonderful commander, th-the -- the colonel, Colonel Behnke.</span> <span id="s1728">I call him different in my -- in my book.</span> <span id="s1729">And he -- I told him -- I -- I -- I relieved myself of my -- you know, I told him of my father, and he was so good, and he said ma -- at that time my father was in a prison in Berlin, and we didn’t know where.</span> <span id="s1730">I had to search for him.</span> <span id="s1731">I found him there, but only because that nice colonel let me go to Berlin on some kind of a mission, you know.</span> <span id="s1732">I was wearing uniform, riding boots, e-especially t -- all tailored for us, you know?</span> <span id="s1733">And well we -- I would stay there until the end of -- of the war, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: And in the stables, helping us, were Russians, Russian prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1736">Every morning a troop of bedraggled le -- figures came from that -- the -- the -- the camp, you know, the POW camp to help us in the stables.</span> <span id="s1737">And they were having a wonderful time with us.</span> <span id="s1738">We gave them bread, the stables were warm.</span> <span id="s1739">I once visited that camp to identify a certain man, and it was -- there were vi -- on -- they were sleeping on the -- they didn’t even have straw, was stone floors.</span> <span id="s1740">And what -- what one of them told me they drag -- they dreaded nothing more than the Sundays when they didn’t have to work, what were they supposed to do?</span> <span id="s1741">And well that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Let’s go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Yeah, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Cause when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: [indecipherable] ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: Yeah, yeah, of course, I’m going too far.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: There -- there -- there are two things I want to ask you.</span> <span id="s1749">One -- one is, what rumors are you hearing about what the Nazis are doing to Jews in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: Oh, no rumors, we listened to the BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: And you -- and what are you told, di -- you -- did you listen to th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: The Voice of America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Da da da daa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Oh yes, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: And what did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: -- when I was away from home --</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: You were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: -- I heard nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: You heard nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: But when you were back in Berlin --</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: Back in Berlin, in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: In 40 -- you’re back there by ’43 or ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: No, no, I was -- we are talking now ’44, and I was allowed to go to Berlin from time to time, even though there was -- no other one of the girls was allowed out.</span> <span id="s1767">I was still searching for my father.</span> <span id="s1768">I found he -- I found his, the prison, the attastrasse number three, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: No, I’m asking now before, before he’s imprisoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1771">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: A little before the assassination plot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: Cause he’s -- okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: Do -- do you hear -- d -- are people talking about they’re murdering Jews, are they saying --</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: You -- you know this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: Of course, they were -- there were rumors but we didn’t -- we didn’t put too much importance on those rumors.</span> <span id="s1780">But we heard the name Auschwitz on the BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: Right, but -- but did you believe what they were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: And at that time in our house was a Jewish woman posing as a seamstress.</span> <span id="s1787">She was Frau Thiele, but her real name was Rittenburg.</span> <span id="s1788">And her son and -- and -- and husband had already been deported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1789">They were -- they didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s1790">She -- she by the way is the only one we know by name that sur -- that survived in Ditte’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: And went to England right away.</span> <span id="s1793">And my father, after his demise from -- from the German -- from the army, with the help of Canaris, he escaped the concentration camp then.</span> <span id="s1794">He was at home, and shortly before the 20th of July he went to -- to the estate of -- of friends of ours to be away for the time, and return right after to resume his planned post as a liaison man to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: But now you -- does he know about the July 20th plot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: Well, he -- the -- the -- the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: His part --</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: -- meetings had taken place in our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Taken place in your house, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: And now the last question that had to be solved was who is going to do it?</span> <span id="s1801">Must be somebody willing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: -- able, and still allowed in Hitler’s presence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Because at that time he was a full grown paranoiac, and Stauffenberg was still -- still permitted in his presence.</span> <span id="s1806">And there was a briefing that was to take place at hit -- at the wolf’s lair, his headquarters, on the 20th of July, and my cu -- my cousin Werner, and he -- Stauffenberg and his adjutant Werner von Haften, they flew by military plane of course, up to ca -- to -- to east Prussia.</span> <span id="s1807">And in with them they had the attaché case with the two British made bombs.</span> <span id="s1808">And full of hope that maybe this time.</span> <span id="s1809">And they entered the building, but my cousin Werner was not allowed to enter the ro -- the conference room.</span> <span id="s1810">First of all, the conference was a -- a ba -- supposed to take place in an underground bunker, where the bomb -- the explosion would have torn everyone to bits.</span> <span id="s1811">At the last moment, it was -- it was transferred to a -- to a -- a hut, a light hut, where most of the pressure went out the windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: Hitler again, because a wa -- the -- of the intense heat that day -- and as you know, I wa -- I’m not going to ta -- to -- to -- to talk at detail about how it then went, but Stauffenberg put the bo -- he had excused himself for changing his shirt or something like that before he reported to the führer, and had done what had to be done to the bombs in order to set them for time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: And nothing could go wrong, really, nothing.</span> <span id="s1816">So he -- he had been planned on the -- on this underground bunker now, and that.</span> <span id="s1817">He put it underneath a heavy oak table.</span> <span id="s1818">And then 24 -- 24 people attended, and wa -- wa -- the -- the bombs were set for a certain time, so my cousin was -- was advised to -- to disturb, in order to get him out, he was allegedly to be called on the phone.</span> <span id="s1819">And Stauffenberg went out and the two made it back, with a chauffeured car back to the airport and on the plane to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1820">But already on their way, they heard the explosion and they knew that everybody must have got -- been killed.</span> <span id="s1821">Three people were killed, 11 were heavily wounded, but Hitler was not among them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: He stood there, his trousers in -- in shreds, and one arm was paralyzed and all that, but he was expecting Mussolini that same afternoon, visiting him, and he made it.</span> <span id="s1824">He was bereft of his speech for awhile, but he again -- and he made it by the time that -- that we were home, I was -- I was outside of Berlin at the estate of a friend of mine, made it back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1825">And at my -- shortly after midnight we turned on the radio and there was Hitler speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1827">Did you -- did you know about the plot before --</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: Oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: That was the trouble.</span> <span id="s1831">Too many people knew, too many people knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: And I remember the day before I went to the countryside, be-before -- it must have been on the 15th of July, I took a walk with my father in the neighborhood and from a lantern right close to our house, hung a German soldier.</span> <span id="s1834">I was not worth dying for the führer, you know.</span> <span id="s1835">And my ha -- my father had been let out of the -- Hitler’s prison.</span> <span id="s1836">He was -- wait a mo -- no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wrong, wrong, wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: You were talking about [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: We are now ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1841">And -- and we -- an-and by this -- by the church my father stood, took me by the shoulders and he said, “Something is going to happen.”</span> <span id="s1842">And it’ll happen tomorrow, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1843">“We have to do it, and it will -- it will not work.</span> <span id="s1844">It will not -- I have a feeling,” he said, “it will not work.”</span> <span id="s1845">As Alan -- keep for -- no, forget.</span> <span id="s1846">Anyway, he said, “It will not work, but we have to show that some people cared.”</span> <span id="s1847">And I knew then that he did not count himself above this err -- among the survivors.</span> <span id="s1848">And he said, “When all is over, I want you to seek your luck under another star.</span> <span id="s1849">You -- and for you and your children.”</span> <span id="s1850">And I’ve never forgotten that, he want --</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Was that the first time he said that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: That was the only time he said that to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: The only time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1855">And we went home arv -- you know, and then they -- there came f -- my father left for the Mackensan’s, and I -- I was visiting my cousin Ilse, I came back and -- after it happened, and the next day at six o’clock in the morning the Gestapo came and searched the house.</span> <span id="s1856">And my fa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: But your mother’s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: My mother is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: And you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: My mother is there, but I tell you something now that shows -- demonstrates the naiveté of th -- all the plotters.</span> <span id="s1861">They were not trained mur-murderers, they were gentlemen, you know?</span> <span id="s1862">And on my father’s desk -- oh, you’re father’s absent.</span> <span id="s1863">Yes, he is with so and so, you know.</span> <span id="s1864">On my father’s d-desk is a little piece of paper and on it is a telephone number.</span> <span id="s1865">And the Gestapo man takes it, and says, “Whose number is that?”</span> <span id="s1866">My mother said, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1867">You know?</span> <span id="s1868">And -- and she snatches it away from him.</span> <span id="s1869">And then he -- she tries the number, or allegedly that number, it was a different number, and she said, “I can’t get through.”</span> <span id="s1870">And she says, “You know, give it to me, I’ll try from the upstairs phone.”</span> <span id="s1871">And upstairs she manages -- it was pencil written, to erase two of the numbers and falsify them.</span> <span id="s1872">The number was that of Goerdeler, who was going to be the head of the new government.</span> <span id="s1873">And they never found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: That was my mother.</span> <span id="s1876">Typical.</span> <span id="s1877">Well, anyway, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: So you’re saying that in some way she was, if not smarter, more strategic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: She saw, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: -- she was smart too, and cunning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: Cunning, yes, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: And also pretty brave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: -- they never even took my mother in for -- for an interrogation, they took me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: But they took you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: Oh yes, because I was -- not so much because I was my father’s daughter, but because I was mu -- Werner’s cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: But you know, I made them believe that I -- Werner and I were lovers, which was not too far from the truth, but -- we had fallen in love as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s1890">And -- and sh -- you know, I -- I don’t know -- know about that, we made love, we da-da da-da.</span> <span id="s1891">And they -- and, you know, my father had trained me, he had said, when you get into the hands of the Gestapo, only answer with yes or no.</span> <span id="s1892">And when they get friendly, then beware.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: Then beware.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Then beware, yeah.</span> <span id="s1895">And they got very friendly.</span> <span id="s1896">And I played stupid, and -- and during the second interrogation, the Gestapo man by the name of Wipper, [indecipherable] Wipper -- we never found him after the war.</span> <span id="s1897">He called another man in because he wouldn’t hit anybody and that one let me have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: He hit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: He hit me in the face with his -- with -- he had a -- a bo -- twice the size.</span> <span id="s1900">And I was bleeding like a -- like a -- how does one bleed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: And was -- di -- did he hit you just because he felt like hitting you, or he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: -- asking you a question and you didn’t answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1905">He didn’t even ask any question anyway, he just let me have it to prepare me for the next session, you know.</span> <span id="s1906">And then -- but then they let me go.</span> <span id="s1907">And on the way downstairs, cowering on a -- in a -- in a chair, I saw a beautiful girl, classmate from Eberswalde, who was le -- the legitimate bride of my f -- my -- my cousin Werner von Haften.</span> <span id="s1908">He was a big one with women, you know?</span> <span id="s1909">And she to this day, acts like his widow.</span> <span id="s1910">I’ve never told her that he and I were a bit attracted to one another.</span> <span id="s1911">And she is the only one of the family, that family, who never married.</span> <span id="s1912">Well, anyway, I went home, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: So they -- did they believe you, that you were having a relationship with Werner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: I -- I only said I only know him personally.</span> <span id="s1917">I’ve not the faintest idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: And then, you know, on the 23rd, they came for my father.</span> <span id="s1920">It was a Saturday or a Sunday.</span> <span id="s1921">And then they came [indecipherable] sie holen [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: And this injury, how bad was the injury to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: Well, I had a black eye, you know, and a s -- and a scratch from the ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: And you -- was your eardrum punctured, was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: Punctured, yes.</span> <span id="s1926">Excuse me, was this side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: It was the right side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: This is my -- this is my -- this is my -- the punctured ear.</span> <span id="s1929">Oh, it was -- it was -- it was ter -- it was so humiliating, you know, and the -- you feel so helpless against that bru --</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: But I found the brute again, right after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: You did find him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: And what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: I reported him to the British.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: And was he arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: Yes, he was arrested, he got a few years, I believe, and then he died, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1938">Was a unbelievable story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: Before we talk about your father’s arrest, how -- how do you understand what they were assassinating in assassinating Hitler?</span> <span id="s1940">What were they trying to stop?</span> <span id="s1941">In -- as far as you understood, what were they really doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: As far as I understood, they were going to kill him, and when he was gone, getting rid of all the others would be child’s play.</span> <span id="s1943">Maybe it would have been, you know?</span> <span id="s1944">But that was the main goal, to get him out of the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: And they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: The head of the snake.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: And the snake --</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: Was the Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: I -- I unders -- no, I understand that.</span> <span id="s1950">But what did the Nazis mean to these people?</span> <span id="s1951">Because they were -- they were in the army, they were -- they -- they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">Q: -- part of the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: Well, it -- it -- they all had different motives.</span> <span id="s1955">Some of them were true anti-Nazis from the beginning on, joining the army when they were forced to, you know, because what else could you do but die, and if you died your whole family was gone, probably.</span> <span id="s1956">And others went along, because they thought maybe it’s the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s1957">And yet others, they really, they waited until it was clear the war was lost.</span> <span id="s1958">So they are -- they -- they joined -- and among those who died a miserable death on the -- on the -- th-th-the piano wire, was a German general, who -- it’s -- it’s documented what he said, quite late, maybe ’42 - ’43, he said, “Well, you can think about Hitler what you want.</span> <span id="s1959">The only good thing is that he rid us of the Jews.”</span> <span id="s1960">There were those people, too.</span> <span id="s1961">So there were not -- and the major -- the minor -- the -- the -- the real from the heart resistors were in the minority.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: Absolutely --</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: -- absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: So it’s a very mixed --</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: A very mixed group --</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: -- mixed motives, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: -- but you know, they make a big thing about them in Germany now.</span> <span id="s1970">Every year they have ceremonies and ji -- th-the f -- on the 55th -- no, o -- o -- in -- in si -- ‘94 I went and the guest of honor was Simon Wiesenthal, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1971">And that was wonderful meeting him.</span> <span id="s1972">He was thin, so fragile and little.</span> <span id="s1973">And now he’s still alive, having lost his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1976">No, I don’t have much in common with the -- with the people of the 20th of July, just a few ma -- family members.</span> <span id="s1977">Course the family has tremendously grown and intermarried, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: And your father’s motives for joining this is clearly one’s that you’re telling [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: One of conscience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: One of conscience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: Absolutely, one of conscience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: And he was ready to -- he was ready to sacrifice his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: In order to stop this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: And he knew he would have to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1987">We have to stop the tape and change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: Sibylle, the third day after the assassination, the Gestapo co -- your father is -- is home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: My father is not home at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: The f -- the -- the -- two days after the -- was probably on the 22nd that they got me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: And my father came home if I am correct, while I was at the Gestapo because he saw how I looked.</span> <span id="s1997">Now, I went twice --</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">A: -- that was the 21st and the 22nd, and on the 23rd they came and got him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: And they knew that he was part of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2002">It was all documented, you know, by -- they didn’t think much of secrets.</span> <span id="s2003">Like the -- that is German, b -- Germanic, because the -- the -- if -- if they had not been so -- so thorough we would never know about how many people di -- were killed in Auschwitz, and so -- it had to be -- all had to ha -- have order.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: So when he was taken, did you expect your father to be killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: And he probably expected that, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: And you knew all these other people were being killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: Did you know -- you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: Yes, one -- one after the other.</span> <span id="s2012">And we -- of course, we didn’t know then by what brutal means they were being killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: And then he had -- he disappeared, nobody could find him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: And how did you find out that people were being killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: I went from one pr --</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: No, no, not about yo -- not where your father is.</span> <span id="s2018">How are you being informed that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: -- people connected with the plot were being killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: I really -- all in all it was 5,500 people.</span> <span id="s2022">I do not remember, I really -- how -- the means by which we were informed.</span> <span id="s2023">I think it was probably the BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: But then it would be after your father was taken, don’t you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: Would you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: So you d -- you don’t -- you don’t know what’s going on in those two days, necessarily, before he’s taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2030">No, and with most of the people Hitler took his time.</span> <span id="s2031">He put them on trial, trial, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2033">Well -- that’s right, yes, cause they’re s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: Only the first four were -- were -- were shot.</span> <span id="s2035">Albrecht, Stauffenberg, Merzenkronheim, and my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: Werner?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: Werner.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: Was shot [indecipherable] also.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: Yeah, Werner was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: He was young?</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: Well, not e -- just 30.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2044">But like all the Brauchitsch, he had -- his mother was a Brauchitsch, you know, they -- he looked very, very young.</span> <span id="s2045">Young and soft, but he wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: He wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: He was determined, also determined to sacrifice his life without thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: Were you in the house when they -- they took your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: Were they brutal with him?</span> <span id="s2051">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: They weren’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2055">The Gestapo -- with the Jews they might have been brutal, not with people like, you know, in this case.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: Even -- even s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A: No, they were very -- they were very matter of fact, polite.</span> <span id="s2058">He could take a toothbrush, or a tis -- a little -- pack a little something.</span> <span id="s2059">And then he went between them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: Even though he’s connected with a plot to kill Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: Isn’t -- isn’t that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: Yeah well, he did -- you know, you di -- didn’t know how many people were watching in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: But ah -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: So he takes the little bag and he goes, and he goes in a car?</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: He goes down the block, across the -- a-a-around the corner, they wouldn’t -- they wouldn’t park in front of the house.</span> <span id="s2068">And there he s -- he is seated between two SS men in the back, that’s was -- and one in the front, and the driver.</span> <span id="s2069">And the driver turns around and says, “Oh my God, Herr Baron.”</span> <span id="s2070">It was the taxi driver who always took him to the station when he went to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: So it’s a taxi driver, it’s not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: No, he had been inducted, you know, there were no taxis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: I see, so he’s inducted --</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: No, he had been inducted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: -- to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: And ha -- and this is what your father told you after he came back, that that’s what happened in the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: Well, he -- during the brief hours that I s -- I saw him, yeah.</span> <span id="s2079">Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: You know he -- when -- his release was -- well anyway, he was gone, he was -- he had disappeared, and I went then already in the -- in the -- in the cavalry and before, went from prison to prison, dolled up to the teeth, you know, high heels and -- I was quite -- quite pretty then.</span> <span id="s2082">And I went in and I just -- what was my excuse?</span> <span id="s2083">Oh yes, I was told my father was here.</span> <span id="s2084">So th -- the idiotic guards let me in and I was wa -- these hallways of the Lehrter strasse prison, that was the military prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: And did you go from prison to prison like this?</span> <span id="s2086">[indecipherable] find him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: I went f -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2088">No, never heard of him, must be an error.</span> <span id="s2089">I said, “Oh well, [indecipherable] is all mine, and all that.”</span> <span id="s2090">And the last prison Lehrter strasse drei, I w -- I standing in the hall, a door opens of -- an office door opens and out comes a dashing SS man, black uniform.</span> <span id="s2091">And I just stood there, and I see a blackboard with the most illustrous names, and I see my father’s name.</span> <span id="s2092">That was a list of the -- big, you know, in big le -- white letters.</span> <span id="s2093">And then I re -- when he came back he said what could he do for me, and I said, “I -- I know my father’s here,” and I da da da da, and, “Can I see him?”</span> <span id="s2094">“No, you have to -- you have to -- you -- well, si -- fill certain forms and you -- and -- and maybe,” -- and I got home and at least we knew where he was.</span> <span id="s2095">So my mother somehow arranged -- and I do not know how it was possible.</span> <span id="s2096">The first time we went to bring him things.</span> <span id="s2097">A down -- a featherbed, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: Cause it was -- yeah, a feather blanket, very light.</span> <span id="s2100">And the most important things were the thermos bottles filled with real coffee.</span> <span id="s2101">In the SS they made a sport out of it, accepting it from you and then dropping it.</span> <span id="s2102">Which was so terrible, you know, but it -- nothing happened.</span> <span id="s2103">My mother and I, we went -- we were led in -- we were told we were not allowed to use the Hitler salute.</span> <span id="s2104">Terrible punishment.</span> <span id="s2105">People like us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: You were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: Yeah that -- we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: -- you were not good enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: -- we were crushed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: Yeah, I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: And th -- we went in and on the benches there sat also wives, mothers, you know, and -- but we -- if we recognized anybody we didn’t let g -- let n -- let anybody know.</span> <span id="s2112">So we sat and waited, and from time to time, the-there was a little booth with a black SS man behind it, who would call out names.</span> <span id="s2113">And a woman would get up with her little package, spend some time there, give the package, and then leave.</span> <span id="s2114">It was our turn and my mother and I went to the window and there was a man looking like Satan himself.</span> <span id="s2115">Really, a bit like Adolf Eichmann.</span> <span id="s2116">Black, piercing eyes and he took the thermos bottle, examined everything and said, quite politely, well that was -- that was it, and then on our -- we -- we turned around and then he called me back.</span> <span id="s2117">Oh God, what have I done now?</span> <span id="s2118">And he said -- he didn’t even lift his eyes to mine, he went on writing, and he said, there now in that position, “Do you have -- could you -- do you think you -- next time you come you have some more bread, or anything to eat?”</span> <span id="s2119">And I -- I went speechless, and he said, “You know, I have many prisoners here who don’t have relatives.”</span> <span id="s2120">That was Oberscharführer Knuth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: Knuth?</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: K-n-u-t-h.</span> <span id="s2123">And oh -- h-he was -- he was the t-turncoat too, you know?</span> <span id="s2124">He realized at some point in his career that he’d joined the wrong party.</span> <span id="s2125">He did a wonderful thing, and by the way the Nazi, th -- his own colleagues took care of him, he didn’t survive the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: Was found out.</span> <span id="s2128">But our friend, to be the minis -- social mi-minister of s -- Teodor Haubach, he was a Socialist.</span> <span id="s2129">Dr. Haubach, a lawyer.</span> <span id="s2130">He was -- he was also in Lehrter strasse.</span> <span id="s2131">He had been condemned to death and he was -- they had to carry him on a stretcher to his execution, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s2132">And his -- his fiancé had received -- had received -- which we did not, permission to see him at Christmas, visit him in the -- in -- in the -- in the prison.</span> <span id="s2133">And she went -- the way that I just described to you, to that window, and Knuth, you know, with a face like that, he said, “Wait a little, wait a little, until I’m rid of all the people here.”</span> <span id="s2134">And then he turned to her and he said -- urged her ga -- s-summoned her into his office, and there was a little office behind, and there was a Christmas tree, a burning -- with burning candles, and there was Teodor Haubach.</span> <span id="s2135">He had arranged a farewell meeting for the two.</span> <span id="s2136">Can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s2137">Must have been very emotional.</span> <span id="s2138">And then he was hanged.</span> <span id="s2139">But much emotion involved in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: So how many times were you able to see your father in this prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: I d -- I never saw my father.</span> <span id="s2142">My mo -- ba -- a -- to -- to gi -- to deliver things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: You could, but you couldn’t see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: I could -- no.</span> <span id="s2145">My -- my mother only, saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: And what did she say about him?</span> <span id="s2147">Did she tal -- tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: Oh he -- yeah, yeah, she -- he looked terrible, and of course, while you were waiting there, for educational reasons they dragged by prisoners at has -- had just been tortured, or led to torture.</span> <span id="s2149">Yeah, that was the way.</span> <span id="s2150">And then one day it must have -- it was on Good Friday, 19 -- oh no, it was -- it’s still March, and I was released from the -- from the cavalry because I had double pneumonia -- no, wa -- pleurisy -- pleurisy.</span> <span id="s2151">And spent time at home with -- I’m glad.</span> <span id="s2152">You know, it was a good idea to be with my mother, and my mother had tried to free -- get my father freed by Kaltenbrunner.</span> <span id="s2153">Kaltenbrunner was a darling.</span> <span id="s2154">And he had not received her.</span> <span id="s2155">And then one day she tried it again, sh -- that woman went into -- in Berlin, to Kaltenbrunner’s office, and -- and decided not to leave until she had seen him.</span> <span id="s2156">And she came back, she was, you know, finished.</span> <span id="s2157">She said that he -- when she walked into Kaltenbrunner, who decided to see her, office -- he was one of the worst -- he didn’t even get up to greet her, and let her stand.</span> <span id="s2158">And she said, “My husband is a -- you know, the last survivor of four brothers.”</span> <span id="s2159">And so on.</span> <span id="s2160">“Had nothing to do with,” da da da.</span> <span id="s2161">And then he re -- she -- sh -- he said nothing, and then he -- she went -- she went home.</span> <span id="s2162">And then on Good Friday, beginning of April it must have been, I was home when a telephone came -- telephone call came to the house, we still at the beginning of April, had a working telephone.</span> <span id="s2163">Still it went into the middle of the -- of the month.</span> <span id="s2164">And on the phone was my father, and he said, “I’m free.</span> <span id="s2165">Come and get me.”</span> <span id="s2166">And we decided -- I said, “Should I pick you up from the prison?”</span> <span id="s2167">He said, “No, no, no, no, on the S-bahn station,” you know, the suburban station, on the S-bahn station, and I -- I don’t know, I must have flown on angel’s wings, because th -- ow -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the subway, the buses, if they came, they came very, very seldom, but I -- somehow I made it and running up the steps to the -- the -- to the up -- upper platform.</span> <span id="s2168">And I was mobbed with people, I couldn’t find my father, because that figure that stretched out his arms to me had nothing in common with my father.</span> <span id="s2169">He was -- had a gray face, he was completely bloated -- he had a very slender face -- completely bloated from the -- you know, from hunger, edema.</span> <span id="s2170">He looked terrible and we sank into each other’s arms and just cried and cried.</span> <span id="s2171">And behind my father, there was a touching sight, was a young SS man, 16, inducted into the SS of course, and had tears streaming down his face because of that sight.</span> <span id="s2172">And then my father noticed that he had left his blanket behind.</span> <span id="s2173">That was a -- you know, precious in those days.</span> <span id="s2174">So the young man ran back t -- and then came back with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: With the blanket, and then we somehow made it home, and sl -- you know, slept in the cellar and then -- it was -- it was the -- until -- it was the 23rd of April then, on the -- in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: S-So your father is in prison from July --</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: July til April.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: -- July ’44, until April ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2181">And that’s -- you know, if he had not been in such a terrible condition, he would have had a better chance to survive what was coming to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: And so how long then are you working with the horses?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: With the horse --</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: It’s af -- is it after he’s arrested --</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">Q: -- that you start?</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A: September, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: After the first of September, when they closed the theaters, and I was w --</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A: -- nobody was allowed to do nothing.</span> <span id="s2192">And I was then -- in January I came down with pneumon -- pleurisy, and in March they released me, and that’s when I went home.</span> <span id="s2193">And I got a little better, but never completely better, you know, and then we’re talking about the end of April, my father is home.</span> <span id="s2194">And -- and just he was home not more than five days maybe, three, five days, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2195">And on the 23rd, you know, I said I would like to go f -- yeah, that was the reason.</span> <span id="s2196">Potsdam had been bombed, something nobody ever expected.</span> <span id="s2197">And in Potsdam was my old grandmother, my father’s mother.</span> <span id="s2198">I said, “I’m going to go on a bicycle and see if Grandma is still alive.”</span> <span id="s2199">And I took the bicycle, steel helmet on, of course my -- parts of my uniform, thank God, you know.</span> <span id="s2200">And my ortkeys.</span> <span id="s2201">And somehow made it to Potsdam on a bicy -- a bicycle.</span> <span id="s2202">The other reason why I went was I wanted to see how my -- my horse, you know, she was already mine, how she w -- wa -- w-what happened to them, because the unit that had been stationed in Baseco, east of Berlin, had been stationed -- had been moved to Potsdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: So the Russians had been in Baseco a long time ago.</span> <span id="s2205">And I found my grandmother alive, and I found her -- her dis -- dip -- her com -- her apartment undisturbed.</span> <span id="s2206">Her maid, Marta was there.</span> <span id="s2207">And I could tell my grandmother that her son, her last remaining son was alive.</span> <span id="s2208">And then I left and made my way north of Potsdam.</span> <span id="s2209">There were so many corpses right, left, and center, and cadavers from horses.</span> <span id="s2210">And I made it to the barracks where the cavalry unit was now stationed.</span> <span id="s2211">And I fell into the commanders arms and he says, “You can’t go back to Berlin, they just blew up all the bridges, and we are moving out.</span> <span id="s2212">We are moving west.”</span> <span id="s2213">So I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: -- I -- on the [indecipherable] at the head of the whole troop -- behind us were the Russians, each leading two horses, and they walked on that trip.</span> <span id="s2216">And we had to go -- the temple that the -- that the Russians were able to go, you know?</span> <span id="s2217">Because we didn’t lose one to lose one man or one -- or one -- or one horse.</span> <span id="s2218">And my two favorite Russians, Fjodur and -- and Pawlik, they were walking right behind me, and I was on the horse, and the commander, and the major and we walked -- we walked west.</span> <span id="s2219">Was -- it was a night already.</span> <span id="s2220">And the second night I fell asleep on a horse.</span> <span id="s2221">And I woke up, had I not worn the steel helmet on my -- I would have cracked open like a coconut.</span> <span id="s2222">On -- and I remember seeing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: Fell off?</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">A: -- Pawlik’s eyes, you know, he picked me up and he said, “Kaput, kaput, nichts kaput, nichts kaput.”</span> <span id="s2225">And then he lifted me up on the horse again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: And you’re riding Arabella all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">A: Nobody else could.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: [indecipherable] nobody else, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2230">Nobody else could, and then we finally were met by the American 82nd Airborne after what -- 12 nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: Did -- did you consider this a liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: Do I consider it as a -- ha!</span> <span id="s2233">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s2234">I’d known all about the 82nd Airborne.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: [indecipherable] oh yes, BBC, you know?</span> <span id="s2237">And it was wonderful, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s2238">Liberation, yes.</span> <span id="s2239">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: You were in Berlin when there is bombing?</span> <span id="s2241">This -- y- you were in Berlin --</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: -- when there was a lot of bombing, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: I don’t think I missed a single wa -- a sing -- single raid, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2246">That was pretty scary, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: -- I was -- well, the only one in my family who was never scared was my mother because she had the second sight, whatever you call that, nothing’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s2248">Nothing is going to happen to the house.</span> <span id="s2249">While my father and I, and later on Liyala, we were scared to death by the bombs.</span> <span id="s2250">And you know, it was like resurrection, surviving a -- a raid.</span> <span id="s2251">And fo -- wa -- you know, I was br-brought up to praise the bombers, you know, who put our -- and to -- I saw that city die inch by inch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: It was terribly sad, but it had to be.</span> <span id="s2254">But you know, I was liberated by the Americans, and the Russians came and there was -- one of the famous meetings on the Elbe, cause that -- that’s where we were, between the Russians and the -- there was only one meeting.</span> <span id="s2255">After that there were no more friendly meetings.</span> <span id="s2256">That was it.</span> <span id="s2257">I mean some of the G.I.’s almost died of the consume of alcohol, you know.</span> <span id="s2258">They weren’t used to that, but that was fraternization, and I was be -- left behind and th -- with the Russians, and was -- and was liberated, saved by young -- a young American officer.</span> <span id="s2259">I know his name but I told him since he had a -- his rencontre with a -- with the army later, and received a -- not for that, for other things he did, received a dishonorable discharge, which to this day follows him.</span> <span id="s2260">Could not remain in the army, but he became a famous lawyer, and after 40 years I found that he has a practice in Florida.</span> <span id="s2261">So we were reunited again.</span> <span id="s2262">Yeah, and then I -- the British came and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: How chaotic was it?</span> <span id="s2264">How difficult were those first few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">A: Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Q: It was wonderful?</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">A: It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s2268">I was in that village, I was hired by the Americans right away to be an interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">Q: Interpreter, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">A: Which meant that I was -- could be disturbed any day of -- any time, night and day.</span> <span id="s2271">And you know, they’ve -- the famous, the most famous thing tha -- things they found things, I’m saying, people that are found, were hiding SS men.</span> <span id="s2272">And some of them were already half beaten to death by the population or by -- by their victims.</span> <span id="s2273">So it was -- there was never a dull moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">Q: But when you think about the whole sit -- maybe your situation was a little bit less chaotic, because you need to ha -- but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">A: It was very chaotic, but very v -- very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: It was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: Very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">Q: Do you think it was nice for all the refugees that were going --</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">A: It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">A: It was unbelievable --</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: -- because we saw them passed when we -- when we moved along these two -- 12 nights, what we passed, these -- these thousands and thousands of refugees, falling, and then attacked by the low flying planes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">A: -- and falling into the -- by the side of the road.</span> <span id="s2286">How many identification I took, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: -- can’t even tell you.</span> <span id="s2289">Yeah, and on the way, before we were liberated, the last day before -- before we met with the Americans, we -- we collected our tri -- train, and ready to move on, and the officers, the -- the veteran, he was in the rank of a major, and I don’t remember his name, and the colonel and I, we were waiting for all the others to come close so we could move on.</span> <span id="s2290">When the SS man came with a -- an SS man came with a -- on a motorcycle, and he said -- asked for identification and he told us we had no business going west, we should go east and defend Berlin.</span> <span id="s2291">Fine, great.</span> <span id="s2292">So without a word, it was only a glance we exchanged, the vet -- the veterinarian -- the veterinarian, a thin blonde man, and I wi -- drew at the same time the pistols, and we shot at the same time.</span> <span id="s2293">And he just sl -- slowly was sloping over his bike, and we still heard the engine going when -- while we moved away.</span> <span id="s2294">Yeah, we killed him.</span> <span id="s2295">I don’t know which bullet killed him, but I don’t [indecipherable] my shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: And you had no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: We had --</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: -- it was a completely automatic response on your --</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: -- completely, because we sho -- it sounded like one shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: Have you ever shot?</span> <span id="s2301">Did you ever shoot anything in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: You were trai --</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: -- you were trained with a gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: Oh, my father taught me, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: This is when you were younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: I was a regular sharpshooter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">A: So, I have a -- maybe I did, but maybe he did, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2314">But that’s the first human being you shot.</span> <span id="s2315">That seems a little --</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: And hopefully the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2319">I have one other person that I probab -- I caused the death of another person, probably of a Russian prisoner.</span> <span id="s2320">My friend Pawlik, and -- you know, that we took along.</span> <span id="s2321">He was such a beautiful little human being, he was -- looked like 16, you know, with -- with al -- infected eyes, and sometimes he was crying, and I said, “Pawlik, what is it?”</span> <span id="s2322">And he said we have such a one -- in his halting German, he could speak a little German -- bad, bad man in our outfit, he is a commissar, a commissar.</span> <span id="s2323">And he is giving them hell for being on friendly terms with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2324">And that’s when I went to inspect that -- that camp, and was pointed out the commissar, and the next day he was gone.</span> <span id="s2325">I don’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s2326">But Powell, and Fjodur, and all the others were very relieved.</span> <span id="s2327">But you know, Powell never made it home, you know what happened to the -- to the -- to the Soviet prisoners.</span> <span id="s2328">The British, they were -- they made it safely into American hands and then were handed back to the Soviet --</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: Oh, back to the Russians, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: And then they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: Well, that is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: But what happened to Powell, your friend --</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Q: -- did he -- he didn’t go -- did he go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">A: I don’t think a single one of them survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">A: According to what you now know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: Now in -- in your book you talk about a lot of rapes that happened to women, and a lot of s-sex all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: They raped anything that moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: Now, you’re talking about the Russians, you talking about the Americans as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">Q: You’re talking about Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">A: Russia.</span> <span id="s2347">There were alleged rapes by -- by the -- the Americans, but they had been invited, really.</span> <span id="s2348">But the Russians raped anything -- I think only female, no -- no boys were raped, was -- so between the ages of three and 103.</span> <span id="s2349">It was absolutely terrifying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">Q: You also said your mother was never raped.</span> <span id="s2351">Or she -- wa -- she said --</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">A: Well, I’ll tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: -- that’s what she said.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">A: -- we -- w-we agreed in the family we wouldn’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">A: But my mother knows she, and I believe her, that soon as the Russian -- and now she was alone, my father was gone, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: -- they had taken him from in front of the house where he was sweeping the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s2359">A truck came by and collected all the men, you know, and only one came back from [indecipherable] and that was our neighbor who had been in the party and was well fed and younger.</span> <span id="s2360">And my mother’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: Wait, which party had he -- had he been in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: The Nazi party?</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2365">Across the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: So you di -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: The neighbor across the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: So why do you think the Russians pi -- did -- do you think they picked up the -- these men, including your father cause they thought they were Nazis or what?</span> <span id="s2369">You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: Probably, but there are various theories about that.</span> <span id="s2371">In the -- on the truck was an old friend of my father who said, “I told the Russians to drive by your house.</span> <span id="s2372">I’ve lost all my documents and now they came to -- to arrest me, and only you can tell them who I am.”</span> <span id="s2373">And my father said, “Of course, I’ll come with you.”</span> <span id="s2374">And my mother at the last moment said, “Here is -- it might be a cold evening, take a jacket.”</span> <span id="s2375">And that was the last we ever saw of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: And that was the last time --</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">Q: So nobody’s -- nobody is sure what this rounding up was about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: Nobody to this -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: This sor --</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: -- well later, when they interrogated my father, of course they found out that he was a baron.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: Probably a spy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">A: Most likely a spy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Q: So that they were worried, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: Ho -- wer -- but it’s all --</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: Speculative, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: -- theoretical, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">A: And on the 12th of November, he -- his -- his bed bunk neighbor, a famous German actor who survived, by the way, found him dead on the floor.</span> <span id="s2392">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: So this is why November is a terrible month for you always?</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2395">We were all taught to fear November.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">Q: As a bad month.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: All right, we’ll change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: When did you find out that your father had passed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: My father had disappeared, dissolved in thin air, so to say, and there were -- was a rumor here and a rumor there, and there were little pieces of paper found in the mailbox telling us that he is alive, but not where and -- and all that.</span> <span id="s2404">We are talking between the end of April and -- and -- well, until he died on the 12th of November.</span> <span id="s2405">What month it was I do not remember.</span> <span id="s2406">Oh yes, it must have been after April 1946.</span> <span id="s2407">I had gone over the green border, so to say, on the first of January 1945, to see where my mother was, you know, how things were in Berlin.</span> <span id="s2408">But there were no official documents that -- that would allow you to pass from one zone to the other.</span> <span id="s2409">So I left my horse in Hasseldorf with my family there, friends, and boarded a train and somehow, fastened by -- by something to the -- what do you call these things between trains, you know, I mean there were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">Q: I don’t remember what you call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">A: -- were no room on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: I don’t remember what you call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: Ice cold, they had -- had to hack me loose in -- in -- in Berlin, I arrived there.</span> <span id="s2414">And somehow I remember h -- the happiness when I saw American soldiers on the subway, it was great.</span> <span id="s2415">But I knew that our house was still there.</span> <span id="s2416">So I -- I kind of ran home, and there w-was my mother, very thin, very much alone.</span> <span id="s2417">I mean, she had a house full of refugees, of course, and in good spirits as I -- you know, of -- always collected, calm and collected.</span> <span id="s2418">And then -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2419">Then I’d stay -- I stayed until -- until the first us -- beginning of April, 40 -- ’46, April ’46.</span> <span id="s2420">I decided to go back to Hasseldorf, see how my horse is, and ra -- I worked for the Norddeutscher radio station as an announcer and I wanted to go back to my job, and how was it -- yeah, there was no way to get back, either.</span> <span id="s2421">And so I smuggled myself into a refugee camp, even got food rations there, I remember.</span> <span id="s2422">And somehow th -- there was a train, like cattle cars, like the ones, you know, that were used to ship the Jews away.</span> <span id="s2423">Cattle cars, maybe twen -- 10 - 20 cattle cars.</span> <span id="s2424">And right smack in the middle was one car reserved for the British -- a re-regular car -- a car reserved for the British who would accompany the train and tried to -- would try to protect us against the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s2425">And at the -- at the checkpoint, I conversed with one.</span> <span id="s2426">He said, “You speak English, you’ll be our interpreter.”</span> <span id="s2427">And so I was very glad.</span> <span id="s2428">I was allowed to travel in the -- i -- I put my things in the -- in a -- in a -- in the cattle ca -- in the cattle car, and in the next one that was the British car, oh, I got a beautiful meal and beer, and whatever.</span> <span id="s2429">And whatever my services were -- were demanded, I did it.</span> <span id="s2430">I did it, and you know, g-going a stretch that nowadays by car would take from Berlin two and a half hours, then took 24.</span> <span id="s2431">20 f -- more, or more.</span> <span id="s2432">I v -- know we left in the afternoon at three and were there the next morning at seven.</span> <span id="s2433">So, 12 - 13 - 14 - 15 - 16.</span> <span id="s2434">And they s -- the sergeant, Atkinson was his name, Sergeant Atkinson told me that before the border dividing the Russian zone from the British zone, I should get out of the British car because the Russian soldiers would come and inspect the British car and they did not like German citizens mingling with the British, meaning a -- I would go into the -- into the car in front of us and pretend to be one of the -- well, I was one of the people.</span> <span id="s2435">And then he would give me a sign with his -- with his flashlight that I would come back.</span> <span id="s2436">And so, go there and the -- the Russian guards come in and they read the -- they -- they read the documents upside down, you know, most of them couldn’t read it, other than Cyrillic, if they could at all.</span> <span id="s2437">And everyth -- they went out and the train begins to go into motion again.</span> <span id="s2438">And I look, standing by the open door, that were not sealed, fortunately, I see a signal from the other car.</span> <span id="s2439">Aha, this is my signal and so I j -- clad with thick under, you know, pullovers, and a sheep coat, I jump down and I find no bottom and I fall and fall in spirals, and finally the water of the river closes over me, in freezing temperatures.</span> <span id="s2440">There were no -- you know, the -- the -- the -- the -- the tracks were all damaged, and what Sergeant atkin -- Atkinson had -- had tried to do was warn me of that, but I had, you know, the original message had been -- and I was the -- it was the very, very shallow river, but I came up again like a cork, and saw the -- the train was halted, it was standing, and I saw the -- all the British soldiers coming to rescue me.</span> <span id="s2441">And they -- they -- they had to wade into the water and pull me out.</span> <span id="s2442">And I had a gigantic -- it’s still to see here, the bump on my forehead.</span> <span id="s2443">I had bump --</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: Even in all your clothes you popped up?</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: Well, the -- the -- the next second I would have been pulled down again, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: I see, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">A: I -- I popped up and they d -- they -- and then something happened which -- of which I was hav -- half -- you know, I was half conscious.</span> <span id="s2448">And they pulled all the clothes from me, stark naked and -- and -- and wrapped me into army blankets and put me on a stretcher there, or a bunk bed or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s2449">And I was -- I was in a very elated mood, you know?</span> <span id="s2450">And captain -- no, it wasn’t a captain -- he sat next to me and after about four hours I went into shock.</span> <span id="s2451">And that was it, I started screaming and crying and having fits.</span> <span id="s2452">And he knew how to handle this.</span> <span id="s2453">He took my hand and kept talking to me about his family in England, northern England.</span> <span id="s2454">He was an electrician, I believe, or a plumber, and his children and everything, and by the time we reached Hannover about 10 hours later or eight hours later, I had developed an eye like this, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">Q: Huge, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">A: I looked terrible, and everything was dry except the fur coat, that took an extra two weeks.</span> <span id="s2457">And on the platform stood the man I would -- was -- who was responsible for me in my job, Captain -- Major Clark.</span> <span id="s2458">Major Clark a Scotsman from Scotland.</span> <span id="s2459">And he t-took one look at me and started laughing like hell, singing black eyed Susan.</span> <span id="s2460">I was not amused.</span> <span id="s2461">And he took me to the British army hospital in Hannover, they x-rayed me and I had a concussion, of course, and other than that, I survived it.</span> <span id="s2462">And I had very little to wear, I’ve -- I stayed in the castle with a -- with the princely family of the Schoenaich-Carolath, where my horse was, and I re -- was allow -- course I had to rest for awhile, and Sergeant Atkinson gave me the promise of what -- he went back to Berlin, he would visit my mother and tell her that I’m all right.</span> <span id="s2463">And then he took another four weeks or so, I remember it must have been May or June that he came back, carrying a big suit, I was -- I -- he came with a Jeep, carrying a big suitcase that was for me, with clothes.</span> <span id="s2464">Clothes, you know, I didn’t even know what clothes were, I only had those riding boots.</span> <span id="s2465">And he said -- I took him to the park, it was a beautiful day, and he was so in awe by all the -- the -- the royal highnesses and -- and wh-whatever.</span> <span id="s2466">We went to the park and he said, “I have very bad news for you.</span> <span id="s2467">Your father is dead.”</span> <span id="s2468">And then he spilled out the story that had just gotten to the ears of my mother, over a year after -- after my father had been taken away, what had happened to him.</span> <span id="s2469">So that’s how we found out, and later my si -- my brother would find out that this -- this famous actor, Berlin’s you know, he was the manager of the Staatstheater, Gustaf Gründgens, had been acco -- a friend of my -- had been there when my father was -- died.</span> <span id="s2470">And I’m s -- was died.</span> <span id="s2471">And I am so grateful the two had each other, because they -- they had a lot to -- to talk about.</span> <span id="s2472">And he told the story, but he -- very reluctantly because the Russians had released him under the provision that he would never talk what happened to him in the -- in the ca -- in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A: So he broke the promise.</span> <span id="s2475">He died shortly after, but a natural death, so that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">Q: So that must have been a -- that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">A: That’s how we found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: Then that must have been a really big shock for you, given how close you were to your father.</span> <span id="s2479">Or did you expect it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">A: Well we -- we gave up all, then we had to go -- gave -- give up all hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: So you gave it up before?</span> <span id="s2482">A: We had, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">A: We really had.</span> <span id="s2485">But now we had confirmation, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">Q: Sure, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">A: -- closure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">A: You know, closure.</span> <span id="s2490">And the -- this actor, Gustaf Gründgens, after my father died, saw to it personally, together with other prisoners, that my father, who was very much respected -- my father had turned politically much more to the left than anybody would have thought.</span> <span id="s2491">You know, he would have wound up a social democrat, you know, and not a rightist any more.</span> <span id="s2492">Rightist, no he was never a rightist, but the si -- the Nazis were rightists.</span> <span id="s2493">And he was highly respected and to this day I get do -- not to this day, for years I got messages from hi -- how wonderful he was, and how well he behaved, and well anyway, he saw to it that my father was not thrown into a mass grave, but has a single grave in Jamlitz, somewhere.</span> <span id="s2494">I mean if I was to inspect a thousand skulls there, I would have found my father’s because of the shrapnel wound in the first World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">A: But we never tried, we never, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">A: -- they dug up corpses there and they gave it up.</span> <span id="s2499">What’s the use?</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q: What’s the use?</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">A: Well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: So now your brother’s alive, this you found out, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A: My brother, I was at the Hasseldorf castle when one morning while I was asleep, the door opens, the princess stands there and said, “Somebody to see you.”</span> <span id="s2506">That was my little brother, you know.</span> <span id="s2507">And he worked on the farm then, you know, before he went back to Berlin, and in Berlin he eventually was one of the founders of the Frei University.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: Yes, yes, because the Humboldt University, he was not the son of a laborer, refused him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">A: And everybody else who was not a laborer’s son.</span> <span id="s2512">And then he founded the univ -- the university, became a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">Q: And how is your mother right after the war?</span> <span id="s2514">Are you -- do -- do you go back to her once you’ve -- once you’re better, do you go back to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">A: Oh yes, frequently, then I’ve -- I’ve -- I’ve moved back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s2516">I moved ba --</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">Q: But when do you marry the first time?</span> <span id="s2518">When you have [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: I -- oh, I married -- not for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">Q: Not for awhile, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A: Not for awhile.</span> <span id="s2522">I -- I was, you know, still under the illusion that after the war, things will be all different.</span> <span id="s2523">The Nazis will be dealt with and all the anti-Nazis would come up and rule the country, you know?</span> <span id="s2524">It didn’t quite happen that way, the Nazis had it good, and those de-Nazi vacation trials, I beg your pardon, you know.</span> <span id="s2525">Were nothing but a farce.</span> <span id="s2526">So I went to work in Berlin, in a famous organization, it was of course ba -- instituted by the Americans, by the CIA.</span> <span id="s2527">The Fighting League Against Inhumanity.</span> <span id="s2528">And I was one of the first people there, and then they somehow did things that the Americans di -- I didn’t like either, and then I -- but I -- I interviewed, interrogated more people than you can shake a stick at.</span> <span id="s2529">You know, refugees.</span> <span id="s2530">Clearing them -- are they political, or are they not?</span> <span id="s2531">None were sent back but the ones who could prove they were political prisoners, they left for political reasons, that their lives were endangered, they received extra help from the Americans.</span> <span id="s2532">Taken by plane from West Germany and so on.</span> <span id="s2533">That was the time when they came by the thousands before the -- the wall was built.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: Now, did most of the people you speak with, you think they were -- they were just trying to leave the east and come west?</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">A: You had to -- you had to use your judgment and I have a very good instinct.</span> <span id="s2536">I could tell by the way a man entered a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">Q: Who he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">A: But once -- I describe it in my book.</span> <span id="s2539">A man -- a gentleman, middle aged, enters the room, sits down and tells me his real name.</span> <span id="s2540">Doktor Reckzeh [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2541">Doktor Reckzeh was responsible, he was a Nazi spy, was responsible for the death of at least 30 people, a terrible death, because he had attended the famous Thadden tea party.</span> <span id="s2542">A woman by the name of Fraülein Fron Thadden, who was the headmistress of a famous girl’s school, had invited people who then was living in Berlin, had invited people for a tea party and independent of each other, al -- my mother almost went, and the Countess [indecipherable] almost went.</span> <span id="s2543">Both held back, you know, by something that could not be explained.</span> <span id="s2544">And guest of the party and the only man was a very nice young man by the name -- he was a medical doctor, and he was allowed free access to and from Switzerland and people who wanted to give him messages should do it, he would gladly take them.</span> <span id="s2545">And he wasn’t Gestapo spy and he denounced all of them.</span> <span id="s2546">And Fraülein Fron Thadden at a ripe old age, was beheaded.</span> <span id="s2547">And -- and many -- all the -- all the -- all the people were -- were hanged.</span> <span id="s2548">And I -- right away I registered, I knew who that man was, even maybe my face gave me away, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2549">And we talked, and then I -- excuse me, as I said, “I have to go the next room, just one moment.”</span> <span id="s2550">And I said to the pers -- “Call the police, call the police right away.”</span> <span id="s2551">And by the time I came back, he was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">Q: Was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">A: And he went back into the Russian zone, where he wa -- they gave him a wonderful life, anyway, I don’t know why he ever wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s2554">He was a doctor and had a beautiful home with a sky high wall around it, and I never knew what happened to him.</span> <span id="s2555">He reported his own daughter to the Russians for being anti-Communist.</span> <span id="s2556">Yeah, nice guy.</span> <span id="s2557">Yeah, I missed that boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">Q: So he could move from one group to another, it didn’t matter, as long as he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s2560">And then, you know, the leader of the place was Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt.</span> <span id="s2561">He was terribly naïve, too.</span> <span id="s2562">And of course we had all the Communist spy we could meet in our office, so we sent our spies into the cowan -- the Communist side.</span> <span id="s2563">And then I left and then I -- I decided with the Nazi time, and I say it in these words, something wonderful had broken with the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2564">The ti -- feeling of togetherness with all the people who were against the regime.</span> <span id="s2565">Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Communist, monarchy, didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s2566">They -- for the moment of the end, each went in his own separate direction again.</span> <span id="s2567">And that would never, ever be the same again.</span> <span id="s2568">That I really missed.</span> <span id="s2569">Everybody missed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: So there was a moment when it didn’t matter who you were, as long as you were against the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">A: It didn’t, no, it didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: And then -- and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A: -- as long as somebody --</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">Q: -- people split again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: They went into their old accustomed directions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">A: And that’s when I -- I -- you know, our family -- and I describe my friendship with -- I called her Aunt Edith and Uncle Otto, he -- Jewish, but Christians for centuries.</span> <span id="s2580">And they had been dragged to Theresien -- Terezín, and they had been -- had survived Terezín and went to America, then ba -- went back to Berlin, and she had her son from her first marriage, who was then chief of staff of the children’s hospital in -- in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span id="s2581">He came to visit and he said, “Why don’t you come to the United States?”</span> <span id="s2582">Ah, that was the moment when I woke up in the mor -- mor -- morning and said to myself, “I’m going to the States.”</span> <span id="s2583">And my -- my little ba -- I had already been divorced, and my little boy was not well.</span> <span id="s2584">So he had been prescribed a time in a climate where he would heal, you know, lungs and everything.</span> <span id="s2585">It did the job, but what would I do when -- you know, I gave myself those six months, that I would go to the States and establish a -- an existence somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">Q: And then bring him over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">A: And I -- I did, and my mother brought the boy, and I -- in New York they had told me newcomers need seven years to get accustomed to new y -- I needed one hour.</span> <span id="s2588">All it took.</span> <span

<span id="s2621">He said, “He knows how to put up a new file system and all that, isn’t that great?</span> <span id="s2622">Good-bye.”</span> <span id="s2623">And I was furious with him, but actually there was a reason why the Americans, together with Willy Brandt, they decided to dissolve that group, but that was long after I had gone.</span> <span id="s2624">But while I was there it was interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">Q: Were you anti-Communist most of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">A: It was no issue during the Nazi time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">Q:

of course I kept my -- my mouth shut, h-he said, “You know, I’m a -- Germany -- West Germany is only a colony of the Americans.”</span> <span id="s2637">And my husband, you know, shook his head and said, “Yeah, just like East Germany is a colony of the Soviets.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: And then he predicted the downfall of worldwide

with Jews, or not uncomfortable with Jews, but rather the notion that you should be part of this tradition, as opposed to part of the Christian tradition --</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">Q: -- comes later to you.</span> <span id="s2723">This is not something you think about in the 40’s, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">A: No, we had other

much.</span> <span id="s2861">And they were beastly to me, but I -- I won them over, I won them all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">Q: And was part of the problem that you were closer in age to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">A: Of c --</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">Q: It was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">A: I was twice divorced, I was an American.</span> <span id="s2866">I used lipstick and other horrible means of beautifying myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2868">And you were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">A: And they alway -- yeah, and -- and I was asked the question, are you still an American?</span> <span id="s2870">And I said, “Yes, and I’m going to be one for the rest of my life.”</span> <span id="s2871">Because that is something that is not for sale, for anything.</span> <span id="s2872">And Martin, of course he -- he -- he loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">A: And -- yes, and be -- being seated in a restaurant, when the waiter asked what his daughter wanted, was me, you know, he would kick me under the table.</span> <span id="s2875">Was very wise of him to marry a woman that much younger.</span> <span id="s2876">He would have died.</span> <span id="s2877">During our marriage he would have died many times for neglecting himself and his -- his -- his health, you know?</span> <span id="s2878">He would not go to bed when he should --</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">Q: I’m sure he didn’t marry you because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2880">A: No, no, no, I was very stri -- I was called the dragon, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">Q: By whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">A: By all the people that I tried to get off his back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">A: He couldn’t say no.</span> <span id="s2885">And -- when he had the flu he was in bed, and I did the right things for him, making him get up, for instance, and walk around.</span> <span id="s2886">Medicine in Germany was, and still is 30 years behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">Q: Was it difficult for you to move back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">A: I never moved back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">Q: No, well, physically you moved back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">A: Physically no, because I knew I was coming to a very Americanized town, Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s2891">The Air Force headquarters was still there, the hospital was there.</span> <span id="s2892">And all through my years in Wiesbaden, I have not made one German friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">A: No, because as Martin’s wife, that was -- he didn’t have friends either.</span> <span id="s2895">He had people who either loved him or despised him.</span> <span id="s2896">And on his own level there was nobody, so he took all my friends in.</span> <span id="s2897">The entire staff of the hospital came Sunday after church for instance, for a drink and a cigar.</span> <span id="s2898">And he -- Martin’s -- Martin’s English was flawless.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">A: He spoke with a German accent, stronger than mine, but his -- it was -- when he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">Q: And -- me -- go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">A: -- when he composed a -- a sermon, there was nothing I had to change.</span> <span id="s2903">Not even a comma.</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">Q: And what did you speak with each other?</span> <span id="s2905">German, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">A: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">Q: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">A: Both, yeah, both.</span> <span id="s2909">And we had our political -- our political views that was very di -- were -- were very different.</span> <span id="s2910">He was naïve in many ways.</span> <span id="s2911">And one of these days, you know, it was -- started off as nothing, and all of a sudden my husband has a -- has a tantrum.</span> <span id="s2912">He’s still seated at the desk, and he begins to trample with his feet, scream.</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">A: And I went to the door, and I sh -- screamed up, “Marc, come down, come down, you have to see that.”</span> <span id="s2915">And he was not even -- his father was not even aware of it.</span> <span id="s2916">So Marc came down and we start laughing in the back you -- the tears were coming from our eyes.</span> <span id="s2917">We were going down to the -- on the floor, and all of a sudden there was complete quiet and after he stopped howling, he turned around and saw us --</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">Q: Laughing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">A: -- dissolved in laughter and tears.</span> <span id="s2920">And what does the man do?</span> <span id="s2921">He starts laughing with us.</span> <span id="s2922">He -- that was typical, typical.</span> <span id="s2923">Once his sister was there when I had allegedly insulted him.</span> <span id="s2924">When she descended on me like an eagle, you know?</span> <span id="s2925">“You cannot speak like that to my brother.”</span> <span id="s2926">And he turns on her and says, “I love that about her, you know.”</span> <span id="s2927">His wife Elsa would never have dared that, it wasn’t done.</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">Q: So -- so was -- was -- was he able to stop the tantrum sooner because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: It stopped itself, he was spent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">Q: Because you were not responding, and -- and stimulating it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">A: No, because -- of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">A: There was nothing i -- he was -- he heard funny noised in the background, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">Q: Did you write to each other between ’68 and when you went over there, when --</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">A: I have collected about 70 love letters from him.</span> <span id="s2936">Nobody is getting them, no.</span> <span id="s2937">My son has -- will have them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">A: Handwritten.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">Q: This is before you’re married?</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">A: We wrote to each other every day practically.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">A: Every other day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">Q: And do you have your letters to him, or only his letters to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">A: I have his letters -- my letters to him, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">Q: Too, you have both.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2948">Under lock and key.</span> <span id="s2949">He wrote beautiful letters.</span> <span id="s2950">But yes, he was shy.</span> <span id="s2951">There was only one woman in his life and that was Elsa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2953">And then there was a second one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">A: And he knew very little about women.</span> <span id="s2955">Amazingly little.</span> <span id="s2956">Didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">Q: This was your best marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">A: The only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">Q: Or the only one, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">A: The only real marriage yes.</span> <span id="s2961">And God gave us so many years together, you know, thinking -- the man was 79 when I married him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">Q: And you were f --</span></p> <p><span id="s2963">A: I was then 46.</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">A: And the church -- his successor’s successor, I cou -- I -- before we were married, I -- I wanted to find out about my status, you know?</span> <span id="s2966">I had married him after he was retired, so there would be little money.</span> <span id="s2967">There is not much money now, but th-they did the best they could with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">A: They really -- the church of Hessen and Nassau carried me on angel’s wings, I can’t say it any other way.</span> <span id="s2970">And after my conversion, ah, was marvelous the way they behaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">A: And also most -- th-the children.</span> <span id="s2973">The children were pretty good except for maybe one of -- but they wouldn’t say anything to me, but I know they disapproved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">Q: They disapproved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">A: Which is their right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">Q: And they didn’t adjust during all those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2980">They’ve all been very composed about it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2982">A: -- and very -- my, of course my -- my favorite child, Niemoeller child is Hammon, after Joachim, who fell in the war.</span> <span id="s2983">The oldest one, he is six years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s2984">And he is my -- he is my buddy, and he is the most talented -- also medical doctor, of all his children.</span> <span id="s2985">He plays the piano -- I mean, concert, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">A: And he --</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: Besides Joachim, there was another child who died of diphtheria, isn’t there, early on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: Yeah, that was Utë.</span> <span id="s2990">She was the most gorgeous of them all.</span> <span id="s2991">But Utë’s death he heard in the conce -- in Dachau.</span> <span id="s2992">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2994">And he could not go to the funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">A: No, not only that, but the g -- the SS guard stopped him in, you know, a hall going from one cell to the other, they were allowed to visit later --</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">A: -- oh by the way your daughter died.</span> <span id="s2998">Which one?</span> <span id="s2999">I don’t know [indecipherable] don’t care, either.</span> <span id="s3000">And then after a few days that must have been hell, he always hoped, he says, that it would be Utë because he had a guilty conscience towards the other children because he showed his preference to Utë all the time.</span> <span id="s3001">She was an angel, she really was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">Q: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">A: Gorgeous looking, wise beyond her years.</span> <span id="s3004">And it was Utë.</span> <span id="s3005">And then his -- his favorite son Joachim, the only one who wanted to go into the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">A: -- into -- into the -- theology, he fell -- and he knew it before he went out.</span> <span id="s3008">He was only 19.</span> <span id="s3009">And I knew them all, I knew the entire family --</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">Q: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">A: -- of course.</span> <span id="s3012">But they are dying out now, you know?</span> <span id="s3013">This -- well, the oldest daughter, who was my grimmest fiend, she lives in Connecticut.</span> <span id="s3014">But she is so far gone mind-wise, that I hesitate to call her.</span> <span id="s3015">We are friends, I mean, she --</span></p> <p><span id="s3016">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">A: And all the children who are fair, they realized that without me he would have died.</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">Q: Much earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s3019">A: They would have lost their father many times, cause he didn’t take care of himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s3020">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3021">And he was 92 or 93 when he passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">A: 92.</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">Q: Two -- 92.</span> <span id="s3024">Let me ask you something, did -- did -- did you two talk about his years in concentration camp, and what he --</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">A: Never once, but not because he blocked it out like you know, so many survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">A: And I count myself among those survivors, having not been able to talk for 40 years.</span> <span id="s3028">Four zero years.</span> <span id="s3029">If Elie hadn’t kvetched that out of me, you know, I would be quiet to this day.</span> <span id="s3030">He had worked it through over the years.</span> <span id="s3031">He was at peace with himself about it.</span> <span id="s3032">He only -- people, some people would ask him, was it really so bad?</span> <span id="s3033">And he would have one stereotype answer, he would say, “No, it was a thousand times worse.”</span> <span id="s3034">And that’s all he -- all he said, he would never -- he’d cut you off very briefly.</span> <span id="s3035">And so I wouldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">Q: So did he -- okay, so that -- there’s something about him not talking about his own private pain or his experience.</span> <span id="s3037">But what about the war and the Holocaust and what the Nazis did?</span> <span id="s3038">Did he talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3039">A: Of course, I mean he -- he opened his mouth after -- and I quote him I think in my book, in my -- both my books, I quote him as saying in -- in -- as declaring that he -- he thinks the church is -- of all the institutions and the people to blame, the church holds the biggest responsibility for not having done anything.</span> <span id="s3040">And he never excluded himself, never.</span> <span id="s3041">Oh, he was very, very aware of it.</span> <span id="s3042">You must remember, there is a man, who unlike me, had been brought up in the anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">A: -- attitude of the Protestant clergy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3046">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s3047">A: He was -- he was the Christ killer The Jew, that Jew was the cri --</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">Q: To him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s3050">My Anna, my old nanny, she went through all the anti-Nazi things we did, but in her heart she remain an anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s3051">So often I said, “Anna, think about it, why?”</span> <span id="s3052">“They killed Jesus.”</span> <span id="s3053">Would not fo -- close her ears, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">Q: So it’s a very interesting combination that you can both be anti-Nazi --</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">Q: -- but anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">A: Oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">Q: And not care that this part --</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">A: -- and that was done by many.</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">Q: -- that this --</span></p> <p><span id="s3061">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">A: But then he -- he realized the full impact of his own anti-Semitism only after the war, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">Q: And did it take him a long time, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">A: No, he had a -- something happened to him when he, for the first time as a free man, with Elsa, visited Dachau concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3067">A: Wanted to show her, you know, and the American officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">A: Because they kept the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s3070">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">A: And the only block that was standing, as a prison for their own G.I.’s, you know, for all sorts of things, from murder to black market.</span> <span id="s3072">And he finds himself standing in front of the crematoria, and so the crude sign, you know, board of s-something, on which it said, here so and so many inmates were killed between 1933 and 1945.</span> <span id="s3073">And there, he says -- and he -- I -- I can quote him, I don’t know if I can do it now by heart, verbatim, he said, “It wa -- like a cold chill came da -- went up my spine.</span> <span id="s3074">I heard God’s voice saying to me,” -- wa -- well, you know, he said, “I knew I had an alibi between 1933 -- between 1937 and 1945.</span> <span id="s3075">But here God was asking me, where were you between 1933 and 1937, and I had no answer.</span> <span id="s3076">Cain, where is your brother Abel?”</span> <span id="s3077">And that’s when he fully realized that he bore the same amount of responsibility, eight years of concentration camp or not.</span> <span id="s3078">He was -- and when people accuse him now of anti-Semitism, you know, they’re running into open doors.</span> <span id="s3079">He admitted it publicly again and again.</span></p> <p><span id="s3080">Q: Yes, there is this -- there are people who will say --</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">A: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">Q: -- at a certain point he was anti-Semitic, but then they don’t speak about ho -- ho --</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">A: Right, it’s easy to say, yeah.</span> <span id="s3084">And never stopped asking God’s forgiveness.</span></p> <p><span id="s3085">Q: Did -- did it cause a conflict in him about his religious beliefs because anti-Semitism was so strong within --</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">A: No, it could --</span></p> <p><span id="s3087">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3088">A: -- the ji -- the Christian church he felt could do very well without --</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">Q: Without it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">A: -- anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s3091">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3092">A: Anti-Semitism of the church is a contradiction in itself, he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s3094">In spite of itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3096">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3097">How did he feel about the state of Israel, do you remember?</span> <span id="s3098">Early, when --</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">A: I really don’t know, he went to Israel only once when I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3100">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">A: -- when I was there.</span> <span id="s3102">He was what -- I heard from conversations with the ambassadors, and so I know that he was very pleased.</span></p> <p><span id="s3103">Q: But I would imagine that the politics also was conflicting in some ways.</span> <span id="s3104">Or not?</span> <span id="s3105">You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3106">A: Really, quite frankly, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3107">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3108">A: I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3109">Q: What other theologians, when you were married to him, were quo --</span></p> <p><span id="s3110">A: Well, he never considered himself a theologian.</span></p> <p><span id="s3111">Q: -- logian, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3112">A: You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3113">Q: Other people of the religious --</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3115">I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3116">Q: You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s3117">Abraham Heschel, or Tillich, or Niebohr.</span> <span id="s3118">Were there people that he associated with or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s3119">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">A: But it’s not bec -- I came too late into his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A: You know, Paul Tillich, of course, he knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3124">Q: Heschel may not have been alive when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3125">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s3126">Q: I -- H-Heschel, I can’t remember now when Heschel --</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s3128">And I really don’t know, but considering him, he would always raise his voice when people called him a theologian.</span> <span id="s3129">He had, you know, walls of books, theology books that he never read, didn’t interest him.</span> <span id="s3130">He was a pastor in this world to spread the message of Jesus.</span> <span id="s3131">And that’s what he would not ever understand about me turning to Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">Q: Yes, I would -- I would like to ask you, you would not --</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">A: He would -- but I could not -- I -- I -- I wouldn’t have done a -- I couldn’t have done otherwise, you know?</span> <span id="s3134">Tr -- my -- my connection with Jesus is still the same, only he was a Jew, he was a pious Jew.</span> <span id="s3135">And -- but the -- our faith, we are divided by Christians faith in him, and the Jews, the faith of him.</span> <span id="s3136">His faith, you know?</span> <span id="s3137">So he was not, you know wh-when -- when Christians nowadays, so -- so-called Christians say, still talking about the Holocaust, isn’t it time that we moved on, you know?</span> <span id="s3138">And they have all sorts of marvelous [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3139">First of all, who would put closure?</span> <span id="s3140">Who is there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3141">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">A: And then I always say, what would a pious Christian say that if the Jews answer -- if the Jews accuse them of, my God, the death of Jesus is 2,000 years ago, isn’t it time to put -- that was different because Jesus was the Messiah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">A: Jesus was the son of God.</span> <span id="s3145">Son of God?</span> <span id="s3146">No Jews contradicts, because we are all the children of God, created by Him in His image.</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">Q: But let me ask you something, when you marry -- I can’t call him Martin, actually, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3148">A: Of course you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">Q: -- okay, all right, Pastor Martin Nie -- Niemoeller.</span> <span id="s3150">Martin Niemoeller, you’re going to church every Sunday?</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3152">Q: Yes?</span> <span id="s3153">So what does this do t -- I mean, do you talk about faith?</span> <span id="s3154">When he speaks of -- is he giving sermons at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s3155">A: He was giving a sermon almost every Sunday.</span> <span id="s3156">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">Q: Okay, and you’re listening?</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">A: I listen to his sermons while they’re being made, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3162">A: He calls me up every half hour to change a word or so.</span> <span id="s3163">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">Q: So, are you looking at this as an esthetic experience as opposed to a religious experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s3165">A: As a humanistic experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s3166">Q: And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s3167">A: Not as a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3168">Q: Not as a religious one.</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">A: No.</span> <span id="s3170">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">Q: And does he understand this, or is he not sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">A: He is not sure and he -- I had a feeling he didn’t really want to know.</span> <span id="s3173">Might not have liked the answers.</span> <span id="s3174">But I could not, being married to him could not -- of course, I could never -- I mean, the Halacha forbids it, I could never -- not the Halacha in this case, the -- the -- the German law for -- forbids -- the theologian law, that a priest is married to a Jewish spouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s3175">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3176">A: Only after ist -- rightfully so, rightfully so.</span> <span id="s3177">They should be not a Catholic either, they should be of the same faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">Q: Of the same faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s3179">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3180">But he was already retired, but I wouldn’t have done it to him because it would have hurt him.</span> <span id="s3181">But after he was gone, I didn’t think twice.</span> <span id="s3182">I went -- the next week I went to the f -- to the place where I could lean -- learn j -- learn Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s3183">Q: So this was brewing in you for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3184">A: It was brewing in me for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3185">Q: So ex -- you do explain it in your book in some way --</span></p> <p><span id="s3186">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3187">Q: That th-the -- it’s as if -- I don’t know, it’s -- it’s as if --</span></p> <p><span id="s3188">A: The Christian view of God di -- didn’t go well with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3189">Q: It just didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">A: No, it just didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">Q: Which means --</span></p> <p><span id="s3192">A: -- and you cou --</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">Q: -- the crucified Christ, is that the image that you -- is -- that you throw out, or is it some other [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">A: No, not that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3195">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3196">A: -- necessarily.</span> <span id="s3197">It was either God is almighty.</span></p> <p><span id="s3198">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3199">A: And then He would have spared His son the death of the -- on the cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s3200">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3201">A: Or the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3202">Or He is not.</span> <span id="s3203">What am I doing with a God who’s not almighty?</span> <span id="s3204">And then the Christian way of life is geared to the hereafter.</span> <span id="s3205">That’s how the Catholic church especially, gets their people.</span> <span id="s3206">If you suffer here, it means that you’ll have a glorious whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">Q: But that’s not the Protestant view?</span></p> <p><span id="s3208">A: That is -- oh well, more or less, yes.</span> <span id="s3209">The hereafter is very, very important.</span> <span id="s3210">While we Jews, we live for this life.</span> <span id="s3211">And what -- not what we think, but what we do is important.</span> <span id="s3212">And that went very well with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s3214">How do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3215">A: The Mitzvot, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3217">But how do you deal with the notion of an all powerful God as -- if you’re a Jewish person who believes in God --</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s3219">At this point I’m not really sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">Q: Aha.</span> <span id="s3221">That’s not the issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s3222">A: No, it’s -- it’s no issue for me.</span> <span id="s3223">But I know there is -- they -- as far as I’m concerned --</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3225">A: -- as I said, I’m being led by a higher power all the way, so He must have something in mind.</span> <span id="s3226">Not she, but He.</span></p> <p><span id="s3227">Q: And not a she-he.</span> <span id="s3228">Only a he.</span></p> <p><span id="s3229">A: That’s -- that’s not -- it doesn’t really matter.</span> <span id="s3230">I belong to a conservative --</span></p> <p><span id="s3231">Q: Well then it must be a he, I guess, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3232">A: No, we pray for -- for Rivka and for Leah and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3233">Q: Really.</span> <span id="s3234">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3236">They are quite -- quite Reform, many ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s3237">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3238">A: I was converted in a Ref-form movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s3239">Q: In Reform?</span></p> <p><span id="s3240">A: Oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3242">A: -- at the progressive, as they call it.</span> <span id="s3243">Liberal, as they call it in England.</span> <span id="s3244">But I had to, in -- in order to be converted in England as a liberal, I had to go to the Mikvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3245">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">A: Which I did in New York.</span> <span id="s3247">Which I loved by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">Q: It was nice?</span> <span id="s3249">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3251">A: It is, you know, sa -- it’s so meaningful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">A: We have to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3255">End of Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s3256">Beginning Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3257">Q: What was your mother’s response to your getting married to Martin?</span></p> <p><span id="s3258">A: She did not take it very well.</span> <span id="s3259">First of all she said, “He’s much too old for you.”</span> <span id="s3260">And then she said, “He’s much too old for you.”</span> <span id="s3261">And then she came out with the truth, that years before -- and I even knew that, she had mentioned it at the time, when Elsa was forlorn and -- and -- and -- and always when she was very depressed about her husband’s absence when he was in the camp, Dorha, the housekeeper, the one who was called -- was killed with her in that car crash; Elsa and Dorha were killed together.</span> <span id="s3262">Dorha would call my mother and said, “Would you please come over?</span> <span id="s3263">Frau Niemoeller is so depressed, she wants to see you.”</span> <span id="s3264">So my mother raced over there, sitting at her bedside, or whatever it was, and then, you know, after she complained, she did her bit of complaining, she said, “You know, if your husband,” my father, “somehow gets killed during the you know, one way or the other, and I die, and my husband is still alive and you are still alive, you’ve got to marry him.</span> <span id="s3265">I am not strong enough to be married to him.”</span> <span id="s3266">And my mother to -- obviously took that very seriously.</span> <span id="s3267">But then we were being as graceful, as gracious as she was, she arranged herself with the given situation, and they became very close and dear friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s3268">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s3269">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3270">It was almost touching to see those two, so close in age, together.</span></p> <p><span id="s3271">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3272">A: She was born in August, and they were separated by -- by four months, Martin was like Albert Schweitzer, born on the 14th of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s3273">Q: And were you living close by, sh -- was she -- she was living in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s3274">A: She was living in Berlin.</span> <span id="s3275">And h-had a massive stroke at age -- well, she was 80, she was about my age, and -- which robbed her of her speech and use of her right arm and right leg, and I was called to Berlin, somebody else took care of -- of my husband in Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s3276">I drove to Berlin, and the doctor took me aside and said, “Frau Niemoeller, have no illusions, this clock has run out.”</span> <span id="s3277">And I said, “Doktor, you don’t know my mother,” you know?</span> <span id="s3278">And my mother lived for more than 12 years, regained her speech, use of her right arm, she could walk with a little limp.</span></p> <p><span id="s3279">Q: You’re kidding.</span></p> <p><span id="s3280">A: But she was there and all with it.</span> <span id="s3281">So you se -- it’s very dangerous for a medical man to make prognosis of a person --</span></p> <p><span id="s3282">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3283">A: -- he doesn’t know, and my mother was a bundle of energy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3284">Q: Did you become closer to your mother as -- as you got older?</span></p> <p><span id="s3285">A: Yes, for the reason that she got older and more helpless, of course.</span> <span id="s3286">But there is not a day that goes by that I don’t -- the I re -- really regret for not having had a relationship with my -- with my mother.</span> <span id="s3287">But my brother didn’t have one either, in the end, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3288">Q: Neither one of you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3289">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s3290">She just -- but I realized it long before my -- my brother did, I think, that she was not to blame, that was the way she was made, that she had been educated.</span> <span id="s3291">She lived in fear of men, and to -- she was not allowed, and she couldn’t partake in discussions.</span></p> <p><span id="s3292">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3293">A: She hadn’t been brought up in -- you know, and Elsa was -- no, she -- Elsa was a -- a teacher of English, so she knew more.</span> <span id="s3294">But in our circles a woman was raised as a girl to be married off.</span> <span id="s3295">Married off.</span></p> <p><span id="s3296">Q: [indecipherable] off.</span></p> <p><span id="s3297">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3298">Q: And be -- and be off.</span></p> <p><span id="s3299">A: And become --</span></p> <p><span id="s3300">Q: So how did Martin and your mother have a friendship if she was so -- I mean, what -- what -- what did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s3301">A: On -- oh, she was much ten -- more tender to him than she ever was with us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3302">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3303">A: Her son-in-law, and she t-talks of very amusing stories, like visiting the cemetery of Saint Anne’s, where she was buried by the way, and s -- seated, resting on a bench, she was approached by two ladies, and the ladies say I wonder -- to my mother, “I wonder if you can t-tell me, we’re here as visitors and we are looking for Martin Niemoeller’s grave.”</span> <span id="s3304">And my mother rose to her full height of -- she was much taller than I, and said, “He is not dead.</span> <span id="s3305">I talked to him 15 minutes ago, he’s my son-in-law.”</span> <span id="s3306">They left in a panic, I think they must have thought she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3307">Q: Crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">A: -- bananas, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s3309">No, she was very proud of being his mother-in-law, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3310">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3311">How would you explain to him your becoming Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3312">A: I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3313">Q: You couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3314">A: And I never even imagined it.</span> <span id="s3315">I only know he would have been hurt that I left the Messiah.</span> <span id="s3316">Jesus was his reason for surviving, you know?</span> <span id="s3317">And it started early, when he was 14, he had a -- a happening that when his father, who was a -- I remember my own -- my own father-in-law and my mother-in-law, I met them when I was very little.</span> <span id="s3318">And his father very much believed in something that pastors, or sometimes even rabbis don’t do any more, visiting members of the congregation and getting to know them.</span> <span id="s3319">And his fa -- and whi -- pastor -- old Pastor Heinrich Niemoeller was exemplary.</span> <span id="s3320">Every afternoon he’d go and see somebody.</span> <span id="s3321">And he visited th -- the home of a miner.</span> <span id="s3322">This was where he -- this was a mining district where they lived.</span> <span id="s3323">And on the wall -- and the miner is -- is eaten up by some dreadful lung disease and on the wall Martin sees some words under glass in German, “Waswürde Jesus sagen?”</span> <span id="s3324">What would Jesus say?</span> <span id="s3325">So this word guided him through all his life.</span> <span id="s3326">Whatever he did, he would ask first, what would Jesus say to that?</span> <span id="s3327">And how I could miss out on it because he would -- he would suspect a terrible void in me, what wasn’t there, you know?</span> <span id="s3328">I don’t know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s3329">Q: So you don’t think he would even understand it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3330">A: No.</span> <span id="s3331">It was -- would have been beyond him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3332">Q: But I just couldn’t have done otherwise.</span> <span id="s3333">When people ask me, and I’m often asked, now tell us the motivation why you became Jewish.</span> <span id="s3334">I said, “Very easy, I had to.”</span> <span id="s3335">I had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s3336">Q: But then people say, so what’s behind the having to?</span></p> <p><span id="s3337">A: There is no [indecipherable] first of all, I do not -- I follow my mentors, Albert Friedlander’s, and London’s advice not to ever get in argument with Christians about it because I would soon notice that I was being maneuvered into a corner where I have to defend myself.</span> <span id="s3338">So when I’m asked in a -- in a -- by the -- a member of the audie -- now tell us about the -- I said, “I don’t discuss that in public.”</span> <span id="s3339">But I will in a s-smaller and preferably Jewish circle.</span> <span id="s3340">But the funny thing is that Martin’s successor in office, Doktor Spengler, Jewish president of the Church of Hessen and Nassau, I didn’t have to explain anything to him about the co-conversion.</span> <span id="s3341">He called me one day, and he said, “I’ve heard you converted to Judaism.”</span> <span id="s3342">He said, “I think it’s marvelous.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3343">Q: Is there -- I don’t -- I don’t even know if you can answer this question, but is there some way in which you’ve come -- I -- I don’t want to say back to your roots, cause I’m not sure what that means.</span> <span id="s3344">You -- one’s roots are many different things, and you weren’t particularly religious as a child, in spite of th --</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">A: I was god-fearing.</span> <span id="s3346">The fear of God was God sees everything, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3347">Q: God -- everything.</span> <span id="s3348">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3349">A: But otherwise --</span></p> <p><span id="s3350">Q: A-Assuming that you lost that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3351">A: -- not with a great love for God, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">Q: Otherwise, you had no great love for God.</span> <span id="s3353">But there is, in some way you grew up under the clouds of National Socialism all your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3354">A: Heavy clouds.</span></p> <p><span id="s3355">Q: From the ni -- from the day that you’re born --</span></p> <p><span id="s3356">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3357">Q: -- they’re not in power, but they’re there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3358">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3359">Q: So there’s -- and a central feature of the -- who they are, is ridding the world of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3361">Q: And that is in some sense very important within the context of your family of trying to negotiate and help and to figure this -- it’s not unimportant in your family.</span> <span id="s3362">So there -- I -- it’s not payba -- I don’t -- I don’t exactly know what the words are, but it’s almost as if you’re trying to reverse part of that history --</span></p> <p><span id="s3363">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3364">Q: -- and make yourself whole by being part of what was being destr -- destroyed.</span> <span id="s3365">I don’t know if that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3366">A: Yes, that is part of it, I am sure, I am sure.</span> <span id="s3367">Because what was destroyed by Hitler, who was almost -- I mean he -- he almost managed to -- to get rid of all the Jews in Europe, must have been so powerful that he felt it and he feared it.</span> <span id="s3368">And that’s why I had to find out what that is, you know?</span> <span id="s3369">Power has always attracted me, and Judaism is a very powerful religion.</span> <span id="s3370">But not alien to me, but it’s now part of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3371">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3372">And do you consider yourself religious now?</span></p> <p><span id="s3373">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3374">Always -- ever since I became Jewish, I consider myself religious.</span> <span id="s3375">I go not only because I -- I read the -- the Torah regularly and -- and the prayer book.</span> <span id="s3376">I pray the Sh’ema three times a day, and I don’t keep kosher, but I believe God is mo -- has become more -- what is the -- now I can’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s3377">Q: Tangible?</span> <span id="s3378">A: Tangible for me.</span> <span id="s3379">More real for me.</span> <span id="s3380">He is not the old man with a white beard any more, but something I truly cannot define.</span></p> <p><span id="s3381">Q: Well, I have to thank you so very much --</span></p> <p><span id="s3382">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s3383">Q: -- for spending the day with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s3384">A: Well, it was my pleasure.</span> <span id="s3385">I’m so proud and so happy to be Jewish, you know, that is my favorite subject anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s3386">Q: It is, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3387">A: Oh yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3388">Q: Well, thank you again for coming [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3389">A: Thank you for listening to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3390">Q: It’s been a pleasure, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3391">Q: And tell us what this picture is here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3392">A: That is my mother’s mother, Helena von Brauchitsch, née von Korn, who died at age 49 after giving birth to seven children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3393">Q: And this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s3394">A: That is my mother’s family, the -- the parents with the five one -- five or six children?</span></p> <p><span id="s3395">Q: One, two --</span></p> <p><span id="s3396">A: Five children.</span> <span id="s3397">And on the left is uncle [indecipherable] he was call -- called Kunz, he was Conrad.</span> <span id="s3398">He was the one who became an S.A. man.</span> <span id="s3399">And that’s my grandfather, and that is little Eberhard, the youngest.</span> <span id="s3400">And that is Herta, the oldest girl, and that is Siegfried, that’s the oldest boy.</span> <span id="s3401">And that is Hildegard, who died shortly after that.</span> <span id="s3402">And that is my mother, and that’s my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3403">Q: Do you know how -- when this photo was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s3404">A: I can guess, of course.</span> <span id="s3405">How old does my mother look?</span> <span id="s3406">14?</span></p> <p><span id="s3407">Q: Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3408">A: Yeah, then it was taken in 1900 and I would say -- does it say anything on the back, or
