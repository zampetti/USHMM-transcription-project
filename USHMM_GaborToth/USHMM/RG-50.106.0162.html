Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann, conducted by Gail Schwartz, on September 24th, 2003 in Bethesda, Maryland.</span> <span id="s4">This interview is part of the museum’s project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum.</span> <span id="s5">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s6">What is your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Answer: Frank Nathan Liebermann.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: And what was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Franz Natan Liebermann.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: January 19th, 1929, in Gleiwitz, on the main street, Wilhelmstrasse Funf.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Let’s first talk a little bit about your family, about your parents.</span> <span id="s13">L -- can you tell me their names first?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My father was Dr. Hans Liebermann, an ear, nose, throat specialist who practiced medicine in Gleiwitz, and we had an office attached to our apartment on the main street.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And -- and your mother’s name?</span> <span id="s16">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s17">My mother was born Lotta Flora Olgala in Opin and married my fa -- was introduced to my father at a -- a fraternity dance when she was only 16 and they were married four years later in 1928, February 28.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: How far back can you trace your family i-in that part of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Back to about 1650.</span> <span id="s20">The family Olgala and Bloch were in Lanendorf, apparently having emigrated from Alsace-Lorraine during various pogroms there and settled in Opin.</span> <span id="s21">In fact, one of -- one of our foremothers married Michael Gratz, who eventually -- whose -- I think granddaughter became Rebecca Gratz in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s22">And my grandfather was very proud.</span> <span id="s23">He made a family tree, which we have, which showed the family and that branch.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What kind of a neighborhood did you live in, and was it a mixed neighborhood of Jews and non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Well, Gleiwitz was a town of little bit over a hundred thousand people, with probably about a thousand Jews, primarily merchants, professional, and of course also others.</span> <span id="s26">We lived, and as I said my father had his office on the main street with a connected apartment.</span> <span id="s27">I considered myself very middle class, in the respect that a -- my mother had for the time a nursemaid for me who stayed almost until we left, and was active in the community.</span> <span id="s28">They had bil -- were quite active before 1935 also, in the general community, but that changed drastically with the coming of the Nazis, to be limited really, to Jewish activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: How religious was your family?</span> <span id="s30">A: My father came from an Orthodox home, my mother came from a barely religious home.</span> <span id="s31">My grandfather was kosher, my parents did not keep a kosher home, except when my grandfather moved in after my grandmother died.</span> <span id="s32">He moved to Gleiwitz from my father’s birthplace, which was in Boyton, about 20 miles away from Gleiwitz.</span> <span id="s33">At that time we went to -- we had a kosher home and my grandfather, even though he had a separate apartment, usually came to us for meals, really until we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Did you celebrate any holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s36">I mean, we celebrated all holidays.</span> <span id="s37">I also remember -- rather my father was fairly observant in that I n -- I remember him taking me to the service for the first born, I think at six o’clock in the morning, I guess when I was about seven or eight years old.</span> <span id="s38">I only have one memory of doing it, but that stays in my memory bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Any other holidays that you can talk about, that you have memories of as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Well, we always -- oh, by the way, our -- oh, we lived about one block from the Temple -- rather, the synagogue.</span> <span id="s41">I particularly always remembered -- sh -- oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Are you thinking of a holiday, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Pa-Passover?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: In -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Rosh Hashanah?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: The [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Su --</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Where the old age home, which was right next to the Temple, always had a Sukkor and a had sweets for the kids, and that was of particular interest.</span> <span id="s50">We al-also always had, obviously Passover, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s51">I remember the Temple.</span> <span id="s52">The women sat in a balcony, but it wasn’t closed.</span> <span id="s53">There was no curtain.</span> <span id="s54">It also had music in terms of the boy’s choir, conducted -- and I still remember him, by Lira Fleischer, who is also the head of the Jewish school, because the public school became closed in 1933, before I started, and the Jewish community had four classrooms within the school, where the instruction took place.</span> <span id="s55">The main negative I remember, and this was after 1936, was we had to leave the school grounds -- or not the school grounds, but the classrooms during lunch period.</span> <span id="s56">And we more or less had to draw a fine line of being in the schoolyard, between the boys and the girls which were separated, because there were fights and so forth and it became more and more dangerous to be in the schoolyard.</span> <span id="s57">Toward 1937 - ’38, we were dismissed five minutes earlier so that we could be away from the grounds by the time school was open, so that we could get home safely.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about that.</span> <span id="s59">How did you feel about that?</span> <span id="s60">Is it something that you would confide in your parents?</span> <span id="s61">Did you have any fears about this kind of situation?</span> <span id="s62">You were very young, of course, but what can you remember about that different treatment that you as a Jewish child got?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: I just realized I had to be careful.</span> <span id="s64">I was given quite a bit of independence.</span> <span id="s65">I was able to ride my bicycle wherever it was in town.</span> <span id="s66">In fact, when the public swimming pools were closed in 1936, at that time I was seven, there was an old rock quarry which had water in it, kind of a small lake, which became the Jewish pool probably about three, four miles out of the city.</span> <span id="s67">And friends of mine and I used to regularly bicycle out there and as long as we weren’t in groups, we didn’t feel particularly vulnerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: What about the teachers in your school?</span> <span id="s69">Wa-a-a -- were any of them Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: They were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s71">In other words, we had no contact with the regular school teachers.</span> <span id="s72">I remember my first gir -- first -- I went through first, second and third grades, and it was strictly -- it was a German curriculum, but we had our own school within the school.</span> <span id="s73">Upper Silesia had been protected by a treaty covering minorities when parts of the area were given to Poland, and therefore, during the transition minorities were protected, the German minorities were protected in Poland and any other minorities were also protected in Germany.</span> <span id="s74">So that the effects of the Nazi government really started in 1936 when Der Stürmer was at every street corner.</span> <span id="s75">Der Stürmer was the anti-Semitic paper published by Goebbels and they had them behind glass for the public to read, virtually everywhere.</span> <span id="s76">I also recall that in beginning of 1936, my parents insisted that I immediately take swimming lessons and be able to pass a swimming test of 20 minutes, because it may be necessary to take an ocean voyage.</span> <span id="s77">When I was afraid of the test at the time, I remember my grandfather went with me and said, I’m not leaving until you do it, because the pool is going to be closed very soon and I want you to be a competent swimmer.</span> <span id="s78">And that was bef -- before the summer of ’36.</span> <span id="s79">During the time when the treaty was over, everybody was afraid of riots and there were some broken windows and similar things.</span> <span id="s80">My parents had the foresight to take a vacation in Bornholm, which is an island in the n -- nor -- the Baltic Sea, whi -- during these times, and when we returned the atmosphere changed pretty substantially.</span> <span id="s81">In other words, the so-called treaty expired and the community caught up with the rest of the country in a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Were you a very fearful child at this time?</span> <span id="s83">Were -- how aware were you of the growing threat?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: I was pretty aware.</span> <span id="s85">I was never particularly fearful.</span> <span id="s86">I think I have very good nerves and that goes back to those days, I just learned to kind of mind my own business and do whatever I wanted to.</span> <span id="s87">I had no real limitations except what I mentioned for school.</span> <span id="s88">In 1937, after my mother had taken a trip to Israel in -- actually, I think late ’35, and determined that a doctor had no chance of making a living in Israel, my parents decided I’d better take English lessons and I remember I had an English teacher and I did this probably about once or twice a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: This was a private English teacher that came to the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: It was not a -- it was not taught in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: German.</span> <span id="s93">Upper Silesia was strictly a German area.</span> <span id="s94">We did not -- people here were surprised that we did not speak any Yiddish, because Yiddish is really medieval German which combined with the local dialects.</span> <span id="s95">And since the language of our area was German, there was no -- it didn’t stay stagnant and didn’t get mixed with any other language, so that it wasn’t used.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Did you feel very German?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s98">In other words, the philosophy of my parents was that they were Germans, but happened to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s99">Like we’re Americans, but religiously we’re Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Did you feel very Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Not particularly.</span> <span id="s102">In other words, except that I did go to a Jewish school and after 1936, we couldn’t go to movies or other children’s activities, and it -- were restricted to certain areas.</span> <span id="s103">I remember among the safer playgrounds was an organization which was the non-zia -- the co-community was pretty much divided between Zionists and non-Zionists.</span> <span id="s104">The non-Zionits-nists being called the Schild, or Shield Organization.</span> <span id="s105">And there was an old -- there was a mansion pretty close to the middle of town, which served as our playground, and that was a nice place to meet and of course, at that point we only played with Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s106">My parents also shared what was called a Schrebergarten, which is a piece of land set aside a little bit at the ed -- kind of at the edge of town, into garden plots, where we had fruit trees and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s107">It was shared by about 10 families.</span> <span id="s108">And that was a place where we could safely congregate and that was actually a private parcel, which was our other playground in summer.</span> <span id="s109">In winter the Schild building was a place where we could go inside.</span> <span id="s110">The Temple really was just for worshipping.</span> <span id="s111">There was no Sunday school, as such.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: So did you get religious training at the school itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Wi -- a -- a little bit of Hebrew.</span> <span id="s114">Not very much because I was -- it was too early to prepare for Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s115">I was nine years old when I left, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Wh-When you played with your friends -- and I -- I realize you’re quite young at the time, did you talk about the difficult times with them, or were you just children that played regular childhood games?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: We did pretty much -- we knew what -- what our limitations were, but within that -- I don’t think I was, as I said, particularly either worried, scared in an everyday way and we just continued to do what was pretty much what we wanted.</span> <span id="s118">But there were limitations of things.</span> <span id="s119">We knew what not to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: You had mentioned that you learned how to swim.</span> <span id="s121">Were there any other sports that you got involved in as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Oh, everybody played kind of sandlot soccer.</span> <span id="s123">That was probably the main game.</span> <span id="s124">That was about the only one because anything that would be more formal was really prohibited because you couldn't go to parks, you couldn’t go to places where that existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: So you did not have any contact with non-Jewish peers?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Very, very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: What about the non-Jewish neighbors of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Just no contact.</span> <span id="s129">We minded our business and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Were any of them pleasant to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: I don’t really remember any contact with neighbors because living in an apartment building, we were in the first floor.</span> <span id="s132">Therefore -- the f -- no, wait a mo -- fir -- it was actually the second floor.</span> <span id="s133">There were stores on the bottom.</span> <span id="s134">The first floor is what the Europeans call the f -- one flight up.</span> <span id="s135">And I didn’t pass anybody except when I went out.</span> <span id="s136">So we had the whole floor.</span> <span id="s137">Our apartment had four bedrooms plus an office, so that I’d have people over, we stopped using the playground area in the apartment, because was considered a good idea.</span> <span id="s138">But there were enough things to do that I didn’t consider myself deprived.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Did you have a lot of toys and games, and did you read books?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s141">I had -- I felt I had just about everything that -- I wasn’t missing anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: What were your favorite games to play?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Probably trains.</span> <span id="s144">I had my -- I had model trains from as long as I can remember, and in fact, when we were ready to leave Germany, my grandfather gave me two presents.</span> <span id="s145">One was an HO gauge, which was new at that time.</span> <span id="s146">That was the small gauge model train, which could be set up on a table, that in case we were in a small apartment, it would fit on our dining room table.</span> <span id="s147">The other thing I got was a golden watch for my Bar Mitzvah when I would have it, wherever we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Did you have any or -- or -- brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s150">My mother had a couple of miscarriages and I was an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Le -- I -- again, I realize you were very young at the time.</span> <span id="s152">Were you -- do you have any memories, being a four year old, of the boycott, or any stories about the a -- the April 1st, 1933 boycott.</span> <span id="s153">Family stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: We were not affected by that.</span> <span id="s155">In other words, due to the treaty, what the boycott was in the rest of Germany, 1936 was in -- was when it hit Upper Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: As far as memories is concerned, the only thing I -- I do remember my father’s parents had a small hardware store, again on the main square, and I remember their house, which was above the store and I realize they did not have -- they only had one area in the kitchen with running water, and for washing they still took a basin with a jug for the hot water.</span> <span id="s158">So this must have been around 1934, because my grandmother died of a stroke in 1935, after which my grandfather closed up the store and moved to Gleiwitz to be near my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So at the time, let’s say, of the Nuremburg rally in 1935, your parents didn’t talk about this with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: It was -- it didn’t affect us, therefore a lot of -- a-also, my father didn’t lose his hospital privileges until 1936.</span> <span id="s161">Many other physicians left Berlin, for instance in 1933 and 1934, because after the boycott, they saw the handwriting on the wall.</span> <span id="s162">It didn’t show up til much later in Silesia, so that it also had the fact that fewer people really saw the urgency of leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: So when were the first restrictions, besides the school, that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Mainly that we couldn't go into certain stores and that we more or less were given maps of what we could and what we couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s165">But it didn’t stop our movement, but rather, there are just certain things which one doesn’t do.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Did --</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: And we took it in that sense, that same as parents said you don’t -- you don’t cross the main street.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Did you ever question any of this to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Just that as si -- that it wasn't safe and that there are en-enough things for me to do without it.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: When did you see your first swastika?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Probably quite early, because it was on every stamp, it was on every government -- government building, but it was taken as something that -- that existed, but didn’t have the same connotations --</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Same connotations of what?</span> <span id="s173">A: -- that we see now, of -- that it was a serious threat.</span> <span id="s174">And, in fact, most people felt it would blow over and wouldn’t last, particularly my mother’s parents, who had celebrated the hundredth anniversary of a wholesale leather business with a tannery in 1933, and survived in very good shape through the hunger of World War I, when they could always barter leather for food at the local -- from the local farmers.</span> <span id="s175">And felt they were pretty much immune from anything that would happen.</span> <span id="s176">They really didn’t appreciate what ha -- what was going on until Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann.</span> <span id="s179">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s180">When did you first hear about a man called Adolf Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Probably around 1935, because one did listen to speeches and the fact that he was able to arouse almost riotous reactions, and people started talking about what was going to happen next.</span> <span id="s182">Again, wa -- how political is a five year old, and I couldn’t really absorb what was going on in the same way as my parents, who obviously were quite concerned, as I said, whether it’s a ocean voyage, learning English and so forth.</span> <span id="s183">That became pretty clear even before the end of the treaty, and I’d say around 1935.</span> <span id="s184">By the time I started school, which was in 1935, it was already fully segregated and I just thought that’s the way it had to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Now, 1935 is when you said your mother went to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Were your parents already Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: No.</span> <span id="s189">No, it’s -- they were always su -- very supportive of Zionism, mainly as a refuge, and especially after the conclusion that a doctor couldn't make a living, they eliminated the thought of moving to Palestine as one of the possibilities, pretty early.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: As things moved on, what about food?</span> <span id="s191">Were your -- were you able to get enough food?</span> <span id="s192">No -- any problems with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: No, there were no problems with food except there were certain regulations, that on certain days -- I believe it was Friday or Thursdays, you had to do everything in one part in order to conserve fuel and I really don’t know if these were restricted -- restrictive laws for the Jewish community, or for everybody.</span> <span id="s194">Oh, one other comment, which I think it interesting.</span> <span id="s195">The synagogue covered all degrees of religious activities, from what we would say very Orthodox to quite Reform.</span> <span id="s196">And there was only one synagogue.</span> <span id="s197">However, virtually all of the families bought from the kosher butcher, because he couldn’t make a living on only the people who were kosher.</span> <span id="s198">Consequently, we ate kosher food as a mitzvah for the rest of the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Did you observe Shabbat every week?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: We drove and I had my -- I once got caught with my scooter, and -- by my Sunday school teacher, who objected, but I wasn’t punished for it.</span> <span id="s201">And it’s really a question of what is work in Biblical times, compared to what is work today, so I have no strong feelings on the subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Did you have a family Friday night dinner?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yes, in fact for many years while my grandparents were still in Boyton, we always went there for Friday night.</span> <span id="s204">My father had bought a car in 1933, which was a major luxury at that time, was a convertible.</span> <span id="s205">Something like a VW convertible, except smaller.</span> <span id="s206">And every Friday night we would go to Boyton, which is -- as I said, it’s about 20 miles away, and be at my grandmother’s for dinner.</span> <span id="s207">And one of the foods which I happened to have liked, which my kids could never understand, was a liver soup.</span> <span id="s208">But she made a very good one.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Were -- did you have any childhood songs that you remember, that -- were you musical?</span> <span id="s210">Was that something that gave you comfort?</span> <span id="s211">A: I would say most of the ones we had we learned from the maids, which were mo -- almost semi-Nazi songs.</span> <span id="s212">Bu -- rather war -- not Nazi, generally, but warlike, about a comrade and things like this and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Ca -- can you sing any?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Can you sing any of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s217">I had a comrade -- I mean, I’m translating it -- we marched together in step.</span> <span id="s218">Then a bullet came flying, I didn’t know if it -- would it be meant for me or for him?</span> <span id="s219">It was meant for him.</span> <span id="s220">He was tr -- he was shot down, he’s lying on my feet.</span> <span id="s221">I mean these ca -- and all kinds of militaristic th-things about the German forests and tha -- the songs were very nationalistic.</span> <span id="s222">Like -- almost like the army songs that we learned here from the academies.</span> <span id="s223">Over hill, over dale, at -- and etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: How did your parents feel about you learning those songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: I don’t know what they knew or did anything else, but that was -- that’s also what you heard on the radio.</span> <span id="s226">So that was almost pop culture.</span> <span id="s227">And I still remember quite a few of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Can you sing one or two lines from some of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Like over hill, over dale, what was it?</span> <span id="s230">Just a second.</span> <span id="s231">[speaks German here].</span> <span id="s232">In other words, hello, hello, what -- we’re -- we’re driving -- we’re driving into the world.</span> <span id="s233">Kind of suggesting the world is our oyster.</span> <span id="s234">And the re -- what you heard on the radio was more and more that as it progressed.</span> <span id="s235">But I di -- again, as a six year old, I didn’t understand the significance, except that I still remember some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: All right, let’s follow through now.</span> <span id="s237">When did you realize you were leaving, or what did your parents first seriously begin to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: First of all, my grandfather was a genealogist and when he -- when my father were thinking of the United States, he looked up relatives.</span> <span id="s239">There were a couple of other relatives who had left and he gave em -- as I said before, he traced the family back to pretty early times.</span> <span id="s240">During my father’s trip finally to the United States to try to find affidavits for the family and the affidavit being to guarantee that whoever comes over will not be on welfare, and would be supported for a year, he fou -- he sent my father to Philadelphia to check the grates records.</span> <span id="s241">Unfortunately --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: This was January, 1938.</span> <span id="s244">After correspondence, he took the trip an -- as a visitor and it happens that Rebecca’s brother married a non-Jewish woman and emigrated -- rather, and went west to Louisville.</span> <span id="s245">There’s some correspondence with the brother, but only for the first generation, and then the family records were lost.</span> <span id="s246">And of course Rebecca never had any children, so that the family tree kind of stopped there.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Your -- your father did not have difficulty getting passage and a -- and a visa to visit the United States in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: He could pay for it with German marks.</span> <span id="s249">The big problem was that you could only spend German money, you couldn’t take anything out.</span> <span id="s250">And visitor’s visas were granted.</span> <span id="s251">That isn’t the same -- like you can go to Switzerland, but God forbid you should live there.</span> <span id="s252">At that point there was also a brother-in-law of my grandfather’s father.</span> <span id="s253">No, wait a minute, it was a brother-in-law -- in-law of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s254">Borrowed a substantial amount of money for a week and disappeared to the United States in 1935, almost causing -- causing a major business crisis, but they averted bankruptcy.</span> <span id="s255">He found out that he was in New York and had a very good job.</span> <span id="s256">In fact, he was vice president of Bendix aviation in 1938.</span> <span id="s257">And my father got a vi -- an affidavit from him, on which we came over that July.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: What was his relative’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Charlie Marcus.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Was he willing to give your father the affidavit without any problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: He gave my -- my father got the affidavit and immediately left.</span> <span id="s262">I mean, he got the affidavit in January.</span> <span id="s263">It took awhile for it to come through.</span> <span id="s264">We got a number and in fact I don’t know if it’s in the other records.</span> <span id="s265">Nothing was happening and everybody was getting kind of anxious.</span> <span id="s266">So a friend of theirs said look, what you have to do is to get a box of candy for Fräulein Schmidt, who’s the secretary of the consul in Berlin.</span> <span id="s267">My father dutifully went to Berlin, got a box of candy and about four weeks later nothing happened.</span> <span id="s268">And he called his friend again and what can I do?</span> <span id="s269">And he said, well, what did you put into the box of candy?</span> <span id="s270">And he said nothing.</span> <span id="s271">I said, that was your first mistake.</span> <span id="s272">You have to put in a hu-hundred mark bill, and then you’ll get action.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Now, this is from the American consulate?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: American consul.</span> <span id="s275">That was minor corruption compared to some of the smaller countries, who took huge payouts and then very often issued fraudulent visas as happened with the Saint Louis in Cuba.</span> <span id="s276">Virtually all the smaller countries made major businesses of giving visas with bribes.</span> <span id="s277">Some were legitimate and some were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Now, were you aware at the time that your parents were making this effort to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s280">I was aware that when I had to learn how to swim, that we’ll probably take an ocean voyage.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: And how did you feel that -- where you said you felt German, what were your thoughts before you left, about leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: If that’s -- if that’s what we had to do, I had no -- I’m adventurous.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: But you would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: [indecipherable] the question.</span> <span id="s285">I had no, basically at that age, the roots are with the parents, not with the community.</span> <span id="s286">You’re thinking now fo -- you’re suggesting the thoughts of a teenager --</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Say you --</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: -- who doesn’t want to lose his friends.</span> <span id="s289">I had friends, but they were kind of playmates.</span> <span id="s290">I had no -- I had no hesitation.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: What did you know about America at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Just that it was a fabulous country.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: How did you know it?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: That’s what my parents told me.</span> <span id="s295">I really knew very little, but that they had friends there and they -- who’ve gone before, and that they’re sure I’d like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Did you have a large extended family in Germany and therefore you’d be leaving them?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Primarily my mother -- my father had one brother who was in Austria, who emigrated to Austria.</span> <span id="s298">My mother’s family was partly in -- was mostly in Opin, some in Breslau and some in Berlin.</span> <span id="s299">The ones in Berlin were making plans to leave and another aunt was staying, and finally got to England around 1940.</span> <span id="s300">That’s about it -- that was about it of the content.</span> <span id="s301">The ca -- those were the major contacts that we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: So your father comes back and then applies for the visa with the candy and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: -- and the money and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: It finally came through, we had to go to Berlin for a physical in June, 1938 and then we -- my father went on the next ship and left my mother to close the household, because the visa was good for 120 days, so it was good through October.</span> <span id="s306">And we therefore booked in October, in order to pack what had -- d-deci -- my mother had to decide what belongings to take along.</span> <span id="s307">At that time we could still pack what was called the lift, which is a container which, providing a tax was paid for the hundred percent value of whatever you’re taking out.</span> <span id="s308">So that we did take most of our furniture that was pack-able, most of my father’s office equipment.</span> <span id="s309">We also -- he also bought the latest equipment that -- for state of the art and I also remember my mother bought the laser -- latest Singer sewing machine, so that in case she had to sew our own clothes, and would -- she was quite good at being -- that was a way of eventually making money and surviving, because of course one couldn't take any money out, except the small amounts that they were able to smuggle out by going to Czechoslovakia regularly and sending it forward.</span> <span id="s310">But that was necessary but quite dangerous and that was for bare subsistence.</span> <span id="s311">Also, we went first class on the ship because you could pay for it in German money and first class pa -- allowed -- allowed you amount of spending money per person.</span> <span id="s312">So that spending money was our subsistence, because we used it and convert it in the -- in -- into dollars when we arrived here.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Why did your father go before you?</span> <span id="s314">Why didn’t you three go together?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Because he had to ta -- he had to study for the state boards, and he rented a room for five dollars a week and signed up for the state boards in December, so that -- and had to be a resident of Ohio in order to be eligible.</span> <span id="s316">If we w -- he would have arrived in October, he would have lost six month.</span> <span id="s317">As it was, he signed up in January on -- while a visitor and then took it in December.</span> <span id="s318">So for all appearances he was a resident for almost a year, and he passed his state board.</span> <span id="s319">Ohio passed 50 percent of those people taking it, and he passed it on the first try.</span> <span id="s320">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: I-In English?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: In English.</span> <span id="s323">He had taken French and some English in high school.</span> <span id="s324">And of course medical terminology has quite a bit of Latin roots, which made that somewhat easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: So you and your mother were left in Germany to get ready to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s327">In other words, my mother basically sold the car, sold whatever she could, had everything packed and in fact, we had an incident during that time, that on the way -- that a -- while playing at the Schild area, I -- we were playing tag and I broke my arm.</span> <span id="s328">And when my mother called the hospital, a colleague of my father, with whom they had -- not socialized, but with whom they had had dinner at various times in the early 30’s, said I’m sorry, I don’t treat Jewish children, I can’t help you.</span> <span id="s329">And she started making calls to have it set and found a doctor in my father’s hometown of Boyton, who agreed to meet us at the back door of a Catholic orphanage in Boyton.</span> <span id="s330">My mother took a taxi there, he set it and put it in a cast, and I -- this must have been in July and I -- by the time we left I was out of the cast and it had pretty well healed.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: We-Were there no Jewish doctors who would set it?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Not in gli -- in Gleiwitz there was no -- there was no orthopedist.</span> <span id="s333">Remember, it was a pretty small community.</span> <span id="s334">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: And then, o-on your way out of the country, how did you -- what was your journey from Gleiwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: From Gleiwitz, first we went to Opin to say goodbye to my grandparents, who, by the way were quite -- I won’t say angry, but were not happy with my father taking their only daughter to this strange country where we may not see them again.</span> <span id="s337">My mother’s brother -- one a -- one of the brothers, went with us.</span> <span id="s338">And I remember we had to stop in Berlin to get our passport stamped with a J. I think I gave that passport to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s339">We had to stand in line about four hours in the police station in Berlin before going on to -- to Bremerhaven from where we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Did your parents have those middle names that were assigned to Jews, Sarah and Israel on their papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: That -- no, that -- that was after -- I believe that was after Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s342">Oh, one other incident.</span> <span id="s343">During the month of September, we got cable after cable from my father to go on an earlier ship.</span> <span id="s344">We really didn’t know why, because there was almost complete censorship on what was going on at Munich, and that Hitler had called back the Europa, on which we were scheduled to sail from Cherbourg, as a wharf rat.</span> <span id="s345">And when we finally arri -- ar -- my mother couldn’t get an earlier sailing because it was -- it wa -- it was booked, and we needed to take a German ship in order to take money out and to be able to pay in German money.</span> <span id="s346">When we arrived in Bremen there was no ship.</span> <span id="s347">It was then that we found out that it was -- it lost, originally, two days, of which it had made up one, due to being called back.</span> <span id="s348">And the next day it arrived and we left one day late.</span> <span id="s349">And that was the first time I saw my uncles cry, because he took us to the ship.</span> <span id="s350">That was my mother’s brother, Walter.</span> <span id="s351">We had a pretty rough sailing, it was hurricane season and I was pretty much alone on the ship, most times, watching the bow go under the wav -- go into the waves.</span> <span id="s352">But my mother I think, had partly a breakdown from all the strain and partly was seasick.</span> <span id="s353">We had a couple of other rather scary incidents.</span> <span id="s354">In the packing -- quote unquote friends said they wanted to help by packing my bicycle in a box and preparing it to use the least possible space.</span> <span id="s355">And they delivered the bicycle to us and it was packed, and -- with all the other things.</span> <span id="s356">And they had -- when we packed our bags, they had a customs inspector check all of the luggage to see that nothing illegal went in and put a seal on it.</span> <span id="s357">When we arrived on the ship, all the seals were broken open by the Gestapo, to check on the customs officials, because the customs official said yes, I’m going out for lunch now, don’t touch anything.</span> <span id="s358">And -- but my mother didn’t take any chances and left things copacetta.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Wha-What was it like for you to see people in Gestapo uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: By that time they were pretty scary and you just kept out of their way.</span> <span id="s361">My father had quite an incident with an armed Gestapo coming into his office.</span> <span id="s362">As a result of the -- there’s a tra -- the way that you have a long term lease in -- or had a long term lease in Germany, you gave a mortgage to the landlord, so it’s basically you lent him money.</span> <span id="s363">And for that it was a long term lease.</span> <span id="s364">When we decided to leave, he -- the landlord had to pay back the mortgage.</span> <span id="s365">And that was tra -- ordered transferred to my father’s bank account from the landlord’s bank account.</span> <span id="s366">Somebody at the landlord’s bank called the Gestapo that a large sum of money is being transferred to Dr. Liebermann, and consequently the two agents came in -- into the office while somebody was there and said we’re here to arrest you.</span> <span id="s367">And he said, for what cause?</span> <span id="s368">You withdrew a large amount of money.</span> <span id="s369">I said, excuse me, this was transferred to my account at such and such bank, which is frozen.</span> <span id="s370">I suggest you call the bank.</span> <span id="s371">It’s daytime.</span> <span id="s372">And fortunately the president of the bank who knew him answered and said that they money is on deposit, and they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann.</span> <span id="s375">This is tape number two, side A, and you were telling the story of the money being deposited in the account.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: So that was shortly before he had left, but it is typical of the so-called small bureaucrats all trying to endear themselves to the party.</span> <span id="s377">And I’m just giving that as an example.</span> <span id="s378">Wher -- as I mentioned, when we got to the ship, all of the seals were opened, but fortunately nothing was found and we were met -- we arrived here on October 20th.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: What -- what day did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: On the 13th.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Were there any other people in your position on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s383">I -- at -- th-there were times when I was probably one of about half a dozen people in the dining room, mainly because I didn’t get seasick.</span> <span id="s384">So I spent most of my time just watching.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Were there other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No.</span> <span id="s387">I didn’t see anybody.</span> <span id="s388">Anyway, we stayed in New York for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Do you -- and what was it like for you to land in New York?</span> <span id="s390">You would have been told about why --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Well, the first thing -- the first thing that I was introduced to is the American drink is a Coke and I thought I was getting cocoa.</span> <span id="s392">So that was my introduction to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Did it have any meaning to you when you got off the boat and stepped on American soil?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Well, it looked gigantic.</span> <span id="s395">I had come from a small city, and New York is an overwhelming sight.</span> <span id="s396">One of the Americans on the ship showed me the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building before we landed.</span> <span id="s397">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Did you know what that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s400">I mean, he was very nice.</span> <span id="s401">He explained -- I think we left -- he told me about Columbus Day.</span> <span id="s402">I got my first history lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: This was on the boat?</span> <span id="s404">A: On the boat, from an American passenger.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: And you were speaking English to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: I have to -- I could speak a little English.</span> <span id="s407">I told you, I took English lessons.</span> <span id="s408">But of course I probably spoke it about as well as I speak German now, which is not very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Were there many Americans on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Again, I didn't see many people on the boat, because just a -- it was an extremely rough crossing, and as I say, it -- th -- most of the time there were maybe -- between 10 and 20 people in the ma -- in the dining room.</span> <span id="s411">And that’s a -- the first class section wasn’t that big, but we had a lot of room to walk around on the promenade deck.</span> <span id="s412">So I spent most of the time just being interest -- of course, I was wondering why I wasn’t invited to the Captain’s table, since everybody -- in other words, I was about the only one who wasn’t sitting on it.</span> <span id="s413">But I accepted that.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: So then you -- you come to New York and your -- was your father at the dock?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: My father was at the dock.</span> <span id="s416">He splurged -- we had a room at the Hotel Taft for three days, and then took the New York Central to Cleveland.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: What was the reunion like between your mother and your father and you?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Oh great, great.</span> <span id="s419">And in th -- Cleveland he rented one room -- one bedroom apartment near Cain Park where I slept in the Murphy bed.</span> <span id="s420">That was my introduction to the United States.</span> <span id="s421">And on the first Thursday we had a feast.</span> <span id="s422">We bought -- there was a deli downstairs and he bought a corned beef sandwich and a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s423">And that was the first notaful American meal -- th-th -- the American meal that I got.</span> <span id="s424">We had one other funny incident, we had a German super, who -- and I remember my parents commented that he spoke terrible English and terrible German, saying in other words something was wr-wrong with the faucet and th -- who answered [speaks German here].</span> <span id="s425">In other words, I’ll fix it for you, in other words sil -- and I remember my mother saying gee, I hope we’ll be able to learn at least one lang -- to speak one language well.</span> <span id="s426">They -- my parents went out the first time, I remember -- I believe it was a Saturday, they went out to a movie, and I believe it was -- it was a night of Kristallnacht, or rather the -- at three o’clock in the morning on -- and they had left somebody in the next apartment to look after -- t-to look in on me.</span> <span id="s427">And I know -- and I remember getting a call, a desperate call from my grandparents to talk to my mother, that the two brothers had been arrested and I think everything was -- and I just took messages, who the operator was, and when they came back, the world changed.</span> <span id="s428">So that was -- I said -- they got through to them and from that time on there was a -- first of a -- the primary objective was still, the state boards were in December.</span> <span id="s429">And right after the state boards, after he got notice that he passed, which was, I think the end of December, he had arranged to go to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s430">Somebody had been recommended, a professor at Hanneman.</span> <span id="s431">He wanted to learn American meth -- methods.</span> <span id="s432">That was a fraternity brother.</span> <span id="s433">He said, why don’t you go there, and he did that -- he wa -- he was at the pe -- their house, and he was particularly nice.</span> <span id="s434">And as he was leaving, he said, by the way, you mentioned that this Dr. Seiderman recommended me and I really don’t know, who is he?</span> <span id="s435">So it turned out that this colleague of his, a fraternity brother, basically wanted to get him out of Cleveland because he shared an office with an ear, nose, throat surgeon.</span> <span id="s436">So he made the suggestion that Dayton would be a good spot.</span> <span id="s437">And even though it wasn’t well meant, it turned out to be a very, very good recommendation, because it was -- there was no -- the reason he went there was that there was no Jewish ear, nose, throat doctor in Dayton, but [indecipherable] he built up a very successful practice, partly with the help of the medical society in vetoing his admission by passing an expos facto law on a Friday night, sometime i -- after he made the application requiring citizenship.</span> <span id="s438">Somebody leaked that to the newspaper and the Dayton Herald, to which he was eternally grateful, had a Sunday editorial on freedom of opportunity in the United States.</span> <span id="s439">And the following Monday he had 11 new patients.</span> <span id="s440">So that was -- what do they generally say -- so anyway, the next Monday he had 11 new patients and that really established his practice.</span> <span id="s441">And oddly enough, his main practice was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s442">In other words, he was fair -- a fairly brusque individual and -- who said what he wanted and didn’t have the be-bedside manners for Jewish pa -- that some Jewish patients preferred.</span> <span id="s443">By the way, another side.</span> <span id="s444">After the war, he was the recipient of the 75th anniversary award for international HIAS, for his resettlement efforts.</span> <span id="s445">He gave over a hundred affidavits personally, to sponsor people after World War II.</span> <span id="s446">He received that together with President Truman, and I think three others.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: This is the Hebrew immigrant aid society award.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Let -- let’s go back a little bit to when your parents heard the news about Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s450">Did they take any actions?</span> <span id="s451">After that you said they called the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Well, when he went to Philadelphia, before going to Philadelphia -- oh, first of all, they fi -- they all wanted to leave at that point.</span> <span id="s453">In other words, they realized that it was much more serious than they had believed at first.</span> <span id="s454">And he -- they made every effort to try to get help.</span> <span id="s455">On the way to Philadelphia he stopped to see Charlie Marcus.</span> <span id="s456">And by the way, we had bought him a large crystal ass -- ashtray as a matter of thanks when we arrived.</span> <span id="s457">But on his second visit he said he can’t take any more responsibility and it was my parent’s belief that this was a little bit too close.</span> <span id="s458">In other words, my father was once removed.</span> <span id="s459">My grandfather -- now it’s -- they had -- he may want repayment for the debt, and he said he can’t take any more responsibility.</span> <span id="s460">This was, by the way, a man who filed, with the affidavit, his income tax return of 1938 of 38,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s461">So I just say that for perspective.</span> <span id="s462">You know what 38,000 dollars was in 1938.</span> <span id="s463">They did --</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: How did your par -- how did your parents handle this news?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: They did manage to get som -- my father’s father, who had signed him into an old age home in -- or what would be called assisted living in Breslau, figuring that he didn't want to be a burden.</span> <span id="s466">He was able to get an exit visa for him and he got sick on the way to the ship, and was taken directly to te -- Theresienstadt and never got out.</span> <span id="s467">My mother’s brothers were finally booked in 1940 on an Italian ship to Shanghai, which left, I think on the day of the breakthrough of the Maginot Line, which caused Italy to declare war on Britain and France, and the ship had to turn back because it didn’t get through the Suez Canal.</span> <span id="s468">And that was the brother that took us to the ship and my mother’s other -- his twin, and his wife and four year old daughter.</span> <span id="s469">My mother also had a younger brother, who was 11 years younger, who was running constantly to Berlin to try to get every embassy for visas.</span> <span id="s470">And at the age of something like 19, unfortunately was not successful.</span> <span id="s471">We never knew whether it was a question of age or just that they were hitting their heads against a wall.</span> <span id="s472">But the next thing we heard that they were t-taken to Theresienstadt, I believe in 1941.</span> <span id="s473">And they had been married by Leo Baeck, who was a ra -- the rabbi in Opin before he moved to Berlin.</span> <span id="s474">After the war, my mother contacted him when he visited Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s475">And he confirmed that they had been sent to Auschwitz in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: So y --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: During this war -- during this time I got -- we got a few postcards through the Red Cross, heavily censored, only knowing that they were starving because they said, you know, they -- they gained weight and were -- and now we’re up to 130 pounds.</span> <span id="s478">And -- typical correspondence, which the Red Cross was totally ignoring, because those conditions must have been apparent and nobody did anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: So even after the anschluss in spring of ’38, your -- your extended family did not make an effort to leave, it was only after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: It was really only after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s481">In fact, my grandfather offered my father that if he moved to Breslau, there was enough of a Jewish community that he could continue to practice medicine, and if he needed any help -- he had been the family patriarch.</span> <span id="s482">If anyone in the family couldn’t make a living, he could open a leather business and get credit.</span> <span id="s483">And he just felt that he would be able to survive from his previous experience.</span> <span id="s484">Not particular -- not very atypical of a lot of other people, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s485">I do remember o -- during the war period my mother helped my father try to keep busy.</span> <span id="s486">She didn't stop wearing black until I asked her to stop in 1946, because from not knowing and basically --</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Sh-She wore black all through the war?</span> <span id="s488">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s489">That was her way of coping and that’s -- that’s how I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Did she talk about her feelings to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Look, every time we were -- every time the mailman came, you looked if there was any news.</span> <span id="s492">Because once they were in Theresienstadt, there was no free mail, it could only go through the Red Cross, and as the war progressed, it beca -- it came -- it became more and more convincing that things looked bleak.</span> <span id="s493">They were very active -- my f -- during that time and for the rest of his life he was head of the professional UJA.</span> <span id="s494">They also went to France under the -- on an inquiry, for example, when the Algeria -- during the Algerian times, when the Jewish community was in severe trouble, for the UJA, finding out that the French were of very little help, and they went -- as I say, they were very active, went to Israel regularly.</span> <span id="s495">In other words, they became strong Zionist supporters, even though they were never Zionists.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Let’s get -- go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s497">So you -- you’re in Cleveland and your furniture has arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: No, it was in storage until we w -- got to Dayton.</span> <span id="s499">In Dayton we di -- oh, my [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: How long -- how long were you in Cleveland?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Til Valentine’s Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Or til the beginning of -- actually, til the beginning of February.</span> <span id="s504">He opened his office on Valentine’s Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: This is 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: 1939.</span> <span id="s507">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: What was it like to open the box and see your bike?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: That was quite an experience, because shortly after we arrived, we got a letter from the bicycle dealer saying that they should be very careful in unpacking the bicycle and they should look inside the frame, that there are some very valuable gold pieces inside the frame and they should keep it for them.</span> <span id="s510">My father was furious, because that was a capital offense and my mother and I could have been sent to a concentration camp for it.</span> <span id="s511">And he kept those gold pieces.</span> <span id="s512">After the war they wanted a refrigerator from the United States, which he sent them pre-paid and my kids and my wife and I each have the gold pieces, which are of a Kaiser who only served 90 days, and therefore very few were minted.</span> <span id="s513">And th-that’s one of the family heirlooms.</span> <span id="s514">But it came at a very, potentially high price.</span> <span id="s515">And those are the people -- those people then escaped to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: So you’ve moved to Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: We’ve moved to Dayton.</span> <span id="s518">As I said, he st-struggled very much for the first year, and with that incident of the medical society, the next day after this came out, I think a Dr. Hallas, who is Chief of Staff of Good Samaritan Hospital came to see him and offered him privileges due to the circumstances.</span> <span id="s519">And he basically served in Dayton.</span> <span id="s520">He volunteered for the army, but was rejected at that point -- this was in 1941, because Dayton became a very critical industrial area with a shortage of doctors.</span> <span id="s521">They had a major influx of workers from Kentucky and Tennessee for various war plant -- Dayton was both a Chrysler and General Motors town.</span> <span id="s522">And we went through the war in -- in Dayton, and as I said, he became very active -- he became the conduit for all immigrants coming in, because he had his connections in the Jewish community as well as being able to relate to the immigrants.</span> <span id="s523">And he was head of the Jewish Family Service, which was a volun -- as a volunteer, and my mother’s chief endeavors were in Hadassah and child welfare.</span> <span id="s524">Pra -- I would say again, thinking -- she thought of adopting a war orphan, but then decided that she probably was not in a men -- mental condition to really do it well, and was in char -- was mainly active in Hadassah child welfare.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s526">Let’s talk a little bit about your experience.</span> <span id="s527">So you come to Dayton, did you feel -- I assume you started school right away -- did you feel different than the other young students?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: I started in Cleveland being put back to -- a year.</span> <span id="s529">I started a -- I was put back in the third grade, as when I was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s530">But as soon as we moved to Dayton, I was moved up a year and then again I skipped the fifth grade, so that I was -- got back to myse -- to my level pretty quickly.</span> <span id="s531">I didn’t have any problem with friends, both Jewish and non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s532">I had an interesting experience in our Temple, since you asked about being religious.</span> <span id="s533">In Dayton the only tem -- the only synagogue which had Sunday schools, had a Sunday school and a full time English speaking rabbi -- was a Reform Temple, which at that time was ultra-Reform.</span> <span id="s534">And I remember the first time we went -- I went to Sunday school, we had an assembly which was -- they ran out of money during the Depression so that the assembly hall was made into the Temple, a dual purpose with a -- with an everlasting light.</span> <span id="s535">And I did -- having been used to having something on my head, when I went into the Temple, I kept my baseball cap on and I remember -- I forget his first now m -- his name -- name was Shapiro and he became a rabbi, said to me, Franz, it’s impolite to wear a hat inside th -- rather, inside the Temple.</span> <span id="s536">So -- but he became very -- my father became very active in the Temple and was probably pushing toward the more traditional side, because it was pretty much realized that it had gone too far.</span> <span id="s537">I was never Bar Mitzvahed, because the Temple didn’t have Bar Mitzvahs in those days.</span> <span id="s538">Confirmation were thought to be a more appropriate age, especially since most kids stopped going to Sunday school after Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s539">And this was a way of continuing the education through at least the 11th grade, or the end of the 10th grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Did you talk about your life in Germany with your American friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: In the beginning I was asked to talk a little bit, but my parents really -- I think after one or two, tried to reduce that because item number one, they didn't want to get into any subjects which were controversial.</span> <span id="s542">Which was part of how we had been brought up.</span> <span id="s543">And any real f -- thoughts were only self-centered on what one should say and shouldn’t say.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann.</span> <span id="s546">This is tape number two, side B. And you -- I had asked you about whether you spoke about your experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Really, that some -- I would say we kind of closed that chapter.</span> <span id="s548">I would -- that’s also partly of the philosophy, whatever happened, you’ve got to look forward.</span> <span id="s549">We made very strong effort -- I feel from the minute we stepped on American soil, we considered ourselves American and kind of pushed anything that we had before out of the picture.</span> <span id="s550">I -- we -- I learned to play one o’ cat, which was the su -- the game in -- in those days of playing baseball with half a team.</span> <span id="s551">We didn’t have Little Leagues, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s552">I had to learn what football was because nobody here played soccer.</span> <span id="s553">And I became a -- an avid Cincinnati Reds fan.</span> <span id="s554">And I really didn’t -- I didn’t even know that I had an accent til I got to college, because was just ignored, this is who I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Were you still Franz at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s557">I didn’t really change my name until I got into business.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: What was December 7th, 1941 like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: We were -- we had gone out that morning and I remember after lunch, I think my parents took a nap or went in the bedroom, tur -- we turned on the radio, and all [tape break] again, we had a -- we had a radio in the bedroom, and I guess it must have been about two o’clock that we heard the announcement, it was a state of disbelief.</span> <span id="s560">And of course I still vividly remember the speech of a day that wi-will live in infamy.</span> <span id="s561">And that of course almost totally prevented any further contact with the family, because the only mail that could go out was through Spain, or th -- through Portugal, up to that tor -- while Germany was ada -- rather, before December seventh.</span> <span id="s562">After that, all communication except the Red Cross, stopped.</span> <span id="s563">So those -- that started a period of no communications that I really don’t know how my mother survived it.</span> <span id="s564">But I guess both parents were pretty strong people.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: What was her state of mind?</span> <span id="s566">You said she was wearing black at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: And she was just keeping busy.</span> <span id="s568">That’s why I say, with volunteer organizations, she decided to help in the office and it was pretty close to where we lived, so that when I came home -- she always had lunch for me and came home after school.</span> <span id="s569">And we really adapted very quickly to life in Dayton.</span> <span id="s570">In 1941 -- first of all in 1940 I felt very privileged, we got a car, which was up to that point my father could -- did -- commuted to the hospital by bus, because again, every dollar was extremely precious.</span> <span id="s571">I remember getting the car, getting the first glimpse of the country, and we took our first vacation in the Smokies that August.</span> <span id="s572">I was a boy scout and did all the basic activities that one is supposed to do and I felt very comfortable, and had no problems getting used to the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Did anybody mistake you for just being German and not being a German Jew, and did you experience any discrimination?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: The one thing which we were laughing about is that I went to camp, I developed hay fever, and when I -- I went to camp when I was 11 and I was able to take my folding camera.</span> <span id="s575">When I was 12, I became an enemy alien and we had to register as enemy aliens.</span> <span id="s576">And technically we’re not allowed to get out of the country -- get out of the -- Montgomery county, which was Dayton, Ohio’s county, without permission from the authorities.</span> <span id="s577">And basically we were laughing about it.</span> <span id="s578">In other words, I as an 11 year old was free to travel, my parents weren’t.</span> <span id="s579">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Oh see -- you were not considered an enemy alien?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Not until I turned 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Oh, oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: That was in 1940 -- 1942 [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Did that make you angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: We were laughing about it, because there was no place to go anyway.</span> <span id="s586">There were travel restrictions, gasoline rationing.</span> <span id="s587">So what’s the difference?</span> <span id="s588">But these other -- you -- you have to -- you have to laugh at anything that’s funny.</span> <span id="s589">Otherwise, of course everybody -- we went through all the things which were done during World War II.</span> <span id="s590">We were encouraged to ge -- to get jo -- when we were in high school we were encouraged to get jobs to replace people.</span> <span id="s591">I worked in a clothing store for 35 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s592">But it -- there were such shortages and they didn't -- I mean, my mother packed a lunch which was probably worth about two hours -- two or three hours work.</span> <span id="s593">But it gave everybody a sense of accomplishment, and my father regularly volunteered to give physicals, I think twice a week at the recruitment center and every -- everybody pitched in and World War II was unique that it was -- got everybody’s hundred percent -- it was a moral war that everybody supported.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Did you follow the --</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: The news?</span> <span id="s596">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: The news of the war, and how did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Radio.</span> <span id="s599">In other words, I remember Lowell Thomas, H.V. Kaltenborn, oth -- Edward R. Murrow and his reports, William Shire at first from Berlin, then elsewhere.</span> <span id="s600">I still na -- I still know all the reporters, and you basically pu -- could put everything together and it looked pretty bleak for awhile, but I think we quickly absorbed American optimism.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: What about being aware of what was happening to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: We knew it was bad, but there was a sense of helplessness.</span> <span id="s603">I remember the episode with the Saint Louis, which was absolutely unbelievable, that -- we worshipped Roosevelt, who at the same time was such a political animal that he would do anything to -- basically do what he felt was politically expedient.</span> <span id="s604">And of course, it’s easy to say that in retrospect, but at the time, it couldn’t be done.</span> <span id="s605">Whether it was a bombing of the rail lines, and -- or the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: When did your family know about the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Well, we knew about Dachau very er -- early on.</span> <span id="s608">Dachau was established before 1938.</span> <span id="s609">I was absolutely flabbergasted when I looked at the map, to see how close Auschwitz was to Gleiwitz, and when we were back there, I took that one day trip into the area from czechsla -- from the Czech Republic, and when I looked at the map I was flabbergasted.</span> <span id="s610">In fact, I had a very interesting -- got a very interesting letter from the Holocaust Museum last week, forwarding a letter that they received from Gleiwitz that in -- the local organization in Gleiwitz has -- I forgot the exact name, something for international relations, is going to dedicate a memorial to the Jewish community, at the site of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s611">When I was there seven years ago, it was a rundown playground with asphalt and not a plaque, nothing.</span> <span id="s612">And the Jewish old age home became a police station.</span> <span id="s613">After that visit, everything else was pretty much unchanged, but I couldn’t wait to get out and they -- I now got notice that they’re dedicating a memorial on the site of the synagogue and that the dedication is going to be on the 28th and 29th of October.</span> <span id="s614">And my wife and I and my three kids, and Joe and his family are going there for the dedication.</span> <span id="s615">Also visiting Berlin, which I understand has a new Jewish museum.</span> <span id="s616">And I feel I want to show the kids our roots, and I also want to show the people who are doing this that it’s about time.</span> <span id="s617">That’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s618">In fact, when I wrote the letter of acceptance that we’re all coming, and I mentioned the European titles, that all my children are being doctors and lawyers, all have the European titles as doctors, that we’re coming and that I hope the visit will be a very productive and memorable experience for all of us and them.</span> <span id="s619">And that’s the reason I feel strongly about going.</span> <span id="s620">I si -- it still hasn’t been determined whether they’re financing it, but I’m willing to finance it, because I think it is for a good cause, even though a couple of my kids disagree.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Will you be speaking to any groups over there?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Apparently yes.</span> <span id="s623">I don’t know what the language barrier is going to be.</span> <span id="s624">But the head of the organization writes perfect English, so knowing that most schools are bilingual, we should be able to communicate to some extent, although when we were there seven years ago in Opin, that’s the town where my mother was born, where I found the apartment where the business was and also where the Temple was, which is now a Russian style office building, I couldn’t communicate in either English or German.</span> <span id="s625">And when we went to a restaurant, we finally pointed to the table next to us, where they had soup and a sandwich, and that’s how we ate lunch.</span> <span id="s626">So it should be an interesting experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Let’s get back to the war.</span> <span id="s628">Any other mention that you want to make of the war?</span> <span id="s629">[phone ringing, tape break].</span> <span id="s630">As I was saying -- saying to get back t-to the war, you were following what was happening and communication got less and less --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: -- from the family, and -- and your parents state of mind because they were busy, was functioning and they were doing worthwhile projects and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: They were definitely not only functioning, but became extremely active in any kind of relief efforts.</span> <span id="s634">And as I said, it went to other causes after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Because that was their way of making up for the family that was lost, that philosophically our feeling is, you can’t replace what’s lost, but you can better what can be replaced.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Were you speaking to your family still in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: No.</span> <span id="s639">We stopped speaking German probably within six months.</span> <span id="s640">But of course we all spoke with an accent, and I do not have very -- I am [indecipherable] graphic and picture person and I do not have very much language talent.</span> <span id="s641">Therefore, I never heard the difference.</span> <span id="s642">And that’s the only way I can explain the fact that I reta -- I retain my accent after 65 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Then it’s the end of the war, and what was that like for you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Well, that’s when everything unfolded and the realization came that nobody could be traced.</span> <span id="s645">In other words, it was finalized by Leo Baeck, which must have been in the late 40’s or early 50’s when he came here.</span> <span id="s646">And it became quite obvious that my uncles never made -- never made it back to where they came from, and as I said, you have to use the energy positively and that was the family phi -- philosophy.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: So you became a high school student, were you active in high school, and have a lot of interests?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Very -- a lot of interests, yes.</span> <span id="s649">I consider myself a reasonably good student.</span> <span id="s650">I participated in various clubs, a lot -- mostly political.</span> <span id="s651">And I guess it shaped me also in a fairly liberal philosophy that Jews have always prospered in any fu -- liberal society, and it’s important that everybody has the rights that they’re entitled to because it rubs off.</span> <span id="s652">And I still thi -- I travel a lot, being that it’s my business, but I still kiss the ground every time we come home, whether I agree with policies or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: And then you completed high school, graduated from high school, and then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: I went to college, Western Reserve University and during my sophomore year I met my wife, who by some accident or act of faith was the first European woman I ever dated.</span> <span id="s655">And we got -- we were married as soon as I finished college.</span> <span id="s656">It’s just about 53 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Ho-How did you meet your wife?</span> <span id="s658">A: Both of us went on unwilling vacations where our parents wanted to rest a few days in Lake Placid.</span> <span id="s659">And then we started corresponding and one thing led to another.</span> <span id="s660">We kept the New York Central Railroad in business.</span> <span id="s661">They went bankrupt after we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: So where was she living?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: She lived in Kew Gardens, New York and I lived in Ohio, but I went to Western Reserve in Cleveland and she went to Syracuse.</span> <span id="s664">And the distance to Syracuse was quite a bit shor -- shorter from Cleveland.</span> <span id="s665">That was kind of little bit better than halfway.</span> <span id="s666">So it was doable.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: And did your -- you said your wife was European, where did her family come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Vienna.</span> <span id="s669">And when -- when the anschluss occurred, her father was also in the leather business and had a customer in Philadelphia, a person, not Jewish, who offered them an affidavit.</span> <span id="s670">And they came here -- they wen -- their name is Simon, maybe they had Jewish roots somewhere, but they definitely were not, and they lived on the Main Line in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s671">And they came over in the same ship as I did, one sailing earlier, the one that was -- that was sent back during Munich.</span> <span id="s672">But we probably wouldn’t -- wou-would have hated each other wa -- if we met when we were nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: And then you got married and where did you live?</span> <span id="s674">A: In -- first in Kew Gardens, and then Great Neck.</span> <span id="s675">And when I -- I worked in New York for -- until 1992.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: I was in charge of production of textiles.</span> <span id="s678">I was in -- for a textile converting firm, until I retired.</span> <span id="s679">And after six months of retirement we -- rather, we moved to Washington because my two daughters both had gone to school -- to graduate school here and retire -- an-and found New York boys to marry in Washington, so we decided to live in -- to move here where we could grow new roots.</span> <span id="s680">And we’ve been living here for about 10 years, and since I’d done a lot of business travel, I went int -- went to travel school to learn the computers and I’ve been doing that since we live here and I work full time and travel a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: When were your children born?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: 1951, ’54 and ’55.</span> <span id="s683">And they all have families.</span> <span id="s684">Joanie, being the oldest has two -- has a daughter of 18 and a son 16.</span> <span id="s685">And he is the one who is going with us to Poland na -- which became Poland after World War II when I -- I say -- I became Polish retroactively when the borders changed.</span> <span id="s686">And my other -- my son has a daughter who is 12, and my other daughter has two daughters, age 14 and 12, who also live in Washington.</span> <span id="s687">Jerry, my son, lives in Seattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Does he have any children?</span> <span id="s689">A: Yes, I said, a daughter of 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Oh [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s691">Mm-h.</span> <span id="s692">Now -- and your parents stayed in Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: My fa -- my father stayed in Dayton unt -- until he died in 1979.</span> <span id="s694">My mother tried to s-stay in her house in Dayton and unfortunately developed fairly severe Parkinson’s Disease.</span> <span id="s695">And finally after she couldn’t manage with round-the-clock help, she -- we brought her to Washington in 1993, and she died in the Hebrew home, 1995.</span> <span id="s696">But my kids did know her.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Your parents you said were very active, Jewishly, in community --</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: -- and your father sponsored a lot of affidavits.</span> <span id="s700">Were they friendly with many other refugee Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Some, but their roots really were in the general community, both Jewish and non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s702">In other words, we tended not to be cliquish and believed philosophically in being fully integrated.</span> <span id="s703">To me it was a step backwards to move to Great Neck, which is kind of a gilded ghetto, and I prefer Washington for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Let’s talk now a little bit about some of your thoughts.</span> <span id="s705">Do you -- which you’ve already expressed some already.</span> <span id="s706">D-Do you feel that you would be a different person today if you hadn’t had the childhood and the experience that you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: I’ve been -- let me answer it in a different way.</span> <span id="s708">I’ve met a fairly substantial number of Germans and I confront the history.</span> <span id="s709">I feel that the Holocaust is probably almost as much part of the German psyche as it is the Jewish psyche.</span> <span id="s710">I’ve also noticed that the -- by the numbers that come to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s711">I feel I’ve had a much, much richer life in the United States than I ever would have had in Gleiwitz, even if it hadn’t -- there hadn’t been a war or Holocaust.</span> <span id="s712">So I sometimes use a statement in speaking to Germans, the best revenge is living well.</span> <span id="s713">And I believe in that philosophy and I think our children reflect it, that the opportunities, I’m talking about cultural and otherwise, that we’ve had in New York and Washington are far greater than anything we could have experienced in Upper Silesia in the best of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Ho-How did you convey your religious feelings to your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: We sent them to Sunday school.</span> <span id="s716">I’m a great believer that the two most important things you give your children are roots and wings.</span> <span id="s717">And they all not only went through Confirmation class, but they all went through post-Confirmation class in order to be rooted not only Jewish religion, but Jewish philosophy.</span> <span id="s718">I’m a philosophical Jew.</span> <span id="s719">My father used to say, I may eat traif, but I like to think kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann.</span> <span id="s723">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s724">When did you change your name to Frank?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: When I started working for a commercial firm.</span> <span id="s726">First th-there were two things which I had to do.</span> <span id="s727">One is sound American, and change my signature that nobody could read it, because at the time we were doing export business, the first customer I di -- I did correspondence with was M.B. Herrairi in Baghdad.</span> <span id="s728">And when I wrote a letter and signed my name, my boss said, this is something you have to change immediately.</span> <span id="s729">And he signed just initials and make a scribble and you never put any name, just initials, that we can tell whom -- who you are, and then I just -- it was easier to be Frank because it’s a common name, people remember it better, and I had no trouble doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: How did your parents feel about your changing your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: No objection.</span> <span id="s732">Although my father kept his name Hans, and he kept the second N, because he said, I don’t want to be -- I don’t want to live with any kind of pretense.</span> <span id="s733">This is who I am and I don’t want to change it.</span> <span id="s734">My wife has adopted that philosophy and insists on the two N’s.</span> <span id="s735">She sa -- wh-when my kids went to camp and the company made mistake on the nametags, she sent them back once, because she’s very firm on it and my kids also retained the Liebermann with two N’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Did your children have a -- become a Bar and Bat Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Oh definitely.</span> <span id="s738">Again, we believe in -- we believe in studying and in the Jewish philosophy that you really -- in o -- in order to defend yourself, you have to know who you are.</span> <span id="s739">And probably the people who fared least well in the Holocaust were those who really didn’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s740">In other words, even the ones who converted were considered Jews.</span> <span id="s741">And they didn’t have the background to deal with it.</span> <span id="s742">And I would say this is one of the things I learned from the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Well, you were very young when you went through what you did.</span> <span id="s744">When your children were that age, did it bring, you know, seven, eight, nine and so forth, did that -- did it bring back that part of your childhood to you, when they were the same age?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: No, not really at that age, but I know that my children persuaded my mother to write her autobiography, because they wanted their sense of history.</span> <span id="s746">Unfortunately, it was fairly late and we had to do a lot of editing because she wrote a lot of notes originally.</span> <span id="s747">And I want to thank my daughter-in-law, who did a wonderful job on the computer in putting her various stories together in a logical way, which became difficult at the time she did it, which was probably in her mid-80’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: What happens to you when you see a swastika now?</span> <span id="s749">What runs through your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Since I -- I an -- I would say I have come to grips with it.</span> <span id="s751">I woul -- I’m saddened when I see it.</span> <span id="s752">I’m beyond angry.</span> <span id="s753">Basi -- as I say, I confront Germans at various times and I feel you can’t undo history, but you have to ta -- you have to learn from it.</span> <span id="s754">This is one reason why -- my wife managed to get me tickets for the consecration of the Holocaust Museum on that rainy, cold, miserable day, when there wasn’t a seat to be had in the part that was roped off for people who wanted to bear witness, while in front, the part that was left for the dignitaries was half empty.</span> <span id="s755">It’s also wa -- why, when I had a chance, I volunteered at the museum, because I feel I can convey a message and I’m glad to be doing it.</span> <span id="s756">My kids are very much aware of their roots, and that’s a reason why they are going on the trip next month, because I said we be -- as a family believe in roots and wings.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Are you angry that you had to leave Germany and your family had to go through what it did, and you had the losses that you had, and other people didn’t?</span> <span id="s758">Let’s say Jews here in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s760">Look, we made the best of a bad situation.</span> <span id="s761">We were very fortunate.</span> <span id="s762">My father’s good fortune was that he lost his living relatively early in 1936, and that he had the foresight to leave.</span> <span id="s763">My father-in-law, who left Vienna, said you know, his good luck was that he was not too old or too rich.</span> <span id="s764">Either of those circumstances made many people victims.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: And early on it’s a very, very traumatic experience to move.</span> <span id="s767">I know it from New York, or fro-from Great Neck to Washington that it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s768">Moving to a strange country is extremely hard.</span> <span id="s769">But once you do it and succeed, I feel I could not have had the life that I’ve had, if we had stayed, forgetting about the politics and everything else that occurred.</span> <span id="s770">So, I’m certainly not angry, but I’m trying to be constructive.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: How old were your children when you told them about the loss of their -- their relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: I don’t remember, but we made no secrets of it.</span> <span id="s773">No, it -- we’ve always been open.</span> <span id="s774">I’ve -- I’m not smart enough to keep secrets, because then you always have to remember what you s -- whom you said what to, and we kept various pictures.</span> <span id="s775">We still have albums of family that are -- particularly my granddaughter has used for some of her art projects, and that’s part of our heritage, that we’re survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: What does it mean to you to be a survivor?</span> <span id="s777">A: I’m happy to have made the best of the situation.</span> <span id="s778">I’ve probably become very family conscious on how important it is, and I think I’m try -- I’m trying to pass that on to my children and grandchildren, with whom we try to travel and give them as many benefits as we can f -- as we can find, or as they’re willing to accept.</span> <span id="s779">That’s -- that’s all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Let’s talk about some of your political views.</span> <span id="s781">You -- you did allude to that before --</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: -- because of what you went through.</span> <span id="s784">You want to le -- elaborate a little more?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Well, I -- I would say I’m -- I -- I’ve become a student of history, Biblical and otherwise.</span> <span id="s786">And if you do that, you realize that the Jewish community has always done well in a free society.</span> <span id="s787">And therefore, I think there’s a reason why Jews tend to be liberal in their own self interest.</span> <span id="s788">And some of the trends we have th -- do worry me, because we don’t seem to be getting our message across as well as we did in former years.</span> <span id="s789">In other words, I’m not -- when -- even when Senator Lieberman mentions God too often, I don’t think that’s -- that belongs in politics.</span> <span id="s790">Now, one of the things that made things so easy for the Germans is that the churches and synagogues were fun-funded by the state.</span> <span id="s791">In other words, you gave a certain part of your taxes to go to the church of your choice.</span> <span id="s792">And therefore, they had complete records of what everybody was and thought, whether they were with them inic -- or against them.</span> <span id="s793">And I therefore don’t like some of the trends that we see now in fighting terrorism, of invading civil liberties.</span> <span id="s794">I mean, I certainly don’t mind giving my name, but some of the illegal searches and so forth, scare me.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Does that remind you of Germany in the 30’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: That’s what I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s797">And being specific, Mr. Ashcroft, who I think is going over the line.</span> <span id="s798">So it has shaped my political views.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: What are your thoughts about the State of Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Well, I am very sad that the middle in the world is losing power.</span> <span id="s801">In other words, the extra -- you only hear from the extremes, in other words, the right wing or the left wing.</span> <span id="s802">The only way that that conflict will ever be solved is through some fairly tough compromises on both sides.</span> <span id="s803">And the further we go to the extremes, the harder it’s going to be to come to terms with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: What are your thoughts about the necessity for a State of Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Look, it’s -- it certainly -- I’m very much for the state, even though I wasn’t always.</span> <span id="s806">I didn’t want a nationalistic -- I didn’t want to be identified with policies with whi-which I disagree.</span> <span id="s807">At this point I believe it’s here to stay, it’s -- when the whole world closed, if we had had a State of Israel, that wouldn’t have happened.</span> <span id="s808">Philosophically, I think the Likud policy of trying to presser -- of the occupied territories is contrary to Jewish la -- to Jewish law and contrary to Jewish interests, because they’re trying to create a South Africa, where we have -- you can’t be a religious state where some people are more equal than others.</span> <span id="s809">And there is merit in -- if you want to have a Jewish state, it has to be pretty much limited to the Jewish population and you can’t be Imperialist.</span> <span id="s810">Because strictly on basis of the increased birthrate, if they carry it on the way it was done in Lebanon, where it used to be 50-50, and then you had a ruling minority, that is poison for stability.</span> <span id="s811">So I’m -- I’m thinking of it again from a philosophical rather than a political point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: And you are concerned about the stability of the State of Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Certainly as an occupying power, it can’t work in the long run.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Did you have -- or did you follow the Eichmann trial, and what were your thoughts when that was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Look, he was a monster.</span> <span id="s816">I had -- I don’t think that he could get justice, no matter what happened.</span> <span id="s817">And I suppose it was expedient to get rid of him, even though a -- I think they were successful in not making him a martyr, but there was a danger of that.</span> <span id="s818">Sometimes a MacArthur idea of old soldiers, sometimes if they could have faded away, it probably would have been just as good.</span> <span id="s819">In other words, I’m not a revenge person, but I’m not always sure that that’s for the best in the same way that eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, which they are doing in Israel, because it just creates more unrest and more anger.</span> <span id="s820">On the other hand, I understand that you can’t let yourself become a victim without reacting.</span> <span id="s821">It’s a dilemma.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Do you feel German in any way now?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: No.</span> <span id="s824">In fact, my -- I am much more sensitive, though, to German characteristics, which probably wouldn't bother somebody else, they do bother me.</span> <span id="s825">I’m talking about the pushiness that I’ve -- I’ve gone through Germany in part.</span> <span id="s826">In a store, if they have the sale, they go with elbows.</span> <span id="s827">That probably bothers me more than it would bother somebody else.</span> <span id="s828">Or the very rigid bureaucrats.</span> <span id="s829">So I’m sensitive to those characteristics, but I try to avoid them.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: So you have no emotional attachment in the sense of the place you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: None at all.</span> <span id="s832">None at all.</span> <span id="s833">In fact, I once got in a conversation with a tra -- when we were on a ferry in New Zealand.</span> <span id="s834">I got on fairly early and I got a very good seat and opposite me sat -- somebody came in later and said in German to the neighbor, I wonder where I can get something to eat.</span> <span id="s835">And I gave him directions in German.</span> <span id="s836">So he looked at me and said, how come you speak such good German?</span> <span id="s837">And I gave him the answer, translated, I was once German.</span> <span id="s838">And he said, how can you say that, it’s your Fatherland.</span> <span id="s839">I said, not for me.</span> <span id="s840">And I got into a discussion with him.</span> <span id="s841">His father was a minister and he hadn’t really come to grips a fact that he didn’t speak up.</span> <span id="s842">And I think I had him in tears during that trip.</span> <span id="s843">He was a tour leader for Budget Tour.</span> <span id="s844">We were going on a f -- in a fairly comfortable way.</span> <span id="s845">And that’s where I originally started using the term, the best revenge is living well.</span> <span id="s846">And I’ve used it several times since, but that really brought it up.</span> <span id="s847">And that sums up my -- my German feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Let’s talk a little bit now about the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s849">You did mention that your wife arranged for tickets for the opening ceremonies, but what was your first encounter with the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Well, at the opening, I had to take a woman from the Temple sisterhood on the condition that I take her out for lunch.</span> <span id="s851">Which I dutifully did and I went through it and of course I heard the protest of six million lies right across the street.</span> <span id="s852">It was a very emotional morning.</span> <span id="s853">And then I just felt I wanted to bear witness.</span> <span id="s854">But after September 11th, when the travel business really collapsed, and for a month we did nothing but give credits and retur -- arrange for refunds for the days that nobody could travel, I was asked to work three days a week, and I took the course at the museum, and I started to volunteer.</span> <span id="s855">Now my -- my agency asked me to come back in January, and I told her look, once they’ve invested their time, I feel I have an obligation.</span> <span id="s856">And ever since I’ve been doing that Thursday morning, then I work the rest of the time.</span> <span id="s857">I get th -- I get to the office by about two o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: So you’ve been working at the museum since January 2002?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Actually, yeah, since the fall of 2001.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Right, after September 11th, and then you took --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yeah, it’s almost two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: It’ll be two years fing -- December first.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: In between the time of the opening in ’93, and -- and September 11th, 2001, what was your contact with the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Just that I had gone a couple of times.</span> <span id="s866">I decided to donate my grandparent’s business papers, which my mother kept with all kinds of correspondence, and the bookkeeper had preserved them, and whatever other letters we had in our collection, because I felt my kids can’t read German, I can barely read German because the grammar is so cumbersome that I may as well give it to somebody who can -- who can use it.</span> <span id="s867">So I’ve had that relationship with them, and I had gone a couple of times, and of course, I’d recommended it.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Recommended it to other people to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Yeah, people.</span> <span id="s870">And I got a wonderful letter from a Catholic friend of my wife’s, whom I gave tickets to, about how moved they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: What kind of work do you do at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: I’m just information, you know.</span> <span id="s873">Greeting, elevators, tickets, information --</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: So you’re in vi -- you’re in visitor services.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Visitor services, exactly.</span> <span id="s876">And frankly, I enjoy the once a week, invigorating experience of going to the mall area and interesting people that we meet at the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Has working there affected your memories of your early childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s879">No, I have no -- I am -- I am past the point of being emotionally repressive or -- in other words, I -- I handle it in an unemotional way now.</span> <span id="s880">Even though when I gave the lecture and put it all together, at the end I was tearful.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Wh-When you gave a lecture --</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: At Madera.</span> <span id="s883">That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: This was your --</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: -- that was draining.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: This was your grandchild’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: -- school.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: This is a high school that you spoke to.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s892">But, let’s see, I keep on living and try to make the most of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: When you’re at the museum and you’ve gone through the exhibit in the fifth floor, in the 1930’s in Germany, do you identify with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: The one that really got me -- oh, sh -- one second, I turn it off [tape break] -- not re -- the one that I got -- probably was most emotional about was the present exhibit on the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: This is the hidden children exhibit.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s897">And the last ti -- wa -- again, when I was emotional is in “Schindler’s List” when they lead the children away.</span> <span id="s898">That’s something that I can’t come to terms with, and I think of my cousin, who when we left she was three years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: And who did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Who did not survive.</span> <span id="s901">I mean, none of the children survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s903">Do you identify with the children yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s905">I mean, I identify as what happened to -- children were totally helpless and -- and I would sa -- it’s probably -- that’s the only pogrom that’s di -- that really -- attacked the children first.</span> <span id="s906">From a phils -- philosophical way of destroying the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: What is your relationship with other survivor volunteers at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Good.</span> <span id="s909">I have no -- I mean, I like some better than others.</span> <span id="s910">Some people you relate to, that’s normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Do you exchange stories with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s913">We don’t have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Do you feel a connection with those who came from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Again, I look strictly as people.</span> <span id="s916">I don’t have any -- no more -- I usually ask where people are from, whether they’re from Ohio or New Zealand and places that I’ve been to.</span> <span id="s917">From the museum, that’s more interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann.</span> <span id="s920">This is tape number three, side B, and we were talking about your experiences at the museum.</span> <span id="s921">Would you encourage other survivors to volunteer at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: I think it’s -- I think it’s quite important that I sometimes do ask, if I’m the survi -- actually, I don’t consider myself a survivor, because my parents with their good fortune got me out before ’38, or during ’38 and I really had a minimum of trauma.</span> <span id="s923">But by being represented as somebody who is authentic, I think it adds to the experience of people at the museum, and I do get asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: You get asked what?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Whether I was a survivor.</span> <span id="s926">And I say yes, even though I don’t believe it myself.</span> <span id="s927">In other words, the category of survivor is somebody who really went through some of the hell which happened after Crystal Night.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: What are your feelings when you walk into the building?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: I think it’s a fabulous piece of architecture.</span> <span id="s930">In other words, the somewhat disjointed look is, I think, a marvelous achievement.</span> <span id="s931">People often ask me, you know, about the map that they give out.</span> <span id="s932">And I said, it really doesn’t help because people didn’t know from one moment to the next what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s933">So you can’t put that in a map.</span> <span id="s934">That’s my standard comment.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Do you feel like you belong there?</span> <span id="s936">There’s a connection to the museum for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s938">In other words, I feel that somewhere I can contribute more than I probably could elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: But I meant an emotional connection when you walk in.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Ah, I do not tend to be that emotional.</span> <span id="s941">In other words, I appreciate the happenings and I -- I try to ra -- I try to believe in reason over emotion.</span> <span id="s942">Not that I don’t get emotional, but this is not -- I don’t have the connection that way, except I think that it -- that it’s an important part of education and I have taken -- I’ve invited -- for instance, I’ve invited my kids and grandchildren to the celebration of survivors, November first.</span> <span id="s943">And I think that’s important.</span> <span id="s944">But from an educational point of view, rather than a strict emotional point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: What are your thoughts about the non-Jewish staff and volunteers?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: They again -- it depends which ones.</span> <span id="s947">Some of them are strictly business, others are really devoted.</span> <span id="s948">And also in th -- among the volunteers are some non-Jewish volunteers.</span> <span id="s949">You don’t know what reasons people have for reacting.</span> <span id="s950">So-Some of them take it strictly they’ve had experience in museums and it’s a museum job.</span> <span id="s951">Others do it because they feel it -- it’s particularly important.</span> <span id="s952">And both kinds of people are useful.</span> <span id="s953">No other comments.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Do you go to many of the lectures and presentations?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: I don’t have time, because I leave there and go directly to work.</span> <span id="s956">If they have something in the evening, preferably on weekends, it’s much easier than during the week.</span> <span id="s957">Course I -- I get home around quarter to six.</span> <span id="s958">By the time I have dinner during the week, that’s -- that makes for a long day -- we -- and we go to the theater a lot in the weekends and have cond -- all kinds of subscriptions.</span> <span id="s959">It’s -- you can only do so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: You had said that the hidden children exhibit was particularly meaningful for you.</span> <span id="s961">Are there any other exhibits in the permanent collection that -- or any other temporary exhibits that really were very memorable, or are very memorable for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Again, they have all been very educational, whether it’s bringing up the book burning and the intellectual philosophy of race superiority and so forth, which was popular in -- throughout the world, it was just taking that to an extreme.</span> <span id="s963">And I say one of the -- one of the things that’s unbelievable about the Nazi movement is the high emotional pitch that it could get to.</span> <span id="s964">And that’s such a danger sign that it still hasn’t been explained to me.</span> <span id="s965">In other words, how the political rallies can be so devastating.</span> <span id="s966">On so -- so-called educated people.</span> <span id="s967">That’s the reason I tr -- I try to be unemotional.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Because it’s dangerous to be emotional.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s970">You said it in different words.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Has the world learned lessons from the Holocaust, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: I wish it really had, but the fact that it’s recognized hopefully will be helpful.</span> <span id="s973">We probably won’t know for another two or three generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: In closing, do you have any message to those two or three generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Unless you lear -- unless you study history, you can repeat mistakes.</span> <span id="s976">That’s the reason I’ve been -- i -- the Holocaust really has made me look at history, including by the way, the re-religious history of the New Testament, or rather the -- the Christian Bible, to be correct.</span> <span id="s977">That in making it the national religion of Rome, Constantine basically had to absolve the Romans.</span> <span id="s978">And therefore, it was easiest to blame the Jews.</span> <span id="s979">And that is not an uncommon way of interpreting history, that it’s always written by the victors, about the people who can’t answer, after the fact.</span> <span id="s980">So the study of accurate history is extremely important and history is generally not taught very well, as to what the real issues are.</span> <span id="s981">I think that’s the end of my thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Anything else you’d like to add before we close?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s984">Anyway, thank you for a nice interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Thank you very much for doing the interview.</span> <span id="s986">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
