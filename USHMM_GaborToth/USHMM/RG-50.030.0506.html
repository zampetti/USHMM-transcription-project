morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: It’s very nice to see you, Mr. Belfer, after all these months of talking on the phone.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: And very good to be with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Tell me, what was your name when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My Polish name was Roman, and my Hebrew name was Avraham Yashuah.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And your last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Belfer.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Belfer.</span> <span id="s22">And you’re now known as?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: As Robert Alexander Belfer.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And where’d the Alexander come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: My cousin, one of my mother’s sister’s children, married a fellow by the name of Shie Faigel, and he also was a Yashuah and he changed the name to Alexander.</span> <span id="s26">So I felt that it was appropriate as an American to have a middle name, so I followed his example.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s28">And when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: In March 27th of 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And where?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I was born in the town of Hajow in Silesia where -- near the German border, where my parents happened to be living briefly.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: But you weren't raised there?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: I was re -- raised in Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: In Kraków.</span> <span id="s35">And what did your father do?</span> <span id="s36">A: My father was a processor of feathers and down.</span> <span id="s37">He would buy the raw feathers from Polish farmers, separate the feathers from the down and then market them separately.</span> <span id="s38">He had a factory in Kraków that did the separation.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s40">And did your mother work as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Bef -- my mother worked in her family’s travel office, and my father, as a result of his business, marketing the feathers and downs, did a lot of traveling.</span> <span id="s42">So he happened to visit travel office, and he found what he thought was an attractive young gal, he courted her and married her.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: So she lived in Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: And do you remember the house where you were living?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Or the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: It was an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: It was, I believe, on the second floor.</span> <span id="s53">And from what I remember it was quite a -- a nice apartment from the perspective of a very young child.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Now I know that your -- your dad left Poland when?</span> <span id="s55">Was it after the war started, do you remember?</span> <span id="s56">Or do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes, I do know.</span> <span id="s58">Okay, on August 23rd, 1939, when the Soviets and Nazis signed a non-aggression pact, there was the fear of war in the air in Poland.</span> <span id="s59">This was particularly true with respect to my father.</span> <span id="s60">When the Nazis got into power, they established all kinds of trade restrictions.</span> <span id="s61">My father was exporting feathers to Germany.</span> <span id="s62">While he was visiting Germany, he was arrested, allegedly for breaking their trade ru-rules.</span> <span id="s63">He was able to post bail, and he actually jumped bail.</span> <span id="s64">So he knew that if Nazis ever got into Poland, that he would be picked up.</span> <span id="s65">With the encouragement of my mother who said to him that if you are in Poland you will be arrested, if you’re out of Poland, you may be he -- able to help us, she encouraged him to promptly leave the country.</span> <span id="s66">It being late August, my father’s parents, being religious, said, the high holidays are coming, you should wait and leave until after the holidays.</span> <span id="s67">Well, my father left Poland from the port of Gdynia, or Gdansk in late August, with the last ship to leave a Polish port before the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: While he was in the middle of the Atlantic, September first came along, with the outbreak of the war, and clearly, if he had listened to his parents rather than his wife, I wouldn’t be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s71">Now, you s -- you were very young, so do you have any recollections from your own memory of your father leaving?</span> <span id="s72">Do you remember that day, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I remember that my father would take a number of trips, but I can’t tell you at this point that I remember this departure.</span> <span id="s74">He had previously gone to the United States, where s -- the ship was going, on -- on a -- business trips.</span> <span id="s75">So I think to my young mind, the difference between this business trip and other business trips, was not apparent.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s77">Do you remember feeling any anxiety in the house because of a possible war and then the war coming?</span> <span id="s78">Do you -- do you have a recollection of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Well, my recollection is that when the war came, we fled to my father’s village, ni -- which was relatively close to Kraków, called Werdiswow.</span> <span id="s80">In my own mind, and perhaps this is fantasizing, I think of Werdiswow as being the Anna Tefka.</span> <span id="s81">And as -- so we felt it being a small village, it was a quote, safer place to be with the Nazis swarming all over Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: So it was you and your mother, your two sisters, and anyone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Well, when we were in Werdiswow, we were with my father’s extended family, his parents.</span> <span id="s84">He was one of seven children, there were three boys and four girls, and my father was the oldest, and so there were a lot of Belfers around in Werdiswow.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: And you know, some of them had children, and I suspect that there were, you know, close family friends.</span> <span id="s87">So I do remember that one night when the Nazis were first invading, we spent the night on the floor of a barn, lying on the floor, somehow feeling that that was safer than staying in our homes.</span> <span id="s88">That there was the noise of artillery in the background.</span> <span id="s89">And I am told a story about myself which perhaps is -- should embarrass me, but it doesn’t, that apparently in the middle of the night, I got up, I felt the full bladder, and just relieved myself to the expense of a sleeping neighbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And who told you this story?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: My parents, and my sisters would tease me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s93">Now, you had two older sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Can you give us their names, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yes, there was my sister Selma who was three years older, and my sister Anita who was just one year older than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Do you remember them in Poland?</span> <span id="s98">Do you remember being with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Well, I remember that my sister Anita, who was then called Hanka by her Polish name, had a nanny maid by the name of Topja.</span> <span id="s100">And apparently Topja wa -- who was su -- probably supposed to be looking after all three of us, seemed to favor Hanka, or Anita.</span> <span id="s101">Also remember being told that when she was two and I was one, that I was as big as she was.</span> <span id="s102">And, by the way, I was told that I was a 10 pound baby.</span> <span id="s103">Obviously I can’t prove it.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s105">That’s pretty big.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: And that I was a much better eater, you know, and that I would eat the food off Hanka’s plate.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: With her permission, or you simply went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Well, she would, I think ha -- was happily acquiescing at being relieved of the burden of eating.</span> <span id="s109">Having grandchildren of various temperaments --</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: -- I know some of them are more like I-I am, and some are more like my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s113">Let me go back for a second.</span> <span id="s114">You -- because not everybody who watches this will know what you meant when you said -- when you went to this little town it was like Anna Tefka to you.</span> <span id="s115">What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: That it would be a small east European village with largely unpaved streets, and probably chickens running around the place, and most of the men being bearded, and Yiddish being spoken --</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: -- much more so than Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: And Anna Tefka actually refers to a town in a musical, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Yes, that’s -- it is the name of the -- a fictional town in “Fiddler on the Roof.”</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Which of course has now become an American icon.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s124">Your -- where did your father go when he left?</span> <span id="s125">He didn’t get to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Wa -- he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s129">By that -- the boat on which he was on sailed to New York.</span> <span id="s130">He was permitted entry to the United States as a business person on a business visa.</span> <span id="s131">While he was in the middle of the Atlantic, the zlotys, the Polish currency that he had with him became worthless overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: When he got to Ellis Island, he was given five dollars by HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and -- in order to have the wherewithal to get off.</span> <span id="s134">And he made contact, reme -- as I said before, he had been to the U.S. previously.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: He had business contacts, and they initially helped him out and he went to work for them, initially as an employee, and he shou -- he shortly became their partner.</span> <span id="s137">Because he was aware that the war had actually broken out, and because wars create scarcity, when he used his business contacts to send cables to -- which was the pre-internet way of communicating --</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: -- to Europe, asking for quotations on feathers and down.</span> <span id="s140">And whatever quote he got, which was then above the market, he responded yes.</span> <span id="s141">When the merchandise arrived, and the fact of the war had been more widely recognized, the feathers and downs had appreciated in value, he was able to then sell them at a profit and get started.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s143">Now, was he able to communicate with your -- with your mother and the family at all, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: There -- the mail service was working.</span> <span id="s145">I think that there was an exchange of letters.</span> <span id="s146">I don’t -- don’t believe there was any telephones --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: -- that time that were functioning on a U.S. to Poland -- to occupied Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: -- relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: You don’t have those letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No, I do not.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: No.</span> <span id="s154">So how long was you father in the United States then?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Well, the -- my -- because he had a business visa, rather than an immigration visa, he had -- he applied as a hardship case as a refugee from a occupied country.</span> <span id="s156">But he had to leave the U.S. and go to Canada and -- to be permitted to re-enter the United States on an immigrant status.</span> <span id="s157">Obviously with the war raging in Europe, he was happy to be able to stay in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s159">Now, in the meantime, your mother is trying to get out of Poland, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Now, in the meantime my father was preoccupied not only with trying to make a buck, but getting his family out of Poland.</span> <span id="s161">And he had with him -- and I’m hoping I can actually get you a copy of what I would call a life-saving photograph.</span> <span id="s162">It was a picture of his wife and three children that he had with him, and utilizing that picture, and -- let’s just say the cooperation of the consulate of the Republic of Nicaragua, he was able to obtain for his family, citizenship papers of Nicaragua, then a neutral country.</span> <span id="s163">My mother won -- who was a little bit older than my father, grew up when there was no Poland.</span> <span id="s164">It was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and so she spoke a perfect Hoke Deutsch.</span> <span id="s165">And the Germans -- I mean, I can go into some detail about her contacts with them, did not speak Spanish, and so she conversed with them as a citizen of a neutral country, not as a Jew, not as a Pole.</span> <span id="s166">To the best of my knowledge, she ne -- we never had to wear yellow stars.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s168">So she’s communicating in Poland, to get out of Poland, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: So as -- as the holder of a citizenship papers of Nicaragua, she applied to leave the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s170">She was told that in order to leave the Third Reich, that she had to go to Berlin.</span> <span id="s171">But if I may, there are a couple of things that I do remember before our departure for Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Absolutely, tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Well, I remember that it snowed a lot, and that I remember holding my mother’s hand as we walked the streets in Kraków, and the way that snow gets shoveled into piles on the edge of the sidewalk, it seemed to me as a little kid that the piles of snow were as tall as I was.</span> <span id="s174">I remember that if we would walk in the streets and we’d come across Nazi s-soldiers, that well, you could -- my -- my mother would definitely show fear which I could feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Cause you were holding her hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: So did she grab you tightly?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: I think she -- I think that she would hold onto me a little tighter.</span> <span id="s179">Now, I have shown you some pictures of myself, probably taken in the summer of ’39.</span> <span id="s180">And modesty aside, I had blue eyes, and blonde golden curls.</span> <span id="s181">And there was a fear that the Germans would take some eastern European children who looked like Aryans, take them away from their family and raise them as Germans.</span> <span id="s182">So my mother cut ou -- had all my hair cut off to make me look less enticing to the Germans.</span> <span id="s183">My hair never grew back blonde.</span> <span id="s184">I’m sure it wouldn’t have -- it would have turned color anyway, but it’s a story that I mi -- that I kind of enjoy telling.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Did she actually cut off all your hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: I can’t say that I have any pictures of myself post haircut, so I can’t give you a precise answer, but certainly you can see from the photos I have, that I had an abundance of golden curls.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s188">Which were cut off.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s191">Do you remember seeing these Nazi soldiers when you were walking?</span> <span id="s192">Or do you only remember your mother’s response, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: So -- I know I remember seeing Nazi soldiers in Berlin, and subsequently when we ended up in Madrid.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: So I can’t be sure --</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Where, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: -- just where I saw them --</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: -- but I certainly do remember.</span> <span id="s200">Also, I miss -- I -- I also remember very clearly my -- a German officer would knock on the door of our apartment in Kraków, accompanied by one or two soldiers.</span> <span id="s201">And they would refer to my mother, who spoke perfect German, as [indecipherable] frau, gracious lady, which was the appropriate way to greet a respected stranger.</span> <span id="s202">And they would come and borrow a furniture for the duration of the war.</span> <span id="s203">In short, they stole it.</span> <span id="s204">And because there was this polite officer, you know, who request -- or looked very tall to me, as did most adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: I -- you know, didn’t get any sense of fear out of it, but I do remember, you know, these visits where, you know, there was no sense of compensation or anything like that.</span> <span id="s207">The Germans took whatever they wanted to take.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I also remember two other things from pre-war Poland, and that is that we used to visit my father’s parents in Werdiswow, and I remember his brothers, including one of them, Norman, who is still alive and in the U.S., playing with me and picking me up and standing me on top of a very tall dresser and I just thought this was, you know, very exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: And you know, so a family was a very big part of -- of our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I also remember that in summers we would go to Wroclaw in [indecipherable] southern Poland, as a family and while I don’t have specific recollections, it kind of rings of a pleasant memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s215">So it’s understandable as a young kid, you have these vague -- certain very specific memories, but th-the history is much vaguer for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I-It is.</span> <span id="s217">I can’t really be much more specific than --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: -- what I’ve said here.</span> <span id="s220">Now, after the war started, I do remember that my sister S-Selma, who used to go and play in the streets with her cousin, who also was Hanka, and was the daughter of my mother’s brother, so her name was Hanka Annisfeld, and she was no longer allowed to go to play in the street, and I suspect I wasn’t either.</span> <span id="s221">And normally I would have been starting school, probably that September, but with the outbreak of the war, whatever formal schooling I might have had was deferred.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s223">Were you -- did your two sisters go with you and your mother when she was going to the German embassy to try to get out of Poland?</span> <span id="s224">Did you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: I -- I think that you -- see, to try and -- and clarify, we -- we were able to go by train from Kraków to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: We were put up at a mother -- at a mother and children’s home [indecipherable] kinderheim, and while we were there, my -- my mother would take me to visit one consulate after another to try and get visas so that we could leave the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s228">I suspect I was not as well behaved as I should have been, so rather than leaving me at home where I could be annoying our neighbors, and just sort of realize that here I was speaking Polish, and all our neighbors were German and they obviously weren’t too crazy about us.</span> <span id="s229">And so it would have been rather risky to antagonize them.</span> <span id="s230">So I went with her, generally by subway, and I remember being on the [indecipherable] and my two sisters, who are only slightly older than I was, were left to stay at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Cause they were quieter than you were?</span> <span id="s232">A: Yeah, they were better behaved than I was, and I’m not quite sure how they occupied their time.</span> <span id="s233">But in any case, they -- they stayed home while I went with my mother.</span> <span id="s234">And I might add that while we were -- the first visas that we were able to obtain was to go from Berlin to Moscow to Shanghai and then hopefully the United States.</span> <span id="s235">To put this in a chronological time frame, we left Kraków in March of 1941.</span> <span id="s236">When I saw the movie, “Schindler’s List,” I realized that we left Kraków a week or two before all the Jews were rounded up in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s237">I’ve always wondered whether we weren't very lucky in getting out just in the nick of time.</span> <span id="s238">And I mention the chronology because we were in Berlin for a total of four months.</span> <span id="s239">Was not a -- a quick or easy st -- stay from March through July of ’41, and as -- as -- on June 22nd of ’41, we were getting ready to leave for Moscow, the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarosa, and that avenue of exit was closed to us.</span> <span id="s240">We subsequently were able to get permission to go through Vichy, France to Spain, and that’s -- that’s a-another chapter.</span> <span id="s241">But before I leave this, and the RAF would come over most every night and drop bombs on Berlin.</span> <span id="s242">They had no idea where the bombs were dropping.</span> <span id="s243">It was more like a -- an annoyance, but it meant that just about every night, we would have to go down to air raid shelters.</span> <span id="s244">And I remember there was at least one time when a bomb fell pretty close to the building where we were and that needless to say, shook up pe -- shook up the people mo -- in more than one way.</span> <span id="s245">Getting up in the middle of the night and going to the basement seemed more like adventure to me --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: -- you know, and I -- now that I think back, I wonder how the Germans who were in the air raid shelter with us, felt about this foreign family who was in their midst.</span> <span id="s248">The only thing I can say is that I don’t recall any act of verbal or physical harassment.</span> <span id="s249">To that extent I will say that I appreciated the, shall we say, self discipline.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: But it is, you know, something that I quite clearly remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Did they know that you were Jewish, or do you think they thought that you were Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: I had -- I regret that I didn’t ask that very question to my mother, because only my mother could give a definitive answer.</span> <span id="s254">I will say this, we did not have to have any i -- wear yellow stars or anything else that identified us as -- you know, physically as being Jewish, and that my mother did speak this perfect German.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: So -- and realize that there were German immigrants who had moved to Central and South America, I mean particularly countries like Argentina.</span> <span id="s257">And so we could have been -- possibly been viewed as Germans who moved to Nicaragua, temporarily ended up in Poland, and were going back.</span> <span id="s258">Again --</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: [indecipherable] right.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: -- I-I just -- I wish I had asked, I wish I could give you a -- a precise answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Do you remember later on seeing your passport, did it have a J in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Oh, our -- we had a Nicaraguan paper --</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Oh yeah, right, so it would have an [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: -- and so it wouldn’t have --</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s266">So you left Poland with Nicaraguan papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Cause you were then Nicaraguan citizens according to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Now, what happened to your grandparents, did they stay in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Okay, my grandparents ended up in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: And they were both killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s275">And this was your father’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: My -- I’m sorry, we’re talking about my father’s parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: My father had four sisters, they all ended up on a boat, a ship, and it was put out to sea, and sunk by the Nazis and they all perished.</span> <span id="s279">My father’s two younger brothers ended up in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s280">They went through a series of harrowing experiences, being moved from one camp to another, especially as the Russians were advancing, but they managed to survive, ended up in Italy at the end of the war, and with my father’s help, started up a feather and down business and subsequently emigrated to the United States, and of the two brothers, one passed away a long time ago from cancer, and the other one, the youngest, Norman, is about 83 years old, still alive, and except for hard of hearing, is in good health.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s282">We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Did you ask your mother when you were -- as you were traveling, what’s happening to Grandma and Grandpa, or did you just think -- were you conscious that there was a war going on?</span> <span id="s286">Did you realize something funny was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Having -- going to air raid shelters almost every night, it was impossible not to --</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Not to.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: -- realize that there’s a war going on, and yes there was a general anxiety, but again, I don’t think I really felt it.</span> <span id="s290">I don’t have the sense of a fearful childhood.</span> <span id="s291">It was in -- in some ways from my young perspective, an adventure as much as anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: It’s interesting, isn’t it, that at such a young age, with bombs falling, that you don’t recall a fearsome childhood.</span> <span id="s293">It’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: So your mother must have been very -- you must have felt very close and safe with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Don’t you think?</span> <span id="s298">Is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yes, I-I do, and I mean, I -- when I think about the complaints that I hear from various family and friends living in this country, about what they think are harrowing problems, and I think about what it was that my mother underwent, I mean, living in mortal fear of losing all three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: It does give you a surge of respect of --</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: And it hurts you.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Ah, it -- yes, it gives me endless admiration for my -- for my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s305">Okay.</span> <span id="s306">We’ll stop the tape.</span> <span id="s307">What happened to you just a few minutes ago?</span> <span id="s308">We just stopped the tape.</span> <span id="s309">What -- what was it that was going through your -- you -- your head about your mother, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: I believe that my mother did some extraordinary things to bring her children out of a death trap.</span> <span id="s311">But that wa -- it is hard for me to think about her and the fact that she passed away at a very early age of 58, that -- that she was dealt an unfair h-hand in life.</span> <span id="s312">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s313">It just upsets me [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s314">I feel silly crying, but I -- I -- I loved her.</span> <span id="s315">I owe my life to her.</span> <span id="s316">Maybe I’m quite a hardboiled business executive, and so this is quite an emotional outburst for me, and I st -- I -- I think I have now gotten it quote, out of my system.</span> <span id="s317">But it is just a fact of my view that this is a wonderful woman who I loved dearly and who was dealt an unfair hand by fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: I’m assuming you told her what you felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: She knew it without being told.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s321">She must have been quite a special person.</span> <span id="s322">So, you want to get to Madrid now?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: What -- what were you doing for four months though, in Berlin, tell me.</span> <span id="s325">You were just going around with your mother to the -- to get -- try to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Well, I know that we spent a lot of time going from one consulate to the next, and because most children that age were going to school and I wasn’t, I have a bit of a hard time figuring out what it was that I was doing with my time.</span> <span id="s327">It may be that because my nights were interrupted by going down to the air raid shelter, that I may have slept more during the day, but otherwise I suspect I quote, played with my sisters, and I know that since Polish was the only language I could speak, I certainly wasn’t playing with the other kids who happened to have been around.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Di -- do you recall your mother saying, Robert, or r -- she probably called you Roman at that time, yes, be careful, or don’t go outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: No, actually, they used the diminutive of Roman, which was Romek.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Romek.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: And Romek is what became Robert.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: I see, so that’s -- makes more sense as to how it moved to Robert, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: So did she warn you, don’t use Polish, keep quiet?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: I know we tried to keep a low profile, since as I alluded to, we -- we -- clearly we were foreigners in a country that was at war with all of the nationalist fervor that being a-at war implies.</span> <span id="s336">And so keeping not only myself, but my two sisters, you know, in a low profile, must have been quite a challenge and a burden to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s338">Did you have enough food, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: I believe that we were given ration cards, I’m not certain.</span> <span id="s340">And I do remember that while we were in Poland, and we -- remember, we were there for a year and a half --</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: -- under Nazi occupation --</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: -- from September ’39, til March ’41 that the variety of food seemed to have diminished.</span> <span id="s345">That you couldn’t get the kinds of things that you could before the war.</span> <span id="s346">But I don’t recall every being hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s348">Do you recall your parents being re-religious in Poland?</span> <span id="s349">Or se-semi-religious, how would you describe it?</span> <span id="s350">If you know.</span> <span id="s351">I don’t know if you even know.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I -- I know -- I mean that -- that we observed the Sabbath, and obviously the high holidays.</span> <span id="s353">I don’t have any specific recollections of, you know, going to a synagogue or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s355">And were you kosher at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: You were.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s359">And we were kosher when we go to this country as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s361">So you maintained that throughout the tra -- even the travels, to -- to get here.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: I suspect that we -- when we were in countries like Berlin -- you know, in Germany and in Spain, that we weren’t perhaps as strictly kosher as we might have wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: But we -- there wasn't a choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s366">Do you remember going to Spain?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: You remember it?</span> <span id="s369">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Well, I remember that we stayed at a hotel in Madrid and in the hotel lobby was an over life size portrait of Adolf Hitler.</span> <span id="s373">I remember clearly that there were Nazi soldiers on the streets of Madrid, and that Spain was -- under Franco was cla -- a Nazi ally, and while not a war combatant, was certainly involved in helping the German war effort, and under German subservience.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: So that must have been really weird, to be in this hotel with this huge portrait of Hitler.</span> <span id="s375">Did you know who this guy was?</span> <span id="s376">Did -- did anybody say?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yeah, yes I did.</span> <span id="s380">You know, I -- sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: So you’re about si --</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Six to seven, because you’re there -- okay, right, you’re not quite seven yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No.</span> <span id="s387">Six and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: So you knew who he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: So did it scare you?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: To a certain extent, I’ve retained a sense of adventure, and as I said, my recollection is not of being fearful, but rather of being curi -- sort of curious.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: And inquisitive.</span> <span id="s394">I was told that I asked more questions than I should have.</span> <span id="s395">On the other hand, I had the time, because I wasn’t going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s397">And your sisters weren’t going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s399">My sister Selma had gone to school --</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: In Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: In Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: -- before the war broke out, but her education also stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s405">So you’re in Madrid again for what, three months -- July -- no, two months, couple months.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Well, right, six weeks.</span> <span id="s407">We ended up -- and I -- frankly I only have a vague recollection as to why we moved to Saville for awhile.</span> <span id="s408">I think it may have been economics.</span> <span id="s409">But we ended up -- my mother was continually trying to get transit on a ship bound -- leaving Spain for the United States.</span> <span id="s410">And we were finally able to get passage on a converted Spanish coal freighter, called the Navamar.</span> <span id="s411">The small ship contained -- carried 1500 refugees, probably all Jewish, in quadruple decker bunks.</span> <span id="s412">There was an open hole in the sleeping quarters because it had been a coal freighter and this hole was where they would dump the coal.</span> <span id="s413">And the ship left from what I believe was the port of San Sebastian, and set out for Havana and then New York.</span> <span id="s414">The -- because there was a lot of illness about the ship -- in fact, I was told that about six people had died in voyage, and that’s a voyage that took almost six weeks, that my mother was anxious to get us off the ship as quickly as possible.</span> <span id="s415">I recall that there were live cattle aboard the ship, like four cows, because they didn’t have refrigeration, or adequate refrigeration, and so in order to have meat for the passengers, you had the cows.</span> <span id="s416">My mother was very appropriately concerned about the health of the water, so here I was, a six and a half year old kid, drinking wine regularly, because it was deemed safer than drinking the local water.</span> <span id="s417">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: I don’t recall not liking it.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Now, the Spanish flagships were being used to get around the British blockade, and the British were regularly sinking Spanish flagships.</span> <span id="s422">So there was a concern as to what -- as to this possible danger.</span> <span id="s423">I think by the time the ship got to Bermuda, or possibly closer, we were boarded by the British Navy.</span> <span id="s424">I remember these officers in white uniforms boarding the ship, and satisfying themselves that this was a refugee ship, and you know, not a transport ship helping the German war effort.</span> <span id="s425">We disembarked in Havana, and in addition to the health concerns, we didn’t have immigrant visas into the United States.</span> <span id="s426">When the Navamar returned back to Spain, it was converted back to being a coal freighter, and was sunk by a British submarine on the next trip out.</span> <span id="s427">Yes, here we are in Cuba --</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Let me -- let me ask you something.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Since the Polish zloty is nothing any more, what is your mother using for money, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Okay, my father was a -- a -- was able to send funds to her through, I think was a Jewish network to hel -- which enabled money --</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: -- to be funneled, from the United States to, you know, Jews living --</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: -- under Nazi control.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s437">So now you’re in Cuba with Nicaraguan citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Where do you go in Cuba?</span> <span id="s440">You can’t get into the United States right away, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Correct, well, we -- my recollections of Cuba are not all that precise.</span> <span id="s442">I remember two things very clearly, that there were a lot of mosquitoes, and I remember my -- I can still picture my mother putting Calamine lotion on me, and the other is that they had a lot of delicious ice cream.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: And it didn’t seem like an unpleasant, you know, existence.</span> <span id="s445">It was, of course, unusual to be in a sort of tropical island after having spent my previous years and -- in Poland, and while we were there, having arrived in September of ’41, my -- the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December, and that changed everything.</span> <span id="s446">This point, it was much easier for my father to obtain immigrant status or visas for his family to be reunited.</span> <span id="s447">And so in January, of ’42, we -- my family boarded a ship called the Monterey, which went from Cuba to Havana from -- to New York.</span> <span id="s448">Because there was a threat of German submarines and we were now [indecipherable], I remember that there were like 13 passengers on the entire ship, and there were more crew than passengers.</span> <span id="s449">So that during the course of a meal, there’d be a waiter standing behind every chair.</span> <span id="s450">So here we went from you know, a most -- you know, extreme harrowing experiences to what seemed like -- like the lap of luxury.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: And when we got to United States on January 23rd, 1942, it was such an extraordinary event that the New York World Telegram, then a prominent newspaper, featured a picture of my family, and that is of my w -- of my mother and my sisters and myself having arrived, escaped, you know, Nazi tyranny.</span> <span id="s453">That was the first -- the last time for a long time that my -- before my picture appeared in the paper again.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Again.</span> <span id="s455">When you were in Cuba, do you remember where you were sta -- staying?</span> <span id="s456">Were you in a camp of some kind for refugees, or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: No, we were in an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: It wasn’t a -- you know, lux-luxury apartment, but we weren’t, you know, living in depravation.</span> <span id="s460">And I wish I could tell you how I spent my time.</span> <span id="s461">It certainly became a lot -- I have a lot clearer picture what I was doing when I got to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s463">Now is your -- when -- your father was able to send for you because he’s now under immigrant status, or he’s already a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: No, no, he’s in immigrant status.</span> <span id="s465">He had applied for citizenship, but it requires five years of living in the United States before --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: -- one can become a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s469">And so he was able to get immigrant status for you -- for you and your mother and two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Ri-Ri-Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: A-As -- as immigrant -- you know, as permanent status rather than a temporary visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s474">And is he living in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: He is.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: So when you see him, is he -- is he somebody you really remembered?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yea -- well, yes, and he had toys for us --</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: -- and was a [indecipherable] it was about -- perhaps 10 inch long model car that was green, was a police car and you could wind it up with a key and it would go and would make a -- a siren sound.</span> <span id="s482">And you know, I just remember being very excited.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: You know, I can feel the excitement of that January 23rd day.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s486">And where does -- where is he living?</span> <span id="s487">In s -- is he living in Brooklyn?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: He had been living, I think, in lower Manhattan in a hotel, but when his family arrived, he had acquired an apartment at 1035 Washington Avenue in Brooklyn, into the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, across the street from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.</span> <span id="s489">And that’s where he w -- he set up shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: And I think on his own, he bought furniture in a department store and had the place furnished and it was a four room apartment.</span> <span id="s492">I initially shared a bedroom with my two sisters, and I had a -- like a pull-out couch.</span> <span id="s493">A few years later we moved to a five room apartment in the same building, where I was able to get a -- my own bedroom and my two sisters shared a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s495">So is your dad still doing the feather business?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: In New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: When do you, as a young person, become conscious of what it was that you really went through in terms of the hist -- I mean, you -- you know what you went through, individual incidents or events, but you don’t necessarily know the history for a long time.</span> <span id="s500">So when does that become really clear to you, that there was something called a Holocaust, and th-the Nazis were exterminating people, killing people?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Let me backtrack just a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: We get to country in January of ’42.</span> <span id="s504">My -- I get s-sent to the local public school, P.S. 241, and of course, remember, I -- I-I -- I’m not speaking English.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: But I was desperate to become an American, and so I willed myself to forget Polish, if you can [indecipherable] grasp that concept.</span> <span id="s507">And so that summer we were sent to a -- a sleep-away camp called unserkamp inkindervelt.</span> <span id="s508">I would say that it was the extreme left wing of Jewish Socialism.</span> <span id="s509">I laugh when I think back on that.</span> <span id="s510">The following September, I was sent to the Crown Heights Yeshiva, and my two sisters stayed at P.S. 241, and were given piano lessons; it seemed appropriate for girls.</span> <span id="s511">They hated piano lessons, I hated the Yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: You couldn’t switch.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: No, I-I wasn’t given the choice, and so here I was taking three and a half hours of Hebrew in the morning and four hours of English in the afternoon and somehow I was trying to learn English the same time.</span> <span id="s514">I can’t tell you how it worked out, but it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Why did they send you to Yeshiva, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Because that’s what boys did.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s518">Your father had gone to Yeshiva when he was a boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: He went to Johaida.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: You know, I -- more of a --</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: -- religious school.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s525">Did you tell your parents you hated it?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: And what’d they say, it’s too bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Well, I had this checkered past where in the third grade I switched for one semester to P.S. 241, and then I went back to the Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s529">And then I should -- remember you asked me about my recognition of the war, and it has -- two things come to my mind.</span> <span id="s530">One is that we were big Roosevelt fans.</span> <span id="s531">Back -- I even remember in 1944 that when he ran for re-election, the Roosevelt cavalcade went right up Washington Avenue where we lived.</span> <span id="s532">But the Hebrew teachers thought that Roosevelt was an anti-Semite because he didn’t allow more Jews into the United States.</span> <span id="s533">So we had this feeling -- this sense, you know, that bad things were happening to Jews there.</span> <span id="s534">The other thing that you asked, when did I really get the recognition of this?</span> <span id="s535">I remember coming home from camp in August of ’45, and my father was sitting on a camp trunk and crying because he had just gotten a telegram that his parents had died during the war.</span> <span id="s536">Then in ’46, my Uncle Norman showed up, together with his brother Maurice, and while Maurice went back to Italy, Norman stayed in the United States, got himself a little tan Oldsmobile convertible wi-with red leather seats and I thought he was real cool.</span> <span id="s537">By that time he was speaking Italian and I think he kind of, you know, had the glow of It-Italian chic.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: But I was turning aware that most of my family had not survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s541">And wh-what did that do to you, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: I think it certainly gave me a -- a sense of identity, you know, of being -- of being Jewish, of being very supportive of Israel.</span> <span id="s543">And I remember, I guess, that November ’47 vote in the U.N. on -- on partition of Palestine as th -- as something very specific.</span> <span id="s544">It was -- it was a historic event that I can say I have a contemporaneous recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s546">And you were 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s549">We need to change the tape.</span> <span id="s550">Do you want to really get up now?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: So you -- you were saying that you have a vivid recollection of the 1947 -- the vote to form a state of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Do you then, as you get a bit older, you’re then 12, in your teenage years or in your early 20’s, do you start reading about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s556">Or is -- does that come later?</span> <span id="s557">Or do you not even feel the need to because you went through it in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Because so many members of my family perished in the Holocaust, I’d have to read about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: I mean, I was on the periphery of it, and did sort of reinforce this.</span> <span id="s561">My mother had a sister Dora, who married a Dutchman by the name of Joel Grajower, that’s G-r-a-j-o-w-e-r, and lived in The Hague.</span> <span id="s562">Dora did not survive the war, but Joel and their four children, who had been in what ha -- what -- I think been in the Caribbean during the war, came -- visited us in new -- i-in Brooklyn in 1946, and lived with us actually, for a few months.</span> <span id="s563">And they made us very conscious of the fact that they were displaced persons, so to speak.</span> <span id="s564">And so we were -- we were living that.</span> <span id="s565">We -- we were living the detrious of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s566">We have to read about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: And your Uncle Norman, did he talk about his experiences when he came?</span> <span id="s568">A: Y-Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: -- I mean, you know, that he -- I heard his experiences in detail, but it’s been over the years, so it’s hard for me to just say this.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: But certainly, I mean, I remember him telling me that at one point he and his older brother Maurice were on one of these death marches when they were moved from one concentration camp to another.</span> <span id="s573">And that when somebody would drop from exhaustion, they were presumed dead, and their bodies would be thrown on the back of a truck and then buried, you know, in due course.</span> <span id="s574">And so my Uncle Maurice fell down, was thrown on the back of a truck and then his younger, more rigorous brother Norman literally took him down from the death truck, you know, and revived him.</span> <span id="s575">And you know, that’s about as bad as it gets.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s577">Do you recall anti-German -- I don’t know whether to call it propaganda or -- ways in which the United States portrayed the Germans once -- once you came here, and then after the war, was there a -- a lot of talk about how horrible the Nazis were, or other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Well, within the Jewish world, where -- which was where I basically lived, you couldn’t say nu -- bad things about the Nazis often enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: And there was just this feeling that this was the greatest calamity that had ever befallen the Jewish people in our 3200 years of history, and that it was shocking that cultured Europeans, and the Germans, who are certainly viewed as being in that category, could act in such a bestial manner.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: When did you start reading English newspapers, do you remember?</span> <span id="s582">Or American newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Early on.</span> <span id="s584">See, I was, let’s say I was gung ho to become an American --</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: -- and one of the consequences of my experience th -- is that I was and still am a gung ho American.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: So does that mean you read papers as soon as you could read?</span> <span id="s588">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: And how long did it take you to learn English?</span> <span id="s590">You were seve -- seven when you came here --</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: -- about seven, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Well let me say, I remember very clearly following the progress of the war, 19 -- you know, ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: You did, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Oh yeah, and D-Day was another day that I -- so I re -- remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: And so that’s -- sure, I was reading the paper, you know, we used to get the “New York Post.”</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: And was by -- by that time I was -- I must have picked up the language quickly.</span> <span id="s600">I think that kids are much more facile at doing that than trying to pick up a language at a later age.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s602">Did your mother speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: She had to learn it.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Yes, and your dad as well, of course, because he was doing business.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s606">Of course he had been in this country for a few more years than we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: But he always retained quite a heavy foreign accent, whereas my -- my mother had not -- spoke English without any noticeable accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s610">Interesting.</span> <span id="s611">It must have been great to be a family again.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: It wa -- it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s614">Was there a conflict when you were in the Yeshiva and hearing about what happened to the Jews, and then in the newspapers you’re reading primarily about the war, which is not about death camps and labor camps and all the horrors that the Nazis committed against Jews a-and other people.</span> <span id="s615">Was there a conflict in you about what’s going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yes, because I thought that my teachers, who -- at the Yeshiva, several of whom were rabbis, were being too critical of my adopted country that I loved.</span> <span id="s617">And that they weren’t looking at it from the American point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: You were very conscious of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: I wa -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s621">Did you come home and talk about it with your parents, what you were -- what you were hearing, what was bothering you?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: I talked about it to -- to my sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: I mean, it’s interesting, when -- when you ask me this question, you really have turned the clock back many, many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: So you -- that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: I remember discussing with my sisters --</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: -- who were going to public school --</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Public school, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: -- and who didn’t have these teachers who had -- who were thinking like old Europeans -- Old World Europeans.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s632">So did that make you want to go to the public school even more?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s634">I’m -- I have to tell you, actu -- during the morning three and a half hours of Hebrew, I was not a very good student, and I was a very badly behaved, throwing spitballs at the teacher, having my face slapped, being sent down to the principal’s office, having my knuckles rapped with a ruler.</span> <span id="s635">To a -- this was a different world.</span> <span id="s636">And in English from the get go, I was an A student and with -- with a A in conduct.</span> <span id="s637">So I --</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: They must have thought you were schizophrenic.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Well, th-they had a point.</span> <span id="s640">I had certainly -- was fighting between my -- the American identity that I wanted to totally absorb.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: And my Jewish heritage.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s644">So how long did you go to Yeshiva?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: I stopped wa -- going there in my last year of grade school.</span> <span id="s646">So I finished -- I was -- I think I was -- just after I -- I was Bar Mitzvah’d in late March, and that June was probably my last year in the Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s647">And then I finished at P.S. 241.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: And went on to -- for the next two years to Erasmus Moore High School.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Two years, you did high school in two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: No, I tell you.</span> <span id="s654">After two years, I switched to the Horace Mann School up in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where I was one of the few boarding students.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: I was able to come home weekends, but I think that in part I was sort of glad to have a bit of a different environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Those two years at Horace Mann made quite a lasting impression on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: What was the biggest impression, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: That I was now thinking of myself as being more pli -- more privileged, more worldly, more obligated to the society of which I was a part.</span> <span id="s661">More comfortable in different social environments.</span> <span id="s662">A quote, real American.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s664">And you were grow -- you were really growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: And from hor -- Horace Mann you went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Columbia College.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s671">A-And what was your major in Columbia?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: I started actually doing engineering, and I took the engineering sequence of -- of advanced physics and chemistry and mechanical drawing.</span> <span id="s673">And especially the last one, I -- I really didn’t like.</span> <span id="s674">And I finished college in three years, and I was thinking about -- by that time my father had entered to the upstream, or growing ec -- end -- production end of the [indecipherable] gas business.</span> <span id="s675">And this was a business that appealed to me as opposed to the feather and down business, or it’s a -- it’s sequence, the foam rubber business, which he had been in.</span> <span id="s676">And so I was thinking about going to get a Master’s degree in petroleum engineering at the Carlotta School of Mines, or someplace like that.</span> <span id="s677">However, I decided that this wasn’t for me, and so kind of the last minute I took the LSATs law school aptitude test, you know, did exceptionally well, applied to Harvard and got in and there I was, you know, going to Harvard Law School, and knowing that I was looking to a business career rather than a career in the law.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: In the law, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: But I was always glad to have had the benefits of the law school education without having the acute anxieties that many of my classmates had, because their standing in the class could very well determine the career track that they would be on.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s681">And were your parents very influential in terms of suggesting that you do one thing rather than another, or were you quite independent by this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Well, I’ll tell you, my sister Selma had a major influence on me, both in terms of going to Horace Mann, because she had also had some catching up to do school-wise, having not gone to school for several years.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: So rather than going to Erasmus Hall, the local public high school, she went to the Rhodes school in Manhattan and got out in three years, and so this is my -- my model of going elsewh -- going off the standard path --</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: -- and -- and going at your own tempo.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s688">So that’s really important.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: So when you graduated, when you got your law degree, did you go into your dad’s oil business, or did you go out on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Okay, I did something wh-which has always brought me a lot of pleasure to think about.</span> <span id="s692">Having been 23, I took off a half a year and traveled around the world.</span> <span id="s693">And I went to places which are c-certainly out of bounds to tourists, particularly American tourists.</span> <span id="s694">Places like Kashmir in Nepal, and Bali.</span> <span id="s695">And I had a lot of wonderful memories of that trip.</span> <span id="s696">One of the things that happened as -- July 14th, 1958, there was a revolution in Iraq, and I was in India, and my parents said come home, come home.</span> <span id="s697">And I said no way.</span> <span id="s698">And actually I went from India to Cairo, you know, and -- you know, people don’t sort of realize that India isn’t that far from that part of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: And I -- I have to tell you a story which I kind of enjoy, and that is that I took 2000 Kodachrome slides during the course of this trip, and when I met my wife the following year, in ’59, and I told her about my slides, she said, “I’d love to see them.”</span> <span id="s701">So I said to her, “Well I’m -- I’d love to show them to you, would you like to move in with me for three weeks?”</span> <span id="s702">She said, “What is this?</span> <span id="s703">What kind of a girl do you think I am?”</span> <span id="s704">Obviously the alternative was to pro-propose marriage, which I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: When -- how long did you know her before you proposed that she move in for three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Se -- a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: A few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: But I knew -- I knew that it -- th-that was not a serious -- a -- a question because obviously I knew her answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: It was just a way of --</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Right, right, you were just -- I see --</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: -- have -- play -- playing the game.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Did you fall in love right away?</span> <span id="s714">Was it pretty fast for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: I would say that I was attracted to her right away.</span> <span id="s716">I -- let me say, I was living in Manhattan by that time, and she was living in Lawrence, Long Island, which made her what -- what we would refer to as G.U., geographically undesirable.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: So rather -- she was working in Manhattan --</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: -- for CBS classical records.</span> <span id="s721">We had a love of music in common, and so rather than asking her out for Saturday night, which meant driving to Lawrence, coming back to the city and then driving out to Lawrence again, I would only ask her out during the week, because this way I could meet her after work.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: And she was wondering whether -- what my level of interest was, since I wasn’t asking her out Saturday nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: I had met her the previous August.</span> <span id="s726">By the time the spring came, she went to an extended trip to Europe with her family, and when she came back, she was wearing much brighter colored clothing, and I found that very attractive, and so I said to her, I said, “You know, I like -- you look so well in these colors.”</span> <span id="s727">And she said, “Well, you know I used to deliberately wear dark colors because you’re -- you’re a Harvard man.”</span> <span id="s728">I assured her that --</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: That you weren't --</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: -- my -- my education and my taste in clothes, had nothing in common.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: -- weren't -- weren’t -- right.</span> <span id="s732">And so I understand that you -- you got married a -- a year before your mother passed away, so she was able to be at your wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: So that was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: We got married December third, 1960.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: And my mother passed away December fifth of ’61.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: And my wife, to her everlasting credit, moved in with me into my father’s apartment because he was truly devastated at my mother’s early and unexpected death.</span> <span id="s740">She died from -- she did not recover from an operation to remove a benign tumor near her brain, and whether it was an avoidable matter, bec -- or whether because she got ex -- excessive anes -- anesthetics, or whether it was unavoidable, we can never be sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: But the consequences were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: And what made it so singularly unfortunate is that we had just moved to Manhattan a few years ago, and -- I mean her.</span> <span id="s745">She was opening -- she was beginning a new phase in her life --</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: -- just when it ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s749">Did your father remarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: He did.</span> <span id="s752">A number of years later, I -- or in --</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Three or four years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s755">And were you close with her or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Oh, with his second wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: The second wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: I would say we were cordial but not close.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Not close.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: And we still maintain very cordial relationship, I spoke to her on the phone a day or two ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: You know, but she has her children and my father has --</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: His.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: -- had had his.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Had his, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: And as I think I mentioned to you, I -- despite the fact that both my sisters have passed away, we keep in close contact with my nieces and nephews.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s768">And I understand you’d like to be able to say something as we -- as we close the interview, so I want to give you an opportunity to say what it is that you want to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Well, my two older grandsons, George and Andrew Malkin are wonderful boys.</span> <span id="s770">They live in Greenwich with their parents, and go to Greenwich Country Day, a school that is over -- overwhelmingly non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s771">My old -- oldest grandson George wrote a paper about my European experiences and background.</span> <span id="s772">He asked me to appear before his history class to [indecipherable] my -- my experiences.</span> <span id="s773">And at this point his younger brother Andrew is expecting me in a few weeks, and anxiously looking forward to sharing my European background experiences with his classmates, and I feel that their interest in my background is something that I would like to share not only with them, but with my other three living grandchildren, and hopefully more grandchildren that come down the pike, and possibly even their children.</span> <span id="s774">I’m appreciative of having this opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: What is it you really want them to know, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: I want them to know that -- how fortunate they are to be living in this country, to be living in a comfortable environment, to recognize that being Jewish is a privilege and a burden.</span> <span id="s777">It is something that you can retain in your heart almost separate and apart from wh-whatever rituals you practice or don’t practice.</span> <span id="s778">That it also represents a caring of family, of loyalty to each other, of the ability to handle adversity.</span> <span id="s779">So I think that there’s a -- much to be learned from what others went through, to hope that you don’t have adversity, but that when you do, well we all have bumps in our road, you keep a sense of perspective.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: And the Holocaust acts as a way of keeping a sense of perspective, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Certainly the Holocaust as an abstract concept is hard to transmit.</span> <span id="s782">But when you realize that you come from a family that had actively, even at -- to an extent peripherally participated in the Holocaust, it gives you an -- a sense of -- of immediacy, and intimacy, which you can’t otherwise get.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to say about your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: While bad things have happened to me overall, I’m an extraordinary lucky person and appreciative as I said of this opportunity to share part of my history with my family and anybody else who is interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Well, thank you very much for giving of your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s788">All right, now we’re going to do the photographs, so you can’t leave.</span> <span id="s789">You can leave and find out what’s going on in your office, but you have to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Okay, and what is this [indecipherable] I mean, Robert, I keep calling you [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s793">Robert, what is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: This is a picture of my parents, Arthur and Rochelle Belfer, and my older sister Selma in the middle, and to her right is my other sister Anita.</span> <span id="s795">And on my father’s lap is a picture of myself.</span> <span id="s796">Judging by the age of the children, I would say that this was taken in the summer of 1939 at the resort of Ropka in the Carpathian mountains of southern Poland.</span> <span id="s797">… Let me ask you, since I’ve already identified the players, I can go a lot faster [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s799">Okay, whenever you’re ready.</span> <span id="s800">Robert, what is this picture of?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: It is the picture of my parents and my sisters, Selma and Anita, with me sitting between them, and it was probably taken in the resort of Ropka in southern Poland in late summer of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Okay, and Robert, what is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: This is a picture of myself at probably the age of about four, and I would guess that it was taken during the summer of 1939, and I look very happy sitting on a horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Is this after your hair was cut?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: No, I still -- I think that my hair -- no, my hair wasn’t cut until after the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s807">Okay, and who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: This is a picture of my sister Selma, who is probably about seven and a half at the time, and her younger sister Hanka, or Anita, who was five and a half, aboard horses.</span> <span id="s809">I suspect this was the summer of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: And which one is Selma?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Selma is the one on the right, the o-older one.</span> <span id="s812">Notice they are both wearing these big bows in their hair.</span> <span id="s813">I imagine that that was the in style in Poland at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Okay [indecipherable] these.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: This is a picture of my parents, Arthur and Rochelle Belfer, taken in Poland.</span> <span id="s816">It was probably taken in 1939, shortly before my father left for the United States, never to return to Poland again.</span> <span id="s817">Do I need to mention my name, or do I se -- just say it’s me?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: You can say it’s you.</span> <span id="s819">Are we ready?</span> <span id="s820">Yes.</span> <span id="s821">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: It is a picture of Bob Belfer at his high school graduation.</span> <span id="s825">You may notice that my hair is a lot shorter and a lot darker than it was in the previous pictures that you’ve seen of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: This is high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: And who is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: This is a photograph of my father, Arthur Belfer, taken about 1990, or about three years before he passed away.</span> <span id="s830">He is looking very distinguished to me, and clearly a man of great wisdom.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Okay, and who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: This is a photograph of my mother, Rochelle Anisfeld Belfer, taken probably when she was in her late 40’s or early 50’s, in the United States.</span> <span id="s833">It was a black and white photograph that was subsequently colored in to accurately reflect her coloring.</span> <span id="s834">She looks rather glamorous there, and it’s my pleasure to see her pretty face.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: And wha -- who are these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: This -- this photograph is of my darling wife René and myself.</span> <span id="s837">I suspect it was taken about 10 years ago, which would make it 1996.</span> <span id="s838">I would say that René has aged very little since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: These folks?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: This is a photograph of René and myself in formal attire.</span> <span id="s841">I think René looks lovely, as she always does.</span> <span id="s842">We’ve now been married for over 45 years, and it was certainly one of -- the very best move of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: And who are these folks?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: This is a photograph of my wife René, to the right, and in -- sitting in the middle is my younger daughter Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s845">Behind her is my son Lawrence and his bride Caroline.</span> <span id="s846">This picture was taken, I would guess, about six years ago, and I can tell you that everybody looks at least as well now as they do in that picture, with the possible exception of myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: And who are these folks?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: This is a photo of my son-in-law, Tony Malkin, my daughter, and his -- and his wife, Shelly, and their two boys, Arthur and Andrew.</span> <span id="s849">The picture was taken when they were probably about 11 and nine years old.</span> <span id="s850">They’re a wonderful family and I love them each dearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Okay, and who are these?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: This is a picture of my cousin Hanka Anisfeld Wyvell, and her husband court -- Dr. Curt Wyvell.</span> <span id="s853">He was an orthopedist who accompanied the Israeli Olympic team to Munich in 1972, a horrifying experience for him and anybody else who thinks about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: And who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: This is a photograph of [indecipherable] God, the Israeli version of Avram Anisfeld, the son of my mother’s brother, and therefore my cousin, in his Israeli army uniform.</span> <span id="s856">He subsequently became Israel’s ambassador to Argentina.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Okay, and who are these folks?</span> <span id="s858">A: Okay, this is a photograph that I treasure, showing four generations.</span> <span id="s859">My father Arthur, my son Lawrence in the middle, and my older daughter’s son, Tony -- I’m sorry, older daughter Shelly and Tony’s son, George Malkin when he was about one year old.</span> <span id="s860">And it is extraordinary that -- I’m sorry -- can I -- can I take that from the top?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: How old is he now?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: George is now going on 16, and of course I’m in this picture also, and beaming with pride at having been associated with so many wonderful people.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: You’re really good at this.</span> <span id="s864">Okay, this is a lot of people here.</span> <span id="s865">All right, what are we looking at now?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s867">I love this wedding photograph of my son Lawrence, who is on my left.</span> <span id="s868">Beneath him is his beautiful bride Caroline.</span> <span id="s869">Next to her is my delightful wife, René.</span> <span id="s870">I’m sitting next to her, and on my left is my older daughter Shelly.</span> <span id="s871">And to her left is my younger daughter Liz.</span> <span id="s872">In front of her, sitting, is my six foot four inch son-in-law, Tony Malkin, and the -- the two little boys in the foreground are George and Andrew Malkin, and I would guess from the photograph they were about five and three years old.</span> <span id="s873">It’s a delicious photograph of my beautiful family.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: All right, one more.</span> <span id="s875">And here, you know, if you don’t -- okay.</span> <span id="s876">And what are we looking at now, Robert?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: This is a photograph of two of my grandsons, George and Andrew Malkin, and eight of their cousins who I will not identify by name.</span> <span id="s878">What they all have in common is that they are all grandchildren of this -- of Arthur and Rochelle Belfer, and the -- with -- here we are together for a Passover Seder, and it is always a source of great joy and pride that our family stays so close together.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Okay, the two gentlemen on the photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: The --</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Who are these [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s883">These are -- my younger two grandsons are Arthur and Daniel Belfer.</span> <span id="s884">If they look devilish, it’s an accurate representation of their personalities.</span> <span id="s885">They are lots of fun to have around.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Very good.</span> <span id="s887">Okay, who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: After four grandsons, my blue eyed princess, Abigail, daughter of my son Lawrence and Caroline, arrived.</span> <span id="s889">She immediately wrapped her older brothers and the rest of her family around her finger.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: And how old is she now?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: She is now three and a half, and as delicious as ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0506 PAGE
