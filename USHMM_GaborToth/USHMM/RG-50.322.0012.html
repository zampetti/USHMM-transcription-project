Fishman by Julie Orenstein.</span> <span id="s6">This is August 15, 1984, and we are in the kitchen of her home.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Tell me your full name, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: My name is Lee Fishman.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Would you tell me your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I was born in 1921.</span> <span id="s11">I am 63.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: What city?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Lubawskie (transcriber cannot find this city on a map, but he was able to locate “Lazdijai” which sounds somewhat like what L.E. said, and this agrees with later location).</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Did you grow up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: What type of town was that?</span> <span id="s19">Was it small?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Not so small.</span> <span id="s21">A little bigger than a really small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Was it industrial or rural?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s24">I think, mostly farming.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Do you know how your family came to be there?</span> <span id="s26">Have they been there for generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: My mother had been raised in that town.</span> <span id="s28">I don’t believe that they had been there for generations.</span> <span id="s29">They had come from smaller towns to this bigger town.</span> <span id="s30">It was, as shall we say, Columbus surrounded by smaller towns, but it was a bigger town.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s33">I had two brothers and two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Did any other family members live in your house besides your parents, brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: No.</span> <span id="s36">We were all kids at the time and we were all living at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Did you have any uncles, aunts or grandparents staying with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yes, we had aunts and uncles, not staying with us, but in the same town.</span> <span id="s39">My mother’s sister and brother with family.</span> <span id="s40">None of them, no one survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: What kinds of jobs did your grandparents have?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: My parents had a bakery at that point.</span> <span id="s43">My father did the selling, my mother did the baking and all of us used to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Did his father also have the bakery?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: No, his father did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Oh, my grandfather.</span> <span id="s48">I believe he bought all kinds of cakes and chicken and sold them.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Oh, kind of a wholesale business.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: No, he was first buying things at the market, such as at a farmer’s market, and then selling to different people, mainly in the houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: What kind of education did your parents have?</span> <span id="s52">Did they go to elementary school?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s54">I know that my mother had a little more education because she could write English.</span> <span id="s55">She had a Russian higher education (prior to the end of WWI, this was Russian territory).</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Were your parents very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Did they pretty much live in a Christian neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I don’t know about the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s60">You know the towns were not so big, so we all belonged to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s61">My mother was very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: So your family attended synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Did they keep a kosher home?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s66">My mother lived here, in the country and kept kosher.</span> <span id="s67">My mother was in the forest, even then she never ate anything which was not kosher.</span> <span id="s68">She would not eat what we wanted her to eat so that she could survive.</span> <span id="s69">We were all hiding in the forest for three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: We spoke mostly Jewish, I mean Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Did you speak any other language?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Russian and Polish, we spoke mainly Russian because where we lived it was in White Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Was that Byelorussia?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: No, we called it White Russia (that was its name prior to 1946).</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: You said that your mother spoke English.</span> <span id="s77">Did she teach it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: No, she didn’t teach it.</span> <span id="s79">We could write the address in a letter, to the U.S.</span> <span id="s80">She would do it for other people.</span> <span id="s81">She couldn’t speak it to us because no one spoke the language.</span> <span id="s82">She had English books.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Did you think of yourself as being among the rich people in your town or amongst the poor people in your town?</span> <span id="s84">When you were a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: No, we were not rich and we were not poor.</span> <span id="s86">In Europe when you had the essentials, when you had a bed, when you had a cow and a lot of chickens, so we were not doing badly.</span> <span id="s87">We sometimes had some help from South Africa where my mother had three brothers.</span> <span id="s88">They would send us money twice a year.</span> <span id="s89">So, we were not poor.</span> <span id="s90">My father ran his business so we made out.</span> <span id="s91">We got a little help.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Did your parents have mostly Jewish friends?</span> <span id="s93">Did they have any gentile friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Oh, we had more gentile than Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s95">In this town there were farmers who were very good to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Did they attend a lot of social functions at the synagogue?</span> <span id="s97">Was it a big center?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Oh, no, nothing especial; what we had were Holy Days.</span> <span id="s99">That is where I used to go with my mother and father, and the rest of the kids.</span> <span id="s100">They were religious as they were all over the country.</span> <span id="s101">In our country everybody was religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Was the Synagogue a big center for the community to get together in?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s104">Strictly for use during holy days or special events.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Do you know what other formal activities your family, your parents, were involved in in so far as such things as social clubs?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: No.</span> <span id="s107">They had to make a living.</span> <span id="s108">That is all for which they had time.</span> <span id="s109">You know that it was a different life in Europe.</span> <span id="s110">It was a hard life.</span> <span id="s111">You had to provide for your family, and work for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Was there any kind of entertainment?</span> <span id="s113">Entertainment which they enjoyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: When you were a little girl, were there any you could remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: As I told you, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s117">I don’t remember any entertainment.</span> <span id="s118">I remember, though, that the circus used to come to town.</span> <span id="s119">I don’t believe that my mother and father attended the movies.</span> <span id="s120">They used to tell me that I was too young yet for them; that I had plenty of years ahead of me to do t.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Do you remember anything about their politics?</span> <span id="s122">Were they politically active at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s124">There were no politics.</span> <span id="s125">Life was going on from day to day and you had to make a living, that’s all.</span> <span id="s126">You had no time for politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: You said that you helped in the shop when you were little?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes, I helped!</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: You started working when you were very young?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Naturally when you have a business like that you pitch in.</span> <span id="s131">We all had to do our things.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Do you feel as if you had been deprived as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: No, not deprived.</span> <span id="s134">We just had to work and do our homework after school.</span> <span id="s135">You couldn’t just sit around like some other people.</span> <span id="s136">We had to help.</span> <span id="s137">My mother had to take care of the house with five kids.</span> <span id="s138">I was one of the older ones, so we had to do all of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: When you went to school, did you go to public school or was it religious school?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: As far as I know it was a private school.</span> <span id="s141">It had to be paid for also.</span> <span id="s142">It was like the Hebrew School in Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: So, it was run by the Jewish Community.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No, not by the Jewish Community.</span> <span id="s145">They got teachers and they ran the school.</span> <span id="s146">It was like a “gymnasium”, for higher education.</span> <span id="s147">It was all in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: So, it was all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s150">It was the same thing which we have here.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Do you recall any specific events during your childhood?</span> <span id="s152">Anything outstanding which happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Nothing that I know of, only that the war started in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: So you were ten years old then?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No, I was not ten.</span> <span id="s156">I was 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Do you recall if the anti-Semitism increased at that time in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s159">I really didn’t know much.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Did they single you out as a Jewish person?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: No.</span> <span id="s162">I don’t know anything about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: What language was spoken at your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: What languages do you speak now?</span> <span id="s166">Languages which you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: English and I speak Polish and Russian and German.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Did you associate very much with gentile boys and girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No, we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Mostly with the Jewish kids you went to school with?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Prior to the war, to what extent were you aware of the Nazi’s intentions?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: We used to read the Jewish newspapers like the “Forward”.</span> <span id="s174">It used to be delivered.</span> <span id="s175">I read in the paper what was going on, even in Poland.</span> <span id="s176">You see, we were close to the Russian border (not far from Minsk).</span> <span id="s177">We didn’t believe what was going on.</span> <span id="s178">We read about it, but that didn’t tell us what really went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: At what point did you begin to believe that you were in danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: The minute they walked in.</span> <span id="s181">When the war started in 1939.</span> <span id="s182">Actually in 1939, the Russians came to us.</span> <span id="s183">In 1941, the Germans came.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: What happened when the Russians came?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: When the Russians came, they took everything away, like my father’s bakery.</span> <span id="s186">Then my father was just working for them, and I was working in the office for them.</span> <span id="s187">We were not allowed to keep our own, even our home.</span> <span id="s188">We had a big house.</span> <span id="s189">We were not supposed to keep it because they said that it was too big for a family.</span> <span id="s190">You were just allowed so much.</span> <span id="s191">It was not so bad.</span> <span id="s192">My father worked, I worked.</span> <span id="s193">We had food.</span> <span id="s194">The only thing which was bad is that if you sold anything and they catch you at it, they put you in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Was it because you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s196">Or, because they just took over?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: No, we were not singled out.</span> <span id="s198">At this time, the Russians did not discriminate.</span> <span id="s199">They were very proper.</span> <span id="s200">They liked the Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s201">They were very polite to people.</span> <span id="s202">They always came with music.</span> <span id="s203">They had dances every Saturday night for people of my age.</span> <span id="s204">After the Russians left and the Germans came, we appreciated the Russians.</span> <span id="s205">When the Germans came, they said that they were going to kill everyone.</span> <span id="s206">They said it right away, the minute they walked into town.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: So you had no anticipation that the Germans were coming?</span> <span id="s208">They were suddenly there, or did you know that they were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: We didn’t know that they were coming because we were under the Russians.</span> <span id="s210">At the time we didn’t know because the Russians were there.</span> <span id="s211">Then they chased the Russians and the Germans came.</span> <span id="s212">Under the Russians, we were happy-go-lucky.</span> <span id="s213">When the Germans came, they were going to kill everyone, that is a little different.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: What did you do when the Germans came?</span> <span id="s215">I mean, you were in immediate danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: The minute they came in, they walked into our next-door neighbors and they said: “You see this?”</span> <span id="s217">They showed the woman next door.</span> <span id="s218">“This is the garment which all the Jews will get.”</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Did they hurt her?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: They did not hurt her.</span> <span id="s221">No.</span> <span id="s222">But the minute they walked in they started killing, that is all.</span> <span id="s223">They took away some men from the houses and they killed just whoever they wanted.</span> <span id="s224">For nothing.</span> <span id="s225">Then they created ghettos and they put everyone into the ghettos and they called for everyone to come and register.</span> <span id="s226">Whoever was able to work had to work.</span> <span id="s227">Whomever they wanted they took away and they said that they would take the rest later.</span> <span id="s228">They burned them.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: So you were put into a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Yes, I was in a ghetto with my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Did they arrest anyone in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: They did not from my family, my family was lucky.</span> <span id="s233">My father was made the chief of all the bakers.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: So, what was the situation in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: In the ghetto, they were killing everybody.</span> <span id="s236">They were taking them out, telling them that they must come out to work, and just killing everybody.</span> <span id="s237">However we, my father, my husband and I, actually, we were just going around together, we were not married yet, we were just trying to find out when they were going to arrest us, because they knew that we had something to do with the people, the boys, who ran away.</span> <span id="s238">That is, the boys who were running away to the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: So, the people were escaping to the forest (the area around Minsk contained many acres of forest, which at that time had not been harvested, except in small, well defined tracks).</span> <span id="s240">Some Russian troops had also escaped extermination.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: So, my brother, and my husband to be, went into the forest when we found out that they were going to arrest us.</span> <span id="s242">So we just went into the forest.</span> <span id="s243">There is more than this to the story.</span> <span id="s244">We all went away.</span> <span id="s245">My father didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s246">I started crying that I didn’t want to stay any longer in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s247">We then were for a couple of years in the forest, hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: What kind of work did you do while you were in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: I worked for the German soldiers, whatever needed doing, such as peeling potatoes, or whatever.</span> <span id="s250">I had to work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Were you assigned that job?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: How long did you live in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: About a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: You were dating your husband at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s257">My husband was from a different town.</span> <span id="s258">He came to see his grandmother and his father.</span> <span id="s259">They were not far from our house.</span> <span id="s260">I had known my husband from before then; from the time when he was a boy, when he came to his grandmother’s.</span> <span id="s261">He stayed in our town until he ran away with my brother into the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: How did you know where to find him?</span> <span id="s263">You found him in the forest when you went, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: We had contact with the forest.</span> <span id="s265">Somebody from the forest came to get some other people, or to get something from the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Did you supply them with food?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: No.</span> <span id="s268">We did not.</span> <span id="s269">We supplied them with something they needed.</span> <span id="s270">Once they were in the forest, they went at night to get some food for the people.</span> <span id="s271">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s272">Farmers used to catch people from the forest and kill them or turn them over to the Germans to kill.</span> <span id="s273">The young people used to go away into the forest, and the farmers would get them and hold them until the police would come and get them.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: When you were living in the ghetto, what kind of a house did you live in?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s276">They put everybody in a house.</span> <span id="s277">Five or six families together.</span> <span id="s278">Some people were sleeping on the floor.</span> <span id="s279">Just so that they could survive.</span> <span id="s280">Until they killed the people, and the houses were empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q; Did they kill people for any reason, or just decided?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: They didn’t have to have a reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: They just seemed to randomly choose the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s285">They pulled the ones they wanted from the ones who registered for work, or whatever.</span> <span id="s286">They just took people away and killed everyone.</span> <span id="s287">People just didn’t come back from where they took them.</span> <span id="s288">That was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Were you able to have some friendships?</span> <span id="s290">Was there any kind of normal life at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: How could that be?</span> <span id="s292">There was no normal life.</span> <span id="s293">You had to hide all the time.</span> <span id="s294">We had to go into the attic of the bakery and hide.</span> <span id="s295">Some other people came to the bakery because they thought that was a place where you could survive because they wouldn’t come looking.</span> <span id="s296">We lay in the attic and heard how they were shooting the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: So, you were hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Yes, hiding all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: But then you had a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes, we had a job.</span> <span id="s301">Not truly a steady job.</span> <span id="s302">They would send us to different places.</span> <span id="s303">You had to go register every time at the Judenrat (that is the organization which the Nazi had set up to govern the Jews for the Germans) and work in one place or another, in a different place, wherever they called for young girls to come and work for them.</span> <span id="s304">But in most of the places where we worked, they did not treat us badly.</span> <span id="s305">As a matter of fact, some even tried to hide some young girls, so that they could survive.</span> <span id="s306">However, they couldn’t do anything when the entire thing was going on.</span> <span id="s307">We had a good German man.</span> <span id="s308">He would supply us with food and things.</span> <span id="s309">He felt sorry for us.</span> <span id="s310">He was hiding some Jewish girls and then, when the others found out, they would kill these people, especially because that fellow had hidden them.</span> <span id="s311">So, although he was a good man, he couldn’t do anything, because the rest of them would go after him.</span> <span id="s312">So these girls were specially killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Did you receive pay for your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: No, we didn’t get paid.</span> <span id="s315">Nobody got paid.</span> <span id="s316">People got hit, if they didn’t work enough.</span> <span id="s317">The girls wouldn’t get hit, the men got hit…they got always hit.</span> <span id="s318">My brothers, my husband got hit.</span> <span id="s319">They would ride them, as if they were horses, and they had to run, as fast as horses.</span> <span id="s320">Whoever didn’t run fast, they would beat him up.</span> <span id="s321">They beat our neighbor so that he couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s322">He was black and blue all over, all swollen up from the way he was beaten up.</span> <span id="s323">He had bad legs so that he couldn’t run.</span> <span id="s324">My brother and my husband, at the time, were young boys, so they could run fast.</span> <span id="s325">They would whip the horses, and the people would run as fast as the horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: When did you decide to go into the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: We decided when the police were after us.</span> <span id="s328">They were after us because we had connections with people who had run away and were in hiding.</span> <span id="s329">They found out about it, and they searched for us.</span> <span id="s330">So we were really afraid that the Germans would find it out and that then the entire town would suffer.</span> <span id="s331">They had those who truly kept an eye on things, and they had to report what went on, because, if they didn’t report us, somebody else would report.</span> <span id="s332">So there was a moment when they sent after me to come with my father to register.</span> <span id="s333">They said that they wanted to talk to us.</span> <span id="s334">We went to talk to them, it was about six o’clock, suppertime, and no one was there.</span> <span id="s335">So I went home with my father, and I said: “I am not going to go into the house.”</span> <span id="s336">So my younger brother came out running, all excited about what was going on.</span> <span id="s337">So I said: ”Send out my mother and my younger sister.”</span> <span id="s338">We walked to the house and I said: “We are going to run away.”</span> <span id="s339">So we ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Was it hard for you to get away?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Oh, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s342">We had to run to a farmer whom we knew.</span> <span id="s343">We came to him and he wouldn’t let us in because he was afraid that the people would know where we were hiding.</span> <span id="s344">He gave us a piece of bread and told us to go further.</span> <span id="s345">So we went into another barn where we stayed overnight.</span> <span id="s346">The next morning the farmer came in and he took some hay.</span> <span id="s347">We thought that, maybe, he knew that we were there and that he went to report us.</span> <span id="s348">So he took the hay and he went to town and when he came back -- seeing that he didn’t report us, we stayed until dark and then, after dark, we started walking further.</span> <span id="s349">My father knew the forest in that area, since that was the town where he used to live, which was not very far.</span> <span id="s350">It was about 50 or 60 miles from our hometown.</span> <span id="s351">We walked for two nights and two days.</span> <span id="s352">Actually we couldn’t walk the days so we just walked the nights.</span> <span id="s353">Then we came to one man who knew where the boys were hiding.</span> <span id="s354">This man took us into the forest.</span> <span id="s355">It was on an island, all surrounded by woods.</span> <span id="s356">They had like little dugouts where we would hide in the daytime.</span> <span id="s357">At night we would improve our location.</span> <span id="s358">It was mainly during the daytime that we were afraid.</span> <span id="s359">At night we weren’t so afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: You stayed there for three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yes, for three years.</span> <span id="s362">We left from there in August, in this month in 1946, when the Russians came back, to our part of the territory.</span> <span id="s363">Then we ran across the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Can you describe to me an average day in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A; What do you mean an average day?</span> <span id="s366">You just got up in the morning, you just hid close to the trees and listened for shots or something else which told you that someone was working.</span> <span id="s367">Usually the men, such as my husband or my brother would go to get food.</span> <span id="s368">My father and my mother were there and so were my younger brother and my younger sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">\Q: So was this just your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: No, we had several single people who had also run away.</span> <span id="s371">There were about fifteen or twenty people.</span> <span id="s372">Later when the Russian partisans stated coming.</span> <span id="s373">So since my husband and I were young people, they took us in a group with them.</span> <span id="s374">They left the rest, the older people behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So, just you and your husband left the camp with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s377">We went with them like soldiers.</span> <span id="s378">That went on until 1944.</span> <span id="s379">That is forty years ago, that we were liberated, as you might call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: When did you and your husband get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: In the forest, before we came out of the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Where did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: It was in the compound where I lived and then he went back to his town and we lived there for a couple of years, in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: What was the name of the town where he lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: It was Postovl (or something which sounds like it but the transcriber cannot locate it).</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Did you work in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: No, I didn’t work there, my husband worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: What kind of job did he have?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: He worked for the Russians as a supplier.</span> <span id="s390">He worked in a warehouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: What made you decide to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: There was no future for us there.</span> <span id="s393">We were afraid that we would lose everything, in case there would be another war.</span> <span id="s394">The whole town had been burned.</span> <span id="s395">There was no family, nobody was left.</span> <span id="s396">We were the only family in town, the only ones who survived.</span> <span id="s397">After the war, one of my sisters died, since there was no medications.</span> <span id="s398">She had diarrhea.</span> <span id="s399">She had eaten something and her stomach swelled up.</span> <span id="s400">After the war, it was easy to eat something wrong.</span> <span id="s401">So, she got dysentery, and it was all empty…there is nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s402">When the Germans ran away they just burned everything.</span> <span id="s403">There was nothing left in the homes.</span> <span id="s404">One house was so close to the graves that all you could see were rats.</span> <span id="s405">The graves were open.</span> <span id="s406">They never even bothered to close them.</span> <span id="s407">The whole town, everything was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: So your husband lost his entire family?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s410">He lot his mother and father, three brothers and one sister.</span> <span id="s411">He was the oldest of the siblings.</span> <span id="s412">He was twenty years old at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Did you ever find out what happened to the m?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s415">They were all killed before he ran away from there.</span> <span id="s416">They killed them in his town before they killed them in our town.</span> <span id="s417">What they did is that they killed all the people in the small towns.</span> <span id="s418">They brought everyone who was left in out town and then they killed everybody in our town.</span> <span id="s419">They killed my older sister, they killed my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s420">My sister had two little children, and they were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: So that entire family was killed.</span> <span id="s422">This sister had moved away from home and married.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s424">My other sister died after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: So you had just the two brothers left?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: My brothers live here in Dayton and my parents died here in Dayton.</span> <span id="s427">My mother died in ’63, my father died in ’77.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Where did you go when you left the little town of Postov?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: After the war?</span> <span id="s430">The Russians annexed Polish White Russia.</span> <span id="s431">If you were a Polish citizen and wanted to emigrate into Poland as of the borders of 1946, they allowed that.</span> <span id="s432">So we did register that we wanted to go into Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: That was further west?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s435">Another time we heard that people would be able to immigrate someplace.</span> <span id="s436">(The U.S. was accepting “displaced persons” at that time).</span> <span id="s437">So we had to pay to cross the border from Poland.</span> <span id="s438">From Poland we had to go to Czechoslovakia, we had to pay for that, and cross the border at night.</span> <span id="s439">Then from Czechoslovakia, we came to Austria and then to West Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: How was your travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Oh, we traveled in boxcars (enclosed freight cars).</span> <span id="s442">That was the only traveling which was possible.</span> <span id="s443">We were allowed to take a cart with us and we took that on the boxcar.</span> <span id="s444">We were in Germany for three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Did you travel directly from Poland to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: No, we didn’t make a straight trip.</span> <span id="s447">We had to cross the borders and we had to pay for crossing the borders.</span> <span id="s448">It was not so easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: You didn’t stop and live anywhere on the journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s451">Not until we came to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: What town did you live in in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: (Here the transcriber is not able to understand the name of the town, except that it is located on the Donau river.</span> <span id="s454">It sounds like Wilhelm on the Donau).</span> <span id="s455">We lived there for three years, in a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: In an internment camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: It was a Displaced Persons (DP) Camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: How was life in the camps?</span> <span id="s459">What did you do with your time there?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: We worked around and we cleaned and we helped in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s461">We did whatever work there was to do in the camp.</span> <span id="s462">We were there until 1949.</span> <span id="s463">We had come to Germany in 1946.</span> <span id="s464">Then, in ’49, we came to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: What kind of food did you have in the DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: We had whatever the Americans provided because Germany didn’t have much food then.</span> <span id="s467">It was right after the war.</span> <span id="s468">Everything had been bombed.</span> <span id="s469">All the food came from UNRA (United Nations Relief Association).</span> <span id="s470">Then, if you had someone in the U.S., they sent you something, a few dollars or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: So there were no jobs with pay or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: No.</span> <span id="s473">You were not supposed to work.</span> <span id="s474">You waited for days.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: What were you waiting for?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Until they would have you here (in the U.S.) or somewhere else, that some country would let us in.</span> <span id="s477">Nobody did.</span> <span id="s478">You had to have papers, and this and that.</span> <span id="s479">Then another time, my oldest son was born.</span> <span id="s480">Then they didn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s481">So altogether we waited for three years.</span> <span id="s482">Three years went by until we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Did you have any idea what country you wanted to go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: No, we really didn’t.</span> <span id="s485">Just as long as we went someplace.</span> <span id="s486">Then Truman got legislation passed which would let us in.</span> <span id="s487">My husband also had family here.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: What relatives did they have here?</span> <span id="s489">How were they related?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: He had an uncle, actually two uncles.</span> <span id="s491">He had an aunt in Akron, Ohio.</span> <span id="s492">They prepared papers for us.</span> <span id="s493">They wanted him to come right away in 1946.</span> <span id="s494">The papers did not move so rapidly because I had my oldest son there (in the DP camp) so they just wouldn’t let us go because he was a little baby.</span> <span id="s495">There was always something.</span> <span id="s496">So we got to stay there until 1949.</span> <span id="s497">Then, we came in August, 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Well, did you have your son in a hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: In Germany?</span> <span id="s500">Yes, he was born in a hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Did you feel that you got good care?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Oh, I guess so.</span> <span id="s503">There was nothing to complain about.</span> <span id="s504">I think that everything was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Was the hospital in the DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: No, it was a regular hospital.</span> <span id="s507">We had doctors in the camp.</span> <span id="s508">I didn’t have a doctor.</span> <span id="s509">I had a midwife.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: So, when you came to the U.S., that was, you, your husband and your son, who else came with you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: That’s all.</span> <span id="s512">My son by then was two and a half years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Were there any other members of your family in the DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yes, all of my family who survived.</span> <span id="s515">They all went different places because my mother had sisters near Boston.</span> <span id="s516">She went there with my father and my younger brother.</span> <span id="s517">He was about sixteen years old then.</span> <span id="s518">They went to Haverhill, Mass.</span> <span id="s519">And stayed there.</span> <span id="s520">My other brother went to New York.</span> <span id="s521">We came here to Dayton.</span> <span id="s522">We settled here and my husband worked for a company here in Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: So one of your husband’s uncles lived here?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Did you live with them at first, or were you able to set up housekeeping?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: We lived with them for a month or two.</span> <span id="s527">You couldn’t find any apartments in 1949, particularly if you had a boy not yet three years old.</span> <span id="s528">You just couldn’t get any apartments.</span> <span id="s529">At least that is what they said.</span> <span id="s530">Particularly with a young boy, you couldn’t get an apartment for any money.</span> <span id="s531">So the uncle found an apartment for us in the East end of town.</span> <span id="s532">We lived there for over three years, then we came over here.</span> <span id="s533">My husband passed away in 1975.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: What work did your husband do?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: He was in business for himself.</span> <span id="s536">First he was in business with his uncle buying some scrap metal and some paper.</span> <span id="s537">They bought, and sold that.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: What were your first impressions of America?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: We had a good impression.</span> <span id="s540">It is a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s541">It has been nice and friendly to our family and we have enjoyed it for years.</span> <span id="s542">That was so especially after what we had to go through.</span> <span id="s543">If I stay with you the entire night, I can’t finish about it.</span> <span id="s544">We were at the pool, just last Sunday, with my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s545">I started telling her stories about what went on in the forest when we had blockades (that was when the Germans took one section or the other of the forest and surrounded it with troops and searched through that section for runaways and shot those they found, on the spot).</span> <span id="s546">How the Germans used to come and how we used to run.</span> <span id="s547">How many days we were without food, because we couldn’t go to the farmers.</span> <span id="s548">You know that there is more to it than what I can tell you just here, because if I tell you for two days and two nights, I still wouldn’t be able to tell you all we went through, and what we have seen.</span> <span id="s549">How the Russian soldiers killed and how they were sadistic and how the skin was on the dead people.</span> <span id="s550">How the Germans said: “Another one is gone and another one.”</span> <span id="s551">They were just killing people like nobody’s business.</span> <span id="s552">It would be hard to truly tell what we went through and what we have seen.</span> <span id="s553">I was in a blockade when the Germans surrounded the forest.</span> <span id="s554">I was laying there with a woman.</span> <span id="s555">She bent my head down…it was not a big forest because we could hear how they were coming through the village.</span> <span id="s556">We were hiding in a little forest with a couple of sick people, or rather wounded, because they had gotten shot.</span> <span id="s557">I could see the Germans clearly like, from here to the street.</span> <span id="s558">So this woman bent down my head so that he couldn’t see us.</span> <span id="s559">Later on she got killed where we were laying.</span> <span id="s560">It was just a matter of luck, it was the way my head was down.</span> <span id="s561">They were just going through the forest to look for everybody.</span> <span id="s562">So, if we would tell all what we have seen, all what we have gone through, all the scares, it would be too much.</span> <span id="s563">As I told my sister-in-law last Sunday, it is impossible to realize what we went through; we can’t believe that it has really happened.</span> <span id="s564">They would just kill people because they were alive.</span> <span id="s565">If there was something they didn’t like, they would just kill people.</span> <span id="s566">They burned villages.</span> <span id="s567">The villagers were not Jews; they just burned them.</span> <span id="s568">They told everyone to leave their houses for work and the people never returned home.</span> <span id="s569">When we went to the villages to find some food, you found the potatoes burned.</span> <span id="s570">Considering how little they were, there was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s571">For three days we had no food, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s572">When we went to the villages, the people had all been killed.</span> <span id="s573">They just killed.</span> <span id="s574">To them, it was just a game, just like kids do at a playground.</span> <span id="s575">In the town, there had been maybe 30,000 to 40,000 people and they killed just a lot of people, including non-Jews.</span> <span id="s576">And burned them.</span> <span id="s577">They burned every house in that town.</span> <span id="s578">The houses where we used to live, my sister’s house had been next to ours, were just leveled.</span> <span id="s579">We couldn’t even recognize where or homes had been.</span> <span id="s580">It was a war which concerned all the people.</span> <span id="s581">If you haven’t seen it you can’t believe all that went on.</span> <span id="s582">They picked people up like here, in a square, and they told them to lay down, an they shot, they just started shooting</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: You mentioned while you were talking that you wondered if there wasn’t someone out there who knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s584">Did you feel that sometime the Russians, or someone else, would come back and would prevent this from happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: We didn’t think that anybody would stop it because when we had seen all the machinery, and all the trucks and all the cars, all the tanks, all the ammunition which the Germans had.</span> <span id="s586">Seeing all of that we thought that nobody would be able to stop them.</span> <span id="s587">They just are going to kill everyone, and that is all there is to it.</span> <span id="s588">They were going at it day and night, with the heavy artillery and the heavy machinery.</span> <span id="s589">The tanks and all that made us feel that there was nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s590">We just wanted to know if anybody would report what was going on, if anybody would stop to see what went on.</span> <span id="s591">We were wondering about that because they were killing everyone.</span> <span id="s592">There was just no answer.</span> <span id="s593">Doctors, lawyers, beautiful people of all kinds were being killed.</span> <span id="s594">I was a young girl at the time, I was not important to the state of things, but doctors, lawyers, professional people, all beautiful people, nice ones with money and everything, they told them to lay down and just killed them for nothing.</span> <span id="s595">They killed just because they found people who were alive.</span> <span id="s596">They just killed, that is all, because they wanted to.</span> <span id="s597">They even killed all the Russian soldiers whom they captured (that is what drove the Russians in the forest and started the Partisan movement).</span> <span id="s598">They picked the Russian soldiers up and used their ammunition on them.</span> <span id="s599">You could see how they had the skeletons on the trucks, you know on the wagons.</span> <span id="s600">They did not feed them, but starved them.</span> <span id="s601">Some of them, they shot, and some of them they starved until they died of hunger.</span> <span id="s602">We felt that people were doomed and that there was no end to it.</span> <span id="s603">They came in shooting and killing and that is just what they did, until they got out of the city.</span> <span id="s604">They burned the entire city and burned everyone in it.</span> <span id="s605">When we came back, there were a few people left in the entire town.</span> <span id="s606">There was no house which had a place where you could sleep or anything else.</span> <span id="s607">When my father got back there was one barn left.</span> <span id="s608">We stayed in this barn until we fixed up one house which used to be on the outskirts of town.</span> <span id="s609">We fixed it up and we stayed there until we left.</span> <span id="s610">We didn’t want to live in a town where all that was left were rats running around.</span> <span id="s611">They had so many rats because they never buried the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: You said that your mother would not eat anything that was not kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: So, there was some sense of religion still in all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yes, my mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s616">I have witnesses here who were in the forest with my mother, they are people who survived.</span> <span id="s617">I was just talking last Sunday about the fact that my mother would not eat anything.</span> <span id="s618">We begged her and we tried because we knew that she couldn’t survive if we had to hide or run, or something.</span> <span id="s619">She was not regaining her strength, she was so weak.</span> <span id="s620">My father begged her because he said: “I cannot carry her all the time.”</span> <span id="s621">She tried a few times but she said: “No!</span> <span id="s622">I rather die than to eat anything that is not kosher.”</span> <span id="s623">Of course she would eat potatoes and bread.</span> <span id="s624">My father and brother and husband and other young boys would bring food for her.</span> <span id="s625">She had her own little pot and what she would do would be to cook for herself.</span> <span id="s626">She would put her food into this little pot, and that is all she would eat.</span> <span id="s627">We were young at the time, we would eat whatever we could.</span> <span id="s628">Still, I cried the first time when I ate something which I was not supposed to eat.</span> <span id="s629">Then, we younger people just adjusted ourselves to a different life.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q; Were there any other kinds of religious observances?</span> <span id="s631">Did you manage to light candles, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: No, we didn’t have any candles.</span> <span id="s633">All we did was to prepare the best way we could for a Holy Day like Passover.</span> <span id="s634">I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s635">We got flour and we just baked matzos.</span> <span id="s636">You know, we had plenty of wood for baking.</span> <span id="s637">Of course, it was hard to start a fire.</span> <span id="s638">Not everybody could do it.</span> <span id="s639">There were some young boys who ran away.</span> <span id="s640">We would find them in the woods.</span> <span id="s641">They were hiding.</span> <span id="s642">They came from different towns.</span> <span id="s643">Our boys took them in and some of these young boys are in Israel now.</span> <span id="s644">They used to light a fire for my mother, she got some flour and that is what she ate.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: So you tried to eat something else?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Sure, I tried.</span> <span id="s647">The rest of the young people didn’t care as long as they could get something to eat, they could survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Were you able to worship in any way in the DP camps at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: In the DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Was there a service available to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: No, I don’t think that there was any worship there.</span> <span id="s652">I just don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: So really you didn’t have a temple to join until you came to Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: That’s for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Was that one of the first things you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Sure, we came especially to our uncle here, in Dayton.</span> <span id="s657">We arrived here in August so the Holy Days were upon us.</span> <span id="s658">He belonged here to Beth Jacob Synagogue, and he got us in there and that is where we belong since we came here.</span> <span id="s659">I belong there and so do my boys.</span> <span id="s660">My husband is buried in their cemetery.</span> <span id="s661">My husband passed away when he was 55 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: That was very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s664">It happened.</span> <span id="s665">He was always very concerned because he was the only survivor of his family.</span> <span id="s666">There was not another survivor of his family.</span> <span id="s667">He was the only one.</span> <span id="s668">He was a very good person and he always worried because everybody was dead, from that beautiful, young family.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: You think that that was some of the stress he felt from losing his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Oh sure, that is something he could never forget.</span> <span id="s671">When everybody in Germany applied for this Wiedergutmachung (the compensation which was made available as compensation for the crimes of the Nazis, The State of Israel was declared as the heir of last resort for those who did not survive)…they called him about it.</span> <span id="s672">He said that he was not going to apply for it, and he never did apply, because he said: “They are not going to pay me for my mother and father and my brothers and sister.”</span> <span id="s673">He never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: He just never did?</span> <span id="s675">He just didn’t want the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No I could apply for it today and it would be kind of handy for me; but he never wanted to apply.</span> <span id="s677">That was his idea.</span> <span id="s678">It would be nice to have such a sum.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: So you always have been a member of Beth Jacob?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: I am curious about some of the changes which Beth Jacob has incorporated over the years.</span> <span id="s682">It was Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: It is still Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: I thought that they were calling themselves “traditional” now?</span> <span id="s685">Does that have any special meaning for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A; I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: I was wondering because in the old days you couldn’t drive at all to Beth Jacob, now you just about have to (it is now located fairly far north of the City of Dayton).</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: They are not allowed to drive, but what can you do if you live further.</span> <span id="s689">(Distances were obviously known before the new Sanctuary and parking lot were built).</span> <span id="s690">I have here a cousin of mine who is very religious.</span> <span id="s691">He used to walk to services.</span> <span id="s692">Now he fell and he broke his knee and he can’t walk.</span> <span id="s693">He was walking because he was religious.</span> <span id="s694">Not everybody can walk.</span> <span id="s695">Many people don’t want to do that anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Do you keep kosher at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: I keep half in half.</span> <span id="s698">I buy kosher meat.</span> <span id="s699">I just prepare some dishes.</span> <span id="s700">I don’t know, when the war started, and since then we have lived through so much, I was close to my mother and she was keeping her eye on me about it.</span> <span id="s701">I still couldn’t be 100% after the war.</span> <span id="s702">So I got away from a lot of things and I just couldn’t go back to them, the way my mother wanted me to.</span> <span id="s703">I don’t know, after seeing what happened to people and now, what is going on, I just don’t believe in a lot of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Did it change your belief in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Yes, it changed a lot.</span> <span id="s706">I talked to a woman when I was in Poland yet, and they were killing everybody.</span> <span id="s707">They had just killed our Rabbi’s two daughters.</span> <span id="s708">They were beautiful girls.</span> <span id="s709">I said to this woman: “Where is God?”</span> <span id="s710">Then she answered: “I don’t know.</span> <span id="s711">How can God see this what is going on.</span> <span id="s712">Why would he allow the killing of such two beautiful girls…they are innocent and religious and everything.”</span> <span id="s713">This woman was very religious, always.</span> <span id="s714">So I said: “Here are beautiful girls, religious girls and they are the first ones they killed.”</span> <span id="s715">She said: “Maybe they killed them because they shouldn’t suffer.”</span> <span id="s716">That was her answer.</span> <span id="s717">So once you go away a little of what is going on you just can’t believe that there is a God.</span> <span id="s718">A lot of times, even the Germans said: “Where is your God?”</span> <span id="s719">You know people are people.</span> <span id="s720">Not even every German wanted to see what was going on, (the Nazi atrocities).</span> <span id="s721">I believe that because I have seen some very nice Germans who really believed that these things shouldn’t happen; they didn’t want to kill.</span> <span id="s722">The ones who did the killing were the SS (that is the black shirted SchutzStaffel who formed Hitler’s elite guard, manned the concentration camps and the behind-the-lines atrocities)…they belonged to the special SS units.</span> <span id="s723">They were the ones who killed more than anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Do you believe in God now?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: I know that there is somebody.</span> <span id="s726">I really don’t know if it’s God, but whoever it is, I believe that there is somebody who is doing all this pondering.</span> <span id="s727">Sometimes I think that there is no God.</span> <span id="s728">Here there is so much going on, that one wonders: “How can God see all this stuff.”</span> <span id="s729">Particularly what I have seen with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s730">Such as when my husband passed away so young and then I have a sick boy.</span> <span id="s731">I am trying to believe in this, but sometimes I ask: “Where is God?</span> <span id="s732">Where is God really?”</span> <span id="s733">You know that is quite a question because we had to go through so much.</span> <span id="s734">Still, I have to go through so much like losing my young husband after having gone through the war with him.</span> <span id="s735">It is not as if we did this for money or for something else to gain.</span> <span id="s736">We were both together during the whole war and he cared for me.</span> <span id="s737">That is the story which sometimes leads me to ask: “Where is God?”</span> <span id="s738">That is what we have seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: I think that this is a good place to stop.</span></p></body></html>
