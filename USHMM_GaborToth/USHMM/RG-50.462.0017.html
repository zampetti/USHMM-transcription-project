<p><span id="s18">Q:This is Eileen Steinberg interveiwing Herbert Lindemeyer December 6, 1983.</span> <span id="s19">Side 1.</span> <span id="s20">Please tell me where you were born and when and a little bit about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A:I was born in Minden, West Germany on March 11, 1922.</span> <span id="s22">My father was a pharmacist; he owned a pharmacy which he had bought in 1921.</span> <span id="s23">I had no brothers or sisters.</span> <span id="s24">Was an only child.</span> <span id="s25">I went to elementary school and then later on to High School in Germany.</span> <span id="s26">Everything seemed all right until about 1934 when the Nazis had been in power for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q:How was your life changed by the Nazi victories in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A:Considerably, especially in school as a matter of fact, for some reason one day just like a bolt out of the sky, my fellow students didn’t talk to me anymore.</span> <span id="s29">There was no fight or anything; there were some who belonged to the Hitler Youth and they told the others they weren’t allowed to talk to me, so I went to that school for two-and-one-half years.</span> <span id="s30">My parents pleaded with me to stick it out so that I would get my education.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q:What years were these?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A:That was 1934 until 1937, almost three years.</span> <span id="s33">There was no Jewish School in Minden so I stuck it out without any one of my fellow students ever saying a single word to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q:Must have been most difficult.</span> <span id="s35">Did your family experience anti-Semitism before the Hitler period?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q:Did your family belong to any Jewish organizations or to a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A:Yeah, they belonged to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s39">We had a small congregation, about 150 members.</span> <span id="s40">The city had about 30,000 population, so one synagogue was sufficient.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q:About how many Jewish people would you say were in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A:150.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q:That were in the synagogue, but I assume there were more than were in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A:No, everybody belonged, just about everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q:O.</span> <span id="s46">K.</span> <span id="s47">Did any of the men in your family serve in any national army?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A:My father was an officer in the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q:Was he wounded or...</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A:No, he wasn’t wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q:Do you remember how you and members of your family reacted to Hitler’s appointment as Chancellor in January of 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A:I remember my parents, they were very upset.</span> <span id="s53">I was at the time 11 years old and I wasn’t too concerned.</span> <span id="s54">I remember the Nazis marching and they had these torchlight parades which were frightening with their singing anti-Jewish songs, then when you are 11 years old it doesn’t concern you too much.</span> <span id="s55">But I remember that my parents and other members of my family, uncles and aunts, were very upset.</span> <span id="s56">They had meetings in our house, and at their houses, and there was tension.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q:You mentioned before that the children in school wouldn’t speak to you.</span> <span id="s58">When you were home, who did you play with as a child, just other Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A:Other Jewish children, yeah.</span> <span id="s60">Um hum.</span> <span id="s61">There were two or three, maybe four boys in my class who called me at night and said they were threatened, that they would like to talk to me but they couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s62">Four out of a class of 32.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q:Four had the courage enough to at least call you and but not to talk to you in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A:Four to call me, not talk in school, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q:All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A:And I later, much, much later, in fact when I came to the States, a cousin of mine told me that my parents had sent a bodyguard going to school and coming from school because they were afraid that I would be beaten and I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q:Were you the only Jewish student?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A:There was one other boy, he was a little younger and I think he, I started high school in ‘32 and he came in ‘33 or ‘34, so I wasn’t in the same class but he was in the same school with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q:I assume he was also ostracized in the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A:Yes, the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q:Did you have any contact or your family have any contact with the Council of German Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A:Yes, my father was a member of certain, well there was a Jewish, what was it called, Jewish I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q:Veteran.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A:Veteran, I guess Jewish Veteran School, yes.</span> <span id="s75">Jewish Veteran School, he was a member of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q:Were you affected by the boycott of April 1, 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A:Yes, definitely and not me personally, but my father had the pharmacy and the Nazis were standing in front of it and not letting any customers in.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q:None at all, not even Jewish customers?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A:None at all.</span> <span id="s80">Well you could have forced your way in but nobody did and by then many Jews on that particular date, Jews didn’t go outside.</span> <span id="s81">It was April 1, everybody knew that all the stores were boycotted and nobody went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q:What did your father do then, if he wasn’t able to earn a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A:He was able to earn a living, until the Nuremberg Laws came out in 1935, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q:Right.</span> <span id="s85">I was going to ask you about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A:Until that time he was able to keep the pharmacy and he made a decent living.</span> <span id="s87">And if he hadn’t, he probably would have emigrated.</span> <span id="s88">This way he said, “If I emigrate I have to learn another language.</span> <span id="s89">Here I can still make a living, and how long can the Nazi government last?</span> <span id="s90">Another year or two and we can stick it out.”</span> <span id="s91">And he wasn’t the only one who felt that way.</span> <span id="s92">There were thousands who felt the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q:During this early period, did you or any members of your family discuss the possibility of leaving at all or your father himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A:My mother was in favor; my father was definitely against it.</span> <span id="s95">He said, “There is still time, after all, this is the country of the old familiar things—Goethe and Schiller and Beethoven—and they wouldn’t do anything to us.</span> <span id="s96">All right, it is tough right now, but how long can it last?”</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q:How were you affected by the Nuremberg Laws, and did you think that this would be the worst that you would have to endure?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A:I personally wasn’t affected.</span> <span id="s99">My parents were there.</span> <span id="s100">He had to give up his pharmacy.</span> <span id="s101">They didn’t take it away immediately.</span> <span id="s102">He had to employ somebody who would run the pharmacy and he was only allowed to help out occasionally.</span> <span id="s103">Because, the reason they said was he could poison the German people by selling them poison instead of drugs and medicines.</span> <span id="s104">But that only lasted for, I think another two years, and after that he was forced to sell the pharmacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q:How did you live after you had to sell the pharmacy?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A:This only came up in 1938, after the famous Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s107">Then he was forced to sell the pharmacy.</span> <span id="s108">Until then he had rented it.</span> <span id="s109">And he got a, I guess it was a fairly decent amount of money, so we could live.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q:During the period from ‘33 to ‘38, did you or your family have any contact with non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A:Some.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q:O.</span> <span id="s113">K., what kind of contact, and how would you describe their behavior?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A:Well, some people came to visit us.</span> <span id="s115">We had a maid until 1936; well she got married and she left voluntarily.</span> <span id="s116">In fact, she, I am still in contact with her today.</span> <span id="s117">She is an old lady now.</span> <span id="s118">But people like that were in contact with us and there was a neighbor’s boy who was a little older than I was; he came to see me, and at least for another year or so.</span> <span id="s119">His father was a policeman and he also was forced to break off all contact with our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q:But they were basically the only non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A:They were basically decent people and there were decent people; because if they were not, all Jews would have been killed in 1933 and ‘34.</span> <span id="s122">There were, I will admit there were basic, a lot of basically decent people.</span> <span id="s123">Not, I wouldn’t say the majority but...</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q:Some.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A:Some.</span> <span id="s126">But many were afraid.</span> <span id="s127">One of my neighbors worked for the Post Office.</span> <span id="s128">She didn’t dare to talk to us because it was a government job and she would have been fired immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q:What happened to your family during Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A:I wasn’t home that night.</span> <span id="s131">I was in a different town.</span> <span id="s132">I went to a trade school.</span> <span id="s133">My father was arrested and sent to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q:Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A:Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s136">And I got a phone call that night and I went home.</span> <span id="s137">My mother asked me to come home immediately and I did.</span> <span id="s138">And my father was in Buchenwald until December—about four or five weeks.</span> <span id="s139">And then he was released because he was a war veteran.</span> <span id="s140">He had the Iron Cross.</span> <span id="s141">And after so many weeks they were all released; all those who had the Iron Cross and were war veterans were released because they couldn’t have kept them forever; they weren’t prepared for it at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q:The numbers at that time.</span> <span id="s143">Did your father talk about his experience?</span> <span id="s144">How was he treated?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A:Not to me.</span> <span id="s146">Because, well I was 16.</span> <span id="s147">I was old enough but he was afraid that I would spill the beans somehow, but I heard when my parents were talking.</span> <span id="s148">He was in sad shape when he came home.</span> <span id="s149">And I am sure he was beaten.</span> <span id="s150">I don’t know, I can’t be sure, but it very much looked like it and it took him quite a while to recover after he came home.</span> <span id="s151">Because it was winter time and I remember his feet were frostbitten, and for several weeks after he was released he was not in good shape.</span> <span id="s152">And then he was more or less convinced there was no future and he took steps to emigrate.</span> <span id="s153">But by that time it was too late.</span> <span id="s154">I know for to get an American visa or American papers in January, there was a waiting list.</span> <span id="s155">The government let, the U.S. government let in, I forget the exact number, 5,000 or 8,000 people a year, and I still remember our number: it was 44,444, so I can never forget that number.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q:You didn’t have much chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A:It would have taken until 1950 or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q:To get out with that number.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A:To get out with that number.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q:O.</span> <span id="s161">K., you said your father sold the pharmacy in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A:Yes, he was forced to.</span> <span id="s163">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q:And what did you do then, is that the time that you left to go to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A:No that was a little later.</span> <span id="s166">I went back to the trade school in Frankfurt after my father was released and then we took steps for me to emigrate and I got the visa to go to England in June 1939 and then I got prepared and emigrated finally on the 9th of August 1939, three weeks before the Second World War started in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q:That’s when the Germans, Germany invaded Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A:Yes, on the first of September.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q:O.</span> <span id="s170">K., that’s the time that you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s172">Um hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q:But your parents remained.</span> <span id="s174">Did they stay in the same town and in the same place?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A:They stayed in the same town and same apartment.</span> <span id="s176">They had to take in another Jewish family and they had to sell some of the furniture.</span> <span id="s177">The money that was paid for the pharmacy never got into my father’s hands because it was confiscated by the government and he was given a pitiful sum every month to live on.</span> <span id="s178">I don’t know how much but it was all that he was allowed to have.</span> <span id="s179">The rest was confiscated.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q:After you were separated from your family, when you left to go, were you able to remain in contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A:Well, for about three weeks there was no war yet.</span> <span id="s182">I wrote to them and then the war started and I had an aunt in Switzerland so I wrote to her and she forwarded the letters from Switzerland to Germany and my parents sent mail to Switzerland and then on to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q:How long were you able to keep in touch with them like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A:I’d say about six months, eight months.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q:All right, how did you learn what eventually happened to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A:I got a Red Cross letter, yes I remember now, a Red Cross letter from my parents.</span> <span id="s187">They wrote from Riga that they were living in Riga now.</span> <span id="s188">I think they used the word “living” or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q:But you understood what they meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A:Right.</span> <span id="s191">And I knew there was a concentration camp there.</span> <span id="s192">And they wrote that they are fine and, whatever that meant, and then shortly thereafter in, for a while I didn’t hear anything because I myself was interned in England so we couldn’t receive much mail in the internment camp.</span> <span id="s193">After I was released, I remember in March, 1942, I learned that my mother had died first and then shortly thereafter, my father died.</span> <span id="s194">So they must have died sometime in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q:Who gave you the information?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A:An uncle of mine was in, he was in Theresienstadt [Terezin, -ed.]</span> <span id="s197">, another camp.</span> <span id="s198">And they wrote to me that my father and mother had died.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q:How did they know?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A:I am not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q:Because they were in a different camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A:That’s right and it was my mother’s sister and I really don’t know how they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q:Did your uncle survive Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q:Did not survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q:Now you mentioned that you were interned when you were in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q:You arrived in England in...</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A:In ‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q:In ‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A:August ‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q:O.</span> <span id="s214">K., tell me about what happened from the time you arrived, what you did and tell me about being interned?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A:I got a trainee permit to work in, permit to work in a factory in Oxford, England.</span> <span id="s216">And I worked there for about ten months until June 25, 1940.</span> <span id="s217">It was a decent job.</span> <span id="s218">I got paid reasonably well, and I lived with an English family and I did fairly well and in June 1940, when after France, Holland and Belgium had fallen, the British government got panicky—which I can understand, many people refuse to allow that—and at least 25,000 or 35,000 refugees were interned.</span> <span id="s219">Men and women, mostly men but some women also.</span> <span id="s220">And some were sent to Australia, some were sent to Canada.</span> <span id="s221">Under horrible conditions.</span> <span id="s222">The soldiers that guarded the prisoners, so-called prisoners on the ships thought they were all Nazis.</span> <span id="s223">There were some German prisoners of war, they all put together with the refugees.</span> <span id="s224">And they were not treated well at all; in fact after the war there was an investigation in the House of Parliament in England and some officers were sent to jail, as far as I know.</span> <span id="s225">One ship was torpedoed by the Germans and several hundred people died.</span> <span id="s226">The German prisoners of war were on top of the ship on the main deck; the Jewish prisoners were not under the Red Cross protection and they were down in the hold and most of them drowned or at least many of them drowned.</span> <span id="s227">The ship was called the Andrea Doria.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q:Oh, for, no not the Andrea Doria because the Andrea Doria, I remember when that...</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A:No wrong.</span> <span id="s230">That, excuse me.</span> <span id="s231">It was called the Andora Star.</span> <span id="s232">I always get them mixed up, the Andora Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q:O.</span> <span id="s234">K.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A:It was sunk by German U-Boats.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q:How were you, yourself treated when you were interned?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A:I was treated well.</span> <span id="s238">We were, the first couple of weeks, I’d say the first, yeah the first two weeks, there was complete confusion, they weren’t prepared to receive tens of thousands of prisoners, and there was little food.</span> <span id="s239">But after about two weeks it was straightened out.</span> <span id="s240">There were very primitive conditions, but we were treated well.</span> <span id="s241">I wasn’t one of those who were sent to Australia or Canada.</span> <span id="s242">We were sent to the Isle of Man.</span> <span id="s243">Those people who went to Canada and Australia went to the Isle of Man first and then when more people came they were shipped out and we took over the Isle of Man.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q:And that’s where you stayed the entire time?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A:Yes for 18 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q:18 months.</span> <span id="s247">What did you do while you were there?</span> <span id="s248">Were you just a prisoner, were you given any kind of work to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A:Yes, we built an airport in the Isle of Man, and we got paid for that.</span> <span id="s250">We laid cables and dug ditches and it was hard work but at least we did something.</span> <span id="s251">We weren’t forced to, it was strictly voluntary.</span> <span id="s252">And the camp was pretty well-organized; later on we could take courses in English, shorthand, bookkeeping and engineering.</span> <span id="s253">We had all kinds of people in there.</span> <span id="s254">After all, these refugees came from Austria, from Germany.</span> <span id="s255">We had composers, we had movie actors, we had engineers, we had professors.</span> <span id="s256">Famous professors, in fact.</span> <span id="s257">We had very famous musicians, authors, people from all kinds of backgrounds.</span> <span id="s258">And you could keep yourself busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q:While you were on the Isle of Man did you know what was going on in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A:Very, very little.</span> <span id="s261">We had no radios; we were not allowed to have radios.</span> <span id="s262">And in the beginning, the first several weeks we weren’t allowed to have papers.</span> <span id="s263">And in fact we expected to wake up one morning and have the Germans stand guard instead of the British Army because we had no idea.</span> <span id="s264">People told us the Germans had landed in Ireland—we could see the coast of Ireland from the Isle of Man—and there were rumors that the Germans had landed and the next step would be the Isle of Man.</span> <span id="s265">Of course that never happened but...we were scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q:So you really didn’t know what was going on while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q:You told me you were on the Isle of Man for 18 months.</span> <span id="s269">When were you and how were you finally released?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A:The British government published a white paper which had 15 or maybe 25 categories under which refugees could be released.</span> <span id="s271">One of them was finding a job in defense work, which was relatively easy; after all it was war time and judges or people who had law degrees were released, doctors for military hospitals, and there were many, many categories which most of them escape me.</span> <span id="s272">And I found a job or I was asked by a defense factory to apply for the job.</span> <span id="s273">As a matter of fact, the man took 15 or even maybe more than 15 from the Isle of Man and employed them in a factory.</span> <span id="s274">He happened to be a German Jew, who had emigrated in the 1920’s and was of course, a citizen by that time.</span> <span id="s275">And he owned the factory and he, I am sorry to say, used us.</span> <span id="s276">He paid us minimum wages and we really had to work very hard there.</span> <span id="s277">Which wasn’t bad, but he didn’t feel for us; there were no promotions; we did the lowest jobs.</span> <span id="s278">Somehow I feel he basically hated us.</span> <span id="s279">Maybe he was a Jewish anti-Semite or I don’t know what made him click.</span> <span id="s280">And I worked there for a year-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s281">As a matter of fact, he, when we arrived there, the first day of work he called us in his office and said, “Gentlemen, don’t think you can use me as a springboard.</span> <span id="s282">You are like in a mousetrap.</span> <span id="s283">I got you out of the Isle of Man and I trap you here, and as long as the war lasts, you cannot get out.</span> <span id="s284">Don’t try to find another job somewhere else.”</span> <span id="s285">And that was it.</span> <span id="s286">We were stuck.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q:Sounds like a wonderful fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A:Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q:So eventually, when did you leave him?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A:The war ended in ‘45, May ‘45.</span> <span id="s291">And then things became a little easier as far as leaving the job was concerned.</span> <span id="s292">Although we were still restricted, we couldn’t just leave.</span> <span id="s293">So I heard of an opportunity to join the American Army as an interpreter and mail censor—to be sent to Germany to censor mail and listen to telephone calls with the Occupation Army.</span> <span id="s294">I applied for the job, passed several fairly tough tests, and was accepted.</span> <span id="s295">So I went to my lovely boss and told him I was leaving next week.</span> <span id="s296">He said, “You can’t do that.</span> <span id="s297">I told you you are trapped here.</span> <span id="s298">You need permission.”</span> <span id="s299">I said, “I have permission.</span> <span id="s300">Here it is.</span> <span id="s301">I am joining the army.”</span> <span id="s302">And he had to let me go.</span> <span id="s303">And that was in October ‘41.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q:‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A:Excuse me.</span> <span id="s306">October ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q:O.</span> <span id="s308">K.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A:October ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q:While you were working in this factory, with this man, where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A:The Jewish Committee in Manchester, that’s where the job was, arranged for us to live in a hostel.</span> <span id="s312">It was called a youth hostel, although there were older people there also.</span> <span id="s313">And as soon as I was released from the Isle of Man I headed for that hostel and lived there for a year-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s314">My wife lived there also; as a matter of fact, that’s where we met.</span> <span id="s315">It was in December ‘41.</span> <span id="s316">I worked in this defense plant until September ‘45.</span> <span id="s317">And in the meantime we got married and that was in 1944, the 2nd of January 1944, to be exact.</span> <span id="s318">We found an apartment, lived in that apartment, and after the war finally ended in May, I tried to get out of the factory, although it was difficult at the time.</span> <span id="s319">It was still war power acts in force, and it wasn’t easy to leave the job.</span> <span id="s320">So I finally heard about the opportunity to join the American Army as an interpreter and the mail censor and go to Germany with the Occupation Army.</span> <span id="s321">So I applied for the job, passed several tests, and was accepted, and quit the job at the defense plant and went to Germany in November 1945.</span> <span id="s322">My wife couldn’t go with me at the time, because they didn’t take married couples, but she was able to follow me three months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q:On her own?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A:On her own.</span> <span id="s325">Um hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q:O.</span> <span id="s327">K., tell us about your work when you went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s328">Did you work together, or were you working separately?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A:The first four weeks she was in a different location but she got a transfer and then we had a nice little apartment in Germany in a military compound.</span> <span id="s330">We censored mail, mostly German mail, but also some army mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q:Mail coming from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A:Coming from all over the world and going all over.</span> <span id="s333">Not all mail was censored, only about 10%.</span> <span id="s334">There were 15,000 people working in our division.</span> <span id="s335">We had to report many different things; black market activities, Nazis living in hiding—we caught quite a few.</span> <span id="s336">We had a so-called “watch list” with thousands of names of known Nazis, either living in hiding or trying to hide and one of them, I remember quite clearly, was Werner Von Braun, who in the meantime had gone to the United States to work on the rocket program.</span> <span id="s337">Every letter he sent and every letter he received was censored by us.</span> <span id="s338">We had many others.</span> <span id="s339">We weren’t allowed to read the top Nazis’ mail; they had their own censorship, those who were indicted in Nuremberg at the time.</span> <span id="s340">There were several officers who did that themselves; we didn’t read their mail.</span> <span id="s341">But it was interesting work.</span> <span id="s342">And it was rewarding to catch a few Nazis here and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q:I would imagine.</span> <span id="s344">You said you lost your parents in the war.</span> <span id="s345">Did you lose any other members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A:About 50.</span> <span id="s347">Uncles, Cousins, Aunts.</span> <span id="s348">I had no brothers and sisters, as I said, but I counted once and there were about 50 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q:Did you ever go back to the town where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A:Definitely, several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q:Tell us the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A:I have very good friends who still live in Minden.</span> <span id="s353">This one man who is approximately my age, his father was not Jewish, his mother is Jewish.</span> <span id="s354">He was brought up Jewish.</span> <span id="s355">He lived in hiding during the war and I immediately contacted him when I got to Germany and I went to see him and his mother.</span> <span id="s356">At that time his father was alive too.</span> <span id="s357">As a matter of fact, his mother is still alive.</span> <span id="s358">She is 92 today.</span> <span id="s359">His father died about 15 years ago.</span> <span id="s360">We were welcomed with open arms, of course.</span> <span id="s361">I am still in contact with him.</span> <span id="s362">I saw him five years ago and we are planning to go again to see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q:I understand you went back to the pharmacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A:I went back to the pharmacy my father owned at the time; when I was in American uniform, of course.</span> <span id="s365">I walked into the pharmacy, the man saw me, the owner at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q:Who had bought the pharmacy?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A:Who had bought the pharmacy and he had known me practically from the day I was born because he worked for my father.</span> <span id="s368">He got as white as a sheet; he was afraid he was going to lose...</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Tape 1 of 1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q:This is Eileen Steinberg interviewing Herbert Lindemeyer December 6, 1983, side two.</span> <span id="s371">The man saw you and what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A:He turned white and I said, “Mr. Foss I am going into your office.”</span> <span id="s373">He said, “I come right with you.</span> <span id="s374">I am busy but I come right with you.”</span> <span id="s375">He followed me, white as a sheet, and told me that he was happy to see me; I doubt it very much.</span> <span id="s376">[laughter] And I will say he was a decent man all his life.</span> <span id="s377">He never did anything to my father; he was forced to take over the pharmacy.</span> <span id="s378">He did it willingly, of course, but I wouldn’t say he was an anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s379">As a matter of fact, he had some very important papers which he had hidden and he gave to me to help me to get some restitution from Germany.</span> <span id="s380">So I can honestly say that he was pretty much on my side.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q:Um hum.</span> <span id="s382">But he was certainly surprised to see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A:Yes, he was.</span> <span id="s384">He had no idea that I had emigrated, where I was, he didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q:Was it when you got back to Germany after the war that you found out what had happened to the different members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s387">I found out some of it in England already before I came to Germany but...</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q:Do you remember when you first heard that the Jews were being murdered in mass numbers and being gassed?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q:And did you believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A:Probably after I was released from the Isle of Man, but I am not sure.</span> <span id="s392">There were stories in the paper, but they weren’t confirmed and we didn’t really know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q:Did you believe the stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A:Yes, having known the Nazis I believed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q:Did you have any contact with any of your family or friends in Germany between 1942 and 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A:None at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q:Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A:I couldn’t write and when the United States got in the war and there was nobody else contacting anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q:You were alone; you were a young man alone by yourself without any of your family, in a different country.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A:Um hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q:Where did you learn to speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A:I had private lessons in Germany before I emigrated, by an English lady.</span> <span id="s403">She taught me and...</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q:Was this in preparation for you going to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A:In preparation, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q:O.</span> <span id="s407">K.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A:And the lady I came to in England was a school teacher and she helped me quite a bit.</span> <span id="s409">She corrected me and she gave me lessons and was very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q:Tell me about the woman that you first went to live with when you went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A:She was an elderly lady, an ex-schoolteacher, who was a Quaker, and she got me out of Germany, got all the papers for me.</span> <span id="s412">I hadn’t known her at all.</span> <span id="s413">She was a complete stranger to me, but she was helpful to many, many refugees.</span> <span id="s414">I think she personally got out about six or seven.</span> <span id="s415">She wasn’t a rich lady but she helped out when she could.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q:There were some good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A:Yes, there were, quite a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q:Were you able to maintain any kind of Jewish identity while you were in England, able to join a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A:They had synagogues and the refugees were allowed to join without paying.</span> <span id="s420">But there was not too much time.</span> <span id="s421">We worked, there was a curfew and we worked six and one-half days or six days at least and there wasn’t too much time for free time.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q:Did you feel strengthened in your experiences by your religious base?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A:I can’t say that.</span> <span id="s424">Maybe in the beginning.</span> <span id="s425">I was young, but as I grew older I don’t think that it helped at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q:You mentioned before that you went back to Minden and you visited the pharmacy where your, that your father had owned.</span> <span id="s427">Where did you stay when you went back to Minden?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A:Well, the first time I was able to travel in Germany after all the destruction, the railways started to run again, was about September 1946.</span> <span id="s429">And I made it a point to go to Minden.</span> <span id="s430">I stayed in the local hotel and contacted my friend.</span> <span id="s431">Since Minden was a small town, and my father had a pharmacy, he was well-known in Minden, and the word spread like wildfire that I was in Minden.</span> <span id="s432">And amazingly enough, I would say about ten people came to the hotel and told me that they had seen my parents the night before they were deported.</span> <span id="s433">Which was an obvious lie, because they wouldn’t have dared to.</span> <span id="s434">They told me all kinds of stories; they brought my parents potatoes and all kinds of things and then the pay-off, of course, was that I could give them some money or some food or, that’s all they wanted.</span> <span id="s435">As I said, at least ten people who came.</span> <span id="s436">And, “I was always your best friend,” “I was always your father’s best friend,” and...</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q:These were all the people who wouldn’t talk to you when you lived there before?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A:Exactly.</span> <span id="s439">One interesting thing is I found out, of my class of 32, and I am in that age group, they are all people who had to go into the army, 18, 19 years old.</span> <span id="s440">Of my class of 32, five are left today.</span> <span id="s441">Including myself.</span> <span id="s442">The others all died, either on the Russian front or on the western front.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q:You said your wife was able to join you a little while after you went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s444">Did you work together at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A:We worked together, um hum.</span> <span id="s446">For the first two or three months, she was at a different location, but then she was transferred and we were stationed in one place.</span> <span id="s447">Had a very nice apartment.</span> <span id="s448">I must say it was a very good time; we were the conquering heroes at the time.</span> <span id="s449">And I wouldn’t call it revenge, but it made you feel good when you saw the Germans crawl and you were the conqueror.</span> <span id="s450">Maybe it is not the right attitude to have, but you can’t help but feel good.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q:I can understand it.</span> <span id="s452">So you arrived back in Germany November ‘45 and how long did you stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A:Two-and-one-half years.</span> <span id="s454">Just about two-and-one-half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q:And then where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A:Then we went back to England because we felt it was time to make a living because we made an excellent living in Germany with the Occupation Army.</span> <span id="s457">We were extremely well paid.</span> <span id="s458">Everything was done for us; we had a maid; we had our shoes shined every day.</span> <span id="s459">The laundry was taken care of.</span> <span id="s460">The cooking was done for us.</span> <span id="s461">We lived like kings.</span> <span id="s462">And we figured, well, let’s not look for another job; we could have found another job with the Occupation Army, but we figured it was time to either start a family or at least start to make a living and go to the States, as we had planned all the time.</span> <span id="s463">So we first had to go back to England and applied for a visa to go to America, which came within a couple of months.</span> <span id="s464">At that time it was very easy because the German quota was not filled.</span> <span id="s465">And in June 1948, we left for New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q:Did you have any family here when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A:Yes, I have several uncles and aunts and quite a few cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q:So you went to New York first and how soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A:No, we went immediately to Philadelphia; my uncle and aunt lived in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q:So you came here right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A:We rented an apartment; our first apartment was in Logan.</span> <span id="s472">We lived there for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q:And then you started your new life here.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A:And we started our new life here, and it wasn’t easy to find a job at that time.</span> <span id="s475">It was ‘48.</span> <span id="s476">The boys came back from the army and...</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q:Everyone was looking for a job.</span> <span id="s478">Is that when you went back to school to Temple?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A:Shortly thereafter.</span> <span id="s480">First I had to make a living somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q:What did you do when you first went to work here in Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A:The very first job was in a gas station.</span> <span id="s483">At 59th and Lancaster.</span> <span id="s484">And that was another one of those jobs that used you, paid you the absolute minimum.</span> <span id="s485">I made $5.00 a day working from 7:00 in the morning until 10:00 at night.</span> <span id="s486">No overtime.</span> <span id="s487">I didn’t last too long.</span> <span id="s488">And then I got another job in a lampshade factory on Arch Street, and that man greeted me by saying: “Are you a German Jew?”</span> <span id="s489">I said, “Yes, I am.”</span> <span id="s490">He was a Russian Jew.</span> <span id="s491">He said, “I don’t like the German Jews; they don’t want to work.”</span> <span id="s492">And I told him, “Listen, I came to the United States to start a new life, to start a family and I want to work and give me a chance, will you,” and he did.</span> <span id="s493">But he again used me.</span> <span id="s494">He promised me a raise within a couple of weeks I guess, and then he didn’t come through with it and it came because it was a union job and he can’t pay me more.</span> <span id="s495">He also paid me $5.00 a day.</span> <span id="s496">And then little by little, I did a job which I hated.</span> <span id="s497">I guess it was about the only thing that I could do at the time; I was a Fuller Brush Man.</span> <span id="s498">I hated every minute of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q:When did you actually become a chemist?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A:Then I got a job as a photographer in a microfilming outfit.</span> <span id="s501">It was a commercial outfit that did nothing but microfilm documents.</span> <span id="s502">At that time there was a war scare again and people microfilmed all papers, documents, what have you.</span> <span id="s503">Then I started going to night school, because I didn’t want to keep that job forever.</span> <span id="s504">I took up chemistry at Temple University and started to look for a job.</span> <span id="s505">Which again wasn’t easy, but there were ads in the paper for Rohm Haas in 1956 and I applied, and they hired me, much to my own surprise.</span> <span id="s506">They hired me with more pay than I had gotten at the microfilming outfit.</span> <span id="s507">I started in February 1956 and I’ll be celebrating my 28th anniversary in a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q:That’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s509">You must be doing a good job for them.</span> <span id="s510">I would like to go back just for a few minutes and ask you about your wife since you met her, and she shared some of the same experiences that you did.</span> <span id="s511">Can you tell us, you met your wife in England and she also was originally from Germany.</span> <span id="s512">Can you tell us how she got to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A:She was younger and she was able to join a Children’s Transport.</span> <span id="s514">I think there was no quota as far as England was concerned and they took any number of children, or at least 1500 at a time.</span> <span id="s515">And she was one of them to go to England on the Children’s Transport, lived with a Jewish family in London and was also interned because she lived in the coastal area.</span> <span id="s516">She was interned for nine months.</span> <span id="s517">We didn’t know each other at that time.</span> <span id="s518">And she was also sent to Manchester to the same hostel and I came to in December ‘41.</span> <span id="s519">That’s where we met and Manchester is where we got married in January ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q:So that was a good place for you both.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A:She worked also on defense work making uniforms, army uniforms.</span> <span id="s522">And she was very lucky; one interesting point was, she was guarding the factory she was working at at night, a so-called fire watch, in case a bomb dropped.</span> <span id="s523">They had rats at that time in the factory and a rat climbed up into her slacks; she was wearing slacks at the time, and they ran out of that factory in a great hurry because they were just scared.</span> <span id="s524">They weren’t allowed to run out but they did and about five minutes after they had run out, the factory was hit by a bomb.</span> <span id="s525">So a rat saved her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q:Her life, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A:That is fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q:That is fate, yes it is.</span> <span id="s529">Thank you so much for sharing your experiences with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A:You are welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">USHMM Archives, RG-50.462*0017 page \* arabic21 From the collection of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History
