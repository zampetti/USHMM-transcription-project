telling me your name, where you were born, and when you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s12">My name is Adam Beer.</span> <span id="s13">I born in a city called Nitokislavski Nicholage (ph), which is Slovakia, before it was, of course, part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s14">And I was born February 25, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Tell me a little bit about your town.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: It’s a very small town, lying very nicely, geographically, under the Tetra (ph) Mountains.</span> <span id="s17">In other words, when I was young, for instance, you could go ski, you have a already on top of the mountains there.</span> <span id="s18">It was a very quiet life.</span> <span id="s19">Not much excitement.</span> <span id="s20">Typical small city in the Slovakia.</span> <span id="s21">And this lasted until about 1938.</span> <span id="s22">Then trouble started.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: What about the Jewish community there.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: There was not a big community.</span> <span id="s25">We had about 300 families.</span> <span id="s26">So maybe, total, it was 400 people.</span> <span id="s27">It was a community, which I think you can compare here to conservative.</span> <span id="s28">There were not -- there were maybe only two or three Orthodox people.</span> <span id="s29">There was the rabbi, the shamis (ph), and the contors (ph), the cousin.</span> <span id="s30">Otherwise, people were .</span> <span id="s31">Most stores were -- good stores were closed, but they made business on the site.</span> <span id="s32">For instance, you could go Saturday, shopping, but the front, see, was closed.</span> <span id="s33">So you just went through the side door.</span> <span id="s34">So, it was really cheating, but that’s how it worked.</span> <span id="s35">We had very beautiful temples there in our hometown.</span> <span id="s36">We had, we made our own matzos (ph) during the Passover time, right on the school place.</span> <span id="s37">We had a Jewish school, Jewish grammar school, which I attended from the age of six until I was Temple, four years.</span> <span id="s38">Culturally, we had good cultural programs.</span> <span id="s39">We had theater, which played.</span> <span id="s40">We had, Sundays, we had outing in the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">There was a large Macarby (ph) group.</span> <span id="s42">The Zionist movement was pretty active there.</span> <span id="s43">So it was a really very nice little community.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Did you mix much with the Christian population?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yes, we did because at that time, I had very good Christian friends, because mostly after I left the grammar school, I went to the Gymnasium, which takes eight years.</span> <span id="s46">So you go from 19 -- I graduated 1940 from Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s47">And there, I met most of my friends.</span> <span id="s48">We had very good relationships.</span> <span id="s49">We were very close.</span> <span id="s50">We went together, we had fun together.</span> <span id="s51">And there was no animosity.</span> <span id="s52">That all ended, of course, when Slovakia became independent and the situation changed around.</span> <span id="s53">But until that time, no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And your family business?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: My father was -- had an electrical store.</span> <span id="s56">He was a master electrician for many years.</span> <span id="s57">He was very well known and he was very busy.</span> <span id="s58">He took care of the leather factories, took care of them.</span> <span id="s59">Always they should be functioning.</span> <span id="s60">And we weren’t rich people, but we had -- made a nice living.</span> <span id="s61">We also lived in a home, actually, it’s two homes there.</span> <span id="s62">And we lived in, and next door to our house was another house that we rented out.</span> <span id="s63">The chief of Zhandamarie (ph) was our tenant there.</span> <span id="s64">Then, a dental technician was a tenant.</span> <span id="s65">And a grocery store was right there.</span> <span id="s66">And my father was pretty entrepreneurish.</span> <span id="s67">For instance, he built garages for cars to park overnight.</span> <span id="s68">And we also, in the house, there was a , from the cigarette people who sell cigarettes.</span> <span id="s69">So it was a busy place.</span> <span id="s70">And that was where I brought up.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did you have brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s73">I had a older sister, two years older than I am.</span> <span id="s74">She was born 1919.</span> <span id="s75">Her name was Gabriella, or Ella, short.</span> <span id="s76">And I have four years younger brother, name is Otto.</span> <span id="s77">My sister, of course, died in the war.</span> <span id="s78">And my brother is still living in my hometown in Nicholage (ph), Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: One other question about this period.</span> <span id="s80">You mentioned that there were Zionist Youth movements.</span> <span id="s81">Were you involved in these political organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: I wasn’t really political, but they sports organizations.</span> <span id="s83">We had outings, we had exercises.</span> <span id="s84">It wasn’t -- for instance, the was on the agenda, but at this time, I was, you know, not really interested in that because we had a pretty good life there and we never dreamed about a time that it would come.</span> <span id="s85">So, it was more a cultural and sport organization than political organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Now, prior to 1939, what did you know about Hitler and Nazis and Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Well, we knew enough.</span> <span id="s88">We had a radio, of course.</span> <span id="s89">The radio at that time was still pretty new, but we had a radio.</span> <span id="s90">And I remember very clearly as we were listening -- my mother was still living at that time -- I think it was in April of ‘34 where the president of Austria was shot.</span> <span id="s91">His name was Schuslig (ph), I think.</span> <span id="s92">I remember that and we were quite shocked because there was already a from Hitler’s party because he wanted to Austria and so, it wasn’t good for -- it was how they killed him.</span> <span id="s93">And the new president .</span> <span id="s94">So, we knew about Crystal Nacht (ph), in 1938, we heard that over the radio.</span> <span id="s95">And it bothered us, but still, nobody comprehend, nobody could foresee that would happen.</span> <span id="s96">We were pretty edgy about it, but we still took the attitude, Slovakia is a free, beautiful, democratic country and we didn’t worry much about it.</span> <span id="s97">I’m afraid so, in 1939, before Slovakia Republic was born, March 14 in ‘39, my father got papers to Bolivia, to immigrate.</span> <span id="s98">It was official and he could have given the paper right away.</span> <span id="s99">But my grandmother was still living , and my mother was already dead, and we didn’t see that we could go away and leave her behind.</span> <span id="s100">So we figured, we’ll ditch these papers to go to Bolivia.</span> <span id="s101">And we stayed.</span> <span id="s102">And I was still in high school.</span> <span id="s103">As I say, I finished -- the last year the Jews could graduate from high school, from gymnasium.</span> <span id="s104">It was on June 6, 1940.</span> <span id="s105">Of course, I always wanted to be a doctor and I wanted to go to medical school, but I was cut out.</span> <span id="s106">No Jew could enter medical school.</span> <span id="s107">So, what to do, then?</span> <span id="s108">I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s109">So, I went to work for my father in his electrical undertaking and I learned electrical work.</span> <span id="s110">And I was, it seemed, from 19 -- to the end of the war -- 1945.</span> <span id="s111">Although in 1944, we already went to the mountains to escape, but we will come to it.</span> <span id="s112">But I was working, helping out, and I learned the trade.</span> <span id="s113">And about the business.</span> <span id="s114">Soon, the Slovak regime started.</span> <span id="s115">My father had to give up the business and he had to be political party zealot (ph).</span> <span id="s116">An Audian (ph) person, had to take over.</span> <span id="s117">He was the boss.</span> <span id="s118">He took the money.</span> <span id="s119">And just give certain amount of income to my father to live on.</span> <span id="s120">That was from 19 -- if I remember, it may be from 1941 or so to end of the war.</span> <span id="s121">So my father was employed, I was employed, but we stayed home.</span> <span id="s122">We did not go.</span> <span id="s123">Now, my sister, she was a seamstress.</span> <span id="s124">She was very good at it.</span> <span id="s125">And she worked for a Slovak company at a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">By 1942, came an order, actually, a letter given to the Jewish families, which said that all girls from age, I know it was from 16 or 18, unmarried women, should report in the Jewish school, I think, if I remember right, either five or ten kilograms of supply and they would be taken to a working place.</span> <span id="s127">So all the girls from, not all the girls, there were some exceptions, but many of the girls came.</span> <span id="s128">They had about two weeks notice.</span> <span id="s129">But at that time, you didn’t know yet what was happening, so nobody felt nothing bad about it.</span> <span id="s130">They came there and stayed overnight in the yard.</span> <span id="s131">And the next day, they were taken by train to the city of Poprat (ph), which is about 40 kilometers east, and from there, on to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s132">Now, we didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s133">We knew nothing about Auschwitz at that time.</span> <span id="s134">Now, there were some parents who were a little bit smarter than we were.</span> <span id="s135">And when they got the notice, they send their daughters to hospital for appendectomy, whether they needed it or not, and they saved their lives.</span> <span id="s136">As a matter of fact, my classmate, girlfriend, who saved her life, lives here in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s137">She’s married here to an American boy.</span> <span id="s138">But my father,we tried to talk, I must say, my sister was very good friend with a girl who was a, she was a girlfriend of the chief of the .</span> <span id="s139">was an organization which cooperated, of course, with Hitler, and which took care of all the Jewish problems.</span> <span id="s140">And my father went to this -- to help this girl to beg that they shouldn’t take my sister.</span> <span id="s141">But they did not worry about it -- just didn’t want to talk to my father about it.</span> <span id="s142">And that was our goal -- that was our biggest mistake that we made because they left of March 27, 1942, from my hometown, Nicholage (ph).</span> <span id="s143">And on April the 2nd, the train took them from the city of Poprat (ph) to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s144">We never heard of her anymore.</span> <span id="s145">And we found out that in May or June, they were already liquidated .</span> <span id="s146">So as I said, that was our biggest tragedy in the family.</span> <span id="s147">But we stayed on.</span> <span id="s148">And the tragedy was also that two weeks after she was deported, my father got so-called economic exemption.</span> <span id="s149">That means that father, my stepmother, I and my brother, we didn’t even have to wear the , the Star.</span> <span id="s150">We didn’t have to wear it.</span> <span id="s151">We could travel, but the condition was we needed to be home by 6:00 at night.</span> <span id="s152">We couldn’t go to a movie.</span> <span id="s153">We couldn’t have a watch, we couldn’t have a radio.</span> <span id="s154">If the family had a radio, it was a big punishment for that.</span> <span id="s155">And actually, we worked, and my father worked, uninterrupted, until the uprising took in Slovakia, which was August 29, 1944.</span> <span id="s156">The uprising took place in a city called , which was maybe 50 or 60 kilometers away from my hometown.</span> <span id="s157">There were some politicists, landing down (ph), some from Russia, some from the brigade.</span> <span id="s158">They picked out a few men and they were coming towards my hometown with tanks and quite a few army people.</span> <span id="s159">In our town, there was a German station of about 10 or 12 men who managed a telegraph station for .</span> <span id="s160">This partisan and the army came to a place, that was in a hotel.</span> <span id="s161">They surprised these men.</span> <span id="s162">They shot them all.</span> <span id="s163">.</span> <span id="s164">It was the president of -- for their interruptions.</span> <span id="s165">The front didn’t have any more connections to our home town.</span> <span id="s166">Because we knew that if something had happened, that there would be murder.</span> <span id="s167">I mean, everybody would be killed because there was, you know, the Germans might (ph) kill them.</span> <span id="s168">So, we didn’t know, of course, at least, something bad had happened, but we were preparing ourselves for bad times, to leave our town and go to the mountains, because Nicholage (ph), my home town lies right on the top of a mountain.</span> <span id="s169">So, about a year before, we found a carpenter who was not a sympathizer with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s170">He was a communist.</span> <span id="s171">And he built us a bunker in the mountains, about three kilometers from our town.</span> <span id="s172">Please ask me if you have a question.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s174">Actually, I don’t wan to -- I want to go back a little bit before we talk about this.</span> <span id="s175">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: I’m curious what happened between 1938 and 1942.</span> <span id="s177">That’s a big chunk of time, considering what was happening in Europe.</span> <span id="s178">So, what was happening in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Well, first of all, on October 6th, 1938, they took Slovakia and was divided in Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia.</span> <span id="s180">Slovakia became autonomous.</span> <span id="s181">That means, the president was still the president of both countries, but autonomy , but they still went to Slovakia.</span> <span id="s182">Then, as I say, from October 6th to March 14, 1939, when Slovakia, under the , it will become independent state, that was completely bought from Bohemia and Moravia.</span> <span id="s183">It became Slovenkis Shtat (ph), Slovak State.</span> <span id="s184">The president of our country became a Dr.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Joseph Tiso, who was a Catholic priest and he, as a minister/president, he had person called Dr. Voitisch Toka (ph), who was a lawyer, but also, they were all Nazis, what we call sympathizers with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s186">And from that moment on, from March 14th, the rules and regulations came out, restricting.</span> <span id="s187">They said you couldn’t be on the street at night.</span> <span id="s188">You couldn’t have a radio.</span> <span id="s189">You couldn’t have watches.</span> <span id="s190">You had to give up any gold or any jewel you had.</span> <span id="s191">You’d get a piece of paper that -- to get the things out.</span> <span id="s192">But you liberty was restricted.</span> <span id="s193">You had to be home in time.</span> <span id="s194">You couldn’t own anything.</span> <span id="s195">You could [not] have your own business.</span> <span id="s196">You’re either to work for somebody or you were just out of business.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">That was in 1939.</span> <span id="s198">But there was a as I started school, until the first deportation took place from town, and that was in 1941 for certain people who were claimed to be communists were at night -- police came at night, took these people away, and they were never seen since -- never came back.</span> <span id="s199">That was in ‘41.</span> <span id="s200">My father -- we still had to at the time, yet.</span> <span id="s201">But because he was an electrician, they needed him, so they let him work.</span> <span id="s202">He was under the control of the men who are in the ground.</span> <span id="s203">But we could work.</span> <span id="s204">But every day, some new regulations came that were tougher and tougher and tougher, until the time came when, of course, people started to be deported.</span> <span id="s205">Not political, but deported to so-called work.</span> <span id="s206">“You will go to work.</span> <span id="s207">You will help the government to survive.</span> <span id="s208">And you’ll be fed.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">And you’ll even get -- everything will be fine.”</span> <span id="s210">Did I say that time when my sister was taken in ‘42?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: You said ‘42.</span> <span id="s212">Was there any German presence?</span> <span id="s213">Or everything was controlled by the Slovakian government?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: There was Slovakian government, but there were German offices in the capital city of Slovakia, which is Bratislava.</span> <span id="s215">There was a person, a German person called , who was the ambassador there.</span> <span id="s216">And of course, he gave the instructions what should be done.</span> <span id="s217">But locally, there were some Nazi party Youth organizations, such as Euchre (ph), but officially, everything was controlled by the Slovak.</span> <span id="s218">But the hundred or so were German.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: So you were never officially occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: No, Slovakia wasn’t occupied, no.</span> <span id="s221">Bohemia and Moravia was.</span> <span id="s222">But Slovakia wasn’t because they become allies with , and therefore, they became so-called independent, but of course, they had to do as they were told.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: The other question is, you had a lot of Christian and Catholic friends, I assume, before this took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: You’re right.</span> <span id="s225">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: What happened to those friends afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Interesting, as I said.</span> <span id="s228">A very good friend whose father was a chief of the hospital in the town and, as soon as was born -- and he was not Catholic, he was Protestant, he was Lutheran -- I see him on the street one day and he had this bright uniform on.</span> <span id="s229">He has a double cross, not , but the double cross of Slovaks.</span> <span id="s230">And I told him, you know, he acted like (ph) he didn’t see me anymore.</span> <span id="s231">So I knew that something was happening here.</span> <span id="s232">The uniform, you know, at that -- and, , see he was a , How are you.</span> <span id="s233">Very, very good friend.</span> <span id="s234">He has a Jewish girlfriend, as a matter of fact, before this was all started.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">And it lasted, maybe, for about six months.</span> <span id="s236">Then took the youth from us, never to be out again.</span> <span id="s237">And more of us started to be against the Slovak regime.</span> <span id="s238">See, he was , not Protestant.</span> <span id="s239">But it didn’t really seem that it’s another way to go and to give everything.</span> <span id="s240">But maturity -- maturity cultivated very well.</span> <span id="s241">On the street, for instance, you would want to meet them.</span> <span id="s242">Or they would want to meet you, then say Hello to you.</span> <span id="s243">They tried to show you that, “Look, I know who you are and everything, but, please, don’t contact me.”</span> <span id="s244">And that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Your father continued to do business with . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yeah, but I think, not on his own.</span> <span id="s247">He had a supervisor.</span> <span id="s248">He was working and the money went to the boss and he was just paid a salary.</span> <span id="s249">I mean, a salary just to survive.</span> <span id="s250">But he was doing the business, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Now, were you afraid?</span> <span id="s252">I mean, were there beatings, arrests, like there were in other countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: There were arrests, as I said, from some of the men, who were thought of as communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">They were beaten and taken away and never came back . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s255">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: What did we just say?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: I was talking about how other people , any my father was still in business.</span> <span id="s259">Yeah.</span> <span id="s260">Q: No, I was asking you about the arrests and the beatings.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s262">There were some, but really, the bad things started in 1941, and mostly in ‘42.</span> <span id="s263">That was when the mass deportation took place, and the whole family was just -- they disappeared.</span> <span id="s264">I remember, for instance, the cousin of the Schuller (ph), the colonel, his five children, I remember like today, they were taking him -- the police escort.</span> <span id="s265">And it was a very sad thing to see.</span> <span id="s266">And we stayed because we had the exemption.</span> <span id="s267">But all these people were gone.</span> <span id="s268">All the stores were out of the Jewish hens (ph) already at the time.</span> <span id="s269">As I say, it was all under different management.</span> <span id="s270">And the life became tougher every day.</span> <span id="s271">There was a rationing of food.</span> <span id="s272">I know that we didn’t have everything that we wanted, but because my father was so long in business and he went to villages, to electrify the city, you know, to start putting electricity in the villages at that time.</span> <span id="s273">So, many times, he brought butter in or some meat or something.</span> <span id="s274">So, we are not starving really.</span> <span id="s275">But food was very, very hard to get.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Do you remember your family talking about the situation and what you thought was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: You talking before my sister went or after?</span> <span id="s278">Before, I say, we didn’t know it was going to be.</span> <span id="s279">We knew that if we honestly would go to work, it will be living.</span> <span id="s280">But, as soon as the transport went -- as I say, it was April 2nd, 1942 -- and we knew it was going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s281">And we heard a few weeks after that, we knew already there was a liquidation.</span> <span id="s282">But what could we do?</span> <span id="s283">We couldn’t escape at the time, because there was no passport, nothing you could get, no place.</span> <span id="s284">You were stuck where you were.</span> <span id="s285">But we tried to prepare for the inevitable, to build something that we could escape, if bad comes, and hopefully, to save our lives.</span> <span id="s286">And I think in 1943, I had a friend whose parents were farmers.</span> <span id="s287">And couldn’t go to school, so he worked for his father.</span> <span id="s288">And they had two horses and a big buggy.</span> <span id="s289">And little by little, the material to build the bunker on Sundays, we shipped to the top of the mountain where we built the bunker.</span> <span id="s290">And somehow, people didn’t notice too much.</span> <span id="s291">You know, why are they being gone?</span> <span id="s292">But anyway, it was several times, delivered wood, and it was probably needed.</span> <span id="s293">And his name, he was a carpenter, built a bunker, which I have said was very wonderfully equipped.</span> <span id="s294">We had bunk beds -- Oh, I didn’t tell you, we were four families together, four families together, which, of course, put the money together to build this bunker.</span> <span id="s295">We were all friends.</span> <span id="s296">There were two couples -- husband and wife, husband and wife, husband and wife and a son, and my father and my stepmother and my brother and I, because my sister was gone.</span> <span id="s297">So four families.</span> <span id="s298">This bunker, it was pretty comfortably built.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">We had, for instance, our own radio so we could communicate with the .</span> <span id="s300">But how we did it, we brought in a bicycle and we put a through it, a dynamo on the bicycle.</span> <span id="s301">And running the wheels of the bicycle, we created electricity and we were able to listen to BBC.</span> <span id="s302">So we knew what’s going on.</span> <span id="s303">And it was all lasting very nicely from the day when the partisans came to town -- like I said, it was August 29, 1944 -- until we are liberated.</span> <span id="s304">How . . . I know, you want me to continue with this story now?</span> <span id="s305">Or do you have some other questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Well, I’ve got a lot to cover before we get to liberation.</span> <span id="s307">A: Please do.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: What else did you have in the bunker?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Supplies?</span> <span id="s310">For instance, we had -- yeah, we prepared all the supplies in canned food.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Everything was canned.</span> <span id="s312">But we hid (ph) them next to the bunker, we built a big hole in the ground and put it all in.</span> <span id="s313">So we had a supply for several months to live on.</span> <span id="s314">And and we are to go.</span> <span id="s315">It was fine.</span> <span id="s316">There was -- in the top of the mountain, in the little -- not the valley, but there was some .</span> <span id="s317">So the bunker was in this .</span> <span id="s318">And we were able to look down into the valley.</span> <span id="s319">So I say, except maybe the linen -- so we brought it out when we escaped -- but the food, everything was prepared for us to go in and start a new life.</span> <span id="s320">That was, again, in ‘43.</span> <span id="s321">And we survived.</span> <span id="s322">Meanwhile, deportation took place almost every day.</span> <span id="s323">More and more people were removed.</span> <span id="s324">For instance, there were two doctors there.</span> <span id="s325">And they needed doctors that were still left (ph) there.</span> <span id="s326">But in ‘44, those families were deported, and of course, never heard of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: There were regular deportations after your sister’s.</span> <span id="s328">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s329">Yes.</span> <span id="s330">Deportation took place from ‘42 to ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Was there a pattern?</span> <span id="s332">I mean, who did they take first or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: First, the people, I think, they didn’t need them so much.</span> <span id="s334">But the doctors, the electricals left in 1944 because we needed -- there were not enough doctors to go around.</span> <span id="s335">But then, the hospital took over and these two families were deported.</span> <span id="s336">Older folks, for instance, who were not working anymore, who were not contributing to the economy, they were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">And everybody who left never returned.</span> <span id="s338">Nobody returned from out of town.</span> <span id="s339">We had president of the Jewish organization there who was supposed to cooperate with this party, the party.</span> <span id="s340">Whom to select -- it was very tough thing for a Jewish guy -- he was a lawyer, an attorney -- Dr. Weinmann (ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s341">And he had to decide whom he was going to send out.</span> <span id="s342">And you know, that creates very bad blood because Why me?</span> <span id="s343">But that’s how it happened.</span> <span id="s344">He survived the war himself.</span> <span id="s345">And he lived a very quiet life that got .</span> <span id="s346">I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s347">We knew that we might have to escape from the house.</span> <span id="s348">But our house where we were living was maybe 200 years old.</span> <span id="s349">The walls of the house were maybe one meter thick from stone.</span> <span id="s350">The meters (ph) were very small.</span> <span id="s351">Not only were they small, but they were -- they had little bars in it.</span> <span id="s352">So you know, if they come in the night to get you, the doors were closed, the windows were .</span> <span id="s353">So, I told my father, “You know what?</span> <span id="s354">Let’s remove these bars.”</span> <span id="s355">Which we did.</span> <span id="s356">We removed the bars so in case, maybe, we could escape.</span> <span id="s357">We had a big back yard there and -- we never had to do it,so, but I said we are prepared for that.</span> <span id="s358">We were -- it was harder and harder -- our insecurity was getting bigger and bigger because we didn’t know when the time would come for us, although my father still was the exception.</span> <span id="s359">But that could have been revoked any minute.</span> <span id="s360">Then it happened.</span> <span id="s361">We are working, and I remember very clearly, I was helping in the house, making the electrical work in the house.</span> <span id="s362">And this August 9th, ‘44, I hear machine gun fire.</span> <span id="s363">And -- because the town was very quiet until this time.</span> <span id="s364">In the meantime -- so we jumped up from the house, “What’s happening?”</span> <span id="s365">“Oh, freedom, freedom!</span> <span id="s366">The ’s here.</span> <span id="s367">Liberation is coming.”</span> <span id="s368">Well, we were very happy to hear that.</span> <span id="s369">And, as I said before, this killed his 12 German soldiers there and arrested a few of the collaborators, maybe even shot them, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s370">They were in the jail (ph), but I’m sure there was some killing going on there.</span> <span id="s371">But we knew this end of it, and, as I say, we said, “Now it’s time to leave.”</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: How much did you know about the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: We knew because, well, my town was mostly Protestants, so we were a little bit against the regime.</span> <span id="s374">And there were some people were coming in with information about going on and maybe even trying to get some people to join the partisans in the mountains -- because that was our adventure (ph).</span> <span id="s375">We went around mountains all around the city.</span> <span id="s376">So they were coming -- because at that time they weren’t in uniforms, they were in plain clothes.</span> <span id="s377">And, though we knew what was going on and we knew the time would come that -- we hoped that the revolution would take place in the , because there was a -- the people parachuted (ph) from Russia and took ’s army.</span> <span id="s378">And I understand there were even some Americans who were shot down over Slovakia, and they returned.</span> <span id="s379">, but I was told that.</span> <span id="s380">So, there was accumulation (ph) to get out of there and come to Liberlin (ph) Slovakia.</span> <span id="s381">So we had some information about them.</span> <span id="s382">And of course, Jews, if there were anybody around, were welcome to join the partisans.</span> <span id="s383">Now, my father still has to work, I had to work, so in the , we stayed there.</span> <span id="s384">But the day came, August 29th.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: So, did you know there was going to be this uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No, we didn’t know, but again, it was in August of ‘44.</span> <span id="s387">The German are losing the war .</span> <span id="s388">So, we knew something would happen, but we -- this came as a surprise to us.</span> <span id="s389">We were surprised.</span> <span id="s390">We didn’t know what to -- we knew the end would come, only we didn’t know when.</span> <span id="s391">And we tried to prepare ourselves good as we could.</span> <span id="s392">As I say, we fixed the house (ph) so we could escape and so on.</span> <span id="s393">But it was a surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Now, one other question before we go to the mountains.</span> <span id="s395">You mentioned this lawyer who was the head of the Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s396">Was there a whole structure in place with a Jewish Council (ph) or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: I don’t think there was, really.</span> <span id="s398">He was a head.</span> <span id="s399">He was there, but I don’t think there were any other people who were involved.</span> <span id="s400">But he was selected by the Slovak (ph) government, “You will represent the Jews,” just like in Russia ghettos, he’s like the unirat (ph).</span> <span id="s401">So he was the unirat (ph), one person.</span> <span id="s402">And, for instance, like I said, he had a niece.</span> <span id="s403">The niece was working for my father as a secretary or as a clerk in our business.</span> <span id="s404">She was a single girl, but never married.</span> <span id="s405">She was supposed to be the puppet (ph).</span> <span id="s406">He knew that this would take place for her, and suddenly, she disappeared.</span> <span id="s407">So, he saved her life.</span> <span id="s408">He didn’t tell everybody else about the .</span> <span id="s409">So, he didn’t have the best reputation.</span> <span id="s410">But, it was his kid, and a special life.</span> <span id="s411">But otherwise, only purposes, he sent out letters to the Jewish families (ph) who were still there, “you must know to do this, you must stay home at six, you couldn’t go to the street,” other restrictions went through there, to give out information.</span> <span id="s412">And the temple, which as I said was a very beautiful temple, was used as a warehouse or something.</span> <span id="s413">there was no more services going on.</span> <span id="s414">So, it was very, very restricted.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: By the time you left, were there many Jews left in the town?</span> <span id="s416">A: Do you mean for America?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: When you left for the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Very few.</span> <span id="s419">Very few.</span> <span id="s420">Only the ones who were exceptions.</span> <span id="s421">Very few.</span> <span id="s422">Because by that time, the deportation took everybody.</span> <span id="s423">So only very few.</span> <span id="s424">I don’t remember how many, but just very, very minimal amount.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Anything else you remember about that period and what was happening in the town, what you saw, before we move on?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: In my town?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Yeah, prior to ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Before ‘44?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Anything you saw or heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: We were quite isolated, as I say.</span> <span id="s431">We couldn’t -- we didn’t get much contact with the non- Jewish people.</span> <span id="s432">They didn’t want to talk to us, they were afraid.</span> <span id="s433">We didn’t read much.</span> <span id="s434">We were living from day to day.</span> <span id="s435">If we survived one day, we were ahead.</span> <span id="s436">Because, as I said, we didn’t know whether, at the time, if at night somebody would come and get us.</span> <span id="s437">For instance - - this is an example I’ll tell you -- a friend of mine, who went with me to school, couldn’t continue up through gymnasium, so he went to learn the electric trade, worked for my father.</span> <span id="s438">His parents had a small grocery store.</span> <span id="s439">And they were also prepared, somehow, to save themselves.</span> <span id="s440">And one night, they came after them.</span> <span id="s441">And they were able to escape in the back yard.</span> <span id="s442">And the , who came to get them, he knew very well this family.</span> <span id="s443">He could have -- he could have said, “Look, they’re gone already.”</span> <span id="s444">But no.</span> <span id="s445">He called them.</span> <span id="s446">They were deported.</span> <span id="s447">And never came back.</span> <span id="s448">Why I say this, after the war, my friend came back.</span> <span id="s449">Then, one day to the station and said, “I want the report.”</span> <span id="s450">And the same who his friends, and let them not escape, took their information.</span> <span id="s451">He said, “I want to declare against you.”</span> <span id="s452">“Why?”</span> <span id="s453">That day when my parents tried to escape, you know, you , and you let them -- and you are .</span> <span id="s454">To his grandchildren, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s455">Nothing.</span> <span id="s456">I know it was a travesty, but nothing happened.</span> <span id="s457">(ph) People -- there were turncoats and -- after -- as soon as the liberation, he became very good to the Slovak.</span> <span id="s458">I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: How much time is left on this tape?</span> <span id="s461">Q: About another five minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s463">Tell me about the day you and your father and brother decided to go.</span> <span id="s464">It was time to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: That day.</span> <span id="s466">Let’s see.</span> <span id="s467">I was working with him that time, that day.</span> <span id="s468">And about noontime, he hears this machine gun fire and shooting and so on.</span> <span id="s469">And we run out of the house and people are saying, “Oh, it’s freedom.</span> <span id="s470">Liberation.”</span> <span id="s471">People kaput (ph), you know.</span> <span id="s472">And we had seen some tanks come in.</span> <span id="s473">and many uniforms and jubilation and so on.</span> <span id="s474">And we heard about this German soldier being killed there, so we knew right away that at that time we needed to go away.</span> <span id="s475">And it was very smart because the next day, the German army was in the city of about 43 people from east of my hometown called .</span> <span id="s476">They came down to the town from , and any men who were on the street to go to -- as a punishment for the death of these 12 soldiers.</span> <span id="s477">And it was very grim.</span> <span id="s478">But we didn’t wait for that.</span> <span id="s479">As I say, the same day, we run out there.</span> <span id="s480">The family was prepared.</span> <span id="s481">And we were, let’s see, 14 or 16 people in the bunker.</span> <span id="s482">And from then on . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: By foot.</span> <span id="s485">By foot.</span> <span id="s486">We go through this village.</span> <span id="s487">See, there was no way to get there, I mean, you couldn’t get a taxi.</span> <span id="s488">I don’t remember if it was the same night we went.</span> <span id="s489">I think it was the night, probably, because, you know, .</span> <span id="s490">Because he had to take almost nothing with us.</span> <span id="s491">Everything was there already.</span> <span id="s492">And we were there and overlooked now (ph) our house.</span> <span id="s493">And we had, I think, a good life, but a quiet life from the day -- from August 29th in ‘44 to December 15th, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Now, how did you spend your days in this bunker?</span> <span id="s495">How did you continue to get food?</span> <span id="s496">A: The food, remember, we had our supply there.</span> <span id="s497">But we must co-exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Okay, so, ready?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: So we are in the bunker already.</span> <span id="s500">And you asked me how did you spend the time.</span> <span id="s501">We had to cut wood to build fire.</span> <span id="s502">Fire wasn’t very good thing because the fumes from the fire would go straight up to heaven, you know, and anybody who was down in the valley could see there was some fire there, so there must be some people there, but there was no way out.</span> <span id="s503">But it was still August, it was still summer.</span> <span id="s504">It was fine.</span> <span id="s505">But then, September, October, November, December.</span> <span id="s506">Big snow fell down.</span> <span id="s507">It was in the mountains (ph).</span> <span id="s508">And we had to eat.</span> <span id="s509">Otherwise we would from freezing.</span> <span id="s510">The food we still had there, but we also got an enemy inside there.</span> <span id="s511">We got lice.</span> <span id="s512">Washing -- there was no water there close by.</span> <span id="s513">There was no river no this -- so we had to -- I don’t remember how we got them out of there.</span> <span id="s514">I do remember washing was not a strongest point at that time, but we tried to keep it neat as we could.</span> <span id="s515">But we got lice.</span> <span id="s516">And I remember, every morning, there was a time when we had to get our lice and clean ourselves.</span> <span id="s517">And it became tougher and tougher because sickness could -- we could have caught sickness from that.</span> <span id="s518">But we made it through.</span> <span id="s519">But on -- about two months after we were there, I don’t remember the time any more, we got a surprise.</span> <span id="s520">Four -- I think there were four or six peasants found our bunker.</span> <span id="s521">Came there, said, “You are Jews?</span> <span id="s522">You hiding here?”</span> <span id="s523">“Yes, we are.”</span> <span id="s524">“You have to share your bunker with us.”</span> <span id="s525">Now, we were 14 or 16 people there.</span> <span id="s526">Not much room, but of course, we had to share with them.</span> <span id="s527">And with them was captain -- I remember his name, Captain Novotney (ph) was his name in Slovak.</span> <span id="s528">Everybody nice, decent human being.</span> <span id="s529">And we had accommodation.</span> <span id="s530">We had to -- instead of one person on the bunker, we slept two people in the bunker and we made room for them.</span> <span id="s531">Both these guys had weapons, automatic weapons, and they were going around, they were going out, seeing bridges and so on (ph).</span> <span id="s532">And my father was very good man, but very naive man.</span> <span id="s533">He was so grateful to these people that he told this Captain Novotney (ph), “Captain, if you should need any food, we have some food here.</span> <span id="s534">Please help yourself.”</span> <span id="s535">And he showed them where the food was.</span> <span id="s536">So, one day, when we went out to get our food and we see the hole there.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Everything was taken out, no food.</span> <span id="s538">it really was a shock, you know.</span> <span id="s539">There is no food now.</span> <span id="s540">And it was getting winter, October, November.</span> <span id="s541">What to do now?</span> <span id="s542">So, we went down to the village.</span> <span id="s543">As I said, we were three young men there.</span> <span id="s544">And we -- one time, I went some of the others so we trade so nobody come .</span> <span id="s545">We came to the village and told them we had money and we need some food, give us food.</span> <span id="s546">And we pay for it.</span> <span id="s547">And the people said to me, “We will not give you food, but if the Germans find out that we gave food, then they will kill us, because you’re enemy.”</span> <span id="s548">So I said, “Look, either they will kill you or we will kill you (we had a gun with us).”</span> <span id="s549">And they gave us the food, we paid them, and we brought it up.</span> <span id="s550">But winter was rougher and rougher because smoke in there.</span> <span id="s551">And I remember one day, my friend went up, and coming back, he almost froze to death.</span> <span id="s552">He told me a story that he had some pins and he pricked himself in the fingers so he shouldn’t fall asleep, on the way up.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">He just died about two years ago.</span> <span id="s554">He lived in Bohemia.</span> <span id="s555">He was doctor.</span> <span id="s556">But it was tougher and tougher.</span> <span id="s557">But on December 15th, which was a full winter -- oh, I must say this.</span> <span id="s558">We had, as I said, we were on top of the mountains, and we had a beautiful view of the valley.</span> <span id="s559">And we had a very good German-size binoculars.</span> <span id="s560">So I and he, we are watching guns and what is happening (ph).</span> <span id="s561">One day, we notice big mass, big mass of moving people there -- this is we are looking down in the valley.</span> <span id="s562">Now, we couldn’t see whether they’re partisans, whether they’re Russians, whether they’re Germans, was it the , we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s563">But we saw we had to make some change in our life.</span> <span id="s564">Not far -- maybe 50 yards or less from our bunker -- was a cave.</span> <span id="s565">So, early in the morning, before the sun came out -- early, early in the morning -- we took our rug and, you know, with us, and went to sleep in the cave because we were afraid that these men might be the enemies and they would find the bunker and kill us.</span> <span id="s566">And we did this probably a few days.</span> <span id="s567">I don’t remember how long.</span> <span id="s568">But it paid off on December 15th.</span> <span id="s569">In the meantime, we are in the cave.</span> <span id="s570">The house (ph) is empty.</span> <span id="s571">But the partisans stayed there.</span> <span id="s572">Because they had weapons, they stayed there.</span> <span id="s573">So we hear big fire -- machine gun fire -- which lasted maybe half an hour or so.</span> <span id="s574">and of course, being snow, we could see the foot marks of the soldiers of these people.</span> <span id="s575">The foot marks had come there and that’s the end of it.</span> <span id="s576">But they never came.</span> <span id="s577">At night, we came to our bunker from the cave.</span> <span id="s578">The bunker was completely burned to the ground.</span> <span id="s579">And two bodies lying there, from the partisans.</span> <span id="s580">It surprised us that the partisans were the two that were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: The ones you knew -- the partisans you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s583">The partisans which were with us, yes.</span> <span id="s584">But two were dead.</span> <span id="s585">I remember, they had the nice boots were taken off.</span> <span id="s586">And I remember one guy had a finger cut off because he had some, probably some ring or something.</span> <span id="s587">And was completely burned with gasoline down.</span> <span id="s588">So we had no bunker.</span> <span id="s589">We had only the cave.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Before you continue, I have a couple of questions about your life in the bunker.</span> <span id="s591">Did you stay in during the daytime?</span> <span id="s592">Or could you come up for air?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s594">We could come out.</span> <span id="s595">Because remember, it was all forest.</span> <span id="s596">All mountains around, trees.</span> <span id="s597">Very high up.</span> <span id="s598">So we could go up, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: And you had your own weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: We had one Luger.</span> <span id="s601">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s602">One Luger we had.</span> <span id="s603">And I don’t know whether we had six -- we are not big shooters, you know.</span> <span id="s604">But I bought the Luger in my hometown from somebody.</span> <span id="s605">I thought if they would catch me, I would shoot myself because I didn’t want to fall in German hands.</span> <span id="s606">It was for committing suicide because I didn’t want to go .</span> <span id="s607">And that’s all we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: How often did somebody have to go down and buy food?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Oh, I figured, at least once a week.</span> <span id="s610">Maybe twice a week.</span> <span id="s611">But dare I say, we did it as a group.</span> <span id="s612">Because it was risky, because if the German patrol catches us, of course, it’s they find us, we are partisans, the partisans are shot.</span> <span id="s613">There’s no prisoners taken.</span> <span id="s614">So, that was good.</span> <span id="s615">But after we had no bunker, and only the cave, we around our place, and we discovered another bunker, which we didn’t know before, not too far from us.</span> <span id="s616">A Jewish family, whom we knew were from my hometown.</span> <span id="s617">The name was Mr. Stein (ph).</span> <span id="s618">I remember very well.</span> <span id="s619">So we came there and we told them we had just been out.</span> <span id="s620">Would you please help us .</span> <span id="s621">And I’ll never forget this.</span> <span id="s622">This old man came out.</span> <span id="s623">And he brought out an empty sardine can.</span> <span id="s624">And he told my father, how’s this, “See this sardine can?</span> <span id="s625">How many sardines can you put in it?</span> <span id="s626">There is only so much room for sardines.”</span> <span id="s627">But he wanted to say there’s no room for -- because he didn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s628">We left and started to build a new bunker.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">We had no material to do it, but we cut down trees and made a very, very primitive bunker.</span> <span id="s630">The walls was the trees.</span> <span id="s631">We used some rugs on top of it.</span> <span id="s632">And we lived there from December 15th -- not December 15th, because we , but from end of December to April 7th when we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s634">Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s635">Did you have particular responsibilities?</span> <span id="s636">Or did everybody. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s638">Except -- yeah, to go down to the food, you know, for the food.</span> <span id="s639">Because, remember, all these people are much older.</span> <span id="s640">So they stayed.</span> <span id="s641">There were women who were old and sick and so on.</span> <span id="s642">So, that was our job, the young folks, to go get the food.</span> <span id="s643">And to cut the wood and to make fire and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: So there were women and children with you also.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No small children.</span> <span id="s646">We were -- I was -- in ‘44, I was 22.</span> <span id="s647">My brother was 18.</span> <span id="s648">The other friend of mine, Dr. Brown, he was five years older than I am.</span> <span id="s649">The other boy was two years older than I am.</span> <span id="s650">So, the youngest would be my brother was the youngest.</span> <span id="s651">The rest were much older.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: But there were women also?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s654">Now, I said, my stepmother, Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Gordner (ph), Mrs. Pollock (ph), and one bachelor from western Slovakia who was in our hometown, and he joined our group.</span> <span id="s655">So there was one single man.</span> <span id="s656">The rest were all husband and wife.</span> <span id="s657">But there were no children.</span> <span id="s658">The youngest, as I said, was my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Did the local people you would get the food from, were they at all supportive of the partisans or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: No, they were just doing their job.</span> <span id="s661">You see, , of course, knew that there were Jews up there.</span> <span id="s662">And they found out, somehow, they disguised as communists, built a bunker.</span> <span id="s663">And some of them were collaborators.</span> <span id="s664">So they told on him.</span> <span id="s665">Yes, Mr. -- I forgot his name -- he built a bunker for the Jews who are up there in the mountains.</span> <span id="s666">Either the Gestapo or the Slovak Gestapo came out and told him that “Either you will tell us where the bunker is or we kill your family.”</span> <span id="s667">Of course, family came first.</span> <span id="s668">So this carpenter told them and that’s how 600 German Ukrainian (ph) marched down in the valley to get our bunker (ph).</span> <span id="s669">That’s how they found out.</span> <span id="s670">So there was a connection there.</span> <span id="s671">But after a while, the men who told on us, they were caught and brought up to the area of the bunker.</span> <span id="s672">And that’s where we see, because the view, see what happened there.</span> <span id="s673">And they had to dig their own graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">They took them there and shot them to death, the partisans, as a punishment for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: During this time, did you, or your brother or your friends. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Oh, one -- may I say this to you?</span> <span id="s677">When we were surprised, it was the machine gun fire that blows.</span> <span id="s678">My brother was out in the cave.</span> <span id="s679">He panicked and ran out of the cave.</span> <span id="s680">When we were counting heads, , my brother was gone.</span> <span id="s681">he wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s682">So we figured, either he was gone by the Germans, was taken prisoner and shipped, or he was shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s683">But he was gone.</span> <span id="s684">It took me until our liberation on April 7th, when we were liberated from the mountain, to find out that he had run down, came to a village, knocked on a door, a young lady let him in -- and I don’t know whether he knew her before or not.</span> <span id="s685">I can’t tell you that.</span> <span id="s686">I forgot to ask him.</span> <span id="s687">but anyway, he was liberated right after December 15.</span> <span id="s688">The village was liberated some time in January or so.</span> <span id="s689">And that’s his wife today.</span> <span id="s690">But we do know that he survived until the end of the war, until we were liberated.</span> <span id="s691">So, he escaped, so we were one man less.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: During this time, did you think about joining the partisan movement?</span> <span id="s693">Was that an option?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: It was part of the option, but somehow, it would have required to leave the family, to leave my father and go away, you know?</span> <span id="s695">And somehow, I wasn’t ready for it.</span> <span id="s696">So maybe I wasn’t ready to be partisan.</span> <span id="s697">We had a , because they came to our .</span> <span id="s698">But I’m sure that if I would have said, “I want to join you,” they would have taken me in, maybe given me some uniform or something, but -- neither one of us -- neither of our boys in our group (ph) joined them.</span> <span id="s699">We had to take the favorite (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: These were Slovakian partisans, Soviet.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: One might have been Russian.</span> <span id="s702">But the captain, as I said, most likely a Slovak, and the other two men were Slovak, too, I think.</span> <span id="s703">I think.</span> <span id="s704">One might have been Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: And they were okay about Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: I mean, they didn’t murder us.</span> <span id="s707">I don’t think there was a big love.</span> <span id="s708">As I say, they took our food away.</span> <span id="s709">But they let us live.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: So, your new bunker that you built, you were in that one for several months again.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Maybe from January ‘til April.</span> <span id="s712">Maybe three months.</span> <span id="s713">It looked like three months.</span> <span id="s714">It was very, very primitive.</span> <span id="s715">It was cold because we had just -- just wood and wood, you know, trees -- just enough so that it didn’t rain, or rather, it didn’t snow.</span> <span id="s716">Very, very primitive.</span> <span id="s717">Because we had no tools, nothing.</span> <span id="s718">And of course, no help.</span> <span id="s719">But we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: What was the life like there?</span> <span id="s721">Was it different?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: No, but we were much more -- in other words, much more scared, much more frustrated, you know.</span> <span id="s723">And we didn’t know what the end was, and what would happen.</span> <span id="s724">As I say, the food was harder to get.</span> <span id="s725">We had to go down, you know, put a gun on people to get the food, and it was much more rough after this burned down.</span> <span id="s726">Because up until that time, people pretty good to , but then it was much rougher.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Did you pay for the food or you just threatened people?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s729">We paid.</span> <span id="s730">We paid.</span> <span id="s731">We paid with Slov money (ph).</span> <span id="s732">No, we paid.</span> <span id="s733">We didn’t want to -- but they people were afraid.</span> <span id="s734">They would have given us the food, but they said, “If you will support the Jews or other partisans, you are an enemy and you will be shot.”</span> <span id="s735">So, I can understand their feelings.</span> <span id="s736">So we told them, “Look, is it you or me?”</span> <span id="s737">And we gave us, and we paid them.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Was there much -- either German or the Linka (ph) guard -- presence in this area at this point?</span> <span id="s739">Could you hear a war going on other than that one time you saw .</span> <span id="s740">.</span> <span id="s741">.</span> <span id="s742">?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: No.</span> <span id="s744">No, because maybe we were about 2,000 meters up high, see?</span> <span id="s745">So .</span> <span id="s746">Yeah, we heard planes overhead flying.</span> <span id="s747">Of course, we heard that.</span> <span id="s748">We didn’t hear any artillery fire because it was far away.</span> <span id="s749">The only information that we had from the radio, and it said that the</span></p> <p><span id="s750">was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: So you were still getting news from the radio.</span> <span id="s752">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s753">Until the bunker was burned out, yeah.</span> <span id="s754">Q: And then you didn’t have anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: But, then, of course, I say the partisans had some use until they would stay with us.</span> <span id="s756">And maybe, I don’t know, there were some people went by there or something, where those people were hiding.</span> <span id="s757">But we are much less informed.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: And then, in the last few months, did you have any contact with partisan people?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: After we found the two dead men there and after we build new bunker, I don’t think there was anymore partisans there.</span> <span id="s760">I just didn’t see any.</span> <span id="s761">We were complete on our .</span> <span id="s762">Mine was my brother, of course, until he ran away.</span> <span id="s763">But completing that part of the stories, one morning, on April 7th, 1945, six uniformed men -- either Czechoslovak uniform or Russian uniform, I don’t remember quite -- came to us and said, “We were sent by our captain to count any people who are hiding here and to bring them across the mountains.</span> <span id="s764">Already, the liberation took place.</span> <span id="s765">And I am here to get you there.”</span> <span id="s766">Now, we are very happy, but also very scared.</span> <span id="s767">Are they real ones?</span> <span id="s768">Or are they Germans to get us and kill us.</span> <span id="s769">So we had a little consultation with us.</span> <span id="s770">“What should we do?”</span> <span id="s771">If we don’t go with them and we stay there, we probably die from hunger.</span> <span id="s772">If we go, we take a chance, but maybe they are real.</span> <span id="s773">And of course, it was.</span> <span id="s774">They took us all -- I don’t know how long -- we walked there and crossed the mountains and we came to a village which was already liberated.</span> <span id="s775">It was April 7th.</span> <span id="s776">And I know, a day or so after that, I went to my hometown.</span> <span id="s777">Everybody went down.</span> <span id="s778">Tried to find my house.</span> <span id="s779">But where the house was, there was no house.</span> <span id="s780">It was a hole in the ground, because our house was located near a river, a river called Vah, and the front moved several times between the Germans and Russians.</span> <span id="s781">So the house was the target.</span> <span id="s782">It was completely gone and there was no house, just a hole in the ground.</span> <span id="s783">So, there was nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s784">We rented in the city place -- we went there.</span> <span id="s785">But already, by May 15th, I was already in Bratislava (ph) and enrolled in medical school.</span> <span id="s786">It was very fast.</span> <span id="s787">We were very impatient to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: When you went back to your town, were there people you knew there?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s790">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s791">Do you mean the Jewish people or Slovak people?</span> <span id="s792">Jewish people, I don’t know that there were many left there.</span> <span id="s793">But the Slovak people, neighbors and so on, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: They welcomed you back?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: I don’t think -- I don’t remember anymore, but I don’t think it was a big welcome, no.</span> <span id="s796">There was no band there.</span> <span id="s797">Certain things -- for instance, we had -- before we ran away, we give to this Christian family to put away for us.</span> <span id="s798">And I think when my father went to get it, it wasn’t there anymore.</span> <span id="s799">So, they were surprised.</span> <span id="s800">“You mean, you are still alive?”</span> <span id="s801">You know.</span> <span id="s802">It wasn’t a big welcome.</span> <span id="s803">But who cared?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: And your father, did he stay in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: He stayed in the town, went back to business.</span> <span id="s806">Continued and worked, I think -- he died in 1976 as an 86-and-a-half years old man.</span> <span id="s807">And he was working in the store after the war until -- maybe until he was 75 years old or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: He stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: He stayed there, yeah.</span> <span id="s810">And he died in the town, in Nicholage (ph).</span> <span id="s811">And I say, I left and went back to Bratislava (ph), stayed there until ‘48, and then came to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s813">We’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s814">How much more time do we have?</span> <span id="s815">Q: I think we probably could change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: So as I said, April 7th was our V-Day.</span> <span id="s819">We came down.</span> <span id="s820">We didn’t know what happened to my brother, but very soon we find out that he was liberated about in January, about three months ahead of us, by running away.</span> <span id="s821">We had to rent an apartment because our house was down.</span> <span id="s822">And I didn’t stay very long.</span> <span id="s823">I just look at my medicalations (ph) book, and I thing on May 15th already, I medicalated (ph) in Bratislava which was the capital city where the medical school was located.</span> <span id="s824">And the only time I came home between ‘45 and ‘48 was on vacation.</span> <span id="s825">Christmas vacation and so on.</span> <span id="s826">And by 1946, some friend told me in the medical school that there is a young lady who needs for the anatomical courses, she needs some skeletons to study.</span> <span id="s827">And he knew that I had some skeletons -- I don’t know where I got them particularly, but it was -- I had some skeletons.</span> <span id="s828">And one day, in my apartment there, somebody knocks on the door and the young lady says, “I am Susan Eisoffer (ph).</span> <span id="s829">And I was told by your friend that you” -- -- “that I could borrow some bones for my study.</span> <span id="s830">Would you be kind enough to lend them to me?”</span> <span id="s831">“Well, sure.”</span> <span id="s832">I liked her.</span> <span id="s833">I lent her the bones.</span> <span id="s834">And the day after or so, she brought me a wonderful goose liver as a present -- as a present for lending her the bones.</span> <span id="s835">And I don’t know why, but I must have like her, so I took her out and we were dating.</span> <span id="s836">And to make it short, of course, it’s my wife.</span> <span id="s837">And her father was a clinician in a small town near Bratislava, called Topochurney (ph).</span> <span id="s838">So he wanted to know who is the guy who, you know.</span> <span id="s839">So, one day, he comes to Bratislava to see who this young man is.</span> <span id="s840">So, she introduced me to him and, evidently, must have liked me or something because he didn’t object too much.</span> <span id="s841">But that was also in ‘46.</span> <span id="s842">And I stayed there until July or June of ‘48 because I got my -- oh, I must say this -- she got papers, she had interrupted her schooling in Bratislava, and she got papers to come to America in January of ‘45 -- January of ‘48.</span> <span id="s843">And I think she came on January 1st, ‘48, by plane, to New York.</span> <span id="s844">I was still there, still stayed home because I didn’t speak very good English and I went to the American consulate in Prague (ph) for interview.</span> <span id="s845">And the consul, a very nice man, told me, “Please sit down, Mr. Beer.”</span> <span id="s846">And Mr. Beer stands there.</span> <span id="s847">“Would you sit down, Mr. Beer?”</span> <span id="s848">And I didn’t no understand one word he said.</span> <span id="s849">So, he knew right away that my English was not too good.</span> <span id="s850">He says, “Come back in a few months.”</span> <span id="s851">So I took and intensive course in English.</span> <span id="s852">Second time and I passed it.</span> <span id="s853">And I left Czechoslovakia on July 27th, ‘48, and I came by small military boat.</span> <span id="s854">It was called Marine Jumper, which took 10 day from the harbor (ph) to New York.</span> <span id="s855">I was sick 10 days on the boat because I was sea sick.</span> <span id="s856">And I remember, I lived only on the military ration of the big cans of grapefruit juice, it was the green cans, the military cans.</span> <span id="s857">So that’s all.</span> <span id="s858">I was weighing 120 pounds.</span> <span id="s859">So, it was hard to recognize me.</span> <span id="s860">But I came to New York.</span> <span id="s861">She was already waiting at the port.</span> <span id="s862">And August the 5th, I arrived.</span> <span id="s863">And I think that we got married September 28th or 26th, next month.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">[background noise]</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: September 19th, 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: In Bratislava, after the war, what was it like to be a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Not very good.</span> <span id="s868">I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s869">Because in 1946 started the trials of the president of the republic, Dr. Tiso (ph), the vice president of the , and all the collaborators.</span> <span id="s870">Small number of trials (ph).</span> <span id="s871">And I remember one morning, going to school, to medical school, and I see on houses and doors, big placards which says, “Death to these people.</span> <span id="s872">Why?</span> <span id="s873">Because it didn’t kill all the Jews.”</span> <span id="s874">That was the sign.</span> <span id="s875">So, not very good.</span> <span id="s876">So, you know, that was the other thing -- that they should get death, but because it didn’t kill all the Jews at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">So, the population in Bratislava was not very friendly.</span> <span id="s878">And also, in school, I couldn’t say that I noticed anything as such.</span> <span id="s879">But the population wasn’t ready because -- see, Bratislava was very close to Vienna, and there were quite a lot of German population there.</span> <span id="s880">And of course, many Germans were caught, they’re executed, so on.</span> <span id="s881">So, the atmosphere wasn’t very good there.</span> <span id="s882">But you asked me how it was, so, it wasn’t very pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Were your friends in medical school all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Not all.</span> <span id="s885">But quite a few of them were.</span> <span id="s886">And one’s in Rochester, New York, now.</span> <span id="s887">One is living in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s888">And the other friends, who were Slovaks, who went with me -- who graduated with me from high school -- one of them was an instructor in anatomy in a medical school.</span> <span id="s889">And he was very nice, very good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s890">And when my future wife had to take a test, I told him, “Would you be kind enough just to help her out?”</span> <span id="s891">He said, “Of course I will.”</span> <span id="s892">And I remember, he called her up or she called him, and said, “Adam is my boyfriend.”</span> <span id="s893">“Well, sure.”</span> <span id="s894">Very, very kind.</span> <span id="s895">So, I had friends who were already doctors.</span> <span id="s896">And see, because there was five years difference.</span> <span id="s897">And they were either in practice or they were assistant of Medical Supervisor (ph), and he was an instructor in anatomy.</span> <span id="s898">So, it was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Did you start practicing your religion again?</span> <span id="s900">Was it important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Very good question.</span> <span id="s902">I was told, by my future wife, that you cannot be very liberal anymore with our religion (ph).</span> <span id="s903">But, my parents would never stand for it because they were Orthodox.</span> <span id="s904">“And you have to, if you want to continue contact with me, you’ll have to become religious.”</span> <span id="s905">So, it was news to me because -- I’m not saying that her father wasn’t that religious.</span> <span id="s906">He was a very decent, honest man about .</span> <span id="s907">But I said, “Okay, I will.”</span> <span id="s908">And I had to go to several ceremonies and I had to go to Mikwa (ph) -- you know what that is?</span> <span id="s909">And of course, I went to Temple and prayed and, uh, I became a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: The whole time you were in the mountains, you probably didn’t think of religion.</span> <span id="s911">A: No.</span> <span id="s912">No, survival only.</span> <span id="s913">We might have prayed inside, you know.</span> <span id="s914">But . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Was there any special strength that you think helped you all survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Just to live and survive at all, as I say.</span> <span id="s917">It was enough (ph) to just live from day to day because it was very rough, and we knew what was going on down in the city and so on, so we just tried to make it from day to day.</span> <span id="s918">And I think the will to live was strong.</span> <span id="s919">As I say, everybody from our bunker survived.</span> <span id="s920">They are all dead now except -- actually the one young man who -- he is still living.</span> <span id="s921">The other friend of mine, Dr. Braun (ph), he died two years ago.</span> <span id="s922">And of course, our parents are all gone now.</span> <span id="s923">So we are the last of the Mahicans.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Did you think, when you were hiding out, that you would make it through?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: I know that sort of -- I hoped.</span> <span id="s926">But there was no guarantee.</span> <span id="s927">I was living from day to day.</span> <span id="s928">But we hoped.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: When you think about this time, 50 years ago, are there certain images that come to your mind or certain reflections that you’ve had over the years about this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Really, what we can say is that we had a second lease on life.</span> <span id="s931">Because, as I say, my sister died at the age of 23.</span> <span id="s932">From the girls, 300 girls left the town.</span> <span id="s933">Not one came alive back.</span> <span id="s934">The only ones who saved themselves, who didn’t go, you know, who were in the hospital and they survived.</span> <span id="s935">But it was a miracle, really, that we did.</span> <span id="s936">And as I say, if my sister wouldn’t have been the victim, we would have been an intact family.</span> <span id="s937">I’ll say, for example (ph) -- my wife, she probably told you that her mother and father both were in Auschwitz, and they all came alive.</span> <span id="s938">But a different war.</span> <span id="s939">They were taken in ‘44.</span> <span id="s940">See, two years later than my sister went.</span> <span id="s941">So, .</span> <span id="s942">But that was a miracle, too.</span> <span id="s943">Very few families left in tact.</span> <span id="s944">So all I say, see, we are -- well, we’re alive and grateful that we could establish ourselves again.</span> <span id="s945">And we just hope that it never happens again.</span> <span id="s946">That’s all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Do you feel that -- other than the obvious, your sister -- that this period was a great loss of anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: It was -- of course, it was a terrible loss of life, loss of time.</span> <span id="s949">I mean, five years was lost for nothing.</span> <span id="s950">And the things that we went through.</span> <span id="s951">I mean, it’s -- I’m not blaming American people who cannot understand that.</span> <span id="s952">May I just say an example?</span> <span id="s953">Somebody who we knew very well came one day to my wife and asked her -- and she knew she was in Auschwitz -- “Did you have enough protein to eat?”</span> <span id="s954">Now, this was an American person born here.</span> <span id="s955">An unliberation (ph) camp, where people went to be gassed and killed, you ask the question, “Did you have enough protein?”</span> <span id="s956">So, when that happened to my wife, she was shocked from it, you know, but -- let me tell you something.</span> <span id="s957">People cannot -- and I don’t blame them -- they cannot understand what that meant.</span> <span id="s958">And children are torn apart and thrown against the wall.</span> <span id="s959">But human life had no value.</span> <span id="s960">I mean, you killed a person like nothing.</span> <span id="s961">But, yeah.</span> <span id="s962">to come back to some type of normality, that was a big, big step.</span> <span id="s963">Life was worthless there, absolutely worthless.</span> <span id="s964">You have seen murder, killing, I mean -- I was okay, but still, I see what’s going on.</span> <span id="s965">So, it is very, very hard to comprehend.</span> <span id="s966">But American people, thank God, don’t know this.</span> <span id="s967">And I really don’t blame them.</span> <span id="s968">But it was a very foolish question.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Was it a big adjustment when you arrived here?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Well, it was, it was, yes.</span> <span id="s971">First of all, we were hungry.</span> <span id="s972">There was no food.</span> <span id="s973">Suddenly, you got here to the land of plenty.</span> <span id="s974">It was hard, you know, to see all the things when you -- I remember, for instance, when we were still home.</span> <span id="s975">And when you got a banana.</span> <span id="s976">I remember, very clearly, a banana was cut in four parts, so each one, a member of the family could get something, you know?</span> <span id="s977">Or an orange.</span> <span id="s978">Oranges are a thing to see.</span> <span id="s979">Those were the real thing.</span> <span id="s980">During the war.</span> <span id="s981">Before the war, it was no problem.</span> <span id="s982">So, I’d just been to the plentifulness of this country.</span> <span id="s983">And the free life.</span> <span id="s984">It was something which was hard to comprehend.</span> <span id="s985">For instance, I remember -- I always carry some documentation with me because I never knew when the police would stop me and ask me for documentation, because it was normal there.</span> <span id="s986">The people are lucky, why do you have that?</span> <span id="s987">Maybe I would be stopped.</span> <span id="s988">You know, in the beginning it was (ph).</span> <span id="s989">“Who will examine you?”</span> <span id="s990">Things like that.</span> <span id="s991">So, they are different worlds.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Were these some of your first impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: First impressions, yeah.</span> <span id="s994">Or for instance, when I first bought a car here, it was in 1940, I bought an air conditioned car.</span> <span id="s995">By that I mean it had a big hole on the floor, so it was good air conditioning, you know?</span> <span id="s996">But it was all I could afford.</span> <span id="s997">And we were used to brake the motor (ph), because it was the only way to survive.</span> <span id="s998">So, I remember very clearly, I wonder sometimes how I did it -- I never stopped for a stoplight.</span> <span id="s999">I went through.</span> <span id="s1000">Until one day I was caught.</span> <span id="s1001">And I learned a lesson.</span> <span id="s1002">Because that was the way to survive.</span> <span id="s1003">You had to break the law.</span> <span id="s1004">You know, you had to fight for your life.</span> <span id="s1005">And so, the first year or so -- it’s scares me -- I went through the stoplight.</span> <span id="s1006">I looked in the mirror for any cop there, and if no, I went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">.</span> <span id="s1008">So, I wanted to tell you that you had to readjust.</span> <span id="s1009">So, it was different, different life.</span> <span id="s1010">And I was very surprised for this one thing -- I don’t know if this is interesting to you or not -- I was stopped here by an American friend, and someone would speak to me, “How are you?”</span> <span id="s1011">He’d always ask me.</span> <span id="s1012">SO I would say, “Oh, I will tell you.</span> <span id="s1013">Please sit down with me and I will tell you everything.”</span> <span id="s1014">You know, I thought that he really wanted to know how I am and I wanted to tell him my story.</span> <span id="s1015">“Oh, dear, I’m -- good-bye, see you next time.”</span> <span id="s1016">Then I learned that “How are you?”</span> <span id="s1017">doesn’t mean nothing, you know.</span> <span id="s1018">Things like that, you know, they are strange to me.</span> <span id="s1019">So, now I know what “How are you?”</span> <span id="s1020">means.</span> <span id="s1021">It was an adjustment.</span> <span id="s1022">And of course, I worked.</span> <span id="s1023">I went to school during the day, I worked at night at the doctor’s hospital as an orderly, .</span> <span id="s1024">I worked at Hospital.</span> <span id="s1025">And there was pathologist there who was from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1026">And I told him that I was a medical student there and so on, and that I could use the job.</span> <span id="s1027">So he found me a job to do autopsies, when somebody dies, autopsies need to be done.</span> <span id="s1028">So he called me and I remember, I got $10 per call, whether I was called or not, $10.</span> <span id="s1029">That was big money that time in ‘49.</span> <span id="s1030">So I was doing this for about six months.</span> <span id="s1031">And the last autopsy which I had to do, I was called, I go.</span> <span id="s1032">And on the table lies a man whom I have seen two days alive.</span> <span id="s1033">He was a father.</span> <span id="s1034">We were working in as houseparents.</span> <span id="s1035">And this man was the father of a girl that was a housemother.</span> <span id="s1036">He died suddenly, so his autopsy -- and I was the guy who would do it.</span> <span id="s1037">I was so freaked out that I took out this, what’s called the cholera, the wrong way so it was shown (ph).</span> <span id="s1038">And they had to fix him and it was very .</span> <span id="s1039">So things like that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">One way to make a living.</span> <span id="s1041">And I was working.</span> <span id="s1042">I worked as an electrician during a year or so.</span> <span id="s1043">And mostly, after , I got rich.</span> <span id="s1044">And then I realized that . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Anything else you want to add about -- I don’t think we have too much time, but is there anything else you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Well, you could ask me.</span> <span id="s1047">There are so many things I could tell you, but it just doesn’t come to my mind.</span> <span id="s1048">What else could I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: We’re about out on this tape, aren’t we?</span> <span id="s1050">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
