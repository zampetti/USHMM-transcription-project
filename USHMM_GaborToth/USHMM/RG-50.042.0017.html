id="s11">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Tell me what you remember of your impressions when the war began.</span> <span id="s13">How life changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Well, the whole summer people were whispering and men were politicking and talking about there's going to be a war.</span> <span id="s15">Uh, our, my life was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s16">We lived in a nice house, my father had a good business.</span> <span id="s17">We just lived a very, very nice life, comfortable life, uh, was the usual luxuries of middle class people, you know, a maid and well-dressed and then going on vacations and, and having good times.</span> <span id="s18">But there was always talk and the men were always whispering, the children were not even supposed to hear, but we knew something is cooking.</span> <span id="s19">And then, just prior to 9/1, my father left.</span> <span id="s20">Uh, he left to escape the Germans.</span> <span id="s21">Rumor was that the children and women were, will be treated civilly.</span> <span id="s22">The men would be put to work, or sent to concentration camp or whatever they would do with them.</span> <span id="s23">So, my father along with a few men, got a bus and a driver, and decided to leave town, and go to the other side so to speak, you know, to the Russian side, which would be occupied by the Russians, and see what happens.</span> <span id="s24">Maybe come back, maybe what--.</span> <span id="s25">And everything changed.</span> <span id="s26">My mother had to go to the store, which she never did before.</span> <span id="s27">I was left with my little sister to take care of her.</span> <span id="s28">I was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s29">She was one, exactly one year old.</span> <span id="s30">And, then the rationing came in and, and we had to wear an armband, a white armband.</span> <span id="s31">There, there were every day there were different, different um rules coming out, you know, wearing a white arm band with the blue star of David, and there was a curfew, and number one, no school for Jewish children.</span> <span id="s32">9/3 was supposed to be a school day, which never happened for the Jewish children, we couldn't go to school.</span> <span id="s33">Uh, my mother tried to get us private tutoring during that time, which was an older cousin who has graduated already from gymnasium, and she was qualified enough to teach 3rd, 4th, 5th grade.</span> <span id="s34">Uh, the children were left more or less to themselves.</span> <span id="s35">The parents were busy, either worrying or doing something or being...occupied otherwise.</span> <span id="s36">Um, but basically, for myself, we stayed in the house for about 2 years, I think, maybe a little less, until the whole thing changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Tell me, describe for me the Germans, your impression of them, and describe the Gestapo, and how you saw the---------, what you thought of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Okay.</span> <span id="s39">They were walking, well, when they first came in, they came, the army came in, they were throwing candy to the children, and the parents said, "Don't pick it up, it might be poisoned," and they ob-obviously knew about it because they took a bite out of it to show it wasn't.</span> <span id="s40">But after they marched in, very quietly, not one shot was fired, we watched the Gestapo with the dogs, with the two German shepherds on each side, with the polished boots, with the, with the hat, with the pride, with the, with the --------------very scary.</span> <span id="s41">Just to look at them was scary.</span> <span id="s42">They even confiscated a couple dogs from our neighbor.</span> <span id="s43">They were Dalmatians.</span> <span id="s44">To this day, when I see a Dalmatian, a beautiful Dalmatian, I cannot help but think about this horrible thing because, they just took it, I don't know, in order to give it back maybe later or what.</span> <span id="s45">In the meantime, they took them.</span> <span id="s46">They were walking with those dogs, they were walking with the German shepherds, and they, they were carrying a thing, I don't know, it was a stick or something, next to them like, God they were, they were like Gods, they were like, they thought of them themselves, and we were petrified, just to look.</span> <span id="s47">You know, you were afraid to look at their faces.</span> <span id="s48">And the children were afraid to look at their faces.</span> <span id="s49">There was such power.</span> <span id="s50">There was such, and such fear in us.</span> <span id="s51">It was such, you thought, if you just looked at them, they would smite you, they would just throw you against something.</span> <span id="s52">Because when are we, we heard about the stories where they didn't waste a shot on a child because the children were just thrown against a brick or a or a stone wall or something and smashed their heads.</span> <span id="s53">So as children, we were very much afraid, very much afraid to just look at them.</span> <span id="s54">Uh, nothing you could do about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Did your mother know what was going on during this time, and how much did she tell you of what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">I don't know how much she knew.</span> <span id="s57">She prob--she didn't tell much.</span> <span id="s58">She didn't want to, I don't know, the, the, the upbringing of children in Europe was such, you don't tell, you don't upset the children, you don't tell the children.</span> <span id="s59">The children are protected.</span> <span id="s60">The children are gentle.</span> <span id="s61">You don't upset children.</span> <span id="s62">But, every day, there were people called to go to, to labor.</span> <span id="s63">You know, to pull stones out of the river in order to make little bricks to build the roads.</span> <span id="s64">You know when I was in Europe, and I saw the roads built in a sort of uh pattern, um, with that scalloped pattern, I know that the Jews built that road, out of the stones that were pulled out of the water that they had to manually make into squares.</span> <span id="s65">This is what they were doing.</span> <span id="s66">And there were some people that couldn't do that kind of work.</span> <span id="s67">There were sick people, there were older people.</span> <span id="s68">Some people never came back from that work.</span> <span id="s69">Either they dropped, or they got sick, or whatever.</span> <span id="s70">So, the, the first year and a half when they came into my town was mostly this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s71">They were catching people to, to go to work and, and confiscating merchandise from the store.</span> <span id="s72">They would come with big trucks and confiscate a lot of--my father had a hardware store, and they needed a lot of stuff from the store.</span> <span id="s73">And they would always give my mother a shine or a, a, a bill to collect a hundred years from now, whatever, nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s74">Uh, so this was mostly what was going on, there was a lot of hunger, there was, food was not available.</span> <span id="s75">Uh, people stood in line for hours to get a piece of bread, you know, that was hard bread or, or, or so soft that it was almost raw.</span> <span id="s76">Either way.</span> <span id="s77">Personally, we were in a lucky position because, before my father left, he provided, he called the mill and had delivered, had them deliver a sack of white flour and black flour, and also told my mother to buy a sack of salt and sugar.</span> <span id="s78">Apparently he remembered something from the first war.</span> <span id="s79">And, personally I was not hungry.</span> <span id="s80">We took the flour to the baker, and he baked bread for us, so I was quite fortunate as far as that goes.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Tell me about your responsibilities when your mother went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">When my mother went to work, I had to take care of my little sister.</span> <span id="s83">I couldn't go to play.</span> <span id="s84">Naturally she wanted to run after me.</span> <span id="s85">Uh, she was a year old.</span> <span id="s86">I trained her to go to the potty, and to this day, she reminds me that af-after a while, I also taught her how to carry the potty out.</span> <span id="s87">She still remembers this.</span> <span id="s88">I (laughs), I was trying to---------, I guess.</span> <span id="s89">So, we went along most of the time until my mother got somebody to stay with us.</span> <span id="s90">Uh, she could very well afford it, and she got a woman to stay, clean the house and stay with the children, and this gave me an opportunity to go out and play.</span> <span id="s91">Not a whole lot because we didn't want to be very visible, but in the backyard a little bit, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Your family refused to register, am I right about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Okay.</span> <span id="s96">One day, there was, there was an order that everyone should come to the city hall and register.</span> <span id="s97">I don't know why, my mother said, "I'm not going to register."</span> <span id="s98">Neither she nor her parents, nor her sister registered, including the children.</span> <span id="s99">We had no idea what it was for, but we just didn't.</span> <span id="s100">The day after, there was another order.</span> <span id="s101">All people that registered had to come to the city hall, was whatever, if they wanted to carry something, they'll be sent out.</span> <span id="s102">And I'll never forget, I was in my grandparent's house standing with my aunt in the window, and we saw people, it was a rainy day.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Wait, we have to do this one again.</span> <span id="s104">We just ran out.</span> <span id="s105">So we'll have to start that again on the next roll.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Now when you tell me about what you did refusing to register, just start at the beginning as though you haven't told it already.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">All right.</span> <span id="s110">You have to ask me the question again?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Okay.</span> <span id="s112">Your family refused to register.</span> <span id="s113">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Okay.</span> <span id="s115">One day, there was an order.</span> <span id="s116">Everybody has to come and register at the city hall.</span> <span id="s117">My mother for some reason refused to go, and also her sister and her parents and the children.</span> <span id="s118">I don't know why, but this was her decision, and we didn't register.</span> <span id="s119">The following day, there was another order.</span> <span id="s120">Everybody that registered yesterday, come to City Hall, and get your belongings.</span> <span id="s121">So, I remember standing in my grandpar-parents house with my aunt in the window, and it was a rainy day, and we saw all these people going with little packages, with little bundles in their hands, carrying children, children by the hand, going in the direction of the river.</span> <span id="s122">We had no idea where they are going, but later we found out, they were all going toward the River ---------, and across the border to the Russian side.</span> <span id="s123">For some reason, that one day, they opened the, the border, and the Germans got rid of these people, and the Russians accepted them.</span> <span id="s124">We felt very, very sorry for them.</span> <span id="s125">Look where they are going.</span> <span id="s126">We are still in our home.</span> <span id="s127">It's warm, it's not raining, we have what to eat.</span> <span id="s128">Poor people, they went.</span> <span id="s129">Little did we know, that these people would remain alive because they would remain side, maybe they'll be sent to Siberia later on, all this, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s130">We were safe in our homes.</span> <span id="s131">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s132">We didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Now describe to me the escape that you made on the train with your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Okay.</span> <span id="s135">At one time, they were going to erect the ghetto, and people between 18 and 40 could go into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s136">Everybody else was going to be sent somewhere else.</span> <span id="s137">Nobody knew where.</span> <span id="s138">My mother had two children, ten, my, at that time, 11-1/2 probably, and 1-1/2 or 2.</span> <span id="s139">Well, she knew she can't go with the children into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s140">So she decided to do something about it.</span> <span id="s141">My aunt, she had a sister who lived in a different city, and the action was over in that city.</span> <span id="s142">In other words, they went through their selection, and she said to me, "Get on the train, and go to Krasno," this was the city where my aunt lived, "find out if they're alive, maybe we can join them."</span> <span id="s143">I knew they weren't at their old address.</span> <span id="s144">This I knew.</span> <span id="s145">So, I got on a train, and I went to Krasno, and I looked up the Jewish Community Center or whatever that was called at that time, it had a different name in Polish.</span> <span id="s146">And I went there, and I asked about the family, and they told me, "Yes, they're alive, they, they survived the selection and they're working in a factory."</span> <span id="s147">And they told me where to go, and I did.</span> <span id="s148">When I came there, my aunt said, "Just stay with us.</span> <span id="s149">Don't go back.</span> <span id="s150">We have to be here.</span> <span id="s151">We are working."</span> <span id="s152">And, I had a cousin who is a year older than I.</span> <span id="s153">She says, "Somehow we'll inter-interchange the two of you, and you stay with us.</span> <span id="s154">Don't go back, there's no future there, you'll all get killed.</span> <span id="s155">Just stay here."</span> <span id="s156">I said, "I can't do that, I have to go back."</span> <span id="s157">So, I went back.</span> <span id="s158">It was a Friday night, I came home.</span> <span id="s159">And, I don't know what made me say it.</span> <span id="s160">To this day, I really don't know.</span> <span id="s161">I said to my mother, "Tante Malca said we should come to stay with them."</span> <span id="s162">My mother took my word for it.</span> <span id="s163">So the next day, she contacted a Polish lady, who was going to take my sister and me to Krasno, and my mother, and come back, and take my mother later.</span> <span id="s164">She didn't want all of us to travel together because we would be recognized, especially my mother, you know.</span> <span id="s165">Children is different.</span> <span id="s166">And, so it was, she packed up a suitcase, she gave me a briefcase with some stuff, I didn't know what was in it, and we went to the station, and as soon as the train started moving, some people said, "I think these are Shverga's???</span> <span id="s167">children travelling."</span> <span id="s168">My father was very well-known in the city, and they recognized the children, and the minute the woman heard this, she disappeared.</span> <span id="s169">She got out of the compartment, and she disappeared.</span> <span id="s170">I didn't know what to think about it, but when this, we came to the station, my sister and I got off, and right there, at the stairs, there were two very tall Secret Service men, and they asked me my name, and they said, uh, they asked me my name first, and I said, "Stefa Nevayetska."</span> <span id="s171">This was my neighbor's daughter's name, and they said to me, "So where are you, who are you coming to, where are you going?"</span> <span id="s172">And I said, "We are coming to my aunt, but she's not here, and I don't what to do."</span> <span id="s173">I was petrified.</span> <span id="s174">I knew what all this meant.</span> <span id="s175">Um, they did not wear a uniform, but we knew Secret, uh, you know, what Secret Service looked like, and, I'm looking around, I don't see that woman, and, I didn't know what to do, and an-anyways, they asked me if was Jewish, I said, "No."</span> <span id="s176">And, again, they asked me what, who are we coming to.</span> <span id="s177">I said, "Well, my aunt is not here.</span> <span id="s178">I don't know where she lives, and I don't know how to get to her house."</span> <span id="s179">I really don't know what spoke through me.</span> <span id="s180">I wasn't prepared for it.</span> <span id="s181">And, as a child I never lied.</span> <span id="s182">I still don't to this day, but something spoke through me, I, I really believe it, and they said, "Well, then we'll have to take you to the police."</span> <span id="s183">I said, "That's a very good idea.</span> <span id="s184">Maybe you can help me locate my aunt."</span> <span id="s185">And, inside I was praying, I was hoping they won't ask for her name, because I didn't have a name for her.</span> <span id="s186">I couldn’t, could not have said her real name.</span> <span id="s187">And I was not prepared for name, but they never asked.</span> <span id="s188">And we, they, well, they started walking us, and they were asking what was in my briefcase.</span> <span id="s189">It was actually a big schoolbag that I had, leather, and I said, "I really don't know.</span> <span id="s190">My mother packed it."</span> <span id="s191">And, one of them said, "Oh, a couple days ago, a girl just like you, Jewish, came here, and she had a bag just like yours, leather bag, and you know what was in it?</span> <span id="s192">Five kilos of gold."</span> <span id="s193">I said, "Well, I don't think I have 5 kilos of gold, but you're welcome to open it up.</span> <span id="s194">And they opened it up, and I almost died on the spot, because what was in that bag was some tomatoes that my mother picked from the garden, and a big Jewish bread, like a twisted challa.</span> <span id="s195">Now, everybody knows in Poland that only Jews eat a twisted challa for Shabbat.</span> <span id="s196">Polish people never eat a twisted Challa Shabbat.</span> <span id="s197">They may have a twisted bread for Easter, but not Shabbat.</span> <span id="s198">When I saw this, I was sure that they would know who I am.</span> <span id="s199">I must have had a guardian angel, oh maybe, my dead father was watching over us.</span> <span id="s200">They didn't see it.</span> <span id="s201">They didn't acknowledge it.</span> <span id="s202">They didn't pay attention.</span> <span id="s203">They closed the bag.</span> <span id="s204">But they questioned us, again and again and again.</span> <span id="s205">Your name.</span> <span id="s206">Where did you come, this...In the meantime, it was a hot day, and my little sister got tired, and she called me by my Jewish name, that she is tired.</span> <span id="s207">"Soluna, I'm tired, I can't walk."</span> <span id="s208">And I said, "Stefa cannot help you.</span> <span id="s209">I'm tired myself."</span> <span id="s210">She said, "Soluna," and I said, "Stefa."</span> <span id="s211">Now any Polish man knows that Sala, Sara, Soluna, is a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s212">Stefa, Stefa is a Christian name.</span> <span id="s213">They didn't hear my little sister.</span> <span id="s214">I truly considered this a miracle.</span> <span id="s215">Finally, they said to me, um, "Okay, you can go.</span> <span id="s216">You can go."</span> <span id="s217">So, I said to myself, "All right, we'll go, and they'll follow me, and they'll know exactly where I'm going," because I knew where my aunt had an apt., even though they were working in a camp, they still kept an apt.</span> <span id="s218">So, we were going around and around in circle, and the heat was incredible, but we walked around, and I kept looking back, but I didn't see them.</span> <span id="s219">Finally I decided to take a walk.</span> <span id="s220">And we walked to the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Why don't you pick that up, and then I want to jump right into --------------.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Remember where you were, you and your sister starting to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Okay.</span> <span id="s227">We started to walk towards my aunt's apt.</span> <span id="s228">When we came there, the house was locked.</span> <span id="s229">There was nobody in the house.</span> <span id="s230">There were 2 outhouses, so I decided to go and sit in the outhouse until the landlady would come because we were afraid to sit outside.</span> <span id="s231">We sat in the stinking outhouse for a long time until the landlady came.</span> <span id="s232">When she came, we came out, and she has met me before because at one time that I was there, my cousin took me to the place, and she knew who I was, and I ask her could we come in, and she says, "Yeah, I'll let you into your aunt's apt.," and she let us in.</span> <span id="s233">Nobody knew where we were because the lady that took us across never showed up, and we were sitting in the apt all alone, the 2 of us, until somebody from the family came, I don't know how many days later, sitting there crying we were.</span> <span id="s234">I didn't know about my mother, if she is alive, she didn't know about us, if we were alive, she had no idea what happened to us, she kept going back to the woman's house, and she must have been hiding from her because her husband only kept saying, "Because of you I lost my wife.</span> <span id="s235">She never came back, which in retrospect, I realize that she did come back, because nothing did happen to her, nobody caught her.</span> <span id="s236">So my mother didn't know what happened to us, and she subsequently went into hiding for a few days in order to be uh out of the ghetto so she should be uh, uh reconnected with us.</span> <span id="s237">Now, the way we were reconnected is another miracle.</span> <span id="s238">My mother went into hiding, and then after a few days, she sent a man into Krasno to look for 2 children.</span> <span id="s239">She had no idea where her sister lived.</span> <span id="s240">She had no idea what happened to us.</span> <span id="s241">The poor man was walking the streets.</span> <span id="s242">He, he didn't know who to ask.</span> <span id="s243">He didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s244">Finally, he approached a young woman, and asked her if she knew about Eddinger family.</span> <span id="s245">And that was my cousin.</span> <span id="s246">Why he asked her, only, I don't know.</span> <span id="s247">She brought him over, and he told me, "Your mother is alive, I'm going to bring her in, in a few days."</span> <span id="s248">And, he did.</span> <span id="s249">At night, he bandaged her face, supposedly that she has a big toothache, and she came with his wife's uh Ausweihs??</span> <span id="s250">and we, we, we got reconnected.</span> <span id="s251">Now we stayed in my aunt's apt for a few days, and my mother talked to Mrs. Olefska, who was the landlady, and she said, "What are we to do?"</span> <span id="s252">She says, "I'll tell you what.</span> <span id="s253">Your sister paid a month's rent.</span> <span id="s254">She only stayed here 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s255">She didn't want any money back.</span> <span id="s256">You can stay for 2 weeks of the remainder of the month, for what your sister paid.</span> <span id="s257">My mother said, "Fine.</span> <span id="s258">Very nice."</span> <span id="s259">After 2 weeks, she said to Mrs. Olefska, "What do we do now?"</span> <span id="s260">And she said, "I don't think I can throw you out.</span> <span id="s261">You have nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s262">I'm going to keep you as long as I can."</span> <span id="s263">All right.</span> <span id="s264">Now I'm going to interrupt you.</span> <span id="s265">Describe Mrs. Olefska for me, and then just tell me in general what she did for you, your mother and your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Mrs. Olefska was, well, first I have to say, she's an angel.</span> <span id="s267">She went straight to heaven.</span> <span id="s268">She was a beautiful, physically beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s269">Tall, with swept up hair, beautiful smile, deeply religious, with a heart of gold, obviously.</span> <span id="s270">The woman went to mass every single day, and if she sold a piece of jewelry for us, what my mother gave her, and my mother would say, "Take a little money from this," she would not accept it.</span> <span id="s271">And Mama would say, "Take a little money when you go to mass, and give it to the poor."</span> <span id="s272">And she would say, "There are no poorer people than you.</span> <span id="s273">Your children have no fresh air.</span> <span id="s274">You have no light.</span> <span id="s275">You have no freedom.</span> <span id="s276">Nobody is poorer than you."</span> <span id="s277">She wouldn't take a penny, never, she never took a penny.</span> <span id="s278">She did it out of the goodness of her heart.</span> <span id="s279">She was incredible.</span> <span id="s280">And we didn't even have a chance to thank her, because after the war, not after the war actually, after the liberation, when my mother went back to her, and, you know, just, just to tell her that we're going back to our hometown and, she says, "Please, don't stay in touch with me.</span> <span id="s281">Don't ever come back.</span> <span id="s282">I don't want my neighbors to see you.</span> <span id="s283">I am afraid for the safety of my, of my life.</span> <span id="s284">My Polish people, my Polish brothers, will not forgive me for saving a Jewish life."</span> <span id="s285">She was in jeopardy, and we never could say thank you.</span> <span id="s286">(Cries) Tell me for how long she hid you, and tell me some of the logistics of hiding, how hard was it for her?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Well, at first we were in this room.</span> <span id="s288">I don't exactly know if it was a year or two or maybe 18 months.</span> <span id="s289">It really is difficult for me to put a time on it, but it was for a long time.</span> <span id="s290">So at first we were in my aunt's apt, but because housing was scarce, people were on her back uh, to rent it out.</span> <span id="s291">You know, why don't you rent out the apt, it's an empty apt, and she always found an excuse, but finally a member of her family, a distant member of her family said, needed an apt, and she had to let them have it.</span> <span id="s292">So, she put us up in an attic.</span> <span id="s293">It was actually an attic room, you know, one of those, and we were, had to be extremely quiet because we walk upstairs, you can hear it downstairs.</span> <span id="s294">That is...so we were quiet, we were either walking on tippy toes or just sitting on a bed.</span> <span id="s295">She would bring us a pot of soup and some bread, and again her goodness.</span> <span id="s296">The bread was sometimes 2 or 3 weeks old because, you know, bread was rationed, so her brother would go to the army to buy bread.</span> <span id="s297">He had to go to the other side of town to buy bread.</span> <span id="s298">And it was stamped with the date, and we were laughing about it, sometimes it was 10 days old, sometimes 2 weeks old, was hard as rock, and so she came up with the idea that she's going to buy some apples, and if you scrape apples, and put them on bread, it will soften the bread for the children.</span> <span id="s299">This is how concerned she was.</span> <span id="s300">But, this too had to end because somebody else needed the room upstairs.</span> <span id="s301">A young student wanted the room.</span> <span id="s302">And, she did not have any excuse not to rent it out.</span> <span id="s303">Can I get a tissue, ughh, please, I don't know if you can stop.</span> <span id="s304">I feel I'm dripping.</span> <span id="s305">Take 4 is up.</span> <span id="s306">Okay.</span> <span id="s307">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Let's just back up a little bit to the food, and also tell me how she respected your mother's religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">I will.</span> <span id="s310">Okay.</span> <span id="s311">I told you that she cooked soup for us.</span> <span id="s312">Now, my mother was very orthodox.</span> <span id="s313">Mrs. Olefska was deeply religious, and she respected my mother's religion also.</span> <span id="s314">She knew that it had to be kosher.</span> <span id="s315">So she took one pot, which she said she'll scrub it out real good, and she won't use any fat at all.</span> <span id="s316">So, she cooked potato soup for us every single day, she browned some flour first, never tou--and she had one spoon, she bought a new spoon, and she had this one pot, which she always used only for us.</span> <span id="s317">My mother didn't have any un-kosher food for the duration of the hiding.</span> <span id="s318">Never in her life for that matter, but this is how she respected my mother's religiousness.</span> <span id="s319">This by itself should tell you something about her character.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Talk to me about what it was like to have to live in hiding, to be in the darkness, what you did -------------------.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">First of all, we had to be very very quiet.</span> <span id="s323">We could not talk.</span> <span id="s324">In fact, after the war, none of us had voices.</span> <span id="s325">We were totally hoarse.</span> <span id="s326">We lost our voices from whispering.</span> <span id="s327">As a matter of fact, uh what I gave up, I gave up my childhood.</span> <span id="s328">We were never playing, we would never go outside, uh, after a while, we went into a basement where we were hiding.</span> <span id="s329">We could hear children play outside.</span> <span id="s330">We could hear music played in an upstairs apt.</span> <span id="s331">We could hear people walking.</span> <span id="s332">We had none of this.</span> <span id="s333">We had no sunshine.</span> <span id="s334">As a matter of fact, I developed a goiter.</span> <span id="s335">My neck became totally swollen.</span> <span id="s336">One day my mother said to Mrs. Olefska, "Look at her."</span> <span id="s337">And she says, "Oh, my God, even if she lives through, she'll be a cripple."</span> <span id="s338">So, being summer, it must have been the next summer already, on a very quiet afternoon, Mrs. Olefska came in the basement, and she says, "You have to come with me."</span> <span id="s339">And she took me, it was very quiet day, there was nobody on the street.</span> <span id="s340">She took me out on a hill, and she says, "You have to sit in the sun.</span> <span id="s341">You have no sun.</span> <span id="s342">Maybe that will help you."</span> <span id="s343">And she did it quite a few times.</span> <span id="s344">Uh, I have a perfectly good neck, thanks to her.</span> <span id="s345">Um, to pass the time, I taught my sister how to read the newspaper, so the first time the newspaper came, the 2 year old read it before we did.</span> <span id="s346">Including the obituary and the matrimonial, and the lost and found, and the...ads, and all the politics and everything.</span> <span id="s347">We tried to remember songs.</span> <span id="s348">We used to whisper songs to each other.</span> <span id="s349">And one day she said to me, "Let's write it down.</span> <span id="s350">Maybe when we live.</span> <span id="s351">Maybe if we live, we could sing these songs."</span> <span id="s352">So, I, I, I used to sing a lot when I was a child, and I had an older cousin who used to teach me all the newest uh, what you call it uh, the newest songs.</span> <span id="s353">And, we wrote down like 23 of them.</span> <span id="s354">Um, oh we also watched the rats go by.</span> <span id="s355">Mostly we just sat around.</span> <span id="s356">I taught myself how to knit.</span> <span id="s357">Took apart an old sweater, and I found some knitting needles, and taught myself how to knit.</span> <span id="s358">I read everything that was there.</span> <span id="s359">Mrs. Olefska being a very pious woman, she had some religious magazines there, and Saint Anthony became my saint, and I prayed to him too.</span> <span id="s360">Uh, I don't remember anymore a saint of who he was, but I adopted him.</span> <span id="s361">He was from Padua.</span> <span id="s362">So, many times when my mother had to leave for a while and didn't come back immediately, I would pray to my father, I would pray to God, and I would pray to St. Anthony, whoever would listen.</span> <span id="s363">Ah...</span></p> <p><span id="s364">What about fear?</span> <span id="s365">Were you afraid a lot of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">The fear was constant.</span> <span id="s367">The fear was non-stop.</span> <span id="s368">The fear was that somebody will come into the basement.</span> <span id="s369">The fear was that somebody will listen.</span> <span id="s370">The fear was that somebody will give a cough.</span> <span id="s371">My sister developed uh whooping cough, which is a horrible cough with a lot of loud coughing.</span> <span id="s372">We taught the little one to put a large pillow over her face.</span> <span id="s373">I don't know how she didn't suffocate.</span> <span id="s374">When the attack came, she coughed into the pillow.</span> <span id="s375">The fear was constant.</span> <span id="s376">A, a wrong word from somebody.</span> <span id="s377">Uh, I don't know how, but somebody must have noticed some action around the basement, although they were very careful.</span> <span id="s378">The woman that lived upstairs in the apt that we previously occupied said, said one day to Mrs. Olefska, she says, "You know, after the war, after the war is over, I wonder about those Jews that are hiding here.</span> <span id="s379">I wonder what they would, how this would come out, what, what would happen, how they would behave."</span> <span id="s380">And she was so innocent she did not expect anything, or suspect anything, she says, "Why, um, I think it will be all right."</span> <span id="s381">This gave it away, she didn't realize, and immediately the woman went and told on us, but another miracle happened.</span> <span id="s382">The Russian front was coming closer and there was bombing, and Mrs. Ol--and, I have to tell you, I have to describe the basement.</span> <span id="s383">There was a staircase going down from the house, and there was a door going out into the backyard, into the garden, and it was always locked.</span> <span id="s384">We were locked in, except for when they came to take our pail, and to bring us food and water.</span> <span id="s385">This one day, Mrs. Olefska's brother came down, and he said to my mother, "You know what, I'm going to leave the door to the, to the garden open tonight.</span> <span id="s386">There's a lot of bombing going on.</span> <span id="s387">What if the house if bombed, and you're caught in the fire.</span> <span id="s388">You have to have an escape, you can't, you, you are locked in.</span> <span id="s389">So, he left the door unlocked, I mean, the door was closed, but not locked on a lock.</span> <span id="s390">This was the same day when the woman talked to Mrs. Olefska about us.</span> <span id="s391">Naturally, it didn't take long as she went and told, and, at night, we hear people coming down the stairs, knocking on the door.</span> <span id="s392">------------------------------, "Jews, open up!"</span> <span id="s393">We were in our night clothes, and I said to my mother, "The door is open, let's get out, let's go into the garden."</span> <span id="s394">At first Mama was hesitant, but I started running, she came after me with my sister.</span> <span id="s395">We were in our night clothes, we hid in the bushes, and a second later, they were inside, and we could see the flashlight going around.</span> <span id="s396">They found our bed.</span> <span id="s397">We were sure they were going to search more, and then we heard them laugh, they says, "Oh the old man is probably sleeping here.</span> <span id="s398">He is afraid of the bombs.</span> <span id="s399">There is nobody here," and they left.</span> <span id="s400">Call it what you want.</span> <span id="s401">That's a miracle.</span> <span id="s402">After this, she took us back in for one day, and she said, "You can't be here any longer.</span> <span id="s403">It's suspicious.</span> <span id="s404">You have to find a place."</span> <span id="s405">And she told us where to go.</span> <span id="s406">There was a woman living alone in a field.</span> <span id="s407">She was a maid in the city.</span> <span id="s408">She built herself a little house, a two-room house, a little bedroom and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s409">So she lives all by herself.</span> <span id="s410">The child still is coughing, go to her, and tell her, it used to be said that if you have whooping cough, a change of city, a change of climate will help.</span> <span id="s411">She says, "You have the perfect excuse.</span> <span id="s412">Go to the woman, tell her you are coming with a sick child, and Mama did that.</span> <span id="s413">She went to the woman, said, told her this, and she rented us the kitchen.</span> <span id="s414">She occupied the bedroom, and we had the kitchen, and my sister was coughing, and this was a very rigid excuse, you know.</span> <span id="s415">Well, after a while, my sister stopped coughing.</span> <span id="s416">It went away.</span> <span id="s417">And the woman, everybody was suspicious.</span> <span id="s418">She says, "Well, the child is not coughing anymore, and why don't you go back."</span> <span id="s419">So my mother said, "Look, they're looking for me.</span> <span id="s420">They, you know, they want to send me to labor, uh slave labor in Germany.</span> <span id="s421">You know, they took Polish people also.</span> <span id="s422">And, since I have no husband, I cannot leave my children with my brother or sister all day.</span> <span id="s423">My sister was not very good to my children.</span> <span id="s424">So I really don't have where to go, and I'm running away from the Germans because I don't want to go to slave labor."</span> <span id="s425">Never mentioning being Jewish, you know we had papers and all this.</span> <span id="s426">She says, "Oh, you're just telling me this.</span> <span id="s427">You, you don't have a brother."</span> <span id="s428">Momma said, "Why, you want to meet my brother?</span> <span id="s429">Okay."</span> <span id="s430">So she wrote to a man, who used to be a customer in my father's store.</span> <span id="s431">He also used to be a customer after my father was away, and Mama had the store.</span> <span id="s432">And, she wrote to him to come and see us, and be, be a brother for the day.</span> <span id="s433">Now, there's a whole story about this man, too, maybe I'll tell you later, but now I want to tell you how we came.</span> <span id="s434">Anyways, he came, and she was at work.</span> <span id="s435">He brought a bottle of vodka, he brought food for us, he never came empty-handed, and he wanted, waited for the woman to come home from work.</span> <span id="s436">And, he was, he was a nice Polish man, with Polish looks, with Polish speak, speech, I mean, you couldn't mistake him for anything else.</span> <span id="s437">And, he came and Mama introduced him as her brother, and we were his nieces, and he spoke to her, and he said to her, "You know, I have a very nice wife, but she doesn't like my sister, and she doesn't like her children, and you have to help this woman out, otherwise the, the Germans are going to take her for slave labor into Germany, and what's going to be with the children.</span> <span id="s438">And he gave her Schnapps, and she was in a good mood, and he left her the whole bottle, and a big salami on top of it, and he left.</span> <span id="s439">And, to this day, I think she's convinced that he's the brother.</span> <span id="s440">So, she accepted this.</span> <span id="s441">She let us be.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Because I realize you're going to select what you want to select, but I think it's important.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Yeah, go.</span> <span id="s446">Go ahead, tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Okay.</span> <span id="s448">Well, first I want to tell you that for the longest time I didn't speak about all this because I didn't think that my story was that important, compared to all the other horror stories that I have heard from other people.</span> <span id="s449">But I feel it's very important to know that people like Penny Olefska and Pandish Vitsky???</span> <span id="s450">were truly one in a million.</span> <span id="s451">Not only that they helped because in helping, you risk your own life.</span> <span id="s452">You could be caught in the same fate------------the Jews.</span> <span id="s453">But, pointing the finger, that was the easiest thing to do, and lots and lots of people did it.</span> <span id="s454">More, the Germans could not distinguish who was Jewish and who was not.</span> <span id="s455">They didn’t' know.</span> <span id="s456">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s457">They couldn't recognize, especially if you were blond and had blue eyes, and didn't have an accent.</span> <span id="s458">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s459">There is a lot of Polish people with black eyes and black hair and and, even crooked noses.</span> <span id="s460">They couldn't tell.</span> <span id="s461">It was the Polish people, 99.9% who were pointing the finger.</span> <span id="s462">And for a measly 5 slake, for a head, they would get it.</span> <span id="s463">But people like Mrs. -----------, Penny Olefska, and Pandish Vitsky???</span> <span id="s464">were truly angels from God.</span> <span id="s465">They risked their lives, they risked their lives of their families, of their possessions, of everything.</span> <span id="s466">They truly believed that they had to help.</span> <span id="s467">Penny Olefska told us a story that when she was a little girl, she was crossing a pond, coming home from school, and the ice broke, and she was drowning, and a man was passing by and pulled her out, was a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s468">When the, when this happened, she said to my mother, maybe he saved my life in order so I should save Jewish lives.</span> <span id="s469">How many people do you know that would feel that kind of gratitude.</span> <span id="s470">Such a mission in life.</span> <span id="s471">I mean, this is, this is incredible.</span> <span id="s472">This is an example that, that people all over the world should, should take how to care and how to sympathize, and how to feel with a human, with a fellow human being.</span> <span id="s473">How to help other people.</span> <span id="s474">I just had to tell you this.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Tell me now about your mother, and her ingenuity.</span> <span id="s476">How did she, tell me about some of the things she did to sort of plan for taking care of you.</span> <span id="s477">Like ---------------------.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Yeah, well, before my father left, he, as I told you, he provided for food, and told her to buy clothing and shoes, it's going to be scarce.</span> <span id="s479">And since she had this store for a while, whatever money she had, she bought dollars??</span> <span id="s480">for it.</span> <span id="s481">And she wrapped it around, women at that time used to wear a corset, and the corset had like stiffs, so, I don't know what you call it.</span> <span id="s482">She would take this, wrap the money around it, and put it in that corset, she always had money on her, so she would remove it and from time to time exchange it.</span> <span id="s483">And Mrs. Olefska's brother took care of this.</span> <span id="s484">So, we actually had enough money to live through.</span> <span id="s485">Of course, you realize that we didn't pay for our keep, only for our food.</span> <span id="s486">And then we, she sold jewelry too.</span> <span id="s487">She had lots of jewelry, and uh, she sold that too.</span> <span id="s488">Money to survive.</span> <span id="s489">Um, and, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s490">All right, tell me how you ended up back at Mrs. Olefska's in the basement with the German ---------------------.</span> <span id="s491">So, you have to describe this for me as though I don't know anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Okay.</span> <span id="s493">We, at one ti--at one point, we had to come back into the basement.</span> <span id="s494">Oh, I know.</span> <span id="s495">We had to leave the woman, the woman's house, even though she believed that Ishbitsky was our uncle and brother, she said, "Look, enough is enough, I need this room for myself, you have to leave."</span> <span id="s496">So, Mama went back to Penny Olefska because she was in touch constantly.</span> <span id="s497">She was the one that provided us with food.</span> <span id="s498">She says, "What are we going to do?"</span> <span id="s499">She said, "The only thing to do is we can get a sled, and send you to Ishbitsky."</span> <span id="s500">Okay.</span> <span id="s501">It was wintertime, and she ordered a sled for us.</span> <span id="s502">It was early Sunday morning, which was a big mistake, but we got on the sled, and we went into the Ishbitsky's village.</span> <span id="s503">When we arrived, we arrived just in time for all the people to come out of church.</span> <span id="s504">And, everybody said, "Aha!</span> <span id="s505">3 Jewish women are going to the Ishbitsky."</span> <span id="s506">They knew.</span> <span id="s507">The whole village knew that the Ishbitsky's against Germans, that he is in the underground.</span> <span id="s508">She, he does everything against it, and they knew that we are going straight to him.</span> <span id="s509">And they knew what he is, but nobody would give us out at that point.</span> <span id="s510">So, he rented us a place for one month.</span> <span id="s511">Not in his house, but somewhere else.</span> <span id="s512">And, we stayed for a month.</span> <span id="s513">After this, he says, "You have to go back.</span> <span id="s514">You cannot be here because there's too many people that know about you."</span> <span id="s515">So, he rented us another sled, and sent us back to Krasnow.</span> <span id="s516">And, under the disguise of darkness, we went back to Penny Olefska, and she took us back into the basement.</span> <span id="s517">Was a month later, it was quiet there.</span> <span id="s518">We came back.</span> <span id="s519">The front, the Russian front was coming closer.</span> <span id="s520">And, the street got evacuated, and the Germans occupied the houses, and Mrs. Olefska was still upstairs, but she told them that one of the basements, they could have.</span> <span id="s521">The basement was divided into 3.</span> <span id="s522">One part built, and like 3 different rooms.</span> <span id="s523">One part belonged to the tenants.</span> <span id="s524">The 2 other rooms were like adjoining rooms that belonged to the Olefskas.</span> <span id="s525">So, they were next door to us, and we could hear the radio, we could hear everything that's going on.</span> <span id="s526">We, we knew all the politics, we, we could hear how far the front is because the radio was on all the time.</span> <span id="s527">My mother understood German.</span> <span id="s528">And, one day, I don't know how it happened, we hear somebody is coming, so we quickly ran into the next room.</span> <span id="s529">The next room was full of Olefska's stuff, her bedding, her food because you know, they expected bombing so they put everything in the basement.</span> <span id="s530">It was filled to the ceiling, so we climbed over this whole thing, we hid in the corner.</span> <span id="s531">Sure enough, the Germans went next door.</span> <span id="s532">I, I, I don't know, that they didn't hear us run, they didn't see us, it's a miracle.</span> <span id="s533">We hid there, we closed the, we just closed the door, shut the door, we couldn't close it, we just shut it, and we hid in that corner, and we sat in that corner like 3 mouse, 3 mice.</span> <span id="s534">We sat there for 2 or 3 days.</span> <span id="s535">Uh, eventually we got very hungry.</span> <span id="s536">There was no food.</span> <span id="s537">So we found some stuff that Mrs. Olefska took down, and we started eating from it, and Mama said, "For God's sake, this is not ours, we cannot eat this food.</span> <span id="s538">It doesn't belong to us.</span> <span id="s539">But we were children, and this took like 2, 3 days.</span> <span id="s540">The Germans were behind the wall.</span> <span id="s541">Finally, Mrs. Olefska's brother came, he couldn't stand it any longer.</span> <span id="s542">During the day he came, he looked around, I don't think anybody was in the basement, maybe they went on some exercise or something, nobody was there, and he knocked on the window, he real, he realized the door was closed, so he knew we were inside.</span> <span id="s543">He knocked on the window, and we opened it up, and he said he's still alive, and he said, "Give me the pail."</span> <span id="s544">That was the first thing, "Give me the pail."</span> <span id="s545">Because we took the pail with us because otherwise it would be obvious that somebody was there.</span> <span id="s546">And one by one, he pulled us out through that window.</span> <span id="s547">This is actually when my mother hurt her arm, which later became infected, which later is another story.</span> <span id="s548">He pulled us out, and he told us, "Look the Russians, the Russsian front is around the corner.</span> <span id="s549">The street is evacuated.</span> <span id="s550">Nobody is in the street.</span> <span id="s551">Just go to a public bunker.</span> <span id="s552">There is a public bunker in the middle of the city.</span> <span id="s553">Everybody is going there.</span> <span id="s554">Go with the children, say you are from...ever, from whatever you want to be.</span> <span id="s555">Mama said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s556">So we went to the public bunker, and everybody was there.</span> <span id="s557">I mean, people from villages, people from houses, people from, from all over, from the city, and mama said to me, you know, we have no food.</span> <span id="s558">Go out and see if you can get some food.</span> <span id="s559">I was the least suspicious-looking one.</span> <span id="s560">So, I went out, and came back, and Mama says to me, "----------------."</span> <span id="s561">They were whispering that we looked very pale.</span> <span id="s562">It was summertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">We need to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Change film, Camera Roll 6 is up; Sync take 7 is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Back up to going to shelter.</span> <span id="s566">Okay.</span> <span id="s567">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">And give the context.</span> <span id="s569">Here we were 3 pale Jews in hiding for so many, for more than...</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Okay.</span> <span id="s571">We went, okay, we had to go in the public bunker.</span> <span id="s572">We were in hiding for a long time.</span> <span id="s573">We were pale.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Wait.</span> <span id="s575">Let's just wait till this truck goes by.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Okay, let's do it again.</span> <span id="s577">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">That's okay.</span> <span id="s579">We went into the public bunker.</span> <span id="s580">We were very pale, and when I came back from where my mother sent me, she says, "Oh, they recognized us.</span> <span id="s581">They are whispering.</span> <span id="s582">They're saying we must be Jewish because the children are very pale.</span> <span id="s583">We've got to go."</span> <span id="s584">So we left.</span> <span id="s585">Mrs. Olefska's brother told us something before we went into this bunker.</span> <span id="s586">He says, "If you really, really have no other choice, I'll give you a place to go.</span> <span id="s587">There is a crazy professor that has a house.</span> <span id="s588">He's crazy.</span> <span id="s589">He's harmless.</span> <span id="s590">If you have no other choice, go to his house."</span> <span id="s591">He told us where it is.</span> <span id="s592">So, we went to his house.</span> <span id="s593">We came there, and he says, "Welcome.</span> <span id="s594">God sent me guests."</span> <span id="s595">Fine.</span> <span id="s596">So we stayed in the house, and middle of the night, I hear him run naked, never saw a naked man in my life at that point, and he's pulling my mother by the hand, "Come, I've got to show you something."</span> <span id="s597">And don't forget, when you are frightened, everything frightens you.</span> <span id="s598">So, he's pulling my mother by the hand, I'm behind my mother, my sister behind me, we're all running.</span> <span id="s599">Says, "I've gotta show you something."</span> <span id="s600">There's a holy light burning.</span> <span id="s601">And he's pulling her to the window, and he has a gas line going, with a flame.</span> <span id="s602">The holy light is there burning because he got company.</span> <span id="s603">In the meantime, we died 100 deaths, because we have no idea where he's pulling us, what he's going to show us.</span> <span id="s604">But we stayed in his house.</span> <span id="s605">We stayed in his house until the Russian front came.</span> <span id="s606">And then this house had to be evacuated too, and we went to some village, I have no recollection of what.</span> <span id="s607">We came there, but that time we weren't so pale anymore.</span> <span id="s608">We came there and we went into the bunker.</span> <span id="s609">Everybody was in the bunker again because there was bombing, and there was kapo???</span> <span id="s610">, and they befriended my mother.</span> <span id="s611">And, the women were making plans after the war, we're going to go to the big city, they're going to open the store because the war was toward the end.</span> <span id="s612">And when the Russians came in and my mother told her who she is, she wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s613">And she would not have anything to do with her.</span> <span id="s614">She wanted to have no part of her.</span> <span id="s615">Well, it's, that's okay, the Russians liberated us at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Tell me who you Ishbitsky???</span> <span id="s617">was, tell me what you know about him.</span> <span id="s618">What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Okay.</span> <span id="s620">Ishbitsky was my father's customer.</span> <span id="s621">He had a farm, he is a farmer in the big farm.</span> <span id="s622">He used to be a customer.</span> <span id="s623">He would come and buy from my father.</span> <span id="s624">When the war started, and my father wasn't there anymore, he used to come and buy from my mother.</span> <span id="s625">He many times brought us fresh eggs and butter from the farm, and, of course, Mama paid him for it.</span> <span id="s626">And, he also used to like to go into the back room where there was storage.</span> <span id="s627">And, every time Mama would home from the store, and bring fresh eggs and butter and chicken, whatever he brought from the farm, she would say, "Now Vishbitsky came and he brought us this, and he also went into back room, and I know that he filled his pockets, but I cannot say anything to him.</span> <span id="s628">I actually didn't see it, I just know he does it.</span> <span id="s629">But I didn't see it with my eyes, and I cannot go and touch his pockets."</span> <span id="s630">So he was actually stealing.</span> <span id="s631">My mother said never a word.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Wait.</span> <span id="s633">Let's cut for a minute.</span> <span id="s634">------------------------- Take 8 is up.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">But the truth of the matter was that um, he maybe felt some gratitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">I want you to--- ----------------false start; that was take 8.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Tell me more about how difficult it was in Poland to be a rescuer, and how many denouncers there were.</span> <span id="s639">I mean people cling to the rescue stories because they're the hope for humankind.</span> <span id="s640">The rescue stories are, how do you feel about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Well, the rescue sto-stories are wonderful.</span> <span id="s642">Not enough.</span> <span id="s643">There were not, there were some rescuers, no question about it.</span> <span id="s644">But there were more people that denounced people, that pointed their finger.</span> <span id="s645">It was very difficult to be a rescuer.</span> <span id="s646">You faced the same, I think I said that, uh, you faced the same penalties.</span> <span id="s647">Even worse.</span> <span id="s648">They were hung for everybody to see.</span> <span id="s649">Uh, yet a lot of people did it.</span> <span id="s650">A lot of people did this for money, but a lot of people like in our case, did it out of the goodness of their heart.</span> <span id="s651">They just did it, they thought it was a Christian way to do it.</span> <span id="s652">It was, it, but most of the population pointed a finger, pointed us out.</span> <span id="s653">The Germans could not distinguish who was and who was not a Jew, except if they pulled a man's pants down.</span> <span id="s654">Women, for sure they could not distinguish.</span> <span id="s655">Uh, so, I think that it wouldn't be for the Polish people, there would be a lot of people alive, a lot of people were in, in the woods hiding, a lot of people were running, having, hiding in cemeteries, hiding all places.</span> <span id="s656">Germans wouldn't go looking there for them.</span> <span id="s657">But they went there after they were told where to go.</span> <span id="s658">Simple as that.</span> <span id="s659">Hide and go seek.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">What do you know about the pogroms after...</span></p> <p><span id="s661">After the war?</span> <span id="s662">Well, we came back to our hometown after liberation.</span> <span id="s663">It wasn't, it wasn't after the war, it was after liberation, the war wasn't over yet.</span> <span id="s664">We couldn't go back to our house because our house was part of the ghetto, it was uh leveled.</span> <span id="s665">They built a road there.</span> <span id="s666">Our house and my grandparents' house was gone.</span> <span id="s667">They built a road.</span> <span id="s668">And we lived in an apt in the city.</span> <span id="s669">There was a few people that were rescued.</span> <span id="s670">There was a father and 3 daughters that were in hiding, and other people came, coming out like from the woods or from the partisans, and I have to back up because there was a group of people in hiding during the occupation about 20 people that were hiding in a woman's basement, and the local a-army, the Polish Underground, knew about them, and they came to kill them off.</span> <span id="s671">That was during the occupation.</span> <span id="s672">At that point, they bought their lives with gold and silver and money, whatever they had.</span> <span id="s673">They just bought themselves out.</span> <span id="s674">Besides, they convinced the attackers, there was a barrack up there.</span> <span id="s675">They convinced them if they get killed, the woman that was in her house, what would happen to her.</span> <span id="s676">So somehow they let it be.</span> <span id="s677">These same people showed up at the man's house, the man and 3 daughters who came back and lived in their house, they came there one afternoon and they said, "This time, you cannot buy your life with money.</span> <span id="s678">And they shot them.</span> <span id="s679">There was also a young boy there visiting.</span> <span id="s680">He was shot.</span> <span id="s681">One of the girls survived.</span> <span id="s682">Somehow she was in another room, and she hid under the bed.</span> <span id="s683">After this, we left our hometown because nobody was safe.</span> <span id="s684">We, this time we were running from our own Polocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">What, list for me the things you lost???</span></p> <p><span id="s686">I lost my track.</span> <span id="s687">What?</span> <span id="s688">...I lost my father, I lost my education, I lost...I lost who I was, of of what I could have become.</span> <span id="s689">My parents had great hopes for me.</span> <span id="s690">There was a piano coming into the house, I was going to start music.</span> <span id="s691">My parents had, they were going to send me to the best schools.</span> <span id="s692">I lost friends.</span> <span id="s693">I lost family, I lost, I lost grandparents, and aunts, and uncles and cousins.</span> <span id="s694">There's, there's no family.</span> <span id="s695">I have friends now that I consider family because I don't have any family.</span> <span id="s696">Um, I'm not even going to talk about uh, material possessions.</span> <span id="s697">My parents had a beautiful home, and a wonderful business, and they were very wealthy, and...gone with the wind.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Okay.</span> <span id="s699">I am your -------.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Camera 7 is up; Sync take 9 is up.</span> <span id="s701">This is the first time we haven't changed tape, and that's going to be the 3rd camera roll with this sound roll.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Beep.</span> <span id="s703">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Tell me what is the legacy of a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">The legacy is that each and every one of us has a story to tell.</span> <span id="s706">It's never enough, no matter how many books have been written.</span> <span id="s707">Everyone is different.</span> <span id="s708">And it is our obligation to talk about it, and to talk about the rescuers because if it would be not for them, there would be no one to tell this story.</span> <span id="s709">There's a lot of doubt about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s710">Believe me, there was one, and if you don't believe the survivors, ask the rescuers.</span> <span id="s711">And, if we lead a semi-normal life, this, this is a victory.</span> <span id="s712">We did survive, and if Hitler would see us now, he would turn in his grave, grave 100 times, because we did survive.</span> <span id="s713">He did not.</span> <span id="s714">And, we are just, just as good as anybody else, and I don't think any people deserves what happened to us.</span> <span id="s715">It is an obligation to talk, and it should never happen again ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">People have this saying that Jews went like sheep to the slaughter.</span> <span id="s717">How does that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">They did not have a choice.</span> <span id="s719">It was very systematic.</span> <span id="s720">It was...some did and some did not.</span> <span id="s721">There were some people that were fighting.</span> <span id="s722">People, there was a Warsaw Ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s723">There were people fighting in the, in the woo--in the woods.</span> <span id="s724">There were Partisans, there were people in the Underground.</span> <span id="s725">Most people did go like sheep.</span> <span id="s726">Unfortunately.</span> <span id="s727">They were very systematic about it.</span> <span id="s728">How do you fight somebody with guns.</span> <span id="s729">How do you fight with bare hands against guns.</span> <span id="s730">I mean, they were mighty.</span> <span id="s731">They stripped you of your dignity before they killed you.</span> <span id="s732">When you have no dignity, there is no life.</span> <span id="s733">They stripped you of whatever you believed in.</span> <span id="s734">You were nothing.</span> <span id="s735">There is...how can you fight this.</span> <span id="s736">The ones that did are very courageous.</span> <span id="s737">A lot did not survive.</span> <span id="s738">The ones that did were very courageous.</span> <span id="s739">(Sigh) I don't know, um, I, I, I don't have the vocabulary to sum it up properly.</span> <span id="s740">Um, the only thing I know is history should never repeat itself.</span> <span id="s741">Not this history, for sure.</span> <span id="s742">And I hope there's more people like Mrs. Olefska, and Vishbitsky, and others that I don't know about.</span> <span id="s743">Because if it wouldn't be for them, I don't know who would survive.</span></p> <p><span
