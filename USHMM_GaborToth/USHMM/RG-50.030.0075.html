and my mother also had her parents, who lived in another town.</span> <span id="s53">And so she had support from both families, both on her husband's side and on her, her own parents' side.</span> <span id="s54">But after my dad came to this country, he used to help us.</span> <span id="s55">When my dad came to this country, it was right after, I believe, the Depression.</span> <span id="s56">And he came to Chicago, and earned three dollars a week working for Vienna Sausage Company in Chicago.</span> <span id="s57">And the story went that my dad would send us a dollar and a half to live on in Europe – which was a lot of money at that time in Europe.</span> <span id="s58">And, of course, he lived on a dollar and a half here.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">01:03:37 And when my dad came here, immigration was very strict.</span> <span id="s60">In those days, a man had to show that he could support a family before he was allowed to bring a family to this country.</span> <span id="s61">And I believe there's a long story behind this, but by the time my dad was able to send us papers to immigrate to this country, the war had broken out.</span> <span id="s62">And my mother was afraid to take her family.</span> <span id="s63">I had two younger brothers; and my mother was afraid to take three children on a ship that might have been bombed on the waters, that were beginning to be bombed already because the war had broken out.</span> <span id="s64">I, I believe this is the joke of, of the century: her being afraid to take us on a boat that might be bombed, and then getting caught in the war in Europe and concentration camps.</span> <span id="s65">You know?</span> <span id="s66">So....</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: As you speak of the war beginning, could you tell us what your first impressions were of the beginning of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: The first – okay.</span> <span id="s69">The first that I really knew that Jews were being persecuted in Europe was as a child.</span> <span id="s70">I recall my mother taking us – meaning my brothers, my two brothers and herself – going to my grandfather's town where my grandparents lived, where my mother was born and came from.</span> <span id="s71">And she took us there, often times, for visits.</span> <span id="s72">And, I believe, in 1939 when the Germans took away citizenship from the Polish Jews that emigrated to Germany, became German citizens, established businesses in Germany and fought for the German government.</span> <span id="s73">These Jews were asked to leave Germany when Hitler came into power.</span> <span id="s74">He took away their businesses, as you well know; and he took – confiscated everything they had, and sent them back over the border to Poland.</span> <span id="s75">When these Jews came to Poland, they had no place to go.</span> <span id="s76">They had no homes; and of course the Polish community did not want these Jews back.</span> <span id="s77">So a lot of the Jews were being persecuted, and a lot of them went into the mountain areas.</span> <span id="s78">My grandparents lived close to the Polish border in Czechoslovakia; and, of course, in – near the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">01:06:05 I recall, as a child, these Jews coming down from the mountains looking for Jewish homes; and begging for food, begging for warm clothing and so forth, to take back to their families in hiding.</span> <span id="s80">I recall, as a child, helping my grandfather; taking buckets, pretending we were going to feed the animals, and going into the barns for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s81">And carrying food and warm clothing in these buckets to take back to these people, so that they could take it back to their families.</span> <span id="s82">I recall hearing horror stories of Jews being persecuted in Poland and in Germany.</span> <span id="s83">Of course, we didn't know about concentration camps at that time.</span> <span id="s84">But we knew – I knew, as a child, that Jews were being persecuted.</span> <span id="s85">And I recall hiding many of these young Jewish people that would come; and putting them into wagons and covering them with straw and whatever, and taking them into different parts of Czechoslovakia, to different towns.</span> <span id="s86">So that we could help these young Jews escape.</span> <span id="s87">We still had freedom at that time, and little did we know that we were going to be next.</span> <span id="s88">That we were going to be persecuted.</span> <span id="s89">So I did know at that time that Jews were being persecuted.</span> <span id="s90">But we still lived in peace with our neighbors.</span> <span id="s91">We, as I said, were not being persecuted at that time.</span> <span id="s92">Our life was peaceful.</span> <span id="s93">The businessmen did or went about their business as they pleased.</span> <span id="s94">And that was my first recollection.</span> <span id="s95">Then I recall going back home to our hometown in Czecho– in Klyucharki.</span> <span id="s96">And I had a young uncle that must have been 17, 18 years old at the time; and as Czechoslovakia was being occupied, this uncle pretended he was going to take eggs and things off of the farm to go into the big city of Munkács.</span> <span id="s97">He would take these things and put them in a basket on his bicycle and pedal to the city; strictly to find out about what was happening in the city, what was happening around the world, so to speak.</span> <span id="s98">Because that was the only news we could really get.</span> <span id="s99">We didn't have television and we didn't have radio, as they do today.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">And my uncle used to come back and bring us bits and pieces of news.</span> <span id="s101">We were not allowed to listen to this news, we as children.</span> <span id="s102">We were being protected.</span> <span id="s103">And we were just – we were getting bits and pieces of this.</span> <span id="s104">So I did know that in certain areas Jews, because they were Jews, they were being persecuted.</span> <span id="s105">But we ourselves were not touched by it at that point.</span> <span id="s106">Actually, I personally was not affected by this until Hitler marched into Czechoslovakia and took over the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: My first recollection was when I went to school.</span> <span id="s109">The night before going to school, my friend who was not Jewish – she and I slept in our home.</span> <span id="s110">Slept in the same bed, played as children do.</span> <span id="s111">I remember my mother opening the door and telling us to go to sleep, because we were being noisy and the next day was school.</span> <span id="s112">She and I got up in the morning to go to school, one morning.</span> <span id="s113">When we came to school, she was allowed to walk in and the door was closed to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">01:09:40 I was told I was not allowed to walk into class anymore.</span> <span id="s115">I needed to go home, because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s116">A teacher who was my teacher, who took out a white handkerchief from his pocket the week before to wipe a smudge off of my face, turned to me one day and told me I must not come to school anymore.</span> <span id="s117">All of a sudden, for whatever reason, I needed to go back home and not come back to school.</span> <span id="s118">I remember going home and crying, and not understanding why I was not allowed to go to school anymore.</span> <span id="s119">A few minutes later, my two brothers came home crying.</span> <span id="s120">They too were sent back home, and were told not to go to school anymore.</span> <span id="s121">Because we became quote "Jewish" overnight.</span> <span id="s122">My mother had to sit down with us and tell us the facts of life.</span> <span id="s123">Tell us why we were not allowed to go to school anymore; tell us that the country was invaded by a man called Hitler who was a bad man.</span> <span id="s124">We did not know about the killings at that time – at least, I didn't.</span> <span id="s125">But we were told that there were certain rules we needed to follow from now on, and one was not to go to public school.</span> <span id="s126">I recall the laws being set down one by one.</span> <span id="s127">Not being able to go to a grocery store, except during certain hours.</span> <span id="s128">Not being able to work our farms anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Not being able to walk into a bakery anymore, except during certain hours.</span> <span id="s130">Not to go into a park and sit on a bench, unless it said, "For Jews Only."</span> <span id="s131">The wearing of the yellow star.</span> <span id="s132">And the hours we were allowed to be out, and the hours we were – has to be back in the house.</span> <span id="s133">And those were the first that I personally felt.</span> <span id="s134">And then, of course, the laws that came down one by one.</span> <span id="s135">Everyday there was a new law, and everyday we had to obey the new law.</span> <span id="s136">And we were not allowed to walk down the street anymore.</span> <span id="s137">If someone came towards us that was not a Jew, the Jew needed to step off the sidewalk to allow the next person – who of course was not Jewish – to walk by.</span> <span id="s138">I recall our neighbors turning their backs on us.</span> <span id="s139">Spitting on us.</span> <span id="s140">Neighbors who lived in peace with us, who were our friends the week before.</span> <span id="s141">And then, of course, we were lucky we were farmers; because we would have starved to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">01:12:40 You know, it's interesting.</span> <span id="s143">You, you sit and, and you talk, and as you sat and memories came back.</span> <span id="s144">It took me many, many years to find out why my mother would put food on the table for her three children at night, give us our dinner, and after she served us, she would walk out of the room.</span> <span id="s145">She never stayed in the room where we ate.</span> <span id="s146">I could never understand this.</span> <span id="s147">Just recently – shows you how smart I am – I've just recently figured this out.</span> <span id="s148">I probably had forgotten all of this.</span> <span id="s149">The reason she didn't stay with us was because there wasn't enough food to go around.</span> <span id="s150">So those are my early memories of Hitler walking into Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s151">And, of course, then there was the knock on the door in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s152">We were told to gather our belongings, take warm clothes, take our valuables, and to take our pots and pans.</span> <span id="s153">We were told we were going to be relocated.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">And as we know today, they lied.</span> <span id="s155">And we believed.</span> <span id="s156">I'm not sure if our parents knew what was going to happen or not.</span> <span id="s157">But we believed.</span> <span id="s158">I think we needed to believe.</span> <span id="s159">And, of course, as we know how brave Hitler was – the knock came in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s160">It was the last days of Passover when they came to get us, and they told us to take whatever food we could.</span> <span id="s161">We didn't have bread in the house yet.</span> <span id="s162">We still had matzo.</span> <span id="s163">I remember my mother packing matzo to take with us to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s164">It seems like yesterday.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: You mentioned to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s166">Was the ghetto in the town or did they transport you?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">01:15:00</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: In our case a ghetto was in a small – in our small town.</span> <span id="s169">The Germans took over the grammar school, a small school.</span> <span id="s170">They emptied the school.</span> <span id="s171">They put a fence around the school.</span> <span id="s172">They brought soldiers.</span> <span id="s173">They brought dogs.</span> <span id="s174">For some reason, always dogs.</span> <span id="s175">And the guards, of course.</span> <span id="s176">And they put us into this school – which became our ghetto.</span> <span id="s177">All the Jewish family from the – families from this community were put into this school.</span> <span id="s178">We slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s179">We had our bedding, because we brought it with us.</span> <span id="s180">We were not abused while we were in this so-called ghetto.</span> <span id="s181">Food was brought to us every day.</span> <span id="s182">We didn't have an over-abundance of food, but we were not starving.</span> <span id="s183">Of course, our neighbors did not come to see us, nor did they come to ask if we needed any food or any help.</span> <span id="s184">I will never understand that part.</span> <span id="s185">I will never understand how one human being – a neighbor, a friend – can turn against you.</span> <span id="s186">A person that has lived with you in peace, that has watched you born, that has gone to school with you, knows your family and knows your life history, can turn against you as a human being.</span> <span id="s187">But nevertheless, that's what they did.</span> <span id="s188">The Germans would come – the soldiers would come every day to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">They would take our young people on a work crew – I was too young, but they would take most of the young people – and they would take them to do forced labor.</span> <span id="s190">Whatever they did, I don't know.</span> <span id="s191">There were different jobs for all the young men, as well as women.</span> <span id="s192">They would tell us that they would bring them back at night; and in most cases, most of them did come back at night.</span> <span id="s193">The ones that didn't, we were told that they were sent to a different area but we would see them in some future time.</span> <span id="s194">Of course, we never did.</span> <span id="s195">And this is how we lived for several weeks.</span> <span id="s196">We – the families stayed together; and we could have lived that way, very well.</span> <span id="s197">We would not have had all of the comforts of home.</span> <span id="s198">But if they would have let us, we could have survived in that type of an atmosphere.</span> <span id="s199">Until the trucks came to empty out the ghetto; and, of course, to take us to the famous trains.</span> <span id="s200">When they came to empty the ghettos, again they told us we were going to be relocated.</span> <span id="s201">I had two younger brothers, of which one was nine and one was seven.</span> <span id="s202">When they came to take us on to the trucks, as we were walking on to towards the trucks, my youngest brother turned back and ran back into the school.</span> <span id="s203">He would not come out.</span> <span id="s204">He hid underneath a table.</span> <span id="s205">They carried him out, bodily, and threw him on to this truck as he was kicking and crying, as if he knew where he was going to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Your mother, you, your brothers... 01:18:50</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: ...my grandparents, my aunt, my relatives, and all the other Jews in the community – we were all loaded onto this train, going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s208">When we were put onto this train, which, of course, I don't need to describe to you.</span> <span id="s209">It was a cattle car, as you know.</span> <span id="s210">No windows and no seats.</span> <span id="s211">No toilet.</span> <span id="s212">When we got onto the trains, none of us knew we were being taken to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s213">None of us knew anything about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s214">At least, I don't think we knew.</span> <span id="s215">We honestly thought we were going to be relocated.</span> <span id="s216">Until the door closed, and we heard the lock go on from the outside.</span> <span id="s217">I believe, that was the first we knew wherever we were going to be taken to, it was not going to be freedom, and it was not going to be a great relocation.</span> <span id="s218">We were not told where we were being taken to, nor did we know what direction we were going in.</span> <span id="s219">I recall there was a small window on top of this compartment, the train we were on.</span> <span id="s220">They would lift a child up that could read.</span> <span id="s221">A man would lift the child up as the train would pass a station, so that the child could read what direction the train was going in, what stations we passed.</span> <span id="s222">And that would give us a clue where we were going to.</span> <span id="s223">This is how we knew where – towards what destination we were being taken to.</span> <span id="s224">The train would stop once, sometimes twice, a day and wait for other Jews to be brought to be put back – to be put on to this train.</span> <span id="s225">Until the compartment was so full that there was standing room only.</span> <span id="s226">It got to the point where if one needed to sit down, someone else needed to stand up; because there truly was absolutely – it was a packed train.</span> <span id="s227">When the train would stop sometimes once a day, they would push in a bucket for our personal use, for toilet.</span> <span id="s228">They would push in a bucket of water; and they would take one of the men off the train to go and get water.</span> <span id="s229">And usually it was a matter of choosing who would go to get this bucket of water, because we weren't sure if the person would come back or not.</span> <span id="s230">And usually it was a young man that would volunteer.</span> <span id="s231">And that bucket of water needed to go around for every single person.</span> <span id="s232">And often times it didn't make to the very end.</span> <span id="s233">Many people would not get any water on that given day.</span> <span id="s234">How do I tell you about a train ride like that?</span> <span id="s235">About the dignity that is taken away from you when you need to use a bucket as toilet in the middle of a compartment on a train, in front of everyone?</span> <span id="s236">About sharing water with every single person?</span> <span id="s237">About the mothers holding on to hungry children.</span> <span id="s238">The crying.</span> <span id="s239">The stink.</span> <span id="s240">The fear.</span> <span id="s241">It's strange, fear gives out a certain smell and that mixed with open bucket – it's a smell I don't believe one can ever forget.</span> <span id="s242">It's, it's not to be described.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: How long were you in that train?</span> <span id="s244">01:23:03</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: I believe, two and a half days.</span> <span id="s246">I believe we were there two and a half days in all, with the stopping and going.</span> <span id="s247">I can't tell you exactly.</span> <span id="s248">I believe if I live to be 100, that smell will stay with me.</span> <span id="s249">And I will always hear the crying of the babies;

and they would try and push and pull us off the train as fast as they could.</span> <span id="s262">These men were not allowed to speak to us; but, in their own way, they tried to help young people.</span> <span id="s263">They walked amongst us, and in Yiddish would whisper to a child, "You're 15.</span> <span id="s264">Remember you're 15."</span> <span id="s265">When we got off the train and they asked us to line up according to age, I lined up with – I became 15 years old, lined up with the 15 years old.</span> <span id="s266">And I truly believe that man, whoever he was, saved my life.</span> <span id="s267">Time out.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">[Pause in interview]</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Anytime you want to continue....</span> <span id="s270">You've brought us to the point where a man gave you advice, and you followed his advice.</span> <span id="s271">Can you remember what was going on around you, in terms of your mother, and your brothers, and others who came with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: When they asked us to line up, of course.</span> <span id="s273">When we, when we got off the train, the men needed to go to one side, the young boys – I believe it was to the left.</span> <span id="s274">It's like a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">The babies were taken away and put onto trucks.</span> <span id="s276">Today that I am a mother and a grandmother, I can understand this more than I did at the time.</span> <span id="s277">The young children and the babies that were taken out of mothers' arms and put on to these trucks; and the mothers running after them.</span> <span id="s278">And the crying and the screaming, "My baby!"</span> <span id="s279">And they were told they would see them later.</span> <span id="s280">Of course, as we know today, they never did.</span> <span id="s281">The old people, the cripples whoever couldn't walk, these were put on trucks.</span> <span id="s282">The young people needed to line up.</span> <span id="s283">Women and men were separated, as were children.</span> <span id="s284">My mother and I stood on the same line when they told us to line up, and then they started to call age.</span> <span id="s285">Mother was a young woman.</span> <span id="s286">They called, "Age!"</span> <span id="s287">And I told my mother she stood in the wrong line.</span> <span id="s288">My mother went into another line.</span> <span id="s289">I found out several hours later that the line she went in went directly to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s290">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">01:28:06</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: It's okay.</span> <span id="s293">Take your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: I thought this was going to be an easy interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: They're never easy.</span> <span id="s296">But after you realized that the lines were separated, and you were in your line–</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: I have to back-track a little bit, if I may.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">2 Canada (German);

and I kept saying, "Yes, I'll do it."</span> <span id="s329">I had seen the article several times, but I ignored it because I could not handle it.</span> <span id="s330">And one day he called me and he said, "If you don't call, I will call the Foundation.</span> <span id="s331">Mom, please go.</span> <span id="s332">Don't ask for anything.</span> <span id="s333">Sign whatever they tell you to sign.</span> <span id="s334">But ask for a tape.</span> <span id="s335">Ask for a tape so that we – your grandson, now, and I – will know what happened."</span> <span id="s336">And so I did.</span> <span id="s337">And this is when the memories started to fall back into place.</span> <span id="s338">This is when I went back into camp, and started to relive all of this.</span> <span id="s339">The reason I'm telling you this is because many things are blocked out in my mind.</span> <span id="s340">One of the things is, crossing the threshold from the train station into the camp itself.</span> <span id="s341">Whether it's really blocked out or not, I don't know.</span> <span id="s342">But probably, psychologically, it's there; but it needs to come out.</span> <span id="s343">I remember the gate.</span> <span id="s344">I can see the gate in front of me: "Arbeit Macht Frei."</span> <span id="s345">I see the separation.</span> <span id="s346">I see the lines.</span> <span id="s347">I see the trucks moving.</span> <span id="s348">But I do not recall going into the camp.</span> <span id="s349">The first memory of camp is sitting in a chair and having my hair shaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">01:33:15 And I recall the hair falling in my face, mingling with my tears.</span> <span id="s351">And then a uniform being thrown at me and a pair of clogs.</span> <span id="s352">Pushed outside.</span> <span id="s353">I recall walking outside, and 3 Work Makes [You] Free (German) seeing all of these hundreds and hundreds of other women with their heads shaved.</span> <span id="s354">Some holding on to their uniforms, and some wearing their uniforms already.</span> <span id="s355">And here was Fritzie – this pampered child – thrown into a snake pit, so to speak.</span> <span id="s356">A lady walked up to me, and kept staring at me.</span> <span id="s357">The lady turned out to be my mother's youngest sister, whose hair was shaved already and who was in uniform.</span> <span id="s358">It was due to that lady that I survived Auschwitz concentration camp.</span> <span id="s359">But that was really my first memory of walking into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s360">This lady held my hand all the way through the months of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s361">I'm not sure any survivor can describe Auschwitz to you.</span> <span id="s362">I know you said you are going back there; but unless you've lived under those conditions for one day, you will never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">How does one describe the walking into Auschwitz, the, the smell?</span> <span id="s364">And someone pointing out to you that those are gas chambers, that your parents went up in smoke?</span> <span id="s365">When I asked, "When will I see my mother?"</span> <span id="s366">several hours later after I came into the camp, I was shown the smoke.</span> <span id="s367">This is how I found out where she went.</span> <span id="s368">How do I describe fear?</span> <span id="s369">How do I describe hunger to someone that has probably had breakfast and lunch today?</span> <span id="s370">Or even if you're dieting, or even if you're fasting for a day?</span> <span id="s371">I think hunger is when the pit of your stomach hurts.</span> <span id="s372">When you would sell your soul for a potato or a slice of bread.</span> <span id="s373">I believe that once one has experienced hunger, they will never ever forget it.</span> <span id="s374">How do I describe living with lice in your clothes, on your body?</span> <span id="s375">The stink.</span> <span id="s376">The fear.</span> <span id="s377">The selections.</span> <span id="s378">The AppellsThe being told when to go to a toilet, not when you needed to use it.</span> <span id="s379">The using of the morning coffee to wash your face with.</span> <span id="s380">The knowing that Dr. Mengelewill be there for his selections every single day.</span> <span id="s381">And mostly, mostly death in the gas chambers, the smoke.</span> <span id="s382">There is no way to describe your first coming to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: As you struggle to remember and help us to know, can you share with us some of your impressions of what you saw and how you reacted to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">01:37:10</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: I think the, the reaction is – I think the first thought is, to survive.</span> <span id="s386">Your concern for your family.</span> <span id="s387">Your wondering what happened to them.</span> <span id="s388">The people around you.</span> <span id="s389">The seeing of death day in and day out.</span> <span id="s390">Not knowing when your turn was going to come.</span> <span id="s391">But I think the struggle to survive, in all of us.</span> <span id="s392">And, and none of us really know the kind of energy we put in every day to survive, unless we're faced with this.</span> <span id="s393">And I know many people thought of dying, and many people thought of committing suicide.</span> <span id="s394">My thought was always of tomorrow.</span> <span id="s395">And I believe that's what – maybe youth – but my, my hope was always of tomorrow.</span> <span id="s396">The struggles to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: You mentioned the word "selection."</span> <span id="s398">Could you tell us a little about that process?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Selection.</span> <span id="s400">We needed to get undressed every day.</span> <span id="s401">And we needed to run – not walk – in 4 roll call (German) 5 Dr. Josef Mengele front of Dr. Mengele, or his entourage, which was SS soldiers.</span> <span id="s402">We needed to show that we still had strength left to – whether it was to work or to live another day.</span> <span id="s403">I recall some women were beginning – as the hair grows back, they were beginning to get gray hair.</span> <span id="s404">And they would go and take a little piece of coal from one of the pot-bellied stoves that was in a barrack.</span> <span id="s405">And they would use this coal to color their hair with, so that they would look a little younger.</span> <span id="s406">I mean, one grayed at the age of maybe 18 or 19 under those conditions.</span> <span id="s407">And they would run – we would run in front of whoever it was that was doing the selections, to show that we could survive one other day.</span> <span id="s408">If one had a scar, a pimple, if one didn't run fast enough, if one didn't look right for whatever reason to the particular person that was doing the selection.</span> <span id="s409">They would stand there with a stick – to the right or to the left – as you ran by them.</span> <span id="s410">One never knew if they were in the good line or the bad line.</span> <span id="s411">One line would go to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s412">The other line would go back to the camp and to the barracks, to live another day.</span> <span id="s413">This is how the selection was done.</span> <span id="s414">I believe there were so many people that needed to be gassed every day.</span> <span id="s415">And we knew the trains were coming in; and we watched the people marching.</span> <span id="s416">And we knew many of the barracks were being emptied out, day in and day out, to make room for the new people that were coming in.</span> <span id="s417">We never knew when our turn would come next.</span> <span id="s418">So one always lived in fear, and one always tried to get through these selections for one more day.</span> <span id="s419">And, of course, the Appell.</span> <span id="s420">They would wake us up at the crack of dawn and empty out the entire barracks.</span> <span id="s421">And we would need to line up in fives to be counted, twice a day – the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night.</span> <span id="s422">To make sure no one had escaped, no one was missing.</span> <span id="s423">Sometimes we would stand there for hours and hours.</span> <span id="s424">Just stand to be counted, until every single person in the particular camp was accounted for.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">01:40:46 You must remember, there were thousands and thousands of people in each camp.</span> <span id="s426">Whether it rained or the sun was out, if it was hot or if it was cold.</span> <span id="s427">We had very little clothing.</span> <span id="s428">And, of course, in the summer we had to wear whatever we had.</span> <span id="s429">So if the sun would beat down on you, many people would faint during these "Appell" counts.</span> <span id="s430">Nobody ever wanted to be at the beginning of the line, and nobody ever wanted to be at the front of the line; because for whatever punishment was being dished out, they would pull people from the beginning or the end of the line to punish these people.</span> <span id="s431">To show us what would happen to us if we did not obey orders in every day living.</span> <span id="s432">And, of course, the dead people that that would die during the night from starvation or disease, or from killing, from beatings, they too would need to be carried out from the barracks every single morning, and lined up in front of the barracks.</span> <span id="s433">They, too needed, to be counted.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Every single body needed to be accounted for.</span> <span id="s435">Day in, and day out.</span> <span id="s436">We would not get any food until every single person was accounted for.</span> <span id="s437">And then we were allowed to march and get our breakfast, which often times just consisted of a cup of coffee.</span> <span id="s438">Often times they would give us a little soup and a small slice of bread.</span> <span id="s439">And most of the time, of course, we didn't have any water.</span> <span id="s440">So we would use that hot coffee to wash our faces and our hands with.</span> <span id="s441">So we wouldn't even get the hot coffee in the morning.</span> <span id="s442">This was our existence while we were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s443">My job in Auschwitz was – they would line us up every morning and they would take us outside; and we would carry huge rocks from one side to another.</span> <span id="s444">One day we would come, and we would take these huge rocks from this side and we would carry them to that side.</span> <span id="s445">The next day, they would bring us back; and we would take these same huge rocks, and we would carry them from that side back to this side.</span> <span id="s446">Now you need to know, we were undernourished.</span> <span id="s447">We were all weak.</span> <span id="s448">And to carry a big rock like that was a lot of weight and a lot of work.</span> <span id="s449">By the time they take us back to the barracks at night, we could barely crawl.</span> <span id="s450">But we needed to show that we could still walk, and we were strong enough to give one more day.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">01:43:17</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: How long did that go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: That went on for several months.</span> <span id="s454">It went on for close to nine months.</span> <span id="s455">Until one day they came and they were emptying out our barrack.</span> <span id="s456">And we knew exactly where we were going to go.</span> <span id="s457">They lined us up, and they were marching us towards the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s458">It was our turn.</span> <span id="s459">My aunt and I, and the rest of the women, marched towards the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s460">And they had a selection.</span> <span id="s461">My aunt was chosen to go onto a truck to be taken somewheres else.</span> <span id="s462">And I was chosen to stay, to march into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s463">The last my aunt saw of me, was walking towards the gas chambers as she crawled down from the truck and begged could I come onto the truck with her.</span> <span id="s464">And they were laughing and said no, but she could come down and join me, as the trucks were pulling away.</span> <span id="s465">As we started to walk towards the gas chambers and we were walking in, I was at the end of the line – again, because of my aunt.</span> <span id="s466">Six of us were pulled out of line; and I was literally in the door of the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s467">I will never know the reason why.</span> <span id="s468">Six of us were pulled out and put onto another truck, with several other women, to go to work in a factory.</span> <span id="s469">Forced labor.</span> <span id="s470">When they brought us to the factory, I was the youngest of 600 women.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">01:45:36 Our job was – we were doing parts.</span> <span id="s472">Each one of us had a different job to do, and this was they were doing parts for airplanes.</span> <span id="s473">My particular job was to put the spring into the compass that would go onto an airplane.</span> <span id="s474">Because I was the youngest, 599 women shared their precious food with me.</span> <span id="s475">Allowed me a little extra food every day.</span> <span id="s476">If anyone could rest, I was the one that would rest.</span> <span id="s477">I was their hope to survive.</span> <span id="s478">I was their hope to carry the message to the world.</span> <span id="s479">To tell the world what happened.</span> <span id="s480">It took me 40 some years to remember a promise I made to 599 women.</span> <span id="s481">But I remember today.</span> <span id="s482">And I remember every time I stand up to speak, it was due to them that I made the last days of camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Of the 600 women including yourself, do you recall how many were able to come out with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: No.</span> <span id="s485">I don't know what happened to any of them.</span> <span id="s486">As Germany started to lose the war, they started to gather us, of course, and the famous death march.</span> <span id="s487">And we, too – all of us were joined a group, the group from other concentration camps and factories.</span> <span id="s488">And started the death march.</span> <span id="s489">I don't know if you're familiar with the death march, but it was – I don't know how to describe it.</span> <span id="s490">All of us were weak already, but we knew – we did not know where we were going to go, but we knew that it was the last days of the war.</span> <span id="s491">We knew because of the bombings; and we knew because of the way the German soldiers were pushing us and pulling us already, and emptying the camps and whatever.</span> <span id="s492">They took us all and put us together, all of the people from camps.</span> <span id="s493">And they had us march through towns and through fields.</span> <span id="s494">They didn't know where to put us anymore, and they didn't know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s495">And there was no food, because the Germans were losing the war.</span> <span id="s496">Often times, as they marched us through a town, a window would open and a shutter would open, and either a potato or a loaf of bread would come flying out; and the shutter would close after.</span> <span id="s497">And we would all pounce on this potato or this – whatever this piece of food was that came at us.</span> <span id="s498">And, of course, they would shoot at us; but we didn't care at that point, because we were hungry.</span> <span id="s499">The streets were literally covered with bodies.</span> <span id="s500">As we marched, we would pass bodies.</span> <span id="s501">Body after body after body.</span> <span id="s502">People that were dropping dead from hunger, from disease, from dysentery; because they did not have the strength, or because they gave up.</span> <span id="s503">So we knew it was towards the very end.</span> <span id="s504">We would sleep in the fields.</span> <span id="s505">We lived on whatever we could find.</span> <span id="s506">If we could find a carrot, a potato, snails, snails!</span> <span id="s507">In order to survive.</span> <span id="s508">The planes would come down low, and shoot at us often times.</span> <span id="s509">Towards the very last, a friend – a girl whose name I do not recall – and I ran into the forest.</span> <span id="s510">I believe they saw us run.</span> <span id="s511">I believe the Germans saw us run; because they could have shot us at that that point.</span> <span id="s512">But they didn't.</span> <span id="s513">We ran into the forest and spent the first night in the forest sleeping.</span> <span id="s514">And we spent all the next day there, because we were afraid to go out.</span> <span id="s515">And when it started to get dark, she and I found a town to walk to.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">01:50:00 And we came to a farmer.</span> <span id="s517">And, of course, they had to know who we were.</span> <span id="s518">Our heads were shaved and we wore striped clothing.</span> <span id="s519">And we begged for food; and they did give us food, and told us to go into the barn.</span> <span id="s520">Because they had to go and give us – get us stamps, because they didn't have enough food.</span> <span id="s521">And we went into the barn; and when the man left, we ran out of the barn and ran away, because we were afraid they would turn us in.</span> <span id="s522">And we lived in the forests until the Russians liberated us.</span> <span id="s523">You know, as we read books today and we watch films, and of course, we know the Germans “did not know what was going on.”</span> <span id="s524">So they tell us.</span> <span id="s525">Not true.</span> <span id="s526">They all knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s527">They marched us through the towns to the forced labor, with our heads shaved and wearing striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s528">Often times, a window would open and they would throw food at us.</span> <span id="s529">The workers that worked in the factories with us.</span> <span id="s530">They tell us, “Hitler did this.”</span> <span id="s531">Did Hitler really do this by himself?</span> <span id="s532">Are we forgetting the machinery Hitler had working for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Are we forgetting the soldiers that gathered us?</span> <span id="s534">The people that took care of the ghettos?</span> <span id="s535">The people that drove the trains to Treblinka and other places?</span> <span id="s536">The men and women who were the guards in Auschwitz concentration camp?</span> <span id="s537">Our neighbors that turned us in?</span> <span id="s538">Are we forgetting all of that?</span> <span id="s539">Hitler didn't do it by himself.</span> <span id="s540">Hitler had lots of help.</span> <span id="s541">What about these men that were the guards in the camps, that would go home at night to play with their children and listen to their music and hug their wives while they were killing our parents and our sisters and brothers?</span> <span id="s542">Did they keep a secret?</span> <span id="s543">Can they keep a secret?</span> <span id="s544">How many people can keep a secret?</span> <span id="s545">We were told they didn't know.</span> <span id="s546">What about all the people that lived in the towns around Auschwitz and other concentration camps, that saw the flames day in and day out?</span> <span id="s547">That smelled the stink of the bodies burning, day in and day out?</span> <span id="s548">What about all the people that saw the trains passing by, and the people begging for water, for food to give to their babies?</span> <span id="s549">Why are we forgetting all of that?</span> <span id="s550">Why are we saying, “Hitler did this?”</span> <span id="s551">Yes, Hitler was instrumental in doing this.</span> <span id="s552">What about all of those people?</span> <span id="s553">What about all of those people that were my age, at that time; and were taught to hate me because I was Jewish, and to hate other Jews?</span> <span id="s554">They are my age today.</span> <span id="s555">Do they love me?</span> <span id="s556">I'm the same person, but so are they.</span> <span id="s557">Do they love me today?</span> <span id="s558">Have they overcome their hatred?</span> <span id="s559">Do they forget that, yes, we are Jews, but we're also human beings?</span> <span id="s560">Do they forget that we all breath the same?</span> <span id="s561">End of speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">01:54:00</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Well, Fritzie, we certainly will not forget.</span> <span id="s564">Before we finish the interview, could you share with us a few moments of how you were in fact aware of your freedom, when it came?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: I think – well, as I said, I was liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s566">I think the first thought is to fill your stomach and to have a warm bath.</span> <span id="s567">We're all human.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Let's go back to the point of being liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s569">How did that actually happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: When we heard that Russia had occupied the particular town we were liberated in, we went to them and presented ourselves as prisoners, as they could see, because we were skin and bones, and of course our hair had not grown back in the few days, and we were still in uniform.</span> <span id="s571">We joined other survivors.</span> <span id="s572">They took us to an area where they had other survivors that they had liberated.</span> <span id="s573">And then the Russians took us into a town, where they took over an apartment building; and they put us all into this building and literally made it like a ghetto type of a surrounding.</span> <span id="s574">Although they did give us all the medical attention we needed, and they did give us food and they gave us a bath and they gave clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">They had to put guards around us, because they were afraid we were carriers of disease at that point, as probably we were.</span> <span id="s576">Most of us were sick.</span> <span id="s577">And they – as I said they put guards there; and they put they put wires on the windows.</span> <span id="s578">But they did – we were given freedom at that point.</span> <span id="s579">And I think the, the windows and so forth were being protected – we, we were given the protection from their soldiers at that point, more than anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Because we were women; and, of course, you know, the protection we needed.</span> <span id="s581">After that, after we had medical attention and all, they had asked us where we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s582">And I chose to go back home to my hometown, hoping that someone from my family had survived and would come back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">01:56:34 I was one of the first to come back home.</span> <span id="s584">And when we came – when I came back to our town, our home was destroyed.</span> <span id="s585">Soldiers had used it as a lookout post.</span> <span id="s586">It was kind of on a hill, and they could see different directions from it.</span> <span id="s587">So it was totally destroyed.</span> <span id="s588">My grandmother's home still stood.</span> <span id="s589">There were no windows, but the home was intact.</span> <span id="s590">And I moved into that home.</span> <span id="s591">And we had a train that would pass by our village once a day.</span> <span id="s592">And I would go to meet that train every day, to see if someone else had survived.</span> <span id="s593">And little by little, some of our young people started to trickle back, one by one.</span> <span id="s594">And my grandmother's home became the gathering place for all of us.</span> <span id="s595">We all moved in.</span> <span id="s596">We had what you call communal living; except that we did it out of necessity, 'cause we had nothing else.</span> <span id="s597">And we all migrated to this one home, and lived off of potatoes and carrots or whatever we could get off the fields.</span> <span id="s598">Our neighbors did not come to offer us anything.</span> <span id="s599">Our neighbors – who used our furniture, who used my aunt's clothes and my mother's clothes, that we recognized – not once came to ask if we needed any food or warm clothing.</span> <span id="s600">I like to think that it was done out of shame, maybe out of guilt.</span> <span id="s601">I don't know.</span> <span id="s602">I like to think that this is why they never came forth.</span> <span id="s603">And we all lived that way until we all went in our different directions.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">01:58:03</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: How long were you there?</span> <span id="s606">In which direction did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: When I came back to our hometown in Czechoslovakia, my dad was in this country, in America.</span> <span id="s608">Neighbors – the post office had mail from my father, who was trying to locate his family.</span> <span id="s609">Not knowing what had happened to his family, tried to locate us in any way he could, any of us that had survived.</span> <span id="s610">And the post office had some letters that I had gotten from my father.</span> <span id="s611">And so I knew where he was.</span> <span id="s612">I knew he was in America, but did not remember his address.</span> <span id="s613">And I was able to get in touch with my father, and he was able to send me some money in letters.</span> <span id="s614">And an American dollar at that time was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s615">And so I survived on that.</span> <span id="s616">And after we lived there for a while, I found that I had an uncle that had survived.</span> <span id="s617">My mother's youngest brother, who lived in another town.</span> <span id="s618">He came to find me, and then the Germans closed the borders between East and West, and we were caught on the Communist side of Czechoslovakia, of course.</span> <span id="s619">And my uncle had left.</span> <span id="s620">He went to the Sudetenlands.</span> <span id="s621">And I was – my aunt, my one aunt that I survived and I were caught under communism.</span> <span id="s622">And my uncle paid a man to smuggle my aunt and to smuggle me over the border in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s623">That's a book I need to write one day about that part of it.</span> <span id="s624">To smuggle us to the Sudetenlands.</span> <span id="s625">And we lived with my uncle until my father was able to send us papers, and I was able to come to this country.</span> <span id="s626">I came here in 1947.</span> <span id="s627">I was still of age where I did not need to wait for a quota number, so I was able to – it was a little easier for me to come to this country.</span> <span id="s628">And life is as it is today.</span> <span id="s629">Life goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Fritzie, we cannot thank you enough for sharing this remarkable story with us.</span> <span id="s631">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s633">Thank you.</span> <span id="s634">[Technical conversation] [Displaying photograph]</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: The lady on my right is my mother's youngest sister, she went through Auschwitz concentration camp with me.</span> <span id="s636">The lady in the center is my mother, and the lady on my left is my aunt, she’s my dad’s sister.</span> <span id="s637">She’s the only one that survived out of the three.</span> <span id="s638">I think it’s important to note this picture, see that we were not backwards, even at that time.</span> <span id="s639">As you look at the picture you are going to realize that we’re normal, modern human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">02:01:10</span></p> <p><span id="s641">[Conclusion of Interview]</span></p></body></html>
