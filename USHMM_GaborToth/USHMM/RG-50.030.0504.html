<p><span id="s59">A: Well, my mother was 10 years younger than my father --</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: -- but was still -- you know, and she was 35 when I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s63">And your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: My mother’s name was Betty, her maiden name was Lewy, L-e-w-y.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: And in German it was pronounced Levy.</span> <span id="s67">But it’s Lewy in --</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: [indecipherable] would like it s -- being spelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Most time Levy is with a -- a v, this was with a w.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: So, let’s talk about what your earliest memories of home life in -- in Germany, what -- do you remember what it was like?</span> <span id="s73">Do you remember your apartment, or your hou -- did you live in a house or apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: No, we had a big apartment, actually it were two apartments that were opened up together.</span> <span id="s75">Half of them was my father’s offices and practice, and the other half is where we lived.</span> <span id="s76">I can still see it in my eyes, it was a long, drawn out apartment, there was a big living room, and dining room that were connected together.</span> <span id="s77">Then there was a long hall that was long enough for me to ride my tricycle on.</span> <span id="s78">At the other end were the bedrooms, and big bathroom, and all that.</span> <span id="s79">And then there were about three rooms that were my father’s offices.</span> <span id="s80">One thing I remember in that big hallway, we had an icebox, I mean, not a refrigerator, but an icebox.</span> <span id="s81">It was pink.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Pink?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Pink icebox.</span> <span id="s84">And you know, in summer the iceman came by in his horse and buggy and brought up those big pieces of ice to put in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: When you say icebox, it means that there’s ice that’s make -- making the area cold so you can have food in there, or is it just for ice?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: No, ice for -- like a refrigerator, but not electric.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: It was a -- I mean, we had electricity, and we had running water, and regular toilets and all that, but many of the modern electrical stuff we didn’t have as yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s90">And how often did this guy come with the ice, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No, I couldn’t tell you that honestly.</span> <span id="s92">My guess would be about once a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s94">But they were these huge, big pieces of ice, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Those huge, big pieces of ice, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: -- the melting of the ice truck down, ran behind it as little kids to get some of that cold water on your face --</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: -- on a hot, sunny day.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Did you have your own bedroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: No, my -- I shared it with my brother.</span> <span id="s102">And we got along fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Most of the -- most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Five years is a big.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: No, it’s actually four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Four year -- four years, rather.</span> <span id="s108">It’s a pretty big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yes, it is a big difference, and we did have our fights, of course he was bigger and stronger than I, sometimes very aggravating.</span> <span id="s110">He would just hold out his hand and I couldn’t get anywhere near him.</span> <span id="s111">But we did fine.</span> <span id="s112">I wasn’t very aware of us being different from other kids in the neighborhood and the building.</span> <span id="s113">The building was owned by a man who has the carpentry shop in the back.</span> <span id="s114">There was a little alley where we played in, and then there was this big factory, where you heard the machinery going almost day and night.</span> <span id="s115">Well, not night of course, but I do remember that very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s117">So was this a -- a mixed neighborhood, or were you the only Jews in the neighborhood that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Um.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: When you said that you didn’t feel different --</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: We were little bit on the outskirts, not a suburb like you see here, but in a working class area.</span> <span id="s121">Not in the downtown area of our little town.</span> <span id="s122">And most of the Jewish family lived more in the downtown area.</span> <span id="s123">So there were not too many Jewish people living there, but we -- the town wasn’t that big to begin with --</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: -- so we had good contact with them.</span> <span id="s126">The streetcar ran right in front of our house, and streetcar was a single track.</span> <span id="s127">And in the front of our house there was a bike path.</span> <span id="s128">So when one came from one side, the other one had to wait --</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: -- for it to come from the other side.</span> <span id="s131">And -- but we walked most places.</span> <span id="s132">We walked to school, and walked to the synagogue and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Were you religious, was the family religious [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: No, not religious at all.</span> <span id="s135">My mother’s family was religious, but we were not at all, my father was not at all.</span> <span id="s136">However, we did belong to the synagogue with -- my parents had the respective seats there.</span> <span id="s137">On high holidays that men sat downstairs, the women upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: So it was -- was it Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: It was Conservative --</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: -- it wasn’t Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: It’s a very -- rather Conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: A little.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Leaning on the Conservative --</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: -- side, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: So you didn’t go on a regular basis every week, you went on holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: We did go frequently on Friday night.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: In fact, we also attended what we would call Sunday school here, but actually Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: And three boys and three girls always got called up for Kiddush onto the beamer, and the joke was that my brother didn’t care for the wine but he had to drink it, but I enjoyed it every time that I got up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Enjoy --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: My mother was more religious than my father, but we didn’t keep kosher or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Did -- did your mother light candles on Friday night?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Most of the time, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: And quite often we had friends over for Friday night dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: But, you know, candle lighting was about as far as we went.</span> <span id="s164">My mother did fast on yi -- Yom Kippur.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Not until I was Bar Mitzvah and then I fasted and most of the time still do.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s168">That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: But that’s about the only thing I’m sort of keeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: It is.</span> <span id="s171">Right.</span> <span id="s172">So what was home life like?</span> <span id="s173">Did you all eat lunch together since your father was working there?</span> <span id="s174">Did he take off lunchtime and have lunch with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Not necessarily, he --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: -- but we had lunch -- we had servants, we had the -- my father had a nurse for his office.</span> <span id="s178">We had a live in maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Oh, you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: And she took care of the house, but she didn’t take care of the kids, my mother took care of my brother and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: We took many walks.</span> <span id="s183">The little town was quite picturesque.</span> <span id="s184">Had nice parks that we went through.</span> <span id="s185">And my father, having lived there for such a long time, was well known in the city.</span> <span id="s186">Old type physician, he got called out at night quite frequently.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: So he was well known as a physician as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: As a physician as well --</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: -- especially in the neighborhood that we were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s192">Was he a general practitioner?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yes, he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: So he did all sorts of things, but he didn’t do surgery, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: He did not do surgery.</span> <span id="s196">There were other people who were there who did surgery.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: And took trips to the little farms outside, and I often went with him.</span> <span id="s199">I remember going with him on a -- to a farm and get s -- got scared when all these big dogs and what have you came snooping around the car while he was in there with his patient.</span> <span id="s200">And as I got a little older, learned to ride a bike, many of the calls he made were by bicycle, and I went with him on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s201">It was on one of those trips where I was riding in front of him, and we talked back and forth, all of a sudden I don’t -- didn’t get an answer.</span> <span id="s202">I look around and I see him off the bike, he had had a heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: A very severe heart attack.</span> <span id="s205">It was a friend of ours, not living too far from where we were, we went to her house and called a taxi to take us home.</span> <span id="s206">And this was his first, and very severe heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s208">And do you remember what year that was?</span> <span id="s209">Was that befor -- must have been before Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes, this was before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s211">It was maybe one or two years before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: So you were quite young?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I was six years old or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: So your brother was not traveling with your dad on bicycle, just --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: No, my brother went through the elementary school in our town, and then when it came for him to go to high school he was transferred to Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Now called Wroclaw, where my mother’s family lived.</span> <span id="s220">And he lived with one of my uncle and aunt’s and attended school there.</span> <span id="s221">So he wasn’t home at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: I see, I see.</span> <span id="s223">So did your dad go to the hospital, or did he stay home?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: He stayed home.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: He got taken care of at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Was he then able to go back to his medical practice after the heart attack, or did that --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes, but it took quite a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: It did?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Quite a few months, and he was all right then.</span> <span id="s231">It was probably -- probably in early 1938, because after he got well, we decided to move to a smaller apartment.</span> <span id="s232">And it was in that smaller apartment where we then experienced the Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s234">So Hitler and the Nazis take over in 1933, so you’re -- there -- something is going on.</span> <span id="s235">Do you notice a change --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: -- as you’re growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: I -- I didn't notice a change, really, because all I knew was --</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: -- Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: I mean, all I knew was the Nazi government.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: You know, at three years you have no knowledge of what is going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: The street we lived on, there were often parades moving along the street, and as a little child you love -- you love a parade --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: -- you like to be out there and cheering them on with the other kids.</span> <span id="s249">And somehow I knew I’m not supposed to cheer these people on.</span> <span id="s250">But it was very difficult for me to fully understand what there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s252">Did your parents talk to you about this --</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: -- at all, and say, you know, don’t go out there, be careful, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Th -- be careful, don’t go out there, and tha -- but they left it fairly open.</span> <span id="s256">[indecipherable] other words, they didn’t make too much of a deal out of it.</span> <span id="s257">But I always knew certain things we can’t do.</span> <span id="s258">Just certain rules we as Jews couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s259">Because my parents had a live in maid, they celebrated Christmas in a way, in fact we had a Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s260">The maid wanted it of course, and so we celebrated Christmas.</span> <span id="s261">And one year my parents called my brother and I together and said, we’re not going to celebrate Christmas any more, we’re going to celebrate Chanukah from now on.</span> <span id="s262">And our main question was, will we still get gifts.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: And long as that was the case, we didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Didn’t care, right.</span> <span id="s266">Now, did your maid have to leave at -- I -- I’m assuming that she was not Jewish, the maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: She was not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Did she have to leave your household at a certain point?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s270">A certain point, the law came about that she had to be, I think fo -- 35 or 45 --</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: I think it’s 45 [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: 45 old, and this was a very young person, and she had to leave the house at midnight, December 31st, whatever year it was.</span> <span id="s273">And she stayed til the very last minute, and then left.</span> <span id="s274">And my parents actually found somebody else, 40 f -- was just 45, to take over.</span> <span id="s275">This person had been a cook in a sanitarium, she knew how to cook very well, and she taught my mother how to cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: The second -- they were both called Marthe, the second Marthe.</span> <span id="s278">And when we moved into the smaller apartment and she didn’t come wi -- come with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: She didn’t come.</span> <span id="s280">So when you had the maid, the maid was cleaning and cooking, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Cleaning and cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: -- your mother was taking care of the two of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Right.</span> <span id="s284">Of course, the maid was there as a babysitter --</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: -- when my parents wanted to go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: So you spent a lot of time with both of your parents, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Lot of time with my mother, because my father was --</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Was working, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Working quite hard.</span> <span id="s291">But we frequently took vacations.</span> <span id="s292">In fact, we were fairly close to the Czech border.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: And over a weekend we would go into Czechoslovakia, just to get out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s296">And how would you travel, by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: By car.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: By car?</span> <span id="s299">You had a car?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: My father had a car.</span> <span id="s301">The car was not parked at the house because you couldn’t, you know, it was in a garage maybe a mile away.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: And you had to get it from there.</span> <span id="s304">But we traveled by car all over the place, quite often.</span> <span id="s305">Then when we went into Breslau to live with my mother’s family, we often went by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: And my grandmother, when she came to visit us, came by train.</span> <span id="s308">And where my brother was going to school in Breslau, on the weekend he came home and frequently I used to pick him up at the train station and we would walk home, just the two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s310">Did you miss him when he was away?</span> <span id="s311">When -- or was it actually nice for you to be able to be alone in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: I honestly can’t answer that.</span> <span id="s313">I don’t -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Okay, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s316">I -- I guess it was a little bit of both.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: He was always my big brother, he was always there to help me out, all my life.</span> <span id="s319">And I don’t know whether I felt it’s nice to be alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I-I don’t think I did.</span> <span id="s322">Because I went to school by this time also.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: You started school when, when you were six or five?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: When you were six.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: But when I was five years old I went to a nursery school, a kindergarten, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: -- here we -- it’s part of the school system, there it was separate.</span> <span id="s329">The same lady was in charge of that kindergarten that was in charge when my brother went there.</span> <span id="s330">And by this time it was 1935 or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: And, you know -- you know, it’s 1935, and I remember very clearly the door ringing at our house, and I opened the door.</span> <span id="s333">There is Miss Schroeder with a big bouquet of flowers, and tears in her eyes, coming to see my mother.</span> <span id="s334">Well, it turned out that one of the other kids, five year old kid, his parents objected to t-to being -- to having a Jew in his kindergarten class.</span> <span id="s335">So this was my first experience of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s336">So obviously I had to leave, and Miss Schroeder couldn’t do anything, and this guy was also a physician, the father of this other kid.</span> <span id="s337">So I had to leave.</span> <span id="s338">But this was shortly before I had to enter regular school.</span> <span id="s339">And when my mother took me to school my first day of school, it turned out that that same kid would be in the same class as me.</span> <span id="s340">So she went to the principal, explained the situation, and he put me into a parallel class.</span> <span id="s341">Turned out that I was the only Jewish kid in the whole school, but at least I wasn’t in with this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: And no one else complained, it was this -- it was this --</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I-In the kindergarten it was this particular person.</span> <span id="s344">And I made friends in school, like any kid.</span> <span id="s345">Got real friendly with two other boys, they were separate, boys and girls were separate in that school.</span> <span id="s346">And one kid had a birthday party, he invited me, the other one was fine, and of course my time to have a birthday party, I invited both of them, they both said they’d come.</span> <span id="s347">The next day one of them said, “I’m sorry, but my parents won’t let me come.”</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: And I remembered his name, his name was Webber, his last name was Webber.</span> <span id="s350">Many years later, I was in the amer -- I was this G.I. in the American army, stationed back in Europe, and I tried to make contact with my former teacher.</span> <span id="s351">And somebody wrote me, my name is Webber, you must remember, you went to school with my brother, and basically they wanted some help.</span> <span id="s352">So I wrote him back, yes I remember him very well.</span> <span id="s353">You didn’t want to have any contact with a Jew, now you do?</span> <span id="s354">But the nice thing at that point was that I made contact with my grade school teacher.</span> <span id="s355">He was a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s356">When Crystal Night came about, I went to school.</span> <span id="s357">The synagogue was far enough away from us that I didn’t see what was going on, we were not in the downtown area where all this Jewish retail stores got ruined.</span> <span id="s358">And I found out in school what had occurred.</span> <span id="s359">And when I came home, my mother received me at the door in tears.</span> <span id="s360">My father had been called out to somebody who had been beaten by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s361">And while he was in that person’s house, they came to our house to -- for my father.</span> <span id="s362">He was then picked up at his patient’s home and taken to prison.</span> <span id="s363">And after that, every day, this teacher, his name was Thiel, came and sat on -- next to me on my chair, is your dad home yet?</span> <span id="s364">Every day.</span> <span id="s365">After five days my da -- dad did come home.</span> <span id="s366">The chief of police in our little town took it upon himself not to send anybody to the concentration camp that had been an officer in the German army.</span> <span id="s367">And as a physician, my father was a lieutenant during World War І, so after five days he came home.</span> <span id="s368">Right after he came home the word came out that Jews are not allowed to go to public school any more.</span> <span id="s369">So they kept me home, my parents kept me home.</span> <span id="s370">Mr. Thiel, when he saw me on the street afterwards, would stop his -- jump off his bike, he used to travel around bike, and see how I was doing.</span> <span id="s371">And when my birthday came around, he came to our house to bring all the papers, and all the books that I had.</span> <span id="s372">And he told my mother he was so glad that I didn’t show up that day because the principal sent somebody in, you’ve got the only Jew in the whole school, send him home.</span> <span id="s373">And he hadn’t -- didn’t have to do that in front of the other kids.</span> <span id="s374">So I got in contact with him in 1951 - ’52.</span> <span id="s375">We have corresponded for awhile, he was in a little town too far off the beaten track --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: -- for me to visit him.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: But he must -- he was quite different, right, he just --</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: He -- he -- he wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: -- he must have been taking a chance to do what he was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: He took a big chance --</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: -- with what he was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: How did this affect you [indecipherable] as a little boy?</span> <span id="s385">Do you re -- do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: I don’t know how to answer that, how it affected me, it’s -- in a way I took it in stride.</span> <span id="s387">It became normal.</span> <span id="s388">The discrimination against you became a normal thing.</span> <span id="s389">Sounds ridiculous if I say it now, but that’s the feeling I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: No, but it makes sense.</span> <span id="s393">It becomes part of the pattern of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: It becomes the pattern of life -- excuse me -- as I said, my brother was in Breslau, and he was in Breslau at Crystal Night.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: He came home somehow or another, just be with us.</span> <span id="s397">But shortly after that was his birthday, his 13th birthday, his Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s398">There was no Torah left in Liegnitz because the synagogue got burned.</span> <span id="s399">So he brought his Torah home from Breslau.</span> <span id="s400">Some of the little shuls were in areas that they couldn’t burn, and there was a few Torahs left.</span> <span id="s401">He carried one on the train from Breslau back to Liegnitz.</span> <span id="s402">And we had the Bar Mitzvah in our house.</span> <span id="s403">And where we lived, that smaller apartment, the second and third floor was a Jewish old age home, and we shared a larger apartment with another family.</span> <span id="s404">And that’s where we had his Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s405">Many people had come home from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s406">This is 1938.</span> <span id="s407">We have -- the family showed that they have intentions of leaving, they got out of the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: I remember these people coming home with shaven heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Were you told where they had come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: You had.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s416">I mean, concentration camp was an everyday word.</span> <span id="s417">An uncle of mine, the one that my brother lived with, in the family, he was taken into concentration camp earlier than Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s418">There was some activity, I forgot what they called it, where if you had any -- done anything illegal years before, you end up -- you got taken into prison again.</span> <span id="s419">My uncle did some cheating, I guess, on the income tax, I don’t know, at one point it got punitive action, he paid his penalty, but that wasn’t enough.</span> <span id="s420">They used that excuse to take him.</span> <span id="s421">And he couldn’t take it, he went up against the electric fence, got killed right then and there.</span> <span id="s422">My mother had a picture of him in Shanghai, and had it on one of the tables, a man came in one time, he said, I know this man.</span> <span id="s423">I saw him getting shot against the ca -- against the fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: This is your mother -- one of your mother’s brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: My mother’s sister’s husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Sister’s husband, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: And, so all these things were told to me, I heard about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Was all part of our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: They had sent their son to England to go to school, Cambridge.</span> <span id="s434">That’s why they had the room free for my brother to live in.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s436">Do -- and your brother came back after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: He came back -- I’m not even sure at this point whether he continued his schooling in Breslau or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Or not, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: But I didn’t go back to a regular school.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: I had the young woman come in to sta -- give me tutoring, private lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: And the Bar Mitzvah, was that in your house, or was that in the -- the home for the aged?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: In the home for the aged.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s445">So were there a number of people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: There’s quite a few people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yeah, and a little anecdote, my mother had a big dinner for everybody and turned out that it were -- we were 13 people.</span> <span id="s449">She was superstitious, so she quickly called a good friend who was a bachelor to come join us.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: That’s great.</span> <span id="s451">We’re going to have to change the tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s456">I think we forgot to get the name of your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Oh, my brother’s name is o -- as he was born was Hans.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: H-a-n-s.</span> <span id="s460">But he changed it to Henry when we became Americanized.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: American.</span> <span id="s462">And did he take the n off?</span> <span id="s463">The double --</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: So it -- he’s Culman too, with one n?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: With one n.</span> <span id="s467">The only one who wouldn’t take it off was my mother.</span> <span id="s468">She said, “I married your father with two n’s and I’m going to keep the two n’s.”</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Keep it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: And my father had already passed away by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s472">Before we get to what happens after Kristallnacht, let me just ask you w-w -- ho-how you remember being in the house?</span> <span id="s473">Was it a -- a very cheerful kind of home to be in, was it serious, or it was a combination --</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: No, it was a ch -- it was a cheerful home.</span> <span id="s475">We had no, you know, I have no bad memories of that at all.</span> <span id="s476">Played out in the backyard with the other kids, and played cowboys and Indians and we got dressed up, and these were all non-Jewish kids that lived in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: The river was not -- was two or three blocks away.</span> <span id="s479">And in winter that’s where we dragged our sled and sled -- sled down the side of the riverbank.</span> <span id="s480">In the spring and summer it was a beautiful area to walk.</span> <span id="s481">I remember walking there with my mother and at the end of the trail, bu -- there was some farmyard which usually had some piglets there, and so -- it’s all very pleasant memories.</span> <span id="s482">The unpleasant parts were like I mentioned, the fact that I got kicked out of nursery school, had the problems in school, then couldn’t go there.</span> <span id="s483">But most of the unpleasant memories are actually things I heard about.</span> <span id="s484">You know, my parents talked about this person got taken to jail for whatever reason, that person disappeared.</span> <span id="s485">And most of it didn’t really get bad for me until Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s487">Did your -- did your parents take you to the f -- was there a theater, were there children’s theater, do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: No, th --</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Was there movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: There was movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: [indecipherable] movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: There were movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: And did you like the movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Saw Laurel and Hardy, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: But there was a theater that my parents attended, I mean adult theater, but I don’t remember going to the theater at all.</span> <span id="s499">[indecipherable] And movies you didn’t go that often.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: In summer there was ice cream stands, it wasn’t like here where you could eat ice cream all year long, you just ate it in summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Summertime, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: And then once in a ye -- once a year a circus came to town, I remember going to that.</span> <span id="s504">But I had no unpleasant mem -- personal memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Personally, they didn’t get bad.</span> <span id="s507">Eventually, after I’ve said this I realize that that wasn’t quite true.</span> <span id="s508">There used to be kids that used to attack me and start hitting on me, called me a Jew, and all kinds of names.</span> <span id="s509">But didn’t happen that often.</span> <span id="s510">When I came home from Hebrew school, I remember once being attacked by three or four kids.</span> <span id="s511">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Did they hurt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Well, not seriously, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Did you fight back?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: No, I ran.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: You ran.</span> <span id="s517">Probably smarter with three or four kids against you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s519">The other thing that I remember is in school there were religious classes, and that religion was taught in school.</span> <span id="s520">My initial teacher, Mr. Thiel used to tell me, well, just sit in class and don’t participate.</span> <span id="s521">And then one year I got another teacher and he had me leave the classroom for the religious class.</span> <span id="s522">And some of the other kids had s -- said, I didn’t know you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s523">They didn’t realize I was.</span> <span id="s524">And that was tough because I went outside, I was the only one in the whole school, for an hour.</span> <span id="s525">It wasn’t long enough to go home, so I just wandered around the area and then got back into class.</span> <span id="s526">So the fact that I was set aside was hard to take.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Now your f -- your father had his heart attack, it was 1936, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: No, I-I think it was either ’37 or ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: So a -- a --</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Just --</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: -- so maybe a year before Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Did he lose his job at this point as a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Oh he -- no, he --</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Was he not allowed to practice, or he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: He was still allowed to practice, and at one point he was not allowed to practice any more except for Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: In our town -- I don’t know how many Jewish doctors there were, but he was the one that was assigned to practice for Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: And do you remember a significant difference in -- in -- in him, once that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s541">He became much more serious to me, much more ver -- worried about everything.</span> <span id="s542">Seriously starting to talk about emigrating, getting out of Germany.</span> <span id="s543">Started to check into going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s544">And this was before Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s545">Then, after Crystal Night we made contact with far enough relatives in the United States.</span> <span id="s546">Our papers at the office, the Palestine office got burned, so everything there got -- had to be started from scratch again.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: This was burned during Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Crystal Night.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: And, you know, in my mind as a child, I was looking forward to this big trip we’re going to take someplace, somewhere.</span> <span id="s551">And some people started talking about going to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s552">Shanghai, being an international city, it -- you didn’t need any papers, any visas, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s553">All you needed was to get on a ship and get there.</span> <span id="s554">But it had a bad reputation, and people didn’t want to go there, including my parents.</span> <span id="s555">So one time after Crystal Night, we had friends over the house for a dinner -- I don’t know if it was a Friday night dinner or not, but one person said, you know what?</span> <span id="s556">I’m not sticking around her any more.</span> <span id="s557">I’m going to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s558">Second person said I’ll join you, my father said, I’ll join you.</span> <span id="s559">If that wouldn’t have happened, we probably would have been stuck in Germany.</span> <span id="s560">By this time we had an affidavit from the United States and in my parent’s mind we’ll go to Shanghai for a year or two until our number gets called up and then we go to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: And that’s how we eventually ended up in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Did they tell you anything about Shanghai when they si -- made this decision?</span> <span id="s564">Or had you heard that this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: I just heard --</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: -- that this was a strange place.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: It’s a strange place, you know, I looked it up on an atlas where it is.</span> <span id="s568">In the meantime, my -- a couple of my uncles her -- moo -- moved to Panama, and I followed on the atlas where they went, you know, we all -- all the trips of course were by ship, it wasn’t by plane.</span> <span id="s569">So he stopped at many different places.</span> <span id="s570">And I was looking forward to this adventure.</span> <span id="s571">So we decided to go on a Dutch liner instead of a German or Italian like most people did.</span> <span id="s572">The advantage on a Dutch liner is that the so-called board money, you could take right out.</span> <span id="s573">The Germans allowed you x number of dollars, or marks, of course, to take on board the ship, to spend on the ship, but not to take off the ship.</span> <span id="s574">So when you went on a German liner, they strictly adhere to that.</span> <span id="s575">On the Dutch liner that we went to, the purser said to my father, well didn’t you lose x number of dollars gambling last night?</span> <span id="s576">Didn’t you buy a box of cigars?</span> <span id="s577">And all that was written down and two days after we left Europe, he had all his money in his pocket.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Whatever amount that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Do you remember packing for Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Oh yes, very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: To get all your heavy stuff on, you got from the freight company something they called a lift, which was like a big box, size of a room, and everything gets put in there.</span> <span id="s584">And when you were packing that, somebody from the Gestapo was there watching what you were packing.</span> <span id="s585">Well, when they came to do this packing, my mother sent me outside to play.</span> <span id="s586">And I had some play money, which was back from the German inflation in the 20’s, had absolutely no value.</span> <span id="s587">And she was getting ready to pack that, and the guy from the Gestapo was -- put up a fuss, you can’t take that.</span> <span id="s588">And she was arguing, that’s my kid’s play money, it has no value.</span> <span id="s589">I don’t know for sure any more whether we left -- let him keep it or not, but I told my mother, “Let him have it, I don’t care.”</span> <span id="s590">You know, it’s just play money.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: So did you come in and out when --</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: -- when these guys were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yes, yes, I walked in and --</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Were they nasty?</span> <span id="s596">What were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: They were actually a little nasty at the beginning and then my mother gave them a drink, and they calmed down a bit.</span> <span id="s600">And some of the little knickknacks that we had, she gave one person this and one person that.</span> <span id="s601">It wasn’t really bribery in any sense, but it softens them up in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: And my parents also had the idea that maybe we can get off the ship somewhere before we get to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s604">I mean, India was still part of Britain, the Philippines was part of the United States, Singapore was part of Britain.</span> <span id="s605">We thought we could maybe get off there.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: So they decided that this lift with all our belongings should be kept by the freight company until they got the word from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s609">Instead of going on the shi --</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Instead -- instead of being shipped at the same time as we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I mean, the ship we were on was a passenger ship, it wasn’t a freighter, and the lift would have to go on a freighter.</span> <span id="s613">The -- obviously we didn't get off anyplace.</span> <span id="s614">Ended up in Shanghai and then contacted the freight company, she -- send it to us, this is our address.</span> <span id="s615">But in the meantime it’s July of 1939.</span> <span id="s616">By the time this lift gets onto a freighter it’s September, and the war breaks out.</span> <span id="s617">And all German ships get the signal, go into a neutral port.</span> <span id="s618">The Dutch is -- East Indies, which are now Indonesia, were still neutral, so the ship ran into a neutral port in Dutch East Indies, and we had to pay a fair amount of money to get it from there to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Get it to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: But eventually we got it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: When -- when your mother was packing the lift, did you have to pack a little suitcase, or did she pack it for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: She packed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: She packed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: She packed it all.</span> <span id="s625">I mean, I didn’t do any packing per se.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: You didn’t?</span> <span id="s627">Were you able -- did she take any toys for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Oh yeah, we took some toys.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Or games?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Games, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Did you -- so you had that on the ship with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: We had some of it on the ship, and some of it was on the freight -- in the -- in the lift.</span> <span id="s633">So I had a few toys, to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: This is a long trip.</span> <span id="s635">You go to Genoa, right, so you have to take a train to Genoa.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: We took a train to Genoa.</span> <span id="s637">We took a train through Germany to say good-bye to relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: My father’s brother was in Upper Silesia.</span> <span id="s640">We had tried to talk him to join us in shan -- to Shanghai and he refused.</span> <span id="s641">So we went there, we went to Berlin to say good-bye to some former friends and relatives and to the western -- I mean, we really did a whole tour around Germany by train and eventually came to Genoa.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: And what happened to your car?</span> <span id="s643">Did your father sell the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: I guess he sold it, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: I never thought about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: But he must have sold it.</span> <span id="s649">When we came to the border, they had everybody get off -- not everybody, all the Jews get off the train to be searched, body searched.</span> <span id="s650">And this was middle of the night, I was fast asleep.</span> <span id="s651">So my mother said to the Gestapo, SS guy, whoever he was, “Can I leave my kid here?”</span> <span id="s652">He says, “You can if you want to, but I’m not guaranteeing that the train won’t take off without you.”</span> <span id="s653">So she woke me up.</span> <span id="s654">I did not have to strip, but my parents did.</span> <span id="s655">And the amount of money that my father was allowed to take out, he had more on him than he was allowed to, he telegraphed that to his brother.</span> <span id="s656">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Oh, he was able to --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Send --</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: -- to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: -- to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: So we took out only what was legal.</span> <span id="s663">At this point my father didn’t want to mess anything up for a few dollars.</span> <span id="s664">And then we went on the train to Genoa, and my mother’s sister, whose husband had been killed in the concentration camp earlier, was living in Milan.</span> <span id="s665">And she came to say good-bye to us.</span> <span id="s666">And her train and our train came together.</span> <span id="s667">I was walking through the train and all of a sudden there’s Tante Trude.</span> <span id="s668">I ran into her arms.</span> <span id="s669">And she came to Genoa with us and saw off -- saw us off from the pier.</span> <span id="s670">I can still see her waving to us as we were leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: And she felt okay staying in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Well, her s -- husband had been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Killed, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Her only child, her son, was in England, so she eventually got to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: By the time te -- she got to England --</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: -- he had managed to go to Palestine and join the British Brigade at Palestine.</span> <span id="s679">And eventually she joined him in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: [indecipherable] each place that she went.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: She was always -- she would -- she was telling us later on the ship was blacked out that she took from England to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s682">She went to Palestine legally.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: This was before the illegal --</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: -- immigrations.</span> <span id="s687">But it was in middle of the war.</span> <span id="s688">But she was there to see us off, and eventually we got to meet her -- meet up with her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s690">So how do you remember this ship trip, which was really long?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: It was -- took about six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Well, I have a tendency to get seasick very easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: But you didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: I didn’t know that beforehand.</span> <span id="s696">But the Dutch liner was a luxury liner and they had special -- in the dining room the children were not allowed to eat with the parents and I hated that idea.</span> <span id="s697">So I was in a separate room with the little kids, you know, the two and three years old --</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: -- and o -- me at nine years old, I felt I was big enough to do that, you know, to be with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: I didn’t like that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: And you would still see land when I got seasick the first time.</span> <span id="s704">I don’t know whether that has to do with seasickness or just anxiety about being left alone.</span> <span id="s705">But eventually it got alright, had ping pong tables, I learned to count to 21 in -- in Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Did you?</span> <span id="s707">Had you played ping pong before?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Yes, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: You had?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: We had, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: So that was fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: That was a lot of fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Were there -- were there a lot of kids?</span> <span id="s714">Were there kids your age on this trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: There were.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Yeah, well, mainly Dutch kids and my brother s -- kids, there was a big swimming pool and I didn’t know how to swim yet, but my brother did, and he enjoyed that a great deal.</span> <span id="s718">And I had a good time on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Now, there were two other couples, right?</span> <span id="s720">Mr. and Mrs. Ritter?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Mr. and Mrs. Ritter, and Mr. and Mrs. Braun, Braun, and a Mr. Salinger.</span> <span id="s722">We were nine people altogether.</span> <span id="s723">Mr. and Mrs. Braun were the people that we shared this apartment with in Germany -- in Liegnitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: They had three children, they had left Germany before that.</span> <span id="s726">One went to Argentina, one went to Holland, and one went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: So they were older kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: They were older kids.</span> <span id="s729">Little older, not that much older.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Teena -- late teenagers --</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: -- I believe, or maybe early 20’s, or -- I have no idea.</span> <span id="s734">And they -- it was very tragic what happened to them, the -- we were in Shanghai for about a year when they got a telegram from Argentina that their son had committed suicide down there.</span> <span id="s735">Reason, of course I don’t know.</span> <span id="s736">Their other son who went to Holland was caught up by the Nazis --</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: -- and disappeared.</span> <span id="s739">And their daughter survived in England, that’s who they went to after the war.</span> <span id="s740">The Ritters had two sons, the younger of which was my brother’s age, the other one was a little bit older.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: And they had gone to Palestine before that, and they were in Palestine.</span> <span id="s743">The Ritters went -- went to them when the war was over.</span> <span id="s744">When we all left Shanghai they went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s745">Mr. Ritter had a heart attack on the ship the day it landed in Palestine.</span> <span id="s746">And whether he got to recognize his son or not, I don’t know, but his sons were able to see him before he died.</span> <span id="s747">Mr. Salinger is another interesting story.</span> <span id="s748">He was married to a non-Jewish woman, they had a son.</span> <span id="s749">She would not go with him to Shanghai, so they divorced.</span> <span id="s750">The son was eventually drafted into the German army.</span> <span id="s751">When the war was over, he went back to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: And lived in what became East Germany.</span> <span id="s754">His son survived also.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s756">That’s quite a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: But the f -- this group of nine people, once we got to Shanghai, we rented a house -- actually were some more people, I mean -- it was the equivalent of a townhouse, and we all lived in there.</span> <span id="s758">Henry and I -- Hans became Henry ba -- were the only children, so my family had two rooms, all the others had one room.</span> <span id="s759">They had a joint kitchen, everybody cooked together.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: And eventually made that into a luncheon area for other people.</span> <span id="s762">But especially the Ritters saw their sons in my brother and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: As I started school in Shanghai they were always interested in how I did, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: So they were sort of like another set of parents or at least some kind of relative in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yeah, well we were close to them --</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Close.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: -- I didn’t consider them relatives, I think they considered us more their children --</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: -- than we considered them our parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: So not so close with the Brauns?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Oh, just as close with the Brauns.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Just as close.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s775">And sal --</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: And Salinger?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: -- sal -- also --</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Also, so it --</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: -- wi -- wi -- also, was very cl -- very closely --</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: -- knit group.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: When you first arrived and saw Shanghai and saw this strange port with all these small boats, big boats, whatever, what -- what did you think?</span> <span id="s783">Was it exciting to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Exciting and scary both.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: And scary, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Everything was so strange.</span> <span id="s787">First of all, Shanghai, the waterfront is called the Bund, which prior to World War ІІ had these giant, beautiful buildings, high rise buildings right around, they look very impressive.</span> <span id="s788">But then you saw these coolies, these are the workman.</span> <span id="s789">When they took the heavy stuff and carried it on bamboo sticks, walking one man in front, one man behind on bamboo sticks, in a singsong voice so they kept their tread going so they moved smoothly.</span> <span id="s790">This was weird to see.</span> <span id="s791">Then you saw the rickshaws, where a man actually pulling a little wagon all along the street.</span> <span id="s792">And then the poverty, the beggars on the street, crippled to some degree, trying to beg stuff.</span> <span id="s793">And Mrs. Ritter had a sister who was in Shanghai already, they actually were there to welcome us.</span> <span id="s794">They said, well most of the refugees are moving into the Hongkew area.</span> <span id="s795">Hongkew was a part of Shanghai that had been devastated during the war between the Japanese and the Chinese.</span> <span id="s796">Many refugees, most refugees ended up there and started to rebuild the area.</span> <span id="s797">People were put into what was referred to as homes.</span> <span id="s798">One room per family, large rooms where people were living together.</span> <span id="s799">And everybody warned us against that, so this is where we didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s800">So the first thing we did was go into a hotel on Bubbling Well Road and stayed there for awhile, well I stayed there while the adults went out shopping for a place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Now is this where you played “Troubles” with the staff?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: This -- this is where --</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: And what is that game?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Well, it’s -- the German name for it is Mensch Ärgere dich Nicht.</span> <span id="s805">I’m not quite sure what it is called in England, but it’s a board game.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: And while they were going around, I sat down there in the hotel lobby, whoever wanted to play with me, played with me.</span> <span id="s808">I won every game, I don’t know if it was purposely or not, but it kept me busy, it kept me from running around.</span> <span id="s809">But looking at it back now, my parents left me as a nine year old kid in a strange hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: But nothing happened, I’ve ha -- I had fun, people enjoyed having a little kid there.</span> <span id="s812">And these were not necessarily Chinese, these were Americans, British, French, all kinds of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: So is this in the in -- what they call the International Settlement?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: In the International Settlement, and the house that we -- they eventually found, belonging to another person, I don’t know if he was leasing it, or what, but we subleased the house, was in the French concession.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Rue Ratard.</span> <span id="s817">In French, everything was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s818">And that’s where we eventually ended up.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Now yo -- did you stay in that hotel before they found the house, or were you able to run around the streets some?</span> <span id="s820">Did you go walk with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: I walked with my parents a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: A little bit.</span> <span id="s823">Was --</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: I don’t remember too much of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: You don’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: No.</span> <span id="s827">But it’s -- when I, 50 years later went back to revisit Shanghai, we stayed at a very fancy hotel in approximately the same area.</span> <span id="s828">So I rec --</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: As the ho -- as the house, the townhouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: As -- no, as the other -- as the other hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: It was on the same street.</span> <span id="s833">That hotel wer -- I couldn’t find any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: The Burlington Hotel was the name of it, but I couldn’t find that.</span> <span id="s836">But there was this very fancy, modern hotel, which I believe was built up in approximately the same area.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Same place.</span> <span id="s838">Did you recognize the area when you went?</span> <span id="s839">Did it look sim -- similar --</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Well, part of it, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: My wife and I were -- went walking, I said, “You know, down this street, I believe is where my school used to be.”</span> <span id="s843">She said, “Well let’s go.”</span> <span id="s844">So we walked down there, I said, “If I remember correctly there was a big wall, a cement wall around it, and behind the wall was a synagogue and this Jewish school.”</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: And bingo, there it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: It was.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: The school was now a government building.</span> <span id="s849">We couldn’t go into it, but I recognized it.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: My goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: And the synagogue was there, it became sort of a museum, and we were able to go into it.</span> <span id="s852">And those things I recognized.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s854">Okay, we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Okay, just let me go back a second, do you remember when you got off the ship to go into Shanghai, did you get into trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Lot of people did, and they were transported by trucks to the homes or other places in Hongkew.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: I’m trying to remember, I don’t know whether we went by -- h-how we got to that hotel.</span> <span id="s861">I imagine we went by cab, but I couldn’t tell --</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Not by rickshaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: No, we used rickshaws later on, but I don’t believe we took rickshaws to the hotel, however I -- my memory fails me on that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Do you remember what the mood of everybody was?</span> <span id="s865">Were people very anxious?</span> <span id="s866">Could you --</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: No, I don’t think as a nine year old child I could --</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: That you would -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: -- detect that.</span> <span id="s870">I know that we -- the ship docked on the other side of the river, you know, Shanghai is along a river, and we took like a little ferry boat --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: -- to the Custom House area where we came in, and on that ferry boat, there was somebody from the Jewish community, from Jewish committee in Shanghai who sort of clued us in a little bit.</span> <span id="s873">But what he clued us in is, he showed us the Garden bridge, the bridge going over the Suzhou creek on one side of which was the International Settlement under British control and the other side was already under Japanese control.</span> <span id="s874">And he told us that you have to walk across this bridge, you can’t drive across it, that you have to show your papers to the Japanese guard, and the Chinese people that are crossing there always had to take off their hat and bow down to the Japanese.</span> <span id="s875">And somebody made s-some remark, well, what are we coming to here?</span> <span id="s876">It sounds as bad as what we’ve left behind.</span> <span id="s877">And that of course, is where the homes were, that’s where the most refugees began to live.</span> <span id="s878">But we, somehow or another didn’t go there.</span> <span id="s879">We ended up at this Burlington Hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: And as I say, I don’t recall how we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Do you remember being registered anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: No, you just walked in?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: We just walked in.</span> <span id="s886">I bi -- I mean -- obviously we had to register at the hotel, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: -- not registered as --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: But not at any formal --</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Formal [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s891">I imagine we did, but I don’t remember any [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: So you don’t remember -- you didn’t have to carry papers or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: I didn’t.</span> <span id="s894">My parents had to --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: -- they had their German passports still, with the big J in it.</span> <span id="s897">And we as children were listed in that passport --</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: -- we didn’t have our separate passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: You didn’t have your own.</span> <span id="s901">Ha -- do you remember how long you stayed in that hotel?</span> <span id="s902">Was it a couple of weeks, was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: It wasn’t too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: A few da -- it wasn’t too --</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Be -- maybe a week or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s907">And then you moved to the French Concession, which was more south, closer to the harbor, I guess.</span> <span id="s908">Or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: No, actually not, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: -- it’s -- the French Concession stretched along, you know, mi-might say it’s parallel to the International Settlement.</span> <span id="s912">The French Concession had the nicer living quarters.</span> <span id="s913">Even today it still has --</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: -- the nicer living quarters.</span> <span id="s916">And what I do remember is like, the streetcars that could only go up to one point and then you had to take another streetcar on the other side.</span> <span id="s917">And there were trolley cars that were driven by electricity, but no tracks.</span> <span id="s918">So the electricity was different in the French area that it was in the in -- in the International Settlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: When they got there, one guy jumped off the car, they took a running start, pulled the wires down, ran across the street and then hooked the wires back up on the other side.</span> <span id="s921">And that’s how you got from one end to the other.</span> <span id="s922">It wasn’t too far away because from there I was able to walk to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: And school was in the International Settlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: It was in the International Settlement?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: It was a Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Just called the Shanghai Jewish school, is that where you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: The Shanghai Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: And did you go there fairly quickly from when you ca -- you came in July --</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: No, we came in July of -- and they were overcrowded there, and I had a hard time -- my parents had a hard time getting us registered.</span> <span id="s931">Eventually we did, but by this time it was September, or October.</span> <span id="s932">I think it was after the Jewish holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: The principal, he was called Reverend Brown.</span> <span id="s935">Course, was all British schooling, and my first day in school they had a dictation.</span> <span id="s936">I ac -- should go back a little bit to -- when I was being tutored in Liegnitz, I was also tutored in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: So for about half the year I had some English lessons.</span> <span id="s939">And that was my whole experience in English.</span> <span id="s940">Now I come into this class, it’s being taught in English, we have a dictation, where you write down everything.</span> <span id="s941">The teacher knows I -- where I came from, so she corrected every word I misspelled, which was practically every word.</span> <span id="s942">You’ve never seen so much red ink on one piece of paper.</span> <span id="s943">But it didn’t take long.</span> <span id="s944">They put me in a class a year younger than I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: They put you in second grade?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: I guess it was second grade, I had not -- I don’t even remember for sure what grade, they called it form, the British school.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Form.</span> <span id="s949">But I was -- I mean, the kids in class were a year younger than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: And after a year I caught up enough to be put into my regular class.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: And was everything taught in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Everything was taught in English.</span> <span id="s954">But as a child, you pick this up very quickly.</span> <span id="s955">The other children were help -- the teachers were helpful.</span> <span id="s956">Some of the other kids were refugee kids that were there a little longer than I, they helped.</span> <span id="s957">I joined the Cub Scouts, right -- you know, about a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: And your brother was in the Boy Scouts?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Boy Scouts, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: So your brother was in fifth grade, or sixth grade, something like -- whatever -- whatever the equivalent --</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: What -- I do -- I don’t remember what number --</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: -- it was, but he was obviously four years ahead of me, however, he only went to school for about a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: And then he went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: And then he was sent to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s967">So, are your parents learning English at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Very little, very --</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Very little.</span> <span id="s970">So you’re speaking German at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: At ho -- home we spoke German, in school we spoke English.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Spoke English.</span> <span id="s973">And is there a common language in Shanghai or is just -- English just one of them because there’s so many languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: English was the main language that you were able to [indecipherable] get along with.</span> <span id="s975">Obviously it’s Chinese, but even Chinese wasn’t [indecipherable] I mean, the Shanghai dialect is quite different from Mandarin, which is the main language of China today.</span> <span id="s976">My brother picked up Chinese --</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: -- where he worked.</span> <span id="s979">I never did, other than a few words here and there, some which you -- curse words you learn very easily in every language.</span> <span id="s980">But my parents lived within this Jewish -- German Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: In the French Concession.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: In the French Concession, we had [indecipherable] contact with other people.</span> <span id="s983">My father tried to open a practice, he actually took an office for about a year or so in the International Settlement.</span> <span id="s984">But the refugees as a rule did not come to him because they didn’t have any money, the Chinese didn’t come to him.</span> <span id="s985">He had recommendation to two -- to two physicians, and they were very nice to us, they helped my father out, taught him something about [indecipherable] diseases.</span> <span id="s986">But all in all my father was not able to make a living from his practice.</span> <span id="s987">He tried all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s988">One time somebody offered him a job in the leprosy colony, my mother put her foot down on that.</span> <span id="s989">She said, that we don’t need.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: She thought he would catch it?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Leprosy is -- you know, has a bad name to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Bad reputation.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Very bad reputation.</span> <span id="s994">And -- but one time somebody was looking for my father and I said, well he’s in that hospital over there.</span> <span id="s995">And I said well come on, I’ll -- I’ll take you there.</span> <span id="s996">And I took off with these two complete strangers to show them where my father was.</span> <span id="s997">My mother was horrified.</span> <span id="s998">You know, you hear about kidnapping and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s999">But I was perfectly at ease to do that.</span> <span id="s1000">And we walked to school every day and I caught up fairly quickly with my class.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: So what was your father doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Sat around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Sat around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Doing nothing.</span> <span id="s1005">Became very depressed.</span> <span id="s1006">Eventually these nine people decided to open up a little lunch room, you know?</span> <span id="s1007">Noon time was the main meal that you ate in Europe.</span> <span id="s1008">There were a lot of people there who didn’t know how to cook, pi -- single bachelors, what have you.</span> <span id="s1009">They loved the lunch room, but inflation went -- was so rampant, that we didn’t make any money.</span> <span id="s1010">We basically paid for our own food.</span> <span id="s1011">And my father acted like a maitre d’, you know, welcoming people, seating them, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1012">In between he still practiced a little bit.</span> <span id="s1013">My mother did most of the cooking.</span> <span id="s1014">The other men did the shopping, they used to go out and come back on the rickshaw with all the food.</span> <span id="s1015">There wasn’t much refrigeration there, so you had to buy the food the same day that you were cooking it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: And I don’t know for how many years that lasted, but it lasted for a little while.</span> <span id="s1018">My mother also baked cakes for people.</span> <span id="s1019">And what we loved is when one of the cakes didn’t come out right.</span> <span id="s1020">Then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: So you could have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: -- that was not good enough to sell, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: -- good enough for us to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: So she learned well enough from Marthe how to cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: She -- she learned -- she became an excellent cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: But cooked everything in the German style.</span> <span id="s1029">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: -- no Chinese food, per se.</span> <span id="s1032">She took the Chinese vegetables, and somehow or another --</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Made them into German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: -- made it into German food, which is, of course, what everybody loved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: She also adj -- when -- once we got our furniture, she got her sewing machine, and she started sewing for people.</span> <span id="s1037">So she did -- whatever money we made, was made by her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1039">So your father must have been really demoralized by this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Terribly demoralized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: And the end result of that was that my brother took on the job of being the head of the household.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: He began to speak English, he began to speak some Chinese.</span> <span id="s1045">He was able to maneuver throughout the city, and one of these doctors that my father was referred to knew a machinist from Switzerland, and he suggested the Henry might get a job with him, which he did.</span> <span id="s1046">But this place was at the other end of town.</span> <span id="s1047">It was -- I don’t know how long it took him, but it took him about an hour by bicycle to get there.</span> <span id="s1048">And then he worked under the worst conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Was this Allensbach?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Alle -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: He wasn’t very nice to him either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: He was not very nice to Henry --</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: -- and Henry has never forgiven my parents for what they -- that they send him out like that.</span> <span id="s1055">But they were desperate, my father especially was desperate.</span> <span id="s1056">He didn’t see how things are going to go on, you know.</span> <span id="s1057">How long is this war going to take?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: So at 14, he worked -- he started to work full time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1061">Can I ask you, was this -- was this sort of typical of the problems that the refugees had, that the male in the family, the -- the adult male was not able to earn a living and the kids had to go out, or wa -- do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: It was not -- it was typical in some instances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Doctors, lawyers -- lawyers had no way of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: The professionals had nothing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: -- pro -- professionals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: If you were a shoemaker --</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: You ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: -- you did fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: If you did -- a watchmaker, you did fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Talking about watchmaker, there was a watchmaker who we became friendly with later on, Flautto, he actually made watches and clocks from scratch.</span> <span id="s1075">And when Roosevelt got re-elected in 1940, he send Roosevelt wa -- a little clock that he had made as a present, and got a sec -- thank you note.</span> <span id="s1076">I became friendly with his son years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: So these are the people did very well, some people opened up little shops.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: And also we must remember my father was in this -- by this time 50 some years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Right, right, he wasn’t a young person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: He was not a young person any more.</span> <span id="s1083">He tried to learn other trades, but that didn’t come easy to him.</span> <span id="s1084">He was often taken advantage of, and we didn’t trust the banks.</span> <span id="s1085">Some of the money we had was kept in either British pounds or American dollars, and then every time you needed some, you changed it into China’s currency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: You didn’t do that too much because the inflation was so tremendous.</span> <span id="s1088">So my father one time went and got some money in Chinese currency, on the Central Reserve Bank of China.</span> <span id="s1089">He came home with that and Henry said, “Doctor, you got taken.</span> <span id="s1090">Central Reserve Bank, that’s the bank of the Chinese puppet government under the Japanese [indecipherable] government.</span> <span id="s1091">It’s not going to be worth much.”</span> <span id="s1092">But shortly afterwards the Japanese took over China --</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: And then it was worth more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: And then it became the currency to have.</span> <span id="s1095">So where he thought he was taken he actually got ahead of everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Now when you first came, the Japanese controlled part of Hongkew, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: They controlled all of Hongkew, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: All of Hongkew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: And -- and the International Settlement went up to a certain point, but that was not taken over by the Japanese, nor was the fre -- the rest of Shanghai --</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Was taken over on December eighth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: At that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: In 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: [indecipherable] in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1107">But so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: But up until that point it was still separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Had this separate government, they had the French government on one area which was like a French colony and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: And then the British.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: -- then the British were primarily in charge of the International Settlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Was there an American [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: There was an amer -- American presence there, too.</span> <span id="s1115">There were American Marines at the -- they were actually stationed right across the street from our school.</span> <span id="s1116">There were American Marine barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: And then December seventh, which of course, because of the International Dateline, December eighth in Shanghai, the Japanese took over the rest of the town, the -- both the French and the British --</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: -- at the International Settlement.</span> <span id="s1121">Even prior to that, the allies knew that they can’t stay there forever, so many of the people living in Shanghai had already left back to the States, or France, wherever.</span> <span id="s1122">Not France, because France was at war already.</span> <span id="s1123">And there were two British -- two gunboats left in the harbor, a British and an American.</span> <span id="s1124">And the Japanese started bombarding them.</span> <span id="s1125">And the story goes that one surrendered and one went down, ship and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1127">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: But these were -- these are stories, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: -- I don’t know these to be facts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: What I do know is that December eighth was a Monday and I walked to school like always.</span> <span id="s1133">We had by this time moved out of this building that we were sharing with our friends, to someplace else, further away from the waterfront.</span> <span id="s1134">We didn’t hear the firing, we didn’t hear the bombardment.</span> <span id="s1135">And we rode to work, which was in the Japanese area.</span> <span id="s1136">I went to school, and the kids, did you hear the bombardment, the Japanese are taking over.</span> <span id="s1137">We got called into the auditorium, the principal told us about Pearl Harbor and that the Japanese at this moment are taking over the rest of the city.</span> <span id="s1138">As he is speaking, we hear troops marching by the school, Japanese troops were marching by, occupying the Marine barracks across the street from us.</span> <span id="s1139">And I still recall seeing the ja -- the American flag go down and the Japanese flag go up over the Marine barracks.</span> <span id="s1140">And then they send us all home.</span> <span id="s1141">By the time I ca -- came home, a kid a year or two younger than I had gotten home a few minutes before me, he told my parents and his parents all kinds of stories, they couldn't make heads or tails out of him, he was so nervous.</span> <span id="s1142">I was the first one to tell them about Pearl Harbor and the Japanese taking over.</span> <span id="s1143">In this time they worried sick about my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: And he pedaled all the way through all this military takeover back home from where he was working.</span> <span id="s1146">And after this my parents decided it’s time to move into Hongkew, into the area where all the refugees are living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1148">But let’s go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s1149">In the -- when you’re living in the French Concession with these two couples and a single guy --</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: -- then all of those people decide they’re going to go to Hongkew.</span> <span id="s1152">Wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: They all decided to go to Hongkew and my mother still didn’t want to go to Hongkew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: So they -- they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: So you -- they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: -- moved to Hongkew and we moved in with another family into a small apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Was that in kena -- ke --</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Yes, it started with a K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Ki -- ki -- K-i-n-e-a-r, Kinear.</span> <span id="s1161">I don’t know how to pronounce it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Kinear Road.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Kinear Road.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: I think yes, Kinear Road.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Now, that was not in the French Concession.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: No, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: -- in the International Settlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: International Settlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: But further, I guess, to the west, away from the harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Ha -- yes, and further away from Hongkew, it wasn’t [indecipherable] Hongkew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Further away from Hongkew.</span> <span id="s1173">A good ways away from Hongkew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Now, during this period, are you walking around Shanghai by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: You are, and it’s -- it’s -- it -- are your parents worried about you, given there’s supposed to be a lot of thievery and opium dens and God knows what there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: They must have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: But you went anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: -- but I di -- I’m -- I’m not aware of it.</span> <span id="s1180">I mean, they had no choice.</span> <span id="s1181">I mean, I walked to school by myself, and sometimes with friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: But we always -- it was always daytime, I didn’t walk around at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: At night.</span> <span id="s1185">Did you see terrible things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1187">The Chinese were very poor and very dirty at that time.</span> <span id="s1188">They had a child, an infant might die, they didn’t bury it.</span> <span id="s1189">They wrapped it in newspaper and put it out on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s1190">So I see this on the sidewalk, I cross over on the other side of the street, not to be close to it.</span> <span id="s1191">I see that.</span> <span id="s1192">I see sometimes dogs na -- around these infant corpses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: And could you see it was a corpse?</span> <span id="s1194">A baby corpse?</span> <span id="s1195">Because it wasn’t completely --</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: You could see that it was something covered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Something, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: I hob -- I wasn’t curious enough to go close to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: I knew what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: You saw people who were crippled on the street, begging, pushing a tin plate in front of them.</span> <span id="s1203">You saw kids crying while the parents were poking them so they cry more, trying to beg.</span> <span id="s1204">You hear and heard and saw thievery going on.</span> <span id="s1205">There was the so-called hat-snatcher.</span> <span id="s1206">You were sitting in the streetcar -- course, they were not air conditioned, was opened and the man had his hat on and just as the streetcar took off, somebody snatched the hat off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: There was money in hats?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: There was money in everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: I guess everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: There was a law in the International Settlement, if somebody steals a loaf of bread and takes a bite out of it, he cannot be punished, cause it shows that he was hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1212">That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: And we just try to be careful, but the worst part was the diseases.</span> <span id="s1214">You couldn’t -- everything had to be boiled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Water had to be boiled, you could not eat any raw food.</span> <span id="s1217">Salads were basically out of the question.</span> <span id="s1218">Sometimes my mother took some salad and put -- poured boiling water over it, well, if you put boiling water over a salad, it doesn’t taste too good any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: The Chinese had little shops where they boiled water and sold boiling water.</span> <span id="s1221">And we would go there with a thermos, with tea leaves and a thermos, so get the boiling water, by the time we got home we had tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Tea, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: But they said, be sure you see the water boiling.</span> <span id="s1224">It has to be bubbling.</span> <span id="s1225">And that’s a -- these were big drums of water, so it took a long time for them to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: -- really boil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: The Chinese guy would like to sell it to you before he -- it was really boiling.</span> <span id="s1230">We were told to be careful about that.</span> <span id="s1231">You couldn’t walk barefoot.</span> <span id="s1232">When the rains came, Shanghai flooded.</span> <span id="s1233">Shanghai was basically at or below sea level, so you had no basements, no house had basements like we’re used to over here.</span> <span id="s1234">When it flooded, h-how did we get around?</span> <span id="s1235">Took a rickshaw, and we talked to the rickshaw pullee what you’re going to pay him to go to wherever you want to go, and then in the middle of the street he’d say no, I want more.</span> <span id="s1236">He would just stop there, so you had to pay more to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: But when it rained, it could be a foot of -- or more of water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Yes, it could -- i-it was fairly deep, I -- let’s say a foot or so at times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Did you have boots?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Yes, but they were not big enough, so you just had to watch what you’re doing, and -- this water was, of course, terribly filthy --</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: -- and you could get all kinds of diseases.</span> <span id="s1243">And we went through all sorts of illnesses.</span> <span id="s1244">Typhoid, cholera.</span> <span id="s1245">We got inoculated every six months against all these different illnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: And where would you get inoculated?</span> <span id="s1247">Would the -- would the Jewish Joint have a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Well -- well, my father gave us the inoculation, I guess --</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: -- I don’t know where he got the stuff from.</span> <span id="s1251">But everybody got inoculated, the health department inoculated people on the street, but we were told not to get that, because you don’t know how clean those needles are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Oh boy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: So you -- when you got inoculated, you got a certificate to show that you have been inoculated.</span> <span id="s1254">But with all that going on, people still got ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Did you get ill during this early period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Yes -- not the early period, I got ill --</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: -- later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: The early period we did fairly well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Did you like being in shang -- I’m not -- talk -- bef -- before December eighth, se-seb -- before Pearl Harbor, did you like being there?</span> <span id="s1262">Was it exciting, interesting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: It was exciting, it was interesting, it was an adventure.</span> <span id="s1264">Sometimes they had gangs that would gang up on you.</span> <span id="s1265">Of course [indecipherable] like anyplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: But this wasn’t because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: No, this was because I was white.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1269">Were these Chinese or Japanese gangs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Chi -- chi -- Chinese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Chinese gangs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Chinese.</span> <span id="s1273">And then the Russians, the Russian kids used to attack us, even in Hongkew later on.</span> <span id="s1274">There was a lot of Russian people living there, and one time my father had a Russian person come up with one of his kids to -- something was wrong with him and he took care of him.</span> <span id="s1275">And he was in part -- h-he was in some of these gangs.</span> <span id="s1276">So if he was in the gang they told them -- he told the gang to leave me alone.</span> <span id="s1277">I had my in with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: That’s -- that was always scary.</span> <span id="s1280">You know, we didn’t have that much money on us, so if they want it, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: So they beat you up to try and get whatever money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Whatever money you had.</span> <span id="s1283">You gave them some money then you ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: These were a lot of White Russians from Russia --</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: White Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: -- who came after the revol -- revolution, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1288">White Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Now, there are some Jews in that population that came, but the majority who had came over --</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Yeah, there was a large Jewish Russian population.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Very large.</span> <span id="s1293">And some of them went to school with us, in the Shanghai Jewish school.</span> <span id="s1294">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: We have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: -- we have to get --</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: -- we have to change the tape [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Hi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Hello.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Tell me something.</span> <span id="s1304">When -- when your brother Hans, or now Henry, was going to do work, was there a discussion or was he simply told by your father, you’re going to go out and -- to Allensbach factory and you’re gonna -- do -- do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Basically speaking, I believe he was just told you have to go out there.</span> <span id="s1308">I don’t think my father realized where he sent Henry to, and how bad it would be.</span> <span id="s1309">I think my father should have checked it out instead of just taking somebody’s word for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: And sending this little kid, 14 years old, out to nowhere.</span> <span id="s1312">And he didn’t do that, he didn’t check it out.</span> <span id="s1313">You know, today if you send your son, or daughter, your child someplace, you check it out, whether it’s a college, whether it’s a work situation.</span> <span id="s1314">That, he didn’t do.</span> <span id="s1315">They -- he was -- my father was so panicked.</span> <span id="s1316">He didn’t know how he would feed his family.</span> <span id="s1317">Here he comes from a upper middle class background as a physician.</span> <span id="s1318">He had his dreams of sending his sons to same university he went to.</span> <span id="s1319">Maybe they would go into his profession or something similar.</span> <span id="s1320">All these dreams got shattered, and now he cannot even take care of them on a day to day basis.</span> <span id="s1321">He was worried how to feed us the next day.</span> <span id="s1322">What will happen to us.</span> <span id="s1323">So when this opportunity came around, he grabbed it and it’ll at least take care of us to some degree.</span> <span id="s1324">Most of our quote unquote income consisted of selling what we had.</span> <span id="s1325">We brought a lot of stuff along on this -- in this lift, and that’s what we lived on.</span> <span id="s1326">It wasn’t until substantially later that we actually got charity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: So when your brother is working, it doesn’t contribute that much, because he’s not -- he’s not earning so much money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: It doesn’t contribute -- i-it couldn't have contributed that much.</span> <span id="s1329">You know, I wasn’t in on how much he’s actually paying in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: But, you know, primarily selling our products, my mother’s work --</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: -- was the main income.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: And I still went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Did Hans complain to you about the work at that -- at that time?</span> <span id="s1337">Do you remember private conversations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Yes, I -- I think more later on than at that time.</span> <span id="s1339">I think I was too young to be privy to si -- this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Henry -- I’ll call him Henry --</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: All right, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: -- because that’s the way I’m used to it now, is a very private person, doesn’t open up very much.</span> <span id="s1344">And four years at that age is a long --</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: -- is a big age difference.</span> <span id="s1347">But while I made friends and had fun, in and out of school, he didn’t.</span> <span id="s1348">He worked many hours, he came home dead tired, slept, back to work, and I wasn’t aware of what he was going through at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: And he worked six days a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: Six days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: So he had -- he did have one day off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: But -- mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1354">Did you -- even though he didn’t say anything, did you realize it was hard on him in some -- do you recall a thi -- or are you just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: No, I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: You were too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: -- I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1359">When di -- when did you join the Cub Scouts and he joined the Boy Scouts, was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Right -- almost within the first year that we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1362">So did he stop when he was working?</span> <span id="s1363">He wasn't part of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: He was -- he stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: He had to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: He stopped.</span> <span id="s1367">Yeah, he stopped and his education stopped, to a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: -- great extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: I went to school for many more years and lot of things that I was learning in school he never was taught, obviously he’s self taught since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: But I had a better education at that point.</span> <span id="s1374">And -- but I wasn’t -- to answer your question honestly, I wasn't aware [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: How was the relationship with your parents at that time?</span> <span id="s1376">You’re living in very close quarters, so you may not have even seen anything, cause at that age we often don’t see anything.</span> <span id="s1377">But it must have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: You mean the relationship between my parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Yes, was it diffit -- was it difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: It must have been very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: But again, a nine year old doesn’t see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: I know my parents loved to play cards, especially my father, loved to play German card game called Skat, and I would set up my cot and go to sleep while they were playing cards.</span> <span id="s1385">I mean, I could sleep thr -- I slept through all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: And my parents, you know, played with us, we played cards and car -- board games and things like that.</span> <span id="s1388">So we do -- did play together in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: I th -- think I saw more of what my mother went through, cooking and sewing, baking.</span> <span id="s1391">And again my father was devastated that his wife had to support the family.</span> <span id="s1392">And Henry was the man of the house, anything that came up to be discussed with the landlord, with this, with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: He did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: He was involved in all these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: That went on all the time that we were in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Were you afraid your father would commit suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Yes, there was a time when we were living out there on -- not Combare, what was the name of the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: Kinear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Kinear Road.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Kinear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: On Kinear Road, where I thought my father went up on the roof to kill himself.</span> <span id="s1405">My father used to sit in a chair and fall asleep in middle of the day.</span> <span id="s1406">Typical sign of depression.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: And that was one of the worst time for us, when we were on Kinear Road, very far away from all our friends.</span> <span id="s1409">And that is of course where we lived when the Japanese took over, and shortly after that we moved to Hongkew.</span> <span id="s1410">Whenever we moved, our apartment or room -- rooms, became smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s1411">My mother and I used make a chart and figure out how we would set up the furniture in the new place, and sometimes it was within an inch --</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: -- that we could squeeze something in, and what we couldn’t squeeze in, we sold.</span> <span id="s1414">The move from Kinear Road into Hongkew was done on a push wagon, I mean it wasn’t a truck, a motorized truck , was hand pushed wagon all through the whole city of Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Cause it’s a big trip from Kinear Road into Hongkew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: It’s a very large trip.</span> <span id="s1417">Th -- and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Were these human beings that are pushing the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: -- pulling the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: Pulling this cart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: This isn’t a rickshaw, it’s bigger than a rickshaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: No, it’s -- it’s bigger than a rickshaw, it’s two guys pushing it.</span> <span id="s1424">And I guess one of us must have walked along with them.</span> <span id="s1425">Yeah, Henry walked along with them.</span> <span id="s1426">Of course it’s always Henry who had to do the dirty work.</span> <span id="s1427">My mother and I went ahead.</span> <span id="s1428">We might have taken the rickshaw, I don’t remember these things for f -- facts.</span> <span id="s1429">So that when they came there, we were able to put everything --</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: -- into the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: And they would move -- these guys would move the stuff into the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Into the apartment and we put them where they are.</span> <span id="s1434">What I do remember is that I was also transferred to another school, from the Shanghai Jewish school, to the SJYA school, Shanghai Jewish Youth Association school, normally referred to as the Kadoorie School --</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: -- because Sir Alec Kadoorie gave the money for that school.</span> <span id="s1437">And you know, I was cutting up the last day in the other school.</span> <span id="s1438">This one teacher didn’t believe that I would be moving, so he put me on detention, and the next day when we were actually moving into the other apartment, he happened to walk by and said, “Oh, you really were moving.”</span> <span id="s1439">And yeah, we were friendly after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Did you like the Kadoorie School better than this -- the British system in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: Well, they were both the British system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: They were both the British system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: The Kadoorie School was on the British system as well.</span> <span id="s1444">It took me a little while to get used to the Kadoorie School, certain things were different, but not long and I was very familiar with everything there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Were there a lot of Jewish kids?</span> <span id="s1446">In the Kadoorie School is all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: All Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: [indecipherable] this a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: Well, this is Jewish refugee school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1451">As well as -- so was the other one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: The other one was not just refugees, it’s a Jewish school, th-the Russian Jewish kids there, the British Jewish kids, these are the people from India, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: -- that settled sh -- in Shanghai initially.</span> <span id="s1455">I mean, they were both Jewish schools, and in the Kadoorie School, the allied citizens had to wear ya -- armbands because the Japanese had already taken over.</span> <span id="s1456">So you had the British or American armbands and eventually these people were taken into POW camps, and only the refugee teachers remained.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: And the refugee kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: And the refugee kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: There were basically none, other than refugee kids in that school.</span> <span id="s1461">Mrs. Hartwich was the principal.</span> <span id="s1462">Mr. Gassenheimer was my teacher, and he wer -- these teachers were excellent.</span> <span id="s1463">They had no textbooks to give us, so -- there were no textbooks so they had to teach out of one book, we had to write everything down.</span> <span id="s1464">But we learned so much.</span> <span id="s1465">I mean, I was not even 14 yet, this was 1941, I was 11 - 12.</span> <span id="s1466">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: So this is before your Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: Before my Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1469">And we learned geometry, algebra, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: When many years later I decided to take some night courses in Montgomery College here, I took math and it was all a repeat, it was all what I had learned as a 12 year old kid.</span> <span id="s1472">Gassenheimer was ex -- a fantastic teacher.</span> <span id="s1473">They were trying to teach us so many things all at one time.</span> <span id="s1474">I mean, everything was taught in English, even though they were refugee teachers, they were all taught in English.</span> <span id="s1475">We -- being a Jewish school, we had Hebrew classes.</span> <span id="s1476">Being in China, we had some Chinese classes.</span> <span id="s1477">Being under Japanese control, Japanese classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Japanese classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: And Mrs. Hartwich thought that we should also learn French.</span> <span id="s1480">Now this wasn’t one year of this and one year of that, these were all --</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: All together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: -- taught simultaneously.</span> <span id="s1483">The end result is that we didn’t learn anything to hold onto, a word here and a word there is all that I remember.</span> <span id="s1484">English and German is what remained because we still spoke German at home.</span> <span id="s1485">When we kids played, it was a mixture, we spoke both English and German interchangeably, but we had a good time as kids.</span> <span id="s1486">There were no air raids --</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: -- going on, none at all.</span> <span id="s1489">We didn’t have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: That’s not until very late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: That’s -- that much later.</span> <span id="s1492">That doesn’t come about until Okinawa fell.</span> <span id="s1493">You hav -- year or so later I was Bar Mitzvah and you had to pay tuition at that school, and when my Bar Mitzvah came about, Mrs. Hartwich came up to my parents, we usually don’t give Bar Mitzvah presents, but we like Ernest -- I don’t know what they called me, er -- they didn’t call me Ernie at that time.</span> <span id="s1494">Anyhow, you don’t have to pay any more tuition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: So they had to pay before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: Be -- we -- everybody had to pay, and this was my Bar Mitzvah present from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: That’s lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: It was very lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: So you made a big impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: I obviously did very well.</span> <span id="s1501">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: And you liked it.</span> <span id="s1503">You liked it a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: I -- I liked it.</span> <span id="s1505">I was -- I mean, math was my forte.</span> <span id="s1506">I was considered the best math student in the school, not in the class, in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: In the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: We were -- eventually kids dropped out as they went to work, so the last year there we were 12 students in my class, six boys and six girls.</span> <span id="s1509">We sat at a long table, the girls on one side, the guys on the other, teacher at the head.</span> <span id="s1510">And I was the best math, it was a fellow by the name of Hans Eberstark who was the best all around student.</span> <span id="s1511">He -- he was -- is a genius.</span> <span id="s1512">He eventually -- his hobby was to go to the library and learn the dictionary by heart.</span> <span id="s1513">But he was also a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s1514">He went along with everybody with their jokes.</span> <span id="s1515">He eventually started working for the United Nations in Switzerland, and although I don’t know these for facts, as things I’ve heard, he helped write the Constitution for some of the new African nations, and as an interpreter for United Nations.</span> <span id="s1516">We also had theater that we put up in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Were you involved in that theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: I was involved in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: I was in -- we did the part of Shakespeare, “Midsummer Night’s Dream.”</span> <span id="s1521">I was Puck --</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: -- in “Midsummer Night’s Dream.”</span> <span id="s1524">We also presented something in Japanese, where the Japanese paper came by and took a picture of us --</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: -- sitting on the stage there.</span> <span id="s1527">Course we learned it by heart, I have no idea what I was actually saying.</span> <span id="s1528">The --</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: But you were saying it in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: No, on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Shakespeare --</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: The Shakespeare in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Yeah, but the Japanese play was in Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Ah-ha, right.</span> <span id="s1536">So they never told you what you were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Well, they did, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: It didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: -- it didn’t really matter that much.</span> <span id="s1540">But we had -- the class had a great time, the 12 of us putting up these plays.</span> <span id="s1541">We were 13 - 14 years old.</span> <span id="s1542">No, not quite 14.</span> <span id="s1543">But we really had a wonderful time there.</span> <span id="s1544">And eventually my parents decided that I sh -- finished that school as much -- far as I could go, that I should go to work.</span> <span id="s1545">In the meantime my brother had -- was able to convince my parents at that place where he was working was not right, and through some acquaintances he found another place, working for a Korean company that made lathe, and drilling machines and so on, where he was able to get a job for me.</span> <span id="s1546">So I became an apprentice in this machine factory under my brother, in a way.</span> <span id="s1547">The factory had a small department where the -- we made all the little parts, little screws, pins, what have you.</span> <span id="s1548">And we were about half a dozen refugees working in there, including a Mr. Lawrence who was a foreman.</span> <span id="s1549">And I worked there, and between my brother and I, we finally made a little bit more money than we were spending each day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: So how old are you then?</span> <span id="s1551">You --</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: F -- so this -- this is what, s-six or eight months after your Bar Mitzvah?</span> <span id="s1554">No, yo -- it’s longer, it’s a year afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: A year afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: This is 1943, before the announcement for the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: [indecipherable] the announcement of the ghetto was in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: The announcement of the ghetto came while I was still in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: And I remember at that point, I mean we read the announcement, we read the borders that there were, and we thought -- I thought we were okay.</span> <span id="s1564">We were on the Seward Road, that’s where the line was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: But the line went down the middle of the street, and we were on the wrong side --</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: -- of the street, and we had to move.</span> <span id="s1569">Well, one of the girls that I was talking to about that, she thought they would have to move and she was on the correct side of the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: On the correct side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: So we had to move, and now to find a place to live was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1572">See, in the ghetto, nobody had to move out.</span> <span id="s1573">The Chinese people didn’t have to move out.</span> <span id="s1574">You had to be in there within 90 days.</span> <span id="s1575">Couldn’t -- it was very hard to find anything until the Jewish organization bought a part of a school and converted that school into small rooms and a few large halls.</span> <span id="s1576">And you had to pay -- I forgot what they call it, key money or something like that, to be able to have one of these rooms.</span> <span id="s1577">And my father had to sell his microscope so that he could have the money for us to move in there.</span> <span id="s1578">So four of us moved into a room in the school.</span> <span id="s1579">And it was very short distance to the school for me to walk there.</span> <span id="s1580">The school was actually outside the district.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: However, the Japanese basically like kids and let us go to school.</span> <span id="s1583">We have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Did you have to get a pass to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: And did you have to get it from this guy, Ghoya?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Was that terrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Well, it wasn’t so terrible as a kid because I -- I don’t think we ne -- actually needed it then, but when I went to work, where I worked was outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: And we had to get it from Ghoya, and that was terrible because it had to be renewed every month, and sometimes you stood in line for a month to get the renewal.</span> <span id="s1592">So you stood outside there in every kind of weather, waiting for him to show up, then he showed up and gave a few renewals, gave a lot of rejections.</span> <span id="s1593">Yeah, in summer it was hot with the sun beating down on you, then you went inside and scare -- you were scared, trying to get in front of this man who had such power over you.</span> <span id="s1594">Initially some of the people decided not to follow -- not to move into the district, so they were thrown into jail for a week.</span> <span id="s1595">Didn’t think a week’s imprisonment was so bad, but these cells were infected.</span> <span id="s1596">They came out and died like flies once they came out.</span> <span id="s1597">And that went on for the rest of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Was Ghoya the main person that you had to get -- wasn’t there somebody else called Okura?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Okura was actually Ghoya’s superior.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: But Okura wasn’t personally involved that much with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: But Ghoya was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Ghoya was, he had a refugee man being his secretary, doing all the paperwork, but I don’t recall his name.</span> <span id="s1604">But when Ghoya eventually got -- was out of it, this man just did every [indecipherable] just took care of everyone.</span> <span id="s1605">He was very fine person.</span> <span id="s1606">But Ghoya was terrible, it’s a -- Ghoya considered himself king of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: It -- this was his own attribution for himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1609">He thought he was doing us all a favor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Our sports activities were mainly playing soccer and he used to come out to the soccer field, where we had to parade past him, just like you parade past a king, and view him.</span> <span id="s1612">And everything was fine and then the next morning for whatever reason, something he didn’t like, he threw the people in charge of the game into jail for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: They never knew how he would a -- react on anything.</span> <span id="s1615">He used to hit people for no reason whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1616">And again, the kids he mainly left alone.</span> <span id="s1617">I’m talking about the adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1619">Did you ever see that?</span> <span id="s1620">Did you ever see him hitting somebody [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: No, but my father got -- he said he got hit on the hand, just like this, and he said, “I felt that for hours.”</span> <span id="s1622">It was just [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1623">And you know, the thing -- you were in such small quarters, everybody was on top of each other, slightest thing and people got into fights and arguments.</span> <span id="s1624">The refugee communit -- community started their own -- what did they call it?</span> <span id="s1625">Like a court system, so it didn’t have to go to the Japanese authorities.</span> <span id="s1626">So you try to settle things outside of them.</span> <span id="s1627">In the meantime, things got a little better for us because my father got a job with the -- with the hip -- not the hospital, but the -- well, with the hospital, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Was it the free clinic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: The free clinic --</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: -- actually he got the job with the free clinic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: And with him getting a job in the free clinic, my brother and I working, we finally were able to make ends meet.</span> <span id="s1634">In the meantime we had gotten onto charity.</span> <span id="s1635">And before you could accept charity, they community send a committee up to your house, you know, places where you live, to make sure you had nothing left to sell, which was very demoralizing.</span> <span id="s1636">But we got one hot meal a day, which was sort of a stew.</span> <span id="s1637">My parents used to dig out the small pieces of meat there was, and gave it to Henry and I. My father lost over 50 pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: Was -- basically both of them were skin and bones, trying to keep us going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: And did you guys lose weight?</span> <span id="s1641">Did you lose a lot weight [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: No, us kids, we didn’t, but you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Were you hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: You don’t remember being hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: I -- I -- I was not hungry, my -- but my parents saw to it that I was not hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: Henry was not hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: And when the three of you were working, did your mother stop doing all this baking that she was doing, and sewing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Yeah, she actually stopped that when we moved into the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: She did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: -- into Hongkew, because she had no facilities there to do all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: So, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: But she still had her sewing machine?</span> <span id="s1656">Or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: She still had her sewing machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: Oh -- to the very end.</span> <span id="s1660">When we finally -- the war is over and we made contact with her brother in Baltimore, things happened very rapidly and she said, should I bring my sewing machine or not, and we -- it never got to [indecipherable] anyhow, we sold it in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: And then she was sorry she didn’t bring it with her.</span> <span id="s1663">But -- was going to say something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: We were talking about [indecipherable] meals and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: Oh, no I was going to ta -- at this time is when I had my Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Which was basically a low point in our life, as financial is concerned.</span> <span id="s1668">And my parents tried to make the Bar Mitzvah pretty nice.</span> <span id="s1669">The cantor that we had used to be an opera singer in Europe.</span> <span id="s1670">I can still see him, he looked like Pavarotti standing there in front of me, singing to me.</span> <span id="s1671">It was done very beautifully.</span> <span id="s1672">Our neighbors had a little haberdashery store and he came up to my mother a month or so ahead of time to loan him one of my shirts, he wants to make one for somebody, well he made a nice shirt for me.</span> <span id="s1673">But what my mother had not realized, she gave him one that I’d -- I’d slightly outgrown.</span> <span id="s1674">So the sleeves came up to here, and he had to attach something.</span> <span id="s1675">That was my big present, was my shirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Your new shirt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: And my Bar Mitzvah party consisted of coffee and cake.</span> <span id="s1678">The rabbi came, my teacher came.</span> <span id="s1679">And Gassenheimer was my teacher, the Hebrew teacher in our school --</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: Was Gassenheimer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: No, was not Gassenheimer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1683">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: Was a Mr. we -- Webber, I believe.</span> <span id="s1685">He was teaching everybody but he was going into a lot of details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: Gassenheimer was not so Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1688">It was easier with him, and I took lessons from him and that went very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: I think we have to change the tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">End of Tape Four Beginning of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: How long did it take you to learn your Haftorah and learn the ceremony for your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: Very short period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Like what, a month?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: Two months maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: Two th -- two, three months, something like that.</span> <span id="s1698">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: So you were quick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: Well, it wasn’t that so much, my birthday is December second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: So when I approached Mr. Gassenheimer back in August sometime, he said, “Oh, December, we got plenty of time.”</span> <span id="s1703">And first day back at school in sep -- early September, he calls me, he says, “I just looked it up, your Bar Mitzvah by the Jewish calendar is actually November 14th.</span> <span id="s1704">We’re talking a lot sooner, we really have to get onto it.”</span> <span id="s1705">So we got onto it fairly rapidly.</span> <span id="s1706">I don’t have a voice to sing, so I was just reading everything, and did fine.</span> <span id="s1707">Everything went off pretty well, I did okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: Ha -- you had learned Hebrew before, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: -- you knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: I mean, I had ler -- started to learn Hebrew back in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Right, in Germany, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: I could read Hebrew, couldn’t speak it as a language --</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: -- but, you know, I could read the Hebrew prayer books, and knew some of the translations, but basically just reading it was no problem for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: Did you have to give some sort of a speech, which is what they do in this country, I don’t know whether they do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: No, I didn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: -- I didn’t do any speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: [indecipherable] speeches.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: So where did it occur?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: In the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: In the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: The school is where we also had services.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: In the main school auditorium, that’s where we had services, we had youth services there to, where the kids from school did all the parts and I one time was the quote unquote rabbi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: Oh yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: -- had a little talk on the subject, the Torah subject of the day.</span> <span id="s1730">So that’s where it was held.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: You know, it was very nice, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: And where was the coffee and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: At -- at our home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: At the ho -- at the si -- in this little room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: That’s -- in that little apartment.</span> <span id="s1737">This was before we moved into the SACRA --</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: -- this was when we were on East Seward Road.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: -- so we actually had two rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Uh-huh, so it was bigger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Bigger, and you know, we didn’t have that many people, maybe half a dozen people that came over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: And did you drink coffee, or was there something else for kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Oh it -- I did drink coffee, but it probably was milk, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: Don’t remember that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: Besides the communal lunches you were getting for nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: And you were going to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: The communal lunches really came about later, when we were in the SACRA building.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: Right, but when you were in East Seward, you were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: We were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: So what -- all of this time, what -- what are you eating?</span> <span id="s1755">Are you eating three meals a day, or would you not even call it three meals a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Yes, we were eating three meals a day --</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: -- and usually the noon meal was the main meal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: I mean, we didn’t have cereal, per se, that I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: So what was breakfast like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: It was a light breakfast, some bread and butter and jelly, what have you.</span> <span id="s1763">And I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: And did your mother have to -- she had to buy food every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: She went to buy food daily --</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: -- because of there was no refrigeration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: And she managed very well to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: And at night it was also very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: Very small, like a little supper.</span> <span id="s1772">But I can’t honestly tell you what we were eating.</span> <span id="s1773">I’m -- the only thing I remember is that my mother made -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: She baked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: -- she did -- changed everything into German cooking.</span> <span id="s1776">You know, people hear that I was living in Shanghai, they think of me eating Chinese food.</span> <span id="s1777">No, we didn’t do that, we ate German food.</span> <span id="s1778">Many of the things we never heard of before.</span> <span id="s1779">Some of it came through the Russians, there’s kasha.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: I remember that, and I hated it.</span> <span id="s1782">But that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: You hated it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: I hated it, I won’t touch it now.</span> <span id="s1785">But kasha was our cereal, and that was served to us.</span> <span id="s1786">And other things, for example, Passover came about, the rabbi announced this particular cereal type of food is good for Passover, for those people who were Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: Made up our own rules.</span> <span id="s1789">Kasha, there was -- we drank a lot of tea, ate a dra -- ate a lot of rice, and for a long time after I came to the United States, I hardly touched tea or rice.</span> <span id="s1790">Since then I’ve been accustomed to it more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: Did you ever eat Chinese food in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Yes, when -- when we had got our visa to come to the States, we went out to a quote unquote Chinese restaurant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1794">That was the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: A nice Chinese place.</span> <span id="s1796">Not the first time, it -- but I remember that time because we -- we ri --</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: Was it good?</span> <span id="s1798">Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: Yeah, we liked it.</span> <span id="s1800">One time earlier, one of these doctors that my father had been referred to, took us to a really fancy Chinese restaurant with several courses came in -- coming in.</span> <span id="s1801">But I was very little at that time, I didn’t appreciate all of it, but it rel -- it can be nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: But most of the time it was make do with what was available.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1805">It wasn’t an easy time, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: No, it was not.</span> <span id="s1807">I -- I mean, again, as a child you don’t know these things, but for my parents it must have been terrible, not knowing how they’re going to feed us the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: How are they going to pay for the food?</span> <span id="s1810">And tha -- you know, once we moved into the SACRA, it’s there that we applied and eventually got charity.</span> <span id="s1811">And I remember the people coming in, looking over to see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: To make sure that you had nothing to sell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: To make sure there was nothing to sell.</span> <span id="s1814">And then we got this one hot meal a day, which was big pot of stew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: And did they bring that to your apartment, or did you have to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: Well, they brought it in a cart, and then they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: And they’d ladled it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: Ladled it out.</span> <span id="s1819">And we had a pot they ladled it in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: -- and then my parents tried to give us as much meat as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: And the other two meals they had to be responsible for getting them to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1824">And one was some sort of kasha or whatever that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: So what did you drink in the course of the day, because it had to be extremely hot at certain times of the year, right?</span> <span id="s1826">I mean, you would need to drink a lot, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: We need to drink a lot, we drank hot water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: You drank hot water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: Because when we went to work, my brother and I went to work, and our mother took -- made some sandwich for us, but we couldn’t take anything to drink with us, and whatever we drank had to be boiled.</span> <span id="s1830">So we had to see that it is boiled, and then we drank hot water.</span> <span id="s1831">Hot water and sort of dry bread was our lunch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: But what happens with the communal meal, if the communal meal is the middle of the day, and the two of you were working, what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: My parents kept it for the evening, and then reheat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: So you -- you would have it in the evening.</span> <span id="s1835">And did your father work all day long once you got into --</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: No, it was a while before he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Awhile before --</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: -- got that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: So you were working with your brother before your father got to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: Oh yes, and my father was still practice once in awhile, and then everybody had to leave that one room that we lived in when he had a patient in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: Other times when it wasn’t such a personal examination, I assisted him in some things.</span> <span id="s1843">We had like a little balc -- not a balcony, like a walk around the room outside where we fired up the, what we called the Chinese oven, which was a hibach -- hibachi.</span> <span id="s1844">Over here when we do the hibachi it’s a lot of fun, over there, that was the way to go.</span> <span id="s1845">Had to buy charcoal to do it, and when charcoal became too expensive, we bought powdered coal, which we mixed with water, and made into little coal balls to heat up.</span> <span id="s1846">Our hands were black as --</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: Black.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: -- oh, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1849">And there was one woman in -- w-we were quite a few people in this building, couldn’t tell you the quantity.</span> <span id="s1850">The one woman worked in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s1851">She used to come home and bring the coffee grounds from the restaurant.</span> <span id="s1852">Anybody has a fire going, you can -- they can share with me a cup of coffee.</span> <span id="s1853">So my mother had -- loved coffee, she missed coffee more than anything else.</span> <span id="s1854">So she had the fire going and drank the coffee when it was going through the grounds a second time.</span> <span id="s1855">And it’s -- and there also were -- we got bombed out.</span> <span id="s1856">In 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: But that’s later --</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: That’s later, okay --</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: -- let -- let -- let me just ask you a couple of things.</span> <span id="s1860">Now, did I just forget my question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: We’re talking about food, and -- we’re talking about the communal kitchen stuff that came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: Ah, this is what I wanted to know.</span> <span id="s1863">Does your -- does your father’s mood, as you see it now, get better when he starts to work and the three of you are working?</span> <span id="s1864">Do you see a difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: When my father got the job in the clinic, his mood began to change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: His mood began to change, and made all the difference in the world then.</span> <span id="s1868">And I remember, you know, you couldn’t deal in American currency on -- on open market, but Chinese currency had no value.</span> <span id="s1869">So when we finally were able to come to a point where we could buy some American dollars, it was a big point because that was a turning point.</span> <span id="s1870">This month we actually made more than we spent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: I see, because it was worth more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: It was [indecipherable] we were able to buy some dollars on the black market, and that’s what we put aside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: Now, before you meet -- they don’t actually call it a ghetto, they say the designated area for stateless refugees, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: So it’s actually for all of you who would come after ’37, am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: So it’s mainly Austrian and German refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: Oh -- as well -- and y --</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: Some Polish also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: I don’t know ho -- the Polish -- w-we -- they were in there, but it’s primarily the German and Austrian refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1884">Before you go in there, there’s a lot going on in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: A lot of murdering of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: We didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Di -- you didn’t know, you hear nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: We know that they are being put into concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: My grandmother, my mother’s mother was still in Breslau.</span> <span id="s1892">She was up in age when we were getting ready to leave, and my aunt, who was quite wealthy, had paid in an old age home for the rest of her life, so she didn’t have to worry about money.</span> <span id="s1893">My mother asked her to come with us to Shanghai, she said, “Look, you guys going to have a hard time in Shanghai, why should I be along?</span> <span id="s1894">Who would do anything to a -- an old woman like me.</span> <span id="s1895">I’m taken care of over here.”</span> <span id="s1896">So we corresponded with my grandmother all the time we were there, and one time a letter comes back, moved, address unknown.</span> <span id="s1897">And we knew that meant concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1898">And I recall seeing my mother in tears when she got that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: When we got that notification.</span> <span id="s1901">Now, what concentration camp meant, that it was death camps, we were unaware of.</span> <span id="s1902">As it turned out, my grandmother was taken to Theresienstadt, and from what we understand, she died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Do you think that your parents knew more than you and Hans knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: You don’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: I don’t think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: I don’t think anybody knew this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1910">So people didn’t have radios, they didn’t have a way of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: Well we had radios.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: You did.</span> <span id="s1913">But you couldn’t get -- you -- you couldn’t go far enough to get --</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: But the radios didn’t announce it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: The Russian radio had a German program on it.</span> <span id="s1917">See, Russia was not at war with Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: So the Russians were free, and the Russians reported very accurately what went on on the European frontier.</span> <span id="s1920">Now, we heard, you know, about the landing in Normandy and all that, almost at the same time as you would have heard over here.</span> <span id="s1921">But we didn’t hear anything about the Japanese war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: And one time we -- it came through about Okinawa and we looked on a map and we saw where Okinawa was, and we said to ourselves, God, that isn’t so far away from us any more.</span> <span id="s1924">And then shortly after that, that bombing off Shanghai began.</span> <span id="s1925">So once a island like Okinawa, comparatively close to the Chinese mainland, was captured, planes flew from there, and did their missions from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: But most of the bombing of Shanghai occurred in the outskirts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1929">Do you think any -- do you think that the majority of refugees, the stateless refugees in Hongkew knew nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: Of the death camps?</span> <span id="s1931">I don’t believe they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: Until after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: Until after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1935">W-When you saw the notice, or all of you saw the notice to go into the designated area, which was February ’43, and you have to be in there by May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: Am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: February 18th -- May 18th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: February 18 -- yes.</span> <span id="s1940">Were you worried about having to go in there, or did you think that the Japanese wouldn’t do anyth -- I mean what -- what -- what was the sensation about the Japanese?</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: Well, we were worried.</span> <span id="s1942">I mean, the Japanese were in control there, and Germans were their buddy buddies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: We had no idea what was going on in Germany, but we realized this is an imprisonment of sorts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: And only of sorts, because usually when you are a prisoner, they feed you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: Here we had to feed ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: Selves, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: And, you know, primarily, the first thing is trying to find the place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: I mean, just imagine yourself at -- you decide to move and you have 90 days to do it.</span> <span id="s1953">So it -- it’s not easy to find a place under the best of circumstances, and here, all of a sudden, all these people trying to move in.</span> <span id="s1954">Many people switched homes with the Chinese.</span> <span id="s1955">They took their fancy house, something like as nice as this one and traded it for a hovel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: So there were some people who did very well in Shanghai, as far as you can tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: You mean among the refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: Very well is exaggerating it a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: They did well.</span> <span id="s1962">They made more money than they spent.</span> <span id="s1963">That’s considered doing well.</span> <span id="s1964">There were some -- there was one family from Liegnitz, one -- a couple actually, they didn’t have any children.</span> <span id="s1965">They came with their parents.</span> <span id="s1966">And his father was not Jewish, so he didn’t have to move into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1967">The younger couple got a little place in the ghetto, but they were all watchmakers.</span> <span id="s1968">His father employed him, and he was able to work with his father and live outside the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: They did work quite well.</span> <span id="s1971">This Mr. Schwartz who lived next door to us, he the one that made the shirt for me, he had a store across the street, and he seemed to do all right.</span> <span id="s1972">And a lot of the people who were handymen, plumbers, electricians, what have you, they did fairly well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: But they’re working with the Jewish refugees, right, who don’t seem to have a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1974">So how are these other people, even though they have the skills, how were they making money?</span> <span id="s1975">Do you understand it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: Well, we all had a little bit of money s -- coming from somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1978">Somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: I mean, you had to have a plumber, you needed a plumber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: I am not sure how these things --</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: -- all came together again.</span> <span id="s1984">You couldn’t see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: And who did you rent from?</span> <span id="s1986">When you rented this little room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: Well the room in the SACRA was of course, the SACRA organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: It stood for something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: Shanghai soma -- something or another.</span> <span id="s1992">Prior to that, a Chinese ow-owned the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: And the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: In Seward, when you were in east --</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: On East Seward Road.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: And he had a sh-shop downstairs and rented out the upstairs.</span> <span id="s1999">And once the war was over, and we moved back a block away on East Seward Road, the same thing occurred.</span> <span id="s2000">Somebody had a s-store downstairs and rented out the upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: All right, let me ask you about hygiene.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: You probably didn’t have a toilet inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: Yeah, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: We did have --</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: Throughout?</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: Throughout, that’s one thing we insisted on, WC in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: -- meaning water closet, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: So that’s unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: Well, it wasn’t too unusual, but it wasn’t unusual not to have it.</span> <span id="s2013">But we had it, we did not have to have an outhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: So you didn’t have to have one of these what they called the honey buckets?</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: Nope, we didn’t have to have a honey bucket.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: Thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Wa-Was that the main given by the refugees, a honey bucket?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: I would imagine so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: You imagine so.</span> <span id="s2021">Because that, I’m sure, was very uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: Well, but, you know, when we walked to work, or walked to school --</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: -- we would see these Chinese people cleaning out their honey buckets --</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: Buckets.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: -- in the middle of the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: And there would be people who would come, and you would dump the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: They du -- come in one of these carts, they would dump it in, and then they would take it out in the field and use it as fertilizer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q: As fertilizer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A: That’s another reason why you had such --</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: So did Shanghai stink?</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: Was it a lot of s -- awful smells?</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: Awful smells, especially -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2035">Not in the French Concession, yeah, the fancy residential area, but in the Hongkew area, it stank.</span> <span id="s2036">I mean literally, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s2037">And the people on the boats, they threw their waste into the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: Now that’s the same water that then came out of your faucet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: So that’s why you had to boil it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: Yeah, boil it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: And even boiling, I would imagine, didn’t clean everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: Well, they well -- that did go through some cleansing pro --</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A: -- process before it got there, but the bacteria of course, all came straight through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: And sometimes people thought that certain filters would help it or -- they tried it and they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: It didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: It didn’t.</span> <span id="s2050">And we got all kinds of illnesses.</span> <span id="s2051">Typhoid, typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: Did your parents ever get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s2054">My parents got sick, I got very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: You got very sick at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: I had [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: And so did your brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: -- war was actually over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: -- right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: My brother got sick --</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Something --</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: -- he had got sick --</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: Bacterial dysentery or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A: Bacterial dysentery in there at one point.</span> <span id="s2065">But wa -- I -- I had either typhus or typhoid, I never can keep it straight, whatever comes from lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: And your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: My father had some bacterial disease, my mother had something else.</span> <span id="s2068">Everybody got sick all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: And so they got sick, and then they got over it and then they got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: Sick, and over it.</span> <span id="s2071">Some things were not so serious as others.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: Let me ask you this, when you look back -- I’m sure at this age you wouldn’t have seen it, but when you look back and think about when you move into the designated area, wh-where people are now calling the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: Maybe you ca -- did you call it the ghetto then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: But -- yeah, I -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: So your mother stops doing cer -- the things that she was doing because all the boys in the family, the men are working, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: Well, the -- yeah, bo -- my father didn’t start working until --</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: -- some time after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: But at a certain point he does.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: And she stops.</span> <span id="s2085">Now do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">A: She di -- she did -- she continued doing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: Oh, she did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: -- something.</span> <span id="s2089">I mean, we didn -- we didn’t have the lunchroom any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: That stopped when we moved away from rue Ratard.</span> <span id="s2092">I think she still did some of the sewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Okay, then my question is not -- I’ll tell you what I was going to ask you.</span> <span id="s2094">I thought that possibly she pulled back from all these things so that your father could feel even s -- even stronger, but maybe --</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">A: No, you know, that was not the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A: I’m not sure at this point how the money that we needed to have came about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: Mostly it came about from selling things.</span> <span id="s2100">My father’s microscope, my mother’s fur coat, and this, that, the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: [indecipherable] more and more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: Did you hate going to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: You didn’t resent it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: No.</span> <span id="s2107">I looked forward to it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: You get out of school, you get to work, I can do someth -- accomplish something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: But you loved school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: I loved school, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: And you loved the work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: -- I basically loved work, but I was an apprentice, I didn’t like it when they had me cleaning up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: I wanted to get onto the machinery, learn how to use the machinery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: The Korean who owned the company, he didn’t want to see me on the machinery, he wanted me to clean here, clean there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: Clean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: This department where we made all the small parts was sort of a showplace for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: And he often brought his customers in to see --</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: -- what we were doing.</span> <span id="s2124">And I loved making money.</span> <span id="s2125">There -- after awhile -- I mean, first we got paid a salary, but then we got on piecework, where for every screw you got so and so many cents, or whatever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: And I loved that, I loved being able to contribute, and making the money.</span> <span id="s2128">An --</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: W-Would yo --</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: A -- but you know, I was still 14 - 15 years of age, of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: Your brother by then is 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: 19 -- 18 - 19 years old --</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: 19 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">A: -- and trying to protect me from everything, I mean, when they told some stories that he thought I was too young to hear, I -- you know, go fetch a glass of water kind of thing, which I resented, I th-thought I was big enough to hear -- hear all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">A: But we also had shelters, bomb shelters in the back of the -- of the factory.</span> <span id="s2137">However, when the bombing started we went on the roof of this factory and watched the American bombs -- bombers bomb the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s2138">I remember the first time we saw the B29’s flying over our head.</span> <span id="s2139">They were flying so high that the Japanese anti-aircraft couldn’t reach them.</span> <span id="s2140">So we were there just looking up at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: Just looking up.</span> <span id="s2142">As I understand it, the Japanese had sort of munition du -- places in Hongkew --</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: -- or around, nearby.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: Where they had it all, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2146">But the school that we -- the SACRA built into this building, the other half was a radio station.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: A Japanese radio station that gave some ja -- radio signals to the military.</span> <span id="s2149">And there was a -- a gasoline place, storage place not far away.</span> <span id="s2150">And there were other things, there was an admiral of some sort not living too far.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: So when on July 17th, 1945, a blanket of bombs was placed over that whole area.</span> <span id="s2153">They were obviously not very large bombs, not like these big bombs that they used to destroy a lot of things, but there were about three or four bombs that fell into our building.</span> <span id="s2154">And quite a few people got killed right then and there.</span> <span id="s2155">I was home, I didn’t go to work because I had a cold, flu or whatever, nothing serious, but I was in bed.</span> <span id="s2156">As I said before, we didn’t have any basement, there was no place to go anyhow when the bombs fell and they were usually [indecipherable] on the outside.</span> <span id="s2157">All of a sudden I heard this big noise and I see the ceiling falling down on me like that.</span> <span id="s2158">And I went like this.</span> <span id="s2159">There was a bookcase over my book, and one foot fell above my head, and one below my feet, and the whole ceiling and everything fell on top of that, so I hardly had a scratch.</span> <span id="s2160">But I came very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Let m -- there were bookcases on it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: It was bookcase, you know, a bookshelf with two legs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: Or a leg on each side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: On either side of the bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: On either side of the bookshelf, that was over the bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2168">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: And one part of that shelf fell above my head --</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: -- one below my feet.</span> <span id="s2172">And it protected me from the ceiling and everything else that came down.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: My parents were just outside the door where I guess there was a stronger part of the building --</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: And they were okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: -- and they were not hurt, they were okay.</span> <span id="s2177">But my mother was scared for me, couldn’t open the door because of the air pressure.</span> <span id="s2178">And then when they finally opened the door and called for me, and they said I didn’t answer right away, because all they saw was the ceiling stuff all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: And my brother was at work, and -- I guess we have to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: We’ll s -- we’ll stop and then continue the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: Ernie, you were talking about the bombing and your parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: My parents were outside --</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">Q: Outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A: -- and the building there, it was a brick building and a fairly sturdy building, so where they stood wer -- did not come down, the ceiling did not come down.</span> <span id="s2188">And my mother at first thought that there’s somebody lying in front of our door that she couldn’t open it, because the air pressure was so strong from the bombs falling.</span> <span id="s2189">But finally she was able to open it, and after a few seconds, actually, I guess, I was able to yell I’m here, and push stuff away from me and jumped out into their arms.</span> <span id="s2190">No sooner was that done than a call came from my father to help here and help there because there were -- a lot of people were wounded, and quite few had died.</span> <span id="s2191">But my brother was at work, and somebody was telling him at the wor -- and he decided to come home when he realized where the bombing had occurred.</span> <span id="s2192">So he started running home, it was a good 45 minute walk.</span> <span id="s2193">And on the way he met people, he said -- he asked, what about the SACRA building, and people just, oh, everybody got killed in the SACRA building.</span> <span id="s2194">It was not til he was about a block or two away that he met somebody who knew us, and he said, don’t worry, your -- your family is fine.</span> <span id="s2195">Now, I still had a temperature from the flu or whatever I had, so I was lying outside on a rug, trying to stay calm.</span> <span id="s2196">And my mother was with me when he came.</span> <span id="s2197">We couldn't find my father, he was being called from one end to the other.</span> <span id="s2198">And then they said, well we all have to move into this school.</span> <span id="s2199">And my mother said, I don’t want to move into the school with all these people.</span> <span id="s2200">So we cleaned up our room a little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: And stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">A: -- and stayed there for the first night.</span> <span id="s2203">You could see the stars coming through the ceiling.</span> <span id="s2204">And during the night a fire broke up somewhere in this complex, was actually two buildings.</span> <span id="s2205">Well, the next morning we all decided we better move into the school.</span> <span id="s2206">So we grabbed -- each one grabbed a mattress and walked those three blocks to the school.</span> <span id="s2207">The classrooms were made empty, and you put one mattress next to the other, man, woman, child.</span> <span id="s2208">And that’s where we stayed.</span> <span id="s2209">But neither Henry nor I decided to go back to work.</span> <span id="s2210">We refused to go back to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Q: You refused?</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: We were too scared.</span> <span id="s2213">And this was July 17th.</span> <span id="s2214">Shortly afterwards the war was over.</span> <span id="s2215">The way we found out the war was over, on August 10th is my mother’s birthday.</span> <span id="s2216">We woke up in the morning, we heard bombs falling.</span> <span id="s2217">My father said, here’s some -- they’re saluting you to your birthday.</span> <span id="s2218">And then at night, wi -- what was always black out, all of a sudden the lights went on.</span> <span id="s2219">There’s Mrs. Hartwich, the principal in her nightgown.</span> <span id="s2220">I just heard over the shortwave that the Japanese have asked for surrender.</span> <span id="s2221">The war is over.</span> <span id="s2222">And everybody got out, went into the auditorium, somebody jumped at the piano, and started playing music.</span> <span id="s2223">And my father led the conga line.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: Dancing through there.</span> <span id="s2226">Next morning people started tearing down the signs of the ghetto [indecipherable] district, and the Japanese arrested them.</span> <span id="s2227">Oh, everybody said the whole thing was just a rumor, nothing true.</span> <span id="s2228">But two or three days later, I think it was on the 14th, a plane, American plane flew real low, dropping leaflets that the war is over, but the Japanese will have control, police control over the city until the Americans can come in.</span> <span id="s2229">And then the emperor held his speech telling Japan and the whole world that the war is over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: Did you hear that on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: Obviously I couldn’t understand what he is saying, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Yeah, I was going to say --</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: But we heard this, and then somebody was translating it.</span> <span id="s2236">And then, just a few days after that, the first Americans came in, they came into the school.</span> <span id="s2237">It was nice to see them, and after that, all right, we now have to go back to work someplace, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s2239">Did you folks hear about the -- the two atom bombs that had been dropped?</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: Did you hear about that later, or in this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: In this same period.</span> <span id="s2243">I mean, it came over the newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: It did, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: Not what we fully understood what an atom bomb was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: But we heard about the destruction of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: And na -- to begin with, we were worried if -- what would happen if they start dropping a bomb on Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: But this happened so rapidly from one day to the next.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: But it was nice.</span> <span id="s2254">It was a good -- good

room with about a dozen other people.</span> <span id="s2282">I had had my shots for typhus, typhoid, cholera, all along, so I didn’t get this illness as bad as it could be.</span> <span

packages were sent to us of clothing and food, and some of the food we didn’t quite know what to do with, what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A:

that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: Did that hor -- did that horrify you, or did you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: Well, the horror, it got overshadowed by what we heard from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: I mean, the paper started running an article about Treblinka, one of the destructive camps.</span> <span id="s2420">Then we saw newsreels and -- when we went to movies, of what occurred.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2422">And so you saw newsreels of the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A: Of the camps.</span> <span id="s2424">And then the realization, these aren’t strangers, these are our relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span

id="s2430">A: -- these are all in there.</span> <span id="s2431">That realization was very, very hard to accept.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: So you’re living with the happiness of being --</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: Free, on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: -- free on the one hand, and not on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: -- on the other hand, I mean, it took a long time to absorb this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: I mean, to this day, none of us can fully comprehend that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: Sometimes read some of these books of -- which have a graphic description, I mean it -- can’t even -- you have to put it down --</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: -- put it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: And what -- when we read about things happening in another country, it’s bad enough, but when you begin to realize these are my people, these are my relatives, that’s -- that was hard to accept.</span> <span id="s2444">An --</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">Q: Did you -- did you see a change in your parents, was this -- di -- did it take a lot -- because they knew them even better than you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: I mean, they was much closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">A: My mother’s three siblings all had gotten out, only her grandmother had stayed behind.</span> <span id="s2451">My father had four siblings and only one had gotten out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">A: And the one brother that he was so close with, that he was trying to talk into coming to Shanghai --</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: Didn’t get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: -- didn’t get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: He had three children.</span> <span id="s2458">One went to England, one went to first Holland -- Denmark, then Sweden and eventually is -- Israel or Palestine.</span> <span id="s2459">But the third one, the youngest one, stayed with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">A: And -- but the one that went to England, I fou -- eventually made contact with and we got together.</span> <span id="s2462">It’s horrible to realize what went through there.</span> <span id="s2463">And that overshadowed a lot of the other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2465">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: And then the next step was to make contact with the people that were alive.</span> <span id="s2467">My mother’s sister was in Panama, her brother was in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2468">Her other sister was in Haifa.</span> <span id="s2469">My father’s sister was in Montreal.</span> <span id="s2470">So we contacted all of them, and we decided whatever comes first, that’s where we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">Q: Where you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">A: We didn’t care where.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A: Well, it turned out that the United States came through f-fast.</span> <span id="s2475">And on Christmas eve, December 24th, 1946, we got our visa to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s2476">And of course once you had the visa, now you had to figure out how to get here.</span> <span id="s2477">The Joint and other Jewish organizations took care of that.</span> <span id="s2478">Was shipped -- usually troop ships, which were filled.</span> <span id="s2479">The first --</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">Q: With troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">A: American troops, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">A: But the -- you know, they tried to arrange it so that husbands went to wives first, parents to children, children to parents.</span> <span id="s2484">And we were the first group after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">A: And we were told we’d have a ship leaving first week of February.</span> <span id="s2487">I get a call at work, Ernie, come on home, we’re leaving in a few days.</span> <span id="s2488">What happened, the ship in February would not take any women because there were still G.I.s on the boat.</span> <span id="s2489">So they said, “Well, you and your sons can go, but your wife would have to come on the next ship.”</span> <span id="s2490">And he -- father wouldn’t hear of that.</span> <span id="s2491">Said, “We’ve stuck together this far, we’re not going to split up now.”</span> <span id="s2492">Is there nothing else we can do?</span> <span id="s2493">This was on January the fifth.</span> <span id="s2494">The guy said, “Well, there’s a ship leaving on the ninth of January, there is still some room.”</span> <span id="s2495">He said, “I’ll take it.”</span> <span id="s2496">But we have to have your heavy stuff by day after tomorrow.</span> <span id="s2497">Okay.</span> <span id="s2498">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">Q: You didn’t have that much stuff anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">A: We didn’t have that [indecipherable] had stuff we had to get rid of, you know, like the sewing machine I mentioned earlier, and got rid of some of the things.</span> <span id="s2501">But we were aboard that ship on January ninth, and 13 days later we were in San Francisco.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: Was it hard to leave Shanghai in some ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: It wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: You were glad to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">A: We loved -- we couldn’t wait to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: Our stay in Shanghai, I mean, even though it wasn’t that tough for me as a child, was very tough for my parents, my brother, and of course it filtered down to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: And even after the amer -- a-after the American occupation, even --</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">Q: -- even then it was not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">A: No, that -- you know, that was just a year, so getting out --</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">A: -- and starting a -- a new life was all we could hope for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: So you were all very happy to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: Very happy to get out.</span> <span id="s2518">Very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Q: Were there any friends there that you had made that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">A: Yes, we had some close friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">A: They moved different places.</span> <span id="s2523">One went to Australia, and I remember him, dimly.</span> <span id="s2524">We corresponded for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: And then stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: And then it stopped.</span> <span id="s2527">There was -- we actually had a little club that we formed after the war, met in the school, called Tikvah, and made some close friends with them, and one of them came to Washington, and I got to know her -- reunite with them --</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">A: -- after we got here.</span> <span id="s2530">I went to one reunion where I met -- re-met many of these people from the Tikvah club.</span> <span id="s2531">But it wasn't hard to leave.</span> <span id="s2532">I think it -- yeah, this group from Liegnitz, we all got together the night before --</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">A: -- had dinner together.</span> <span id="s2535">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">Q: That original group?</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">A: That original group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">A: The Brauns, the Ritters --</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">Q: The Ritters and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">A: Mr. Salinger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">A: And we said goodbye to each other because we all went in different directions.</span> <span id="s2544">We came to Baltimore, Brauns went to London, Ritters went to ta -- Palestine, and Salinger went back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">Q: Get his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">A: To his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">A: And my parents corresponded with them for a fairly long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2550">Had you remained fairly close with them whi --</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">Q: -- the whole time you were in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2554">Yeah, in fact, we always celebrated Passover together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: Mr. Braun was the one who conducted the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">A: I was always the youngest in all my life, to say the four questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">A: Manishtana.</span> <span id="s2561">And he used to practice, and I had to come over his house to help -- to do my part, and to practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">Q: I see, so you would do it well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">A: So I would do it well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">A: But e-even in Germany, my mother’s family, where we used to have Seder together with her family, I was always the youngest of all the cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">A: Then in this group I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s2568">So I was always the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">A: But s-say that by heart in Hebrew to this day to a great extent.</span> <span id="s2571">But it must have been very hard for my parents to say goodbye to them --</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: To them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A: -- because we spent so much --</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">A: -- time together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: And you shared a huge decision to even go to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: Decision to go to Shanghai, to live together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">A: To do that lunchroom together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">A: And even afterwards we stayed very close.</span> <span id="s2582">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">Q: Was America what you expected?</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">A: In most cases, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">A: In many cases better and some cases not so good.</span> <span id="s2587">And by that, the racial discrimination.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: I thought that this business with the blacks being different from the whites went out with the Civil War.</span> <span id="s2590">And of course, especially in Maryland and Baltimore, that was not the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">A: There was still a lot of discrimination in 1947 and ’48.</span> <span id="s2593">When we came here, of course, the first thing, you had to find a job.</span> <span id="s2594">We had a little bit of money that we had brought with us, but not very much.</span> <span id="s2595">And so looking for a job was the first thing, and we had relatives here, mother’s brother and his family.</span> <span id="s2596">They found out that Henry was a mechanic, and -- not an automobile mechanic, but a machinist, I should say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">A: So they got him a job in Bethlehem Steel, which was not to his liking because that was quite a distance from where we lived, and it reminded him like being shoved off to Allensbach in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s2599">When he -- my cousin heard that I was a camera repairman, he took me into Ritz camera center, and they hired me, and I was with Ritz for about 10 years.</span> <span id="s2600">So I had a job a week after we got here, my brother had a job a week after we got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">Q: Your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">A: My brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">Q: Your brother, right, at Bethlehem Steel, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">A: At Bethlehem Steel.</span> <span id="s2605">And my father went to the Jewish Community Center and talking to those people he says, I’ll be a Fuller Brush man, whatever you can find me.</span> <span id="s2606">And he was told, no, wa -- I’ll find you something better, and a few months later found him a job in a hospital.</span> <span id="s2607">In Maryland you could work as a physician in a hospital without having to take all the tests.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">A: But this was a sa -- a sanitarium for colored people.</span> <span id="s2610">So he was in a place called Henryton, working his profession, very happy living there.</span> <span id="s2611">My mother decided to live in Baltimore to take care of Henry and I.</span> <span id="s2612">They got together on -- on weekends.</span> <span id="s2613">And -- but this is some more of this discrimination that I was talking about, these doctors, African-American doctors used to tell my father, when you go into downtown Baltimore, you can go into any restaurant --</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">A: -- drugstore, have thi -- something to eat, or to drink, we can’t do that.</span> <span id="s2616">Theaters, some you can go to, some you can’t.</span> <span id="s2617">And that -- that surprised me, that was one of the things that surprised me.</span> <span id="s2618">But other than that, it was just great.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">Q: It was easier than being in Shanghai, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">A: Much easier --</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">Q: In a ce -- in a certain --</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">A: -- much easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">A: And we became assimilated as fast as we could.</span> <span id="s2625">We wanted to be as American as --</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">A: -- and the next guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">Q: Now you were 17 when you came and your brother was 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">A: 21.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: So you’re no longer kid kids any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2632">You know, I -- I made friends very quickly, and some of the people I made friends with I’m still friends with today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">Q: Are you?</span> <span id="s2634">That’s great.</span> <span id="s2635">Would [indecipherable] change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: Ernie, what did your father actually do in this hospital?</span> <span id="s2639">Was he just a regular physician?</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">A: Regular attending physician --</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">A: -- it was a TB hospital.</span> <span id="s2643">There were quite a few little children there, and he loved little children, got some pictures at home, him and the little children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">Q: And he lived there, so when did you and -- and Henry see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">A: On weekends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">Q: So, just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">A: Henry -- Henry got a -- a -- the idea was, when Henry was so unhappy with working in -- at Bethlehem Steel, my father said to him, as soon as I have a job, you can quit there and find something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">A: And he did.</span> <span id="s2650">He found a position as a salesman for a paper company selling wrapping paper and all that kind of stuff to retail stores, hos -- hospitals --</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">A: -- hotels, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2653">And for that, of course, he needed a car, so we bought him a car, and with that car we --</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">Q: You went back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">A: Back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2657">And did your father have an apartment there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: He did?</span> <span id="s2660">So y --</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">A: And my mother stayed there sometimes for days, but she wanted to take care of Henry and I, so she stayed in Baltimore with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">Q: So you all four were -- were subsidizing two apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: Well, the ap -- the apartment in the -- in Henryton, he didn’t have to pay for it, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">Q: I see, that was given to him, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A: -- that was given to him as part of his pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">A: My mother could have stayed there too, with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">Q: Right, but she preferred to stay with you guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">Q: Now I understand that one of the reasons you came to Baltimore, because her brother was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">Q: And then pretty much after you came, they decided they were -- or had they already decided they were going to California.</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">Q: Which was a little odd, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2676">It -- my mother became very upset about that, because when we came into California, when we landed in San Francisco, friends of my parents from Germany, who were living in San Francisco, were there welcoming us.</span> <span id="s2677">And the Joint gave us a hotel room where we could spend a little bit of time with them.</span> <span id="s2678">These were two brothers, they were not married, two brothers who, in Liegnitz had department stores, something, but they came to San Francisco and lived there.</span> <span id="s2679">And said, “Why do you go to Baltimore?</span> <span id="s2680">Everybody from the east is coming west.”</span> <span id="s2681">My mother said, “Well, all these years, with all that went on, I want to get back and at least be with my brother.”</span> <span id="s2682">So we came to Baltimore, we settled down a little bit, and they tell us that they are planning to move to San Francisco.</span> <span id="s2683">My mother was furious.</span> <span id="s2684">You could have told us that ahead of time, we would have stayed in San Francisco, the -- I forgot what their name was -- told us to just stay there.</span> <span id="s2685">Anyhow, they decided to go there, first their son, and then they.</span> <span id="s2686">And my uncle couldn’t find a job.</span> <span id="s2687">So after awhile they came back to Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2688">In the meantime we had really settled down extremely rapidly.</span> <span id="s2689">I had a nice job, maybe it wasn’t paying a fortune, but more than minimum wage.</span> <span id="s2690">Henry eventually had the job with this paper company, he stayed with them for over 40 years until he retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: And we made friends.</span> <span id="s2693">My parents made friends with other refugee people that lived there.</span> <span id="s2694">I joined a fraternity, it had nothing to do with a college, it was like a club, and as I said, I’m still friends with these people today.</span> <span id="s2695">A few years ago we had our 50 year reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">A: Just the three couples, one young -- one man moved onto New York and is now in upstate New York, and we call each other on the phone every once in awhile, once in awhile we see each other.</span> <span id="s2698">So it was a very deep friendship that developed there.</span> <span id="s2699">My brother also became friends with quite a few people, he had now a decent job, nine t -- nine to five, so to speak, rather than all hours of the day and night that they had in Bethlehem Steel.</span> <span id="s2700">He had a car so he could get around.</span> <span id="s2701">Began to teach me how to drive, which was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">Q: That was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">A: -- it was good to a point.</span> <span id="s2704">Eventually I went to a driving school, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2706">You needed a better teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">A: Well, would -- he was so nervous because he had no controls, you know what I -- driving school the guy has all the controls there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A: And that -- so we had no intentions of leaving Baltimore to go to San Francisco.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Q: Did you want to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">A: No.</span> <span id="s2712">That’s my problem, I didn’t want to go to school.</span> <span id="s2713">I liked -- I liked making money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">A: I liked work, I liked making money.</span> <span id="s2716">But people said to us -- used to say to us, in America you don’t need schooling.</span> <span id="s2717">They don’t care about your schooling, it’s what you know that counts, what you can do that counts.</span> <span id="s2718">Well, that’s not true.</span> <span id="s2719">And eventually somebody said to my father, look, your boys don’t even have a high school diploma.</span> <span id="s2720">You need to see to it that they get some schooling.</span> <span id="s2721">So Henry and I went to night school, Baltimore City College, which although it has the name college in it, is really a high school.</span> <span id="s2722">We went to night school, and sent our report cards from Shanghai to a department of education here in Washington.</span> <span id="s2723">That eventually came back, and they just went by our age into which grade we should go.</span> <span id="s2724">So in the meantime, what should we take, we -- English, of course, American history and some other subjects.</span> <span id="s2725">We took tests in German for both German one and for German two, which we passed with about a 90 degree setting.</span> <span id="s2726">And then we heard about the ga -- high school equivalent tests.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">A: And we both took that and passed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">Q: So you got your high school degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">A: So we have our high school degree.</span> <span id="s2731">Recently I happened to come across a report card of that.</span> <span id="s2732">I had 99 plus in mathematics, so mathematics was my field.</span> <span id="s2733">But we didn’t go on to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: And neither one of you wanted to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: Henry did go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">A: He went to -- he went to Baltimore City College and took a two year course there.</span> <span id="s2738">I was not eager at the time, which --</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">A: -- and I had no encouragement from my parents.</span> <span id="s2741">In the meantime, my pa -- father had passed away, and my mother depended on Henry and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: -- to keep her going.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">Q: Now, your father had a -- a goiter when he was in Shanghai, and this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">A: My father had a goiter from when he was a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: During World War І is when he first noticed it.</span> <span id="s2748">And it was in the army at the time, German army.</span> <span id="s2749">But this is 1914 - 1918 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">A: He had had a friend who had a goiter removed and he became a vegetable afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">Q: So your father was afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">A: My father said, I don’t need that, this is just a beauty spot.</span> <span id="s2754">People either like me or don’t like me with it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: -- and just kept that.</span> <span id="s2757">However, that put a tremendous strain on his heart, pos -- probably had some effect on his heart attacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">Q: Because it was growing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">A: It was growing internally --</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">Q: Internally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">A: -- yeah, always.</span> <span id="s2762">And it put a pressure on his heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">A: So after we’re here for awhile, we have to meet some of the doctors here, they said, look, why don’t you have it taken care of now?</span> <span id="s2765">We have Johns Hopkins Hospital here --</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">A: -- one of the best hospitals in the world.</span> <span id="s2768">He said, “But what about my heart?”</span> <span id="s2769">I mean, now after the initial heart attack in Germany, he had had another heart attack in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">A: Not as severe, but it was a heart attack.</span> <span id="s2772">They said, well, let’s take you under observation and then see how your heart will hold up for an operation.</span> <span id="s2773">So he did that, went into Hopkins, and we went to visit him one Sunday in December, and while we were there the doctor comes in.</span> <span id="s2774">We’ve checked your heart, you’ve been under observation, your heart is fine, you’ll be able to do it.</span> <span id="s2775">We’ve scheduled the operation for tomorrow, next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">A: Well, he ex -- my father excused himself after a few minutes, he had to go to the bathroom, didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s2778">All of a sudden we hear, Dr. So and So, Dr. So and So, calling him.</span> <span id="s2779">My father had had a heart attack.</span> <span id="s2780">They wheeled him back into the room, they chased us out, and that’s ho -- when he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">A: His heart just wasn’t able to take this, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2783">Completely -- I -- I for one never expected him to die.</span> <span id="s2784">That really got to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">A: And my mother now depended completely on my brother and I to take care of her.</span> <span id="s2787">No encouragement to me to go to school, so I didn’t.</span> <span id="s2788">Two years later, 1951, I got drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">A: And that -- after I come out of the army, instead of taking advantage of the G.I. bill, I went right back to work.</span> <span id="s2791">My own fault, I should have gone to college.</span> <span id="s2792">It would have been paid for under the G.I. bill.</span> <span id="s2793">But with no encouragement, in just the other way, you know, you got to go back to work so you can support me, I went back to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">Q: And who was supporting your mother when you were -- when you were in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">A: My brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">Q: Your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">A: And I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">Q: And you, because you were sending back the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">A: I sent back half of my pay, I mean, I got 80 dollars a month as a private, sent 40 bo -- dollars back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">A: While the other guys got money from home, I sent it back.</span> <span id="s2802">And my brother was just above the age to be drafted, and the age was at 26, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2804">A: -- so he just escaped being drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">Q: And you didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">A: And I didn’t, and you know, so once I got home -- my brother got married while I was in the service, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">Q: Did you know?</span> <span id="s2808">Was he dating this person before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: You did -- so you knew her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2812">I knew her.</span> <span id="s2813">And this -- also from -- she’s actually from Vienna.</span> <span id="s2814">And they took an apartment just a few doors away from my mother’s house, or mother’s apartment, didn’t have a house, and my mother used to cook dinner for them.</span> <span id="s2815">So they came over her house for dinner, and then went home.</span> <span id="s2816">But then I came home, and I moved in with my mother and stayed there, and this is still in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2817">In the meantime I went back to Ritz camera centers, and they told me -- Eddie Ritz, a very fine man, you know, they had to send repairs out while you were gone, so now how about -- we think you’d be better salesman than a repairman.</span> <span id="s2818">So I went into sales, worked my way up to assistant manager.</span> <span id="s2819">And one day I got a call from Eddie Ritz out of Washington, we just bought this place called Brenner photo, how would you like to be manager of the store here in Washington?</span> <span id="s2820">And that’s how I ended up in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">A: But instead of moving to Washington, my mother put it very bluntly, well, if you move to Washington, you’d have to pay for two apartments.</span> <span id="s2823">So I commuted for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">Q: By train, by car?</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">A: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">Q: By train, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">A: And then, after awhile I left Ritz cameras and then went for another comp -- with another company called Industrial Photo in Silver Spring, but there was no good train connection to Silver Spring --</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">A: -- and I commuted by car.</span> <span id="s2830">And couldn’t wait to get out of my mother’s house, so first chance I had, found a girlfriend, we decided to get married and move to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">A: Now [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">Q: But you still supported your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">A: I still supported my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2836">Did you get along with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s2838">To some degree, yes.</span> <span id="s2839">Retroactively I resent a lot of what happened.</span> <span id="s2840">This business of making us support her, not letting us have a life of our own.</span> <span id="s2841">I got married and when this young lady and I talked about marriage, I said, “But, you know, you’ve got to realize, I’ve got to send some money to my mother every month, every week.”</span> <span id="s2842">And it was tough --</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">A: -- on our weddin -- on our marriage.</span> <span id="s2845">Eventually she got some money out of Germany, a small pension.</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">Q: [indecipherable] I see, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">A: And that’s when it made it a little easier on us.</span> <span id="s2848">But I moved to Washington and visited my mother very frequently, but even that was not frequently enough.</span> <span id="s2849">So there was quite a bit of resentment that built up in me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">Q: Was she very isolated, do you think?</span> <span id="s2851">Or did she have friends that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">A: She had made lots of friends among the German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">Q: But she still wanted this association with you and Henry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">A: Well, you know, she wanted that, she wanted our financial support.</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">A: And made no strong effort to learn the language or to find a job.</span> <span id="s2857">And it was very difficult to build up a family life of our own, with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">Q: And did you have children?</span> <span id="s2859">This is your first wife, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">A: My first wife, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">Q: You had --</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">A: We had -- we had three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: -- two -- three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">A: One of whom unfortunately be -- died a few years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">A: But they all got to know my grandmother -- my -- their grandmother, my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: Although the youngest probably hardly remembered her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">Q: And do they live in the area, your children?</span> <span id="s2870">The two?</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">A: The two -- one lives in Philadelphia, just outside of Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">A: One is now here in northern Virginia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">Q: How nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">A: But she is married to a man in the diplomatic service, so every once in awhile they are --</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">Q: They’re [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">A: -- in other places, which is usually fine, we have a place to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">A: They’ve been in Lisbon, I visited them in Lisbon, I’ve -- we visited them in Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2880">Q: Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">A: So it’s very nice, and they have a little boy.</span> <span id="s2882">My son has two sons, one of whom is getting ready to go to college this fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">A: And my son-in-law never remarried after my daughter died, but has a little -- a little daughter, a young daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">A: She is now in high school, so they’re not little any more.</span> <span id="s2887">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">Q: And I gather your daughter was ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">A: My daughter had an illness that came about, well it was in her all her life.</span> <span id="s2890">I can’t think of the name right now, but it was a illness of the connecting tic -- tissue.</span> <span id="s2891">Ehlers -- Ehlers-something syndrome.</span> <span id="s2892">She one day developed a sore on her leg which wouldn’t heal, they had to decide to amputate the leg.</span> <span id="s2893">And then it a-attacked other parts of her body.</span> <span id="s2894">And it’s something I can’t get over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">Q: It’s awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">A: I mean, you expect your parents to die before you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2898">You don’t expect your children --</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">A: You sometimes expect your mate to pass away, but you don’t expect the children to die before you.</span> <span id="s2900">It’s -- that’s the tough part.</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2902">And you divorced in the 60’s, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">A: No, late -- later on.</span> <span id="s2904">When did I divorce?</span> <span id="s2905">About 15 years ago -- no, 18 years ago, cause it was just before my oldest grandson was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">A: We divorced, there were many reasons for it, and once the children were out of the house, it became more obvious that we don’t fit together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">A: And it was a -- about as friendly a divorce as you can have, I guess.</span> <span id="s2910">One day we just looked at each other and said, do we really want to continue our lives like that, and we decided no.</span> <span id="s2911">So first I suggested she find a place to live, and then I would sell the house and I’d find a place to live, figuring it’s easier for a man to find an apartment than a woman.</span> <span id="s2912">And she started to look around, she said, “Why would you want to sell this house, I mean, it’s something valuable that we have.”</span> <span id="s2913">I said, “Well the house is too big for one person to live in.”</span> <span id="s2914">Said, “Well if you don’t want it, then I want it.”</span> <span id="s2915">I said, “Well, that’s fine, you know, I’ll find a place to live,” and I moved out.</span> <span id="s2916">And you know, financial arrangements that we made between us hit some hard times, but not bad, not really bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2917">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">A: And she eventually remarried, and a few years later I met somebody and remarried.</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">A: And a good friend of mine asked me [indecipherable] how is marriage a second time around?</span> <span id="s2921">I said, “Well, if it’s that much better the second time around, I can’t wait for the third time around.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">Q: So it’s a good relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">A: It’s a very nice relationship, we do a lot of things together, we travel a lot.</span> <span id="s2924">We bo -- she’s also divorced, so we learned from our mistakes the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2925">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">A: And any divorce, it’s not one person’s fault --</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">Q: It’s not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">A: -- it’s always two people who are not necessarily at fault, things just don’t work out right.</span> <span id="s2929">There are many, many parts that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">A: -- play a part in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">Q: Whe -- when you look back, it’s -- in a way what I’m going to say is a stupid question, but -- because I don’t know exactly how you take something out of your life and say if -- what would have happened if this didn’t happen to me.</span> <span id="s2933">But I don’t know whether you experience what Shanghai has done to you.</span> <span id="s2934">The move out of Germany, the effect on your family and all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">A: I think I am aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">Q: You are?</span></p> <p><span id="s2937">A: My life -- I mean, I look at what my life would have been like if Nazism wouldn’t have come to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">A: I would have gone to college, I would have become a doctor or lawyer --</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">A: -- some professional.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">A: I would have had a great life, you know, I would not have had to worry about supporting my parents, they would have supported me.</span> <span id="s2944">Probably would have gone into a profession where I could make -- I’ve made a decent living, and -- instead of what I ended up with.</span> <span id="s2945">I mean, I didn’t do bad.</span> <span id="s2946">Considering what I went through, I did very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2948">And you enjoyed it, it seems.</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">A: I -- I enjoyed most of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">A: And -- but I find -- I -- you know, I get together with people my age or even younger, and they talk about their college life, which I’d never experienced.</span> <span id="s2952">I never experienced living by myself until I divorced.</span></p> <p><span id="s2953">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">A: Because I went from my mother’s house, got married --</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">A: -- into married life.</span> <span id="s2957">The three years between my separation from my wife, and before I met Anya, I enjoyed those, because I was on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">A: I was able to take care of myself, I didn’t starve.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">A: Figured out how to cook, more or less, and I missed out on that part of my youth.</span> <span id="s2962">I never had a teenage life, or a young adult life.</span> <span id="s2963">So yes, I missed that.</span> <span id="s2964">I decided a couple of times to go back to take college courses, but didn’t really follow through on it.</span> <span id="s2965">I did all right in my profession.</span> <span id="s2966">I eventually, after I left Ritz Camera Center, went with a company called Industrial Photo, and became their general manager and vice president, and did fairly well for myself.</span> <span id="s2967">But it’s not the same as what I could have been, or would have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">A: [inaudible] you know, I can hold my own with other people, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">A: -- have enough education of -- by reading and studying on my own.</span> <span id="s2972">But certain things I just missed out on.</span> <span id="s2973">You know, it -- like one time I tried to -- I considered opening up my own camera store, but then I became scared.</span> <span id="s2974">I am not a big risk taker, I’d rather let other people take the risk and I work for them, but that doesn’t get you very far.</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">Q: But you were in a very high risk situation as a child, it makes perfect sense, doesn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">A: Uh-huh, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">Q: It wasn’t your choice, it was certainly --</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">A: It was not my choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: No, but it certainly was a high risk situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: It was a very high risk situation, I mean, we escaped Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">Q: Barely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2982">A: -- barely escaped Germany.</span> <span id="s2983">In Shanghai I got bombed out, I mean I easily could have been killed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2985">A: And to think about what would have happened if we wouldn’t have left Germany --</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">Q: You wouldn’t be sitting here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">A: -- is really un -- I wouldn’t be sitting here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: Really be unthinkable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">A: To realize what happened to my cousin, my uncles, my aunts, can’t -- I can’t dwell on that too long, it’s too horrible.</span> <span id="s2992">You read some books and you wonder how one human being could do that to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">A: And yet, it’s still happening today.</span> <span id="s2995">Not necessarily against the Jews, but human beings can be very cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2997">Are you a religious person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">Q: Do you think that this set of events destroyed the possibility of becoming religious, do you think, or were -- you were just -- weren't that way all along?</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">A: No, it has -- I think the last straw was my daughter’s death.</span></p> <p><span id="s3001">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">A: I always say if -- there can’t be a God who can let six million people die, with one million of children, and then I say it’s really six million and one.</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">Q: And one, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">A: So, I’m really an atheist in -- as far as my belief is concerned.</span> <span id="s3005">I’m a cultural Jew, and ethnic Jew, but not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">Q: Not religious.</span> <span id="s3007">Well, I want to thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us today, and speak with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">A: Well, thank you for asking me, I feel privileged.</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">Q: You’re more than welcome, it’s a privilege for me.</span> <span id="s3010">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s3014">Q: What is this shot here?</span></p> <p><span id="s3015">A: This is actually a shot of the Main Street of Liegnitz.</span> <span id="s3016">Legnica is called now.</span> <span id="s3017">At one point in Shanghai, somebody came across this as a picture postcard and gave it to my mother when they saw that it was town we were born in -- I was born in.</span> <span id="s3018">And you see the streetcar on its single track down the street, and those two domes in the back, I don’t remember the name of the church, but was the center part of Liegnitz, and it -- the main shopping center.</span> <span id="s3019">This must have been taken sometime in the early 30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s3020">Q: And who is this couple?</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">A: These are my mother’s parents.</span> <span id="s3022">Their last name was Lewy, pronounced Levy in German.</span> <span id="s3023">His name is Isadore and her name is Rosa.</span> <span id="s3024">And my grandfather had a little goatee, looks a little bit like Lenin.</span> <span id="s3025">He -- what I remember about him is as a child he fell out of a tree, and they had to amputate one of his fingers.</span> <span id="s3026">And when we went for walks, it always felt funny when that one finger was missing.</span> <span id="s3027">He passed away in 1936, of a normal death, I forgot -- I have no idea what it was.</span> <span id="s3028">But my grandmother lived on and then eventually ended up in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">Q: And Ernie, who are -- who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">A: These are my father’s parents.</span> <span id="s3031">I never met them.</span> <span id="s3032">They died during World War І.</span> <span id="s3033">I am not sure what they died of, it might have been from that flu epidemic that went all around the world at that time.</span> <span id="s3034">But these pictures must have been taken before the 20th century started.</span> <span id="s3035">I have the originals in the frame in my bedroom.</span> <span id="s3036">And well I’m -- as I say, I don’t know too much about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3037">Q: And their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s3038">A: Emil is his name, and now you got me, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3039">Q: You remember [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3040">A: I -- Hanne, I believe.</span> <span id="s3041">I think it’s Hanne, well don’t quote me on this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s3042">Q: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">A: This is my father, his name was August, and -- on his motorcycle.</span> <span id="s3044">He didn’t have the motorcycle any more by the time I was born.</span> <span id="s3045">He and my mother cruised on the motorcycle all through Germany, and eventually they bought a car.</span> <span id="s3046">And then when I came along, a bigger car.</span> <span id="s3047">So the story goes that my brother asked once, why didn’t you buy a bus in the first place?</span> <span id="s3048">But he loved gadgets like this, and people recognized when the doctor was visiting someplace by the motorcycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">Q: Do you have any idea what year that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s3050">A: Well, it is probably in the 20’s, the mid- 20’s, because Henry was born in 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s3051">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3052">A: So it would have been before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">Q: And this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">A: This is my whole family, my father, obviously doing quite well, not on a diet at that point.</span> <span id="s3055">My mother, Betty, that’s me on her lap, and my brother Henry on the other side.</span> <span id="s3056">This was taken when Henry and I had whooping cough, and we were out in the country someplace, and my father went to town to his practice, and then came ho -- back in the evening, and one day he came back with a brand new car.</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">Q: And who is this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">A: This is my nursery school.</span> <span id="s3059">The lady in the back is Miss Schroeder, who was the owner [indecipherable] of the school, and I’m the little guy right in front of her.</span> <span id="s3060">I have no idea of any of the names of the others, but this is Miss Schroeder, who had to kick me out cause one of the other kid’s parents didn’t like a Jewish boy in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3061">Q: And Mrs. Schroeder’s the one who came with flowers for your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">A: With flowers, to my mother, to tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">Q: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">A: This was my first day of school.</span> <span id="s3065">In Germany it was common practice that on your first day of school you got a cone filled with candy.</span> <span id="s3066">That’s my brother, putting his hand on my shoulder for support.</span> <span id="s3067">But I obviously enjoyed the candy afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">Q: And this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">A: This is my first year of school, my first grade class.</span> <span id="s3070">I’m in the front in the center.</span> <span id="s3071">They -- right there.</span> <span id="s3072">And my teacher Mr. Thiel is in the background there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3073">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3074">A: That’s him right there.</span> <span id="s3075">Basically had a pretty good time in school there.</span> <span id="s3076">And I reconnected with Mr. Thiel when I was in the military after World War -- after -- no, during the Korean War.</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">Q: And this one?</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">A: Well, this is me in my liederhosen.</span> <span id="s3079">And it’s hard to tell who is more proud, my father of me, or me of my father.</span> <span id="s3080">But I believe this was taken in the mountains not too far from where we used to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">Q: And how old do you think you are there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">A: My guess is about seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">Q: So you think 1936?</span></p> <p><span id="s3084">A: Yes, approximately.</span></p> <p><span

id="s3089">A: I don’t know if in the album I even have the dates on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">Q: And this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3091">A: This is probably on the second year in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s3092">Both my brother Henry and I joined the British Boy Scout association.</span> <span id="s3093">He as a scout, and I as a Wolf Cub.</span> <span id="s3094">Here we call them Cub Scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">Q: A Wolf Cub?</span></p> <p><span id="s3096">A: It was referred to as Wolf Cub.</span> <span id="s3097">This was actually taken across the street from where we used to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">Q: And what do we see here?</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">A: Here we see what is left of the SACRA building after the bombing on July 17th, 1945.</span> <span id="s3100">You can see the bomb holes on top, and there’s a little gate in that wall that we used to enter in.</span> <span id="s3101">The building has been razed, and there’s another apartment building in its place now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3102">Q: So was your apartment, once you got inside, you went [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3103">A: Well it -- if you can imagine a school, where you have a walkway all around --</span></p> <p><span id="s3104">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3105">A: -- and rooms all around, we were actually in the back --</span></p> <p><span id="s3106">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3107">A: -- of this, but several bombs fell onto the building, and substantial destruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s3108">Q: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3109">A: This was taken in the school building when we were living there, after the bombardment.</span> <span id="s3110">And they came by with these big bins of food, and doled out enough food for every family.</span> <span id="s3111">We used to stand in line with our pots, waiting for them to show up, but eventually we kids just let the pots stand there, and we played on the playground until they came by.</span> <span id="s3112">And th -- each one got a little bit of food.</span> <span id="s3113">That what we lived on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">Q: This shot [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">A: This is back in -- being a Boy Scout.</span> <span id="s3116">The war is over, and during the war we often met, but didn’t dress up in uniform, always had to be back home before 10 o’clock when curfew came about.</span> <span id="s3117">And now we started to take some trips around Shanghai.</span> <span id="s3118">That’s me right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3119">Q: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">A: This is my family in our last apartment, taken by the photographer who took the passport pictures for the visa.</span> <span id="s3121">And we asked him to take one of the whole family, my brother on the left, my father, my mother and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">Q: And this is in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A: This is in Shanghai in our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s3124">End of Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s3125">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives
