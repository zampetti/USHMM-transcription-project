Please tell me about your background; your childhood years in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A. I lived in the city Hanover.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q.</span> <span id="s14">What year were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A. 1919.</span> <span id="s16">I lived a comfortable life.</span> <span id="s17">My father was a physician - a general practitioner.</span> <span id="s18">I would say I had quite a normal childhood - I had one younger brother.</span> <span id="s19">School was a little different; I was the only Jew in the class throughout most of my school years.</span> <span id="s20">I felt somewhat different from the others even though I fit in quite well.</span> <span id="s21">There were no major difficulties, but in the background it was always the one Jewish kid in the class, but I had good friends among the German students.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q.</span> <span id="s23">Did you visit their homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A.</span> <span id="s25">Some real good friends came to our home, and I visited their homes and so forth.</span> <span id="s26">There were never any problems until the early 1930's when the Nazi system became stronger.</span> <span id="s27">Less of my schoolmates would associate with me.</span> <span id="s28">After 1933, there were only a few who would still come visit us.</span> <span id="s29">But as a child I never suffered directly.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q. That's the truth?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q. Can you tell me about the Jewish life in Hanover?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A.</span> <span id="s34">There was a conservative synagogue in Hanover, where I had my Bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s35">Our friends were all quite similar, maybe too much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q.</span> <span id="s37">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A. Well, the Jewishness kind of disappeared out of everyday life.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q.</span> <span id="s40">What do you remember in your own life of the Jewishness?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A. I remember my Bar mitzvah, in 1932.</span> <span id="s42">It was the last time my whole family was together.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q.</span> <span id="s44">How large a gathering was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A. Small by today's standards - it was in my home.</span> <span id="s46">Less than ten people.</span> <span id="s47">I also remember going to the synagogue that was later burned down.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q.</span> <span id="s49">How many families attended this Synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A.</span> <span id="s51">In the city of Hanover there were less than 5,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s52">One percent of the population, so compared to cities like Frankfurt and Berlin this percentage was very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q.</span> <span id="s54">How did things change?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A. Things changed dramatically in approximately 1935-36.</span> <span id="s56">First of all, I could no longer go to school - I had only one more year until matriculation, but I could not stay.</span> <span id="s57">One thing that had tremendous impact was that my father lost his practice.</span> <span id="s58">He was permitted to treat Jews, but when he lost his practice to non-Jews that was the end.</span> <span id="s59">He took it very hard, and things just went down as far as our family is concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q. And so, how was your mother able to cope with this?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A. Mother was very strong.</span> <span id="s62">A strength we had never recognized.</span> <span id="s63">At this point I became the head of the household.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q.</span> <span id="s65">How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A. Well, by 1936 I was 17.</span> <span id="s67">I had to do things that normally at 17 I would not have done.</span> <span id="s68">In 1938 I went to school in Berlin.</span> <span id="s69">After that, in early October of that year, I took a job in Dortmund in a bell factory welding steel bells.</span> <span id="s70">In late November of the same year I was arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q.</span> <span id="s72">What was the reason for the arrest?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A. Well, the Gestapo stopped me on the street, they said are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s74">I said yes, and I was arrested.</span> <span id="s75">After that I was transported by train to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s76">After the train left, it stopped once in Hann to pick up some more Jews.</span> <span id="s77">I would say there were 300 on the train.</span> <span id="s78">Well, I don t know - the shades were down and none of us really new what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q.</span> <span id="s80">These were passenger cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q. Were you able to have any contact with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A.</span> <span id="s83">This was my greatest worry: what was happening with my family.</span> <span id="s84">I figured whatever happens, but I couldn't stand not knowing what happened back home.</span> <span id="s85">The whole time I was in the Kanzert (??)</span> <span id="s86">that was my uppermost concern.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q. I kanzert (??)</span> <span id="s88">a special word?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A. Well, the concentration camp in Germany was known as Kanzert (??)</span> <span id="s90">which is kz, the slang for concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q.</span> <span id="s92">What happened while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A. Oh God, you really want me to get into that, this discussion could be very lengthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q. I think that it is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A. Of course.</span> <span id="s96">The first day was an absolute nightmare.</span> <span id="s97">We had to stand at attention in front of an electric fence for 10-12 hours.</span> <span id="s98">People were beaten.</span> <span id="s99">People were encouraged to run into the fence and electrocute themselves, which some did.</span> <span id="s100">I guess the thought of my family kept me from doing these things.</span> <span id="s101">I was determined to see my family.</span> <span id="s102">Then we were put to work.</span> <span id="s103">We had to carry sand in our jackets to sites of construction, and we did other physical labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">3:74 The sanitary conditions in Sacksenhausen were fair, I think when I talk to other people who were in different camps.</span> <span id="s105">We slept on straw.</span> <span id="s106">In the barracks there were 50-60 other men.</span> <span id="s107">The main goal was to stay healthy because we knew anyone reported sick would never be seen again.</span> <span id="s108">We did not know, but I think it was quite obvious what happened to them.</span> <span id="s109">Must be healthy, also must not stand out.</span> <span id="s110">They always pick on the guy who was very tall or very short or had red hair or whatever.</span> <span id="s111">Some days were better than others.</span> <span id="s112">On the way to work they made us sing.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q.</span> <span id="s114">What kind of songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A. German marching songs.</span> <span id="s116">They were familiar from our days in youth organizations.</span> <span id="s117">As we marched through populated areas from camp to the work site, we had to sing so the people knew how happy the prisoners were.</span> <span id="s118">I think it actually helped our spirits.</span> <span id="s119">Then of course we were fed - very meagerly.</span> <span id="s120">There was boiled meat once a week.</span> <span id="s121">Most of the ones that stayed healthy survived--most were released 4,5,6-8 weeks later.</span> <span id="s122">And so this was not the beginning of the real extermination, yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q.</span> <span id="s124">How long for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A. 5 weeks</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q.</span> <span id="s127">Did they ever indicate how long it would be?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A. Never.</span> <span id="s129">We never knew if we would ever get out.</span> <span id="s130">If we would be shot.</span> <span id="s131">We had no idea until one morning when my name was called I was told I was getting out.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q.</span> <span id="s133">What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A.</span> <span id="s135">The first thing is that I found out that my mother had sent a small amount of money to the camp so that I could take a train home.</span> <span id="s136">I looked like an absolute mess.</span> <span id="s137">I went to Berlin and then on to Hanover.</span> <span id="s138">By the way, in Berlin we had a very touching experience; the people came to the station and waited with food and money and offers of housing.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q.</span> <span id="s140">Who were these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A. Germans.</span> <span id="s142">Non-Jews waiting for the prisoners.</span> <span id="s143">This was quite a contrast from what I had just experienced - it was very touching.</span> <span id="s144">It sticks out in my memory that these people did exist, there were people who did care.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q.</span> <span id="s146">Did you get home?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">5:06 A. Yes, I did get home.</span> <span id="s148">My father had been in prison in Hanover; he was very sick and they finally sent him home.</span> <span id="s149">My brother had been sent to Holland on a children s transport.</span> <span id="s150">And here was my mother who had been so strong.</span> <span id="s151">We still had our house at that time...</span></p> <p><span id="s152">USHMM Archives RG-50.031*0029 PAGE 4</span></p></body></html>
