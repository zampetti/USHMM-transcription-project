survivors who are able to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">I lost my entire family, even second cousins.</span> <span id="s5">I feel that if I forget them they will have died again and again.</span> <span id="s6">An entire civilization is gone and we have to perpetuate their memory.</span> <span id="s7">I also believe that quite a few people wish to say that it never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">There are books that say this never happened.</span> <span id="s9">But it was true and we have to speak up.</span> <span id="s10">Not very long ago there was a commemoration and among the speakers there were several Americans.</span> <span id="s11">We have to learn the story of the Holocaust because it tells the story of man~s inhumanity to man.</span> <span id="s12">The jews were chosen as a people, and they went back to your grandparents.</span> <span id="s13">We have to face that we are capable of great things, but also great evil.</span> <span id="s14">During the Nazi period the majority just stood around and did nothing.</span> <span id="s15">.</span> <span id="s16">In the twentieth century, in one of the centers of culture in Europe, unimaginable atrocities happened.</span> <span id="s17">.</span> <span id="s18">There will probably always be bloodshed, but we have to feel watchful.</span> <span id="s19">It is easy to kill people now.</span> <span id="s20">Today there is germ warfare and atomic destruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">I was born in Poland in 1926.</span> <span id="s22">I am 56.</span> <span id="s23">I was in a middle class family.</span> <span id="s24">My father was a principal.</span> <span id="s25">It was comfortable in Poland despite antisemitism.</span> <span id="s26">At the time I was growing up it was a vibrant community.</span> <span id="s27">My ancestors settled possibly in the 15th or 16th century.</span> <span id="s28">I was born to a family of three children.</span> <span id="s29">I lived a normal life.</span> <span id="s30">I went to an all girls school.</span> <span id="s31">It was quite a happy childhood.</span> <span id="s32">I was aware that although the law proclaimed us first class citizens, there were a great many things that a jew could not do.</span> <span id="s33">What do you know when you are a child?</span> <span id="s34">I had a loving family and my sense of belonging to the jewish people was strong.</span> <span id="s35">Poland was the country that I loved and I wanted to be on par with them.Yet I was always aware of the subtle yet tangible divisions.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">My world was shattered by the war.</span> <span id="s37">.</span> <span id="s38">When the Nazi's invaded in 1939, within two weeks Poland was occupied., and I was standing on the sidewalk when the Germans marched into my city.</span> <span id="s39">My whole world crumbled because they immediately started persecuting the population.It~s greatest venom was directed against the jews.</span> <span id="s40">They eliminated the intelligentsia.</span> <span id="s41">The anti- civilian laws were much more severe on the jews.</span> <span id="s42">.</span> <span id="s43">We were immediately ordered to wear an armband which was then changed to jewish star.</span> <span id="s44">Suffice it to say that be the end of 39, edicts came out requesting the jewish population to move to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s45">A slum area was cleared out.</span> <span id="s46">You could only take what you could carry on your back.</span> <span id="s47">The jews , realizing that one edict would follow after another, were trying to find some safety.</span> <span id="s48">By 1940, the ghettos were in larger towns and cities.</span> <span id="s49">After we went in there, the remnants of the jews were moved by train to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s50">We numbered about 200,000.</span> <span id="s51">Statisticians say that if we had not been deported to Auschwitz in '40 we would have died anyway.</span> <span id="s52">.</span> <span id="s53">My 14th birthday was the day that the Nazi's surrounded us with barbed wire.</span> <span id="s54">We were also divided in several points by barbed wire.</span> <span id="s55">The reason we lived longer than other is that we were needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Can I rest for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Some people were requested to come to the train station.</span> <span id="s58">Sometimes a hundred, sometimes a thousand.</span> <span id="s59">First they took people without work, the insane, children , and the aged.</span> <span id="s60">Until the end I didn't know where the people went.</span> <span id="s61">At the point when they took all of the Czech.</span> <span id="s62">jews and some of the German jews, some of the clothes were returned.</span> <span id="s63">Special factories were made where women had to clean the clothes and check for valuables.</span> <span id="s64">Occasionally, these women found bulletholes and blood.</span> <span id="s65">We thought some of the people might have resisted changing into prison clothing.</span> <span id="s66">It never dawned on us that all the people were killed.</span> <span id="s67">Almost at the same time as they were building Auschwitz, they were erecting a death camp near Loge.</span> <span id="s68">This is where the vast majority of jews of my city died .</span> <span id="s69">A lot died in the ghetto of starvation because we were on a minimal ration.</span> <span id="s70">A ration was issued once a week provided we worked.</span> <span id="s71">The SS, who wanted to kill us, had a battle with the army, who needed us.</span> <span id="s72">For a time, the army won out.</span> <span id="s73">Everything that was needed for the army was produced there.</span> <span id="s74">Without a ration you couldn't survive more than a day or two.</span> <span id="s75">There is a name in the polish language for someone who is almost dead.</span> <span id="s76">The word means, a ~death notice".</span> <span id="s77">I was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">I was young and healthy.</span> <span id="s79">I was an adolescent when they took the children away.</span> <span id="s80">A commission composed of high officers went from house to house and we had to line up.</span> <span id="s81">They took quite a few people away, the rest remained.Don't think we worked willingly, but you had to show up or you wouldn't get your ration.</span> <span id="s82">There were 70,000 of us left alive in 1944.</span> <span id="s83">We heard a rumbling.</span> <span id="s84">We had no contact with the christian world .</span> <span id="s85">There were some illegal radios.</span> <span id="s86">One man, knowing he would be tortured into giving away the location of the other radios, killed himself.</span> <span id="s87">He was a great hero.</span> <span id="s88">A young boy , who was seventeen, broke under the pressure and revealed where the other radios were.</span> <span id="s89">Occasionally we would get news from repairmen, etc.</span> <span id="s90">But we didn't know that Auschwitz was nearby where twenty thousand jews a day were killed.</span> <span id="s91">We did know that rumbling in the distance was the red army.</span> <span id="s92">The commander of the ghetto appeared and told the people, " Believe me I have no guns", and he opened his coat.</span> <span id="s93">"WE want to save you from the enemy, the red army.</span> <span id="s94">We want to transfer you to another camp. "</span> <span id="s95">We tried to hide, we didn't trust the Nazi's.</span> <span id="s96">But it was difficult because you had to claim your ration.</span> <span id="s97">By august 1944 we were surrounded and taken to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A small number of people stayed to help the nazi's pack.</span> <span id="s99">They survived because the red army arrived sooner than expected.</span> <span id="s100">The rest of us went to Auschwitz where most if us perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">There was a selection for life and death immediately.</span> <span id="s102">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s103">I was in a cattle car.</span> <span id="s104">There was enough water for the sixteen hour drive.</span> <span id="s105">It was actually much shorter but the trains had to skirt the major roads .</span> <span id="s106">It was wartime remember.</span> <span id="s107">Then we stood on the tracks and through the window we saw two beefy German soldiers drinking beer.</span> <span id="s108">Eyes looked at them from the train and they didn't blink an eyelid.</span> <span id="s109">It was like we weren't weren't there.</span> <span id="s110">.</span> <span id="s111">Men with shaven heads started yelling for us to get out and form lines-- men and women separately.</span> <span id="s112">My father went to the line for men.</span> <span id="s113">Despite the orders , I managed to run to the men's line and give him a bag with his toothbrush and his shirt.</span> <span id="s114">My father said to try and stay with my mother, I switched places with my friend .</span> <span id="s115">My friends mother was a tiny little woman and completely grey.</span> <span id="s116">She stood with my mother.</span> <span id="s117">My mother was taller and looked less than her 48 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">There was a long table in front of us with German soldiers.</span> <span id="s119">They would point either to the right or to the left from the direction I was coming.</span> <span id="s120">The right meant death, But I didn~t know that.</span> <span id="s121">All I knew is that out of the corner of my eye I saw a young woman and girls like myself moving to the left.</span> <span id="s122">To the right, I saw crippled people, lame people, people who were emaciated.</span> <span id="s123">But I didn't have much time to think about it.</span> <span id="s124">Before I knew it I stood in front of a handsome officer.</span> <span id="s125">Later I was told it was Mengel.</span> <span id="s126">All I remember is that he was smiling.</span> <span id="s127">He asked me about the little lady, " Is she your mother?'"</span> <span id="s128">I said, " No".</span> <span id="s129">He pointed to the right and she went to the right.</span> <span id="s130">Then he looked at me and said, " How old are you?"</span> <span id="s131">.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">I said "18".</span> <span id="s133">And he said ~ Old enough", and I went to the left.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Ahead of me was my mother and my friend.</span> <span id="s135">It didn't occur to me until much later that if I would have said that she was my mother I would have gone to my death with her.</span> <span id="s136">Obviously, he though there was a little work left in me.</span> <span id="s137">My mother and I stayed together and pretended we were not mother and daughter because they separated them.</span> <span id="s138">.</span> <span id="s139">They would look at our bodies everyday-- line us up.</span> <span id="s140">They looked and took the ones that were emaciated to one side.</span> <span id="s141">I was sent away.That night we started to holler and cry.</span> <span id="s142">We were dreadfully congested.</span> <span id="s143">If you got up there were overseer.</span> <span id="s144">They were all nationalities of jews.</span> <span id="s145">We could only go to the latrine once or twice a day.</span> <span id="s146">Or , sometimes they took us outside for punishment.</span> <span id="s147">To show German order we would have to kneel in the gravel and heaven help if you relaxed.</span> <span id="s148">THey told us to behave.</span> <span id="s149">there was a girl who yelled to us in Slovak,~ Where do you think you are?This is a deathcamp.</span> <span id="s150">We don~t want to pay for your disobedience."</span> <span id="s151">On the fourth day I was led to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s152">We were lead into a shower but water came out.</span> <span id="s153">We were told to sleep on a pile of coal dust.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">When we woke up we looked incredibly funny.It became late in the evening and the sky was red and black.</span> <span id="s155">I saw smoke but I couldn't smell anything.</span> <span id="s156">I felt no fear.</span> <span id="s157">I was too bewildered.</span> <span id="s158">The sun couldn't have been out but the sky was red.</span> <span id="s159">Next to me sat a couple of women.</span> <span id="s160">It kind of encouraged me to speak.</span> <span id="s161">I said, "Tell me, why is the sky so red and what is that black smoke.</span> <span id="s162">It's so pretty here".</span> <span id="s163">She said, " Don't you know where you are?"</span> <span id="s164">I said,~Auschwitz~.</span> <span id="s165">She said, ~The sky is red because they are burning people.</span> <span id="s166">They are gassing them.</span> <span id="s167">Instead of water , gas comes out.</span> <span id="s168">And then they burn them .</span> <span id="s169">Consider yourself lucky because tomorrow you are going to a branch of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s170">I would do anything to get out of here, I wish I could go with you."</span> <span id="s171">I left with several thousand.</span> <span id="s172">I ended up in an under ground airplane factory.</span> <span id="s173">We worked for 12 hours at night in the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">most of the labor was slave labor.</span> <span id="s175">We were expendable.</span> <span id="s176">If a group dies you can always replenish it.</span> <span id="s177">We were, in 1945, close to getting freed by the Russians.</span> <span id="s178">We heard the guns distinctly, But they wouldn't let us stay in Breslau.</span> <span id="s179">Anyone who stayed behind was shot.</span> <span id="s180">For food we had nothing and for drink we had snow.</span> <span id="s181">We marched for three days.</span> <span id="s182">When ever we rested to perform our necessities, they watched us-- men and women.</span> <span id="s183">You lose your shame very fast.We would sneak out, not even afraid of their bullets.</span> <span id="s184">We would knock on doors.</span> <span id="s185">We knocked on the door of a German house to beg for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">No one came to the door.</span> <span id="s187">I'm sure they were afraid.</span> <span id="s188">After three days we came to a small town and saw a train full of prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">They were trying to liquidate all the jews and they were trying to get them into the center of germany.</span> <span id="s190">We were packed into a train like sardines.</span> <span id="s191">I was in the last detachment.</span> <span id="s192">We got off in the darkest of night .</span> <span id="s193">We wandered several kilometers into a concentration camp.I couldn~t read where I was because it was dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">We were given a shower.</span> <span id="s195">It was water, not gas.</span> <span id="s196">They took some of our clothing, considering us too well dressed.</span> <span id="s197">We were then shoved into an overflowing barracks-- there we proceeded to die.We had a minimum of food and a maximum of lice.</span> <span id="s198">We deloused ourselves with our fingers.</span> <span id="s199">Pretty soon I couldn't get up anymore.</span> <span id="s200">My mother lay dying.</span> <span id="s201">There was not even much compassion left because everyone was in the same boat.</span> <span id="s202">We had dysentery from bad water.</span> <span id="s203">The only water available was in anti-aircraft basins that were dug.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">When we were freed the barracks were 3/4 empty.</span> <span id="s205">The British freed us on April 15, 1945.</span> <span id="s206">I heard some of the healthier people yell, " Some uniformed soldiers are coming".</span> <span id="s207">Then the loudspeaker announced that it was the british and that we were freed.</span> <span id="s208">They said to stay in the barracks and they would distribute food.Unfortunately, they did not realize that the stomach lining was completely shot and they distributed a tin of pork and some biscuits.</span> <span id="s209">I was too weak to open the tin of pork.</span> <span id="s210">If I had eaten it, I would have been a goner in a couple of hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Bodies were piled between the barracks two stories high.</span> <span id="s212">I could hardly walk , because the bulldozers were actually performing a burial ceremony.</span> <span id="s213">I don~t know where my mother lies.</span> <span id="s214">Later, I found out my father had died in January of '45 of malnutrition and</span></p> <p><span id="s215">exhaustion.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">I was freed , but how can you be happy when you~ve seen the worst that a person can see.I left Germany.</span> <span id="s217">I would have left immediately but I had to wait for my number.</span> <span id="s218">I came to New York on April 8, 1948.</span> <span id="s219">I have made it a life long study.</span> <span id="s220">As long as my brain works, I will read and learn about the Holocaust Was there any Jewish Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">In the ghetto where I was there was no military resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Unfortunately, we speak of resistance only in military terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Resistance went on everyday of your life.</span> <span id="s224">It didn't matter where you were.</span> <span id="s225">We tried to survive and be clean.</span> <span id="s226">We had to exist only on what was given.</span> <span id="s227">There was a lot more resistance than is commonly known.</span> <span id="s228">Even today, there are a great many books by survivors.</span> <span id="s229">The Polish resistors were not that eager to accept jews.</span> <span id="s230">Such was Polish anti-semitism , even though the enemy was one and the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">The communists accepted more jews.</span> <span id="s232">Some groups were as anti-jewish as anti-nazi.</span> <span id="s233">The Poles deny this, they are not proud of it.</span> <span id="s234">I am not saying the Polish nation could have saved the 3.5 million jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">I am focussing on Poland because I come from there and the majority of jews killed were in Poland.I am saying that many thousands could have survived if Polish sympathy had been more.</span> <span id="s236">Unfortunately, the desire to help jews was minimal.</span> <span id="s237">Please remember, there is resistance with and without arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Is there a memorial at the Lodz Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s240">There is a large monument in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s241">They are afraid it will bring back too many memories.</span> <span id="s242">There is an effort in the Soviet Union and the satellite countries to clump the jewish tragedy into a general tragedy.</span> <span id="s243">I am not minimizing their tragedy,but the tragedy of the christian people is not the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">The Christians had a chance.</span> <span id="s245">It did not take much to be shot or taken to a labor camp, but there was a chance.</span> <span id="s246">The jewish people were not considered human.</span> <span id="s247">We were fit only to be dead.</span> <span id="s248">We only lived on the way to death .</span> <span id="s249">The satellite countries deny it.</span> <span id="s250">They are trying to obliterate the memory of the jews.</span> <span id="s251">The emphasis in Poland now is on the destruction of the civilian people by the nazis with a smaller emphasis on the jewish genocide.The jewish tragedy is minimized and and clumped together with the others.</span> <span id="s252">Ironically, there is not an effort to make the point that the jewish people had to bear the brunt of the destruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">In what time period did the U.S. become aware of the deathcamps?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Information was available from the very beginning .</span> <span id="s255">The knowledge was available in 1941.</span> <span id="s256">It was buried in the back of newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Church newspapers printed it.</span> <span id="s258">Certainly, in 1942 and 43 they were aware to the point that they had the ability to bomb railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s259">The jewish leadership pleaded with the government to drop bombs.</span> <span id="s260">They knew haw many were killed and where.</span> <span id="s261">When the jewish representatives approached President Roosevelt, he gave them an audience, and there were a few rallies.</span> <span id="s262">The representatives were seen but nothing was done.</span> <span id="s263">Some were afraid to raise the specter of divided loyalty.Therefore, they didn't put up a big enough fuss.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">So horrible was the knowledge of everything that it was denied.I see in the way that the U.S. was able to accept so many refugees after the war that it was paved with jewish blood.Remember the ships that were turned away?</span> <span id="s265">It was a clear sign to the nazi's that the world was indifferent.We were not human enough in the forties and fifties.</span> <span id="s266">We never even forced the red cross to get packages to the jewish families.Had the allies cared more, not one Hungarian jew need have died.</span> <span id="s267">One boat of fleeing jews was left to fall apart by the british and all but one died.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Do you see any antisemitism now?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">It is minimal compared with what I grew up with.</span> <span id="s270">Without antisemitism the nazi's wouldn't have been able to do what they have done.</span> <span id="s271">We are not the only minority here, and I don't see any danger to any minority.</span> <span id="s272">If the economic situation became worse, antisemitism could become stronger.One doesn't have to teach the population about jew hatred.</span> <span id="s273">We are not free of antisemitism.I had hoped that in this country I would no longer encounter it.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">[ Couldn't hear question ] I took care not to come to close [ to the girds ].</span> <span id="s275">If you were called you had to come, and it was often to shoot or beat you.</span> <span id="s276">So, we walked on the streets out of sight of the sentries.</span> <span id="s277">I saw them every day of my life.</span> <span id="s278">I remember being led from the train after the decision of life or death by boys who were no more than fifteen or sixteen.SS women were not armed, they used their fists.</span> <span id="s279">You faced them face to face.</span> <span id="s280">You were not permitted to stand too close because you were not human , you were vermin, you were guards.</span> <span id="s281">You had to say things indirectly through the overseer who was a</span></p> <p><span id="s282">prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Did they permit religious services?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Are you joking?</span> <span id="s285">They denied you food and water and they killed you.I was angry at God.</span> <span id="s286">I would not have gone to services if I could have.</span> <span id="s287">It was difficult to believe in him.</span> <span id="s288">Some became more religious.</span> <span id="s289">.</span> <span id="s290">For recreation they shot you.</span> <span id="s291">They loved it.</span> <span id="s292">They were not all sadists, they were trained to do what they were doing.</span> <span id="s293">They were told that killing jewish people was a good thing.</span> <span id="s294">They almost did what they set out to do.</span> <span id="s295">The jews disappeared, but the problems of the world have not.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">How did you put it behind you?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">I did not have the luxury of going to a psychologist.</span> <span id="s298">It was a fairly new science and one shied away from it.</span> <span id="s299">My self esteem was crushed to a point.</span> <span id="s300">I remember the feeling of where is God and what is this world all about?</span> <span id="s301">I felt so insignificant.</span> <span id="s302">After the war I felt a little better.</span> <span id="s303">I was thinking, where am I going to sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">How am I going to find out what happened to my friends and relations and neighbors.</span> <span id="s305">Where am I going to go?Will I be permitted to go to Israel?</span> <span id="s306">I had a lot of practical things to think about.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">First , I went to the British headquarters and asked for a job.</span> <span id="s308">I was fluent in three languages.</span> <span id="s309">I couldn't get
