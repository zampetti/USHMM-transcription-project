maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Salzburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Where were you born and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I was born in the city of Przemyśl in 1917.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: What day, specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: The 13th of September.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And the town is in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: In Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: In the district of Lvov?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Well, according to the latest arrangements, Przemyśl is almost at the border, the Polish-Russian border, because Lvov has become a Russian city, it’s not Polish any more.</span> <span id="s24">But when I lived there, it was a town of about 60,000 people, of which 22,000 were Jewish.</span> <span id="s25">I went to a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s26">My father didn’t want to send me to the Hebrew gymnasium because it was co-educational with the boys.</span> <span id="s27">So I went to a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s28">And I find the arrangements that they had were very smart.</span> <span id="s29">On 44 girls, we were 20 Jewish.</span> <span id="s30">So we had a religion class.</span> <span id="s31">We had to leave the class and go to another, we Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s32">And we had a rabbi who came and gave us a lesson in religion.</span> <span id="s33">I liked the priest better, he was young and handsome.</span> <span id="s34">We had to stand up at the beginning of our classes and listen.</span> <span id="s35">Not say it, but li – stand in the respect of their prayer.</span> <span id="s36">And we had to stand up before we left for home.</span> <span id="s37">That was the only thing we had to do.</span> <span id="s38">Otherwise, we had our religion class.</span> <span id="s39">And we had a few Jewish teachers, even though it was a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s40">We didn’t have nuns.</span> <span id="s41">The only – the only way they could prove that it was a Catholic school was that we had the prayer in the morning and the prayer in the afternoon, which we didn't participate in, we just stood and listened, and that was all.</span> <span id="s42">Was a very fine school, and a very fine education.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Let’s talk a little bit now about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: My family.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: How long – how far back can you go, of generations that lived in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Well, I – I know my grandfather, who lived there, and my grandmother, who later, when she was older and ill, stayed with us in our house.</span> <span id="s47">My father, as a 16 – my grandmother, poor, limping grandmother, who had one leg shorter than the other, she was very small, had 11 children, of which 10 were boys and one girl.</span> <span id="s48">She was very happy when they took off and went to America.</span> <span id="s49">The boys.</span> <span id="s50">I know of two were here, living here in – in New York, but my father came here as a 16 year old boy.</span> <span id="s51">He was a very handsome boy and he was addicted to the theater, to the Yiddish theater.</span> <span id="s52">So when he came to New York, besides learning a trade to become a tailor, he joined the Yiddish theater in New York.</span> <span id="s53">And I grew up on stories of great Boris Tomachevsky and Luther Adler.</span> <span id="s54">And he played with a young boy by the name of Muni(ph) Weisenthal, which was pel – Paul Muni later.</span> <span id="s55">And I still remember my father in Poland, in a Jewish theater, where he played King Lear.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: King Lear in Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: In Yiddish, absolutely.</span> <span id="s58">But, after staying in New York City for 11 years in very, very poor conditions, he got sick.</span> <span id="s59">He had TB.</span> <span id="s60">And at that time TB was not easily cured as it is now, so he was so frightened that he took a boat and went back to mama, to Poland.</span> <span id="s61">He never returned.</span> <span id="s62">But we lived with New York times all the time and I lived with the stories of the Yiddish theater, and that was my dream when I was a young girl, to come to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: What was your father’s name?</span> <span id="s64">A: Isadore(ph).</span> <span id="s65">I remember him in the Yiddish theater, and so was my mother.</span> <span id="s66">I think they met in the Yiddish theater.</span> <span id="s67">My father was an extremely handsome man.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Well, the – the picture doesn’t show up on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s70">He – he did very well in his profession, he was very successful, he had a good business, and he had workers working for him.</span> <span id="s71">He specialized in ladies’ coats and suits, no dresses, and he used me as a model.</span> <span id="s72">He would say, put on a coat and go for a walk.</span> <span id="s73">My mother helped him in the business and he was very successful.</span> <span id="s74">My father by – he – he used to call himself a – a – a socialist.</span> <span id="s75">He be – he belonged to the Polish socialist party.</span> <span id="s76">And when the Russians cov – came into our town, I was very concerned about him because he was wealthy, very well known.</span> <span id="s77">They didn’t touch him.</span> <span id="s78">They didn’t touch him.</span> <span id="s79">He closed his business and he was sitting home, working there, and he survived.</span> <span id="s80">I was afraid they will take him to Siberia.</span> <span id="s81">And I shouldn’t have been afraid, it would have been better had they – had they taken him.</span> <span id="s82">Well, they didn't.</span> <span id="s83">When the Germans came in, he became one of the – you – are you familiar with the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: We – we – we’ll get to that in awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Oh, we gonna get to it, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Yeah, let’s talk a little bit about your mother’s family.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: My mother’s family.</span> <span id="s88">I don’t remember my mother’s family as well as my father’s.</span> <span id="s89">He – she had a sister, older sister who lived also in Przemyśl.</span> <span id="s90">They all – who had – they had three children, two boys and a girl, they all died, m-my mother’s sister and her family, they all died.</span> <span id="s91">She also had a brother who worked for my father, he was a tailor and was married and had a little boy.</span> <span id="s92">They all died.</span> <span id="s93">From my family, nobody survived.</span> <span id="s94">I’m the only one, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s95">From my husband’s family, his father and mother came to Przemyśl during the war, we got them there.</span> <span id="s96">We thought we can take better care of them.</span> <span id="s97">I took them to the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: So, what was your mother’s name?</span> <span id="s99">A: Anna.</span> <span id="s100">She was a very, very smart, clever woman.</span> <span id="s101">She was the one to – who encouraged me to go into hiding during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Well again, we’ll talk about that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes, we will talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span> <span id="s105">A: No, I was an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And how much of your extended family was in the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: My ex –</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Aunts, uncles, cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, it was my mother’s sister, that was the only one.</span> <span id="s110">From my father’s family, most of them went to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: How religious was your house, yo-you –</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: It was, I would say a standard religious home.</span> <span id="s113">In other words, my father was a president of a shul, oh yes, and he used to take me with him where men were praying, until I rebelled one day and I said I don’t want – I want to go where women are, and to this day it bothers me when I sit together with men.</span> <span id="s114">But my mother was less religious.</span> <span id="s115">She would be in the store on a Friday and she would forget to light the candles, or couldn’t go home.</span> <span id="s116">She would say to me, go home and light the candles, so Father wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s117">He didn't like it.</span> <span id="s118">He was – he was a – in his way he was a religious man, yes.</span> <span id="s119">He – he – I used to love Seders because my father would come home freshly shaven from the barber, smelling of powder and – and we would sit at the table and he would say dom(ph) sefredyah(ph) and instead of doing that, I would do this [indecipherable] always – he always smiled at me when we did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: These are the plagues?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s122">He was very well known in town.</span> <span id="s123">My father had – my mother was the brain of the family, my father was the heart.</span> <span id="s124">He had a big heart.</span> <span id="s125">From the age of 10 to 18, I went every summer with my father for a whole month of July, to the Polish Tatra mountains.</span> <span id="s126">There was a resort in that Polish Tatra mountains on the – almost on the Czechoslovakian border, where people with TB would come, first of all because of the weather.</span> <span id="s127">It was marvelous, it was in demand.</span> <span id="s128">Secondly, they had special waters.</span> <span id="s129">There was one water that was specially for people with lung problems, and the water was later bottled and sold in pharmacies.</span> <span id="s130">So we went every year, and he would always rent two rooms.</span> <span id="s131">I never slept in the same room where my father was.</span> <span id="s132">I was not allowed to enter the room where my father slept, he was so afraid that I might catch the TB from him, although he was under doctors’ care.</span> <span id="s133">A – but nevertheless, he always rented two rooms with an adjoining ba-balcony, and I – one was for me, and one was for him.</span> <span id="s134">And we would fight constantly, he and I, constantly.</span> <span id="s135">Every year at the end of the season when we were in those mountains, I would say, I will never go with you again.</span> <span id="s136">He says, if you pay me I wouldn’t go with you.</span> <span id="s137">Until the next year.</span> <span id="s138">And the next year, May came, I saw his eyes looking at me and he says, are you starting to pack?</span> <span id="s139">And we went.</span> <span id="s140">We left Mother in the store, she was probably very glad to get rid of us.</span> <span id="s141">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: What was the name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Przemyśl.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: No, no, the – th-the resort in the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Oh, the resort.</span> <span id="s146">That’s hard, Szczawnica, s-z-c – c-z-a-w-n-i-c-a, Szczawnica.</span> <span id="s147">It was a place that was – there was no train station there, there was no bus.</span> <span id="s148">So we went to the nearest town and we hired a taxi and we would go there.</span> <span id="s149">And the reason I am telling you this is because I was about 14 years old, I always travel with my music, I played piano.</span> <span id="s150">And my father had very few requirements of me, but one of those was that he rented always for me, a piano, where I could go and play an hour a day, practice my piano.</span> <span id="s151">We arrived to the station, and those Jews living there knew him, because he was there year after year after year.</span> <span id="s152">So they were waiting for him to arrive.</span> <span id="s153">And as soon as we arrived, they would tell him something, something very important, and he would turn to me and say, do you have your music with you?</span> <span id="s154">I said, yes, of course I have my music, I always have it.</span> <span id="s155">He says, well, there is a – a family, a mother and father, Jewish family and two children and they are very poor and they don’t have enough food.</span> <span id="s156">So I, being a spoiled little thing, I said to him, Father, I don’t understand, if they are so poor, why do they go to a summer resort?</span> <span id="s157">Which was a logical question.</span> <span id="s158">But he was enraged.</span> <span id="s159">He says, you mean to tell me that the – only the wealthy can have good air and good waters?</span> <span id="s160">We have to do something about it, he decided.</span> <span id="s161">He says to me, do you have that pink chiffon dress that the dressmaker just finished for you?</span> <span id="s162">I said yes, I have it.</span> <span id="s163">He looked at my hair and he said, we’ll take you to the hairdresser and have some very nice curls made.</span> <span id="s164">And I said, what do you have in mind?</span> <span id="s165">You’re going to play the piano, we’ll give a concert and we’ll collect money.</span> <span id="s166">I said no, I’m not going, I am not prepared to give any concert.</span> <span id="s167">I was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s168">He says, we will find a boy who’ll play the fiddle.</span> <span id="s169">And if they see a girl and a boy playing, who cares whether you playing well or not?</span> <span id="s170">We’ll collect the money.</span> <span id="s171">And here’s exactly what he did.</span> <span id="s172">He hired a place, he found a boy, I played with my music because I didn’t memorize anything, and he, he didn't care, he collected the money for the people.</span> <span id="s173">That was my father, always caring about people, a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: You had said that he was politically oriented.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes, he was a social – he used to say he was a socialist and I would – I would joke and say, a wealthy socialist.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: So you would describe your family as being upper class?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Yes, yes, yes, I would describe as being – he never mastered the Polish language and I felt very embarrassed because of that.</span> <span id="s178">He – he spoke English, he spoke Yiddish, and they spoke Yiddish to each other, but never to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: What did you speak to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Polish.</span> <span id="s181">And I offered him that I would teach him Polish.</span> <span id="s182">He didn't want to.</span> <span id="s183">But I found later that the knowledge of Yiddish was very helpful to me.</span> <span id="s184">I didn’t know I knew it.</span> <span id="s185">When I came to Munich, Germany, and I taught piano in a DP camp, I had children from all over Europe, but they didn’t speak German and they didn’t speak Polish.</span> <span id="s186">So I didn't know how to reach them.</span> <span id="s187">I started with my broken Yiddish, and that’s the way I reached them.</span> <span id="s188">That’s the mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What kind of neighborhood did you live in?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: I lived like you would live here, let’s say on Connecticut Avenue.</span> <span id="s191">The main street of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Did you live in a house or an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: No, we lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s194">And our store and factory was about a half a block away from where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: What was the name of the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Franciszkańska.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Was it a Jewish neighborhood, or a mixed neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Well, it – it was primarily Jewish, yes.</span> <span id="s199">It was the downtown of the city.</span> <span id="s200">And most of the stores were owned by Jewish people, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: And did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: It was a lovely city.</span> <span id="s203">We never had any crime, we never had to lock our doors when we went out.</span> <span id="s204">When – there was one taxi standing at the station and if somebody took that taxi, the whole town knew it.</span> <span id="s205">At the same – at this – at the house where we lived, downstairs were three – two young ladies.</span> <span id="s206">They were not so young, they were older.</span> <span id="s207">Unmarried, who had a – a store with sweets; candies and things like that.</span> <span id="s208">And that was my mother’s favorite store, she – there was a chair for her there and she would always sit in the evening and chat with them.</span> <span id="s209">I never had to pay for anything.</span> <span id="s210">I didn't need any money.</span> <span id="s211">As soon as I say who I am, it went on paper and my mother later paid for it somehow, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Did you have many non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: I had – I had one Polish girl, non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s214">The other one was Jewish.</span> <span id="s215">No, I – we – as I said, we were – we were 20 girls for a 44 girl class, so there were quite a number of Jewish girls, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: How – for how many grades did you go to this Catholic school?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: From the first to eight, eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: And then what did you do after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: After that I started to go to a conservatorium, which was Ukrainian, in Przemyśl.</span> <span id="s220">There – it was a very, very funny arrangement because I – I didn’t speak Ukrainian, but I could understand it.</span> <span id="s221">They spoke to me in Ukrainian, I answered in Polish, and we understood each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: This is a music school?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Music, yes, where I studied piano, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Did you notice when you were younger, even in those eight grades or in the conservatory, any indication of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s226">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s227">In all my years in that school, I have never heard something said against Jews, or against us as Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s228">As I said, we – I had – I had two – three teachers who were Jewish.</span> <span id="s229">I didn’t feel at all, any anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s230">And I think my hu – from what my husband was telling me he felt very comfortable in his school too.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: What was the name of the school that you went to, the elementary school?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: That I went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: The Catholic school?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Maria Konopeniczka(ph).</span> <span id="s235">That’s a name of a Polish [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Now, y-you said that you loved Seders.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Any other favorite holidays that you had growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Oh, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: And do you have particular memories of?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, I remember that.</span> <span id="s242">Well, I used to joke because when my mother – mother has a pair of very beautiful diamond earrings, and she – that was her pride and joy, and she kept it in a safe deposit.</span> <span id="s243">When sh – I knew when the Jewish holiday is coming because Mother took out her earrings, yes, yes,

there was no dating, absolutely nothing But I – I was a very good scholar in school, and I also had to spend a lot of time pratic – practicing my piano.</span> <span id="s251">So I didn’t have much time for other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Were you interested in sports, or art?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: No, no, the only sport my father allowed me was tennis.</span> <span id="s254">He did not allowed me g – to go skating.</span> <span id="s255">He was afraid that I probably break my leg, probably.</span> <span id="s256">I wasn’t particularly – but, in Przemyśl, the city is divided by a river.</span> <span id="s257">A river with very, very clean water.</span> <span id="s258">And in the summer we had kind of a arrangement.</span> <span id="s259">They built a wooden – wooden cabanas at the edge of the river.</span> <span id="s260">And it was done very smartly, that you didn’t feel that you have a proper figure and you wanted to have a b – wear a bathing suit.</span> <span id="s261">You could go to the wood cabana, there were steps there going down into the water.</span> <span id="s262">You could emerge in the water without being seen by anybody.</span> <span id="s263">And this is how we spend our summers, beautifully.</span> <span id="s264">Beautiful river.</span> <span id="s265">It was a good life, it was a very peaceful life, until

<span id="s271">For each piano lesson she would write in the date, what was my next assignment and at the bottom was a mark from each lesson.</span> <span id="s272">If I had a A or a B, it was all right.</span> <span id="s273">If I had a C, I was licked.</span> <span id="s274">And yet, she was my best friend.</span> <span id="s275">When I grew up, she was my best friend.</span> <span id="s276">When I got married, it was already 1940.</span> <span id="s277">Times were starting to be very bad, I discovered that I’m pregnant, and I went to my mother and I said, Mother, I am pregnant.</span> <span id="s278">She didn’t – she didn’t bat an eyelid.</span> <span id="s279">She said, then we have to get an abortion.</span> <span id="s280">She went with me.</span> <span id="s281">She got the doctor.</span> <span id="s282">In Poland, to get an abortion is like to spit.</span> <span id="s283">As long you have enough money, no problem.</span> <span id="s284">She got the women doctor and another doctor who was present.</span> <span id="s285">She took me there.</span> <span id="s286">I got an abortion.</span> <span id="s287">She says, you cannot have a baby now.</span> <span id="s288">And if I had that baby, I wouldn’t have survived, that’s for sure.</span> <span id="s289">And after that she said to me, you can rest for 10 minutes, then we walk back home.</span> <span id="s290">And we walked home, and on the way there she must have seen that I was tired.</span> <span id="s291">She said – we passed an ice cream parlor and she says, would you like some ice cream?</span> <span id="s292">So we sat down.</span> <span id="s293">She was a very smart woman.</span> <span id="s294">She treated me to the ice cream, then she took me home.</span> <span id="s295">Walking, mind you.</span> <span id="s296">And then, when we came home, she said, Father must not know about it.</span> <span id="s297">You go now, undress and go to bed and lie down.</span> <span id="s298">But at dinnertime I want you dressed, sitting at the table, eating dinner with your father.</span> <span id="s299">And this is exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s300">He never knew that.</span> <span id="s301">He was much more sentimental that she was.</span> <span id="s302">She was a very great realist.</span> <span id="s303">She knew what is going on.</span> <span id="s304">Very smart woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: What was her family name?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Weitz.</span> <span id="s307">W – w-e-i-t-z, Weitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Hitler came into power in 1933 and you were 16 years old then.</span> <span id="s309">Did – when did you first hear of him?</span> <span id="s310">Were you aware of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: It’s funny, I wasn’t aware of it at all.</span> <span id="s312">I mean, I knew he is in Germany, but we were – this seemed so far away.</span> <span id="s313">Total – we were totally not concerned about it.</span> <span id="s314">Even in ’38 I wasn’t concerned about it.</span> <span id="s315">In ’39, when he finally attacked Poland, this is when I realized that very hard times are coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: So, up to September 1939, your life went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Was very peaceful, very peaceful.</span> <span id="s318">I met my husband when I was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s319">I had a cousin who lived in Lvov.</span> <span id="s320">She was a perpetual matchmaker.</span> <span id="s321">And she probably figured out, here is that boy who – he was a – kind of tutoring children on the upper floor where she lived, and she thought he was a very nice boy, she liked him.</span> <span id="s322">And here I have that cousin of mine who is 14, let me introduce them to each other.</span> <span id="s323">And she did that.</span> <span id="s324">She invited me for – for Pesach, to come and visit with her, and I did.</span> <span id="s325">And I went there and she introduced me to that boy.</span> <span id="s326">And he – the first thing he asked me was to go for a walk in the park with him.</span> <span id="s327">And I forgot my gloves and my hands were very cold, and I was always preoccupied about my hands because of the piano.</span> <span id="s328">So we were walking in the park and he took my hands into his hands and he say – he was – see, he said to me, I will always keep you warm.</span> <span id="s329">He was ready to go to medical school, and there was innumerous clauses in Poland, as you know.</span> <span id="s330">And as his brother lived in Italy, in Genoa, and was a very known dentist, he was ready to go to his brother to study medicine.</span> <span id="s331">So when – he took me to the train when I left, brought me some flowers, and I came home and my father said, what are those flowers from?</span> <span id="s332">And I said, well, a boy gave it to me.</span> <span id="s333">My father said, throw it away.</span> <span id="s334">He went to Genoa and he wrote letters to me, and of course I wasn’t allowed to date anyhow, so there was no danger of my dating, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: You’re still 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: I am 14.</span> <span id="s337">And for vacation he came to Poland, so he came to us to visit us.</span> <span id="s338">And my mother was absolutely crazy about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: His name?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Julian.</span> <span id="s341">He was – he was her ideal.</span> <span id="s342">He was very well dressed, very sophisticated, it seemed to her.</span> <span id="s343">And my father would say, well, it seems he is a nice boy, but – there was always a but – you are too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: He would come to school to wait for me and my girlfriends were so jealous.</span> <span id="s345">But of course I didn’t date anybody else, and – and it – I waited for him seven years.</span> <span id="s346">Oh, I – one didn’t get married, not unless your husband can support you.</span> <span id="s347">So I waited for him seven years.</span> <span id="s348">And then he came to Poland in 1938, and he was stuck; 1939 the war started.</span> <span id="s349">So that’s where our tragedy started.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: So wha – when did you get married, what date?</span> <span id="s351">A: In 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: What date?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: In Lvov, by a rabbi, in a rabbi’s home.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Yeah, what – what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: What month?</span> <span id="s356">In May.</span> <span id="s357">May 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: So, up to – so through the 30’s, you went on with your education –</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: – and your music and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Oh, absol –</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: And you were in touch with Julian?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s364">We wrote – he wrote letters and I answered him letters.</span> <span id="s365">And I – I felt very comfortable with his family.</span> <span id="s366">I – I really fitted very well with his cousins, his aunts, his parents, I liked them very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Did he – did he talk about what was happening in Germany at all?</span> <span id="s368">Was he aware?</span> <span id="s369">A: He didn’t talk much about it.</span> <span id="s370">No, he was in Italy, having a very good time, living with his brother and sister-in-law in a beautiful apartment.</span> <span id="s371">So, we didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s372">It seemed so remote at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Had you heard about Kristallnacht in November 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s375">Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: What were your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: But this was in Germany, you know, it wouldn’t come to us, it was there.</span> <span id="s378">That’s what we thought.</span> <span id="s379">It’s funny, nobody realized what is going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Did you feel very Jewish then?</span> <span id="s381">I mean, these terrible things were happening to Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Absolutely, absolutely, very Jewish, very Jewish.</span> <span id="s383">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And you – did you feel under threat because you were Jewish at that time, in ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Not in Poland.</span> <span id="s386">And if – and it’s funny because Julian was living in Italy, where Mussolini was at that time.</span> <span id="s387">But this was before he – he w – formed the friendship with Hitler.</span> <span id="s388">And Mussolini at the time was very nice to Jews there.</span> <span id="s389">He changed later.</span> <span id="s390">So, in 19 – you know, Przemyśl has quite a past in politics.</span> <span id="s391">It’s – it’s not – not a – I don’t think a lot of people know about it.</span> <span id="s392">But in 1939, the Germans came from the west, the Russians from the east, and this is where they met, in Przemyśl.</span> <span id="s393">The river was the border.</span> <span id="s394">And it stayed like that for almost a year, until 1940.</span> <span id="s395">And then I – at that time I lived in Lvov with my husband, we got married and I lived there in the beginning.</span> <span id="s396">But my father was telling me later that one night, without any preparation or anything, they were not aware that it’s coming.</span> <span id="s397">They started shooting at each other, the Germans and the Russians, and it was in my town.</span> <span id="s398">And my father said it was the most heroic shooting that he has ever witnessed.</span> <span id="s399">For some reason, the Russians must have gotten an order to just leave it and pull back.</span> <span id="s400">So they did.</span> <span id="s401">As a consequence the – the Germans occupied the whole city.</span> <span id="s402">And that’s when the trouble started.</span> <span id="s403">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Lena Jurand.</span> <span id="s405">This is tape number one, side B. Let’s talk about when the war started.</span> <span id="s406">The Germans came into your town September 14th, 1939.</span> <span id="s407">Wer – were you there then, and if so, what were your thou – your memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: In 1939 they came to my town, but occupied only one part of the town.</span> <span id="s409">There’s the center river, was the border.</span> <span id="s410">The other side was occupied by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: What – what side were you on?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: On the Russian side.</span> <span id="s413">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: And you were in the town at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: What do you remember from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Wait, wa-was I in the town?</span> <span id="s418">Let me think about it.</span> <span id="s419">No, that’s not correct, I was living in Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: When did you move to Lvov?</span> <span id="s421">A: I – I was in Lvov because I married my husband there in 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: But you married in – mar-married in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: In 1940, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: We’re talking about September ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yes, why was I in Lvov?</span> <span id="s426">Maybe I was in Przemyśl, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s427">I know only that the war was, without – without pity, without – without any – they were so – the Russians were fighting beautifully, but they had an order to leave the whole city and move back.</span> <span id="s428">So they left the city and the Germans consequently moved in.</span> <span id="s429">And this is when trouble started.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: What was your first impressions of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Well, I didn't – I really didn’t realize what is going on.</span> <span id="s432">At first I saw some simple soldiers in the city, the SS didn’t move in yet.</span> <span id="s433">And it was relatively peaceful in the beginning.</span> <span id="s434">They didn't start right away with the ghetto, the ghetto was formed much later.</span> <span id="s435">But my father was very depressed, he probably felt that it’s going to be very hard.</span> <span id="s436">And the first thing they did is to choose a Judenrat.</span> <span id="s437">You know what a Judenrat is?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: The Jewish council.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: The Jewish council.</span> <span id="s440">And my father was chosen as one of those.</span> <span id="s441">So we always thought that because he is a part of the Judenrat he is relatively safe.</span> <span id="s442">The first thing that I remember is that we were sitting in our apartment, it was – we were not in the ghetto yet, there was no ghetto yet.</span> <span id="s443">And a few German soldiers knocked at our door and I came to the door.</span> <span id="s444">And my father was sitting in the dining room at the table.</span> <span id="s445">They didn’t see him.</span> <span id="s446">And I came to the door and they ask me whether there are any men in the house?</span> <span id="s447">And I said no, it’s just me and my mother.</span> <span id="s448">And they looked at me, they – they thought about it for a moment, and they left.</span> <span id="s449">They didn’t go in.</span> <span id="s450">Had they gone in they probably would have taken my father, that was the first time I saved him.</span> <span id="s451">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: You are 22 years old now –</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yes, I was 22 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: – in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: And my father used to say, I don’t know, I don’t like it, I don’t like it at all.</span> <span id="s456">They come to the Judenrat and they ask for a lot of money.</span> <span id="s457">You know, they wanted money from the members of the Judenrat and you had to collect the money to give it to them to pacify them.</span> <span id="s458">And then my father came home one day and said, I think we are going to move to a ghetto.</span> <span id="s459">They are forming a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Were there many refugees from other parts of Poland in Tremisz(ph) by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Not by then.</span> <span id="s462">They came later.</span> <span id="s463">They formed the ghetto on the other side of the city, which was not primarily Jewish.</span> <span id="s464">In other words, it was not occupied by Jews.</span> <span id="s465">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Well, that was a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: That was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Yeah, let’s, before we get to the ghetto –</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: – let’s talk about the – what the conditions were.</span> <span id="s471">Up t – in the late 30’s what were you doing?</span> <span id="s472">You were still going to that music school?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes, I was going to the music school.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: You were going to the music school all the way up to the time of the war starting?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: No.</span> <span id="s476">There was one year when I took off.</span> <span id="s477">I forgot to tell you about it.</span> <span id="s478">I – I ask my father permission.</span> <span id="s479">I wanted to study cosmetology in Lvov, as I had that cousin and I could have stayed with her.</span> <span id="s480">It took a year.</span> <span id="s481">My father was terribly against it, he said, you want to become a hairdresser?</span> <span id="s482">I said, no, as a hairdresser, I want to study cosmetology.</span> <span id="s483">Well, he said all right.</span> <span id="s484">So I went to Lvov and I spent a whole year there.</span> <span id="s485">And that was in 1938.</span> <span id="s486">And it was a very happy year, very nice year.</span> <span id="s487">I worked there and my – when my husband would come for occasion, he would teach me about skin layers, because he was – he was a medical student, so he knew more than I did.</span> <span id="s488">And I spent that year in Lvov, and then I came back home.</span> <span id="s489">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: So now the German – now you’re back in Tremisz(ph) and the ger –</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: The Germans, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: – the Germans, and how did your life change then, when the Germans first came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Well, it became, first of all, much more complicated, because there was a struggle for food.</span> <span id="s494">There was a struggle for – the insecurity, especially was very, very, very – I mean, you didn’t know what’s going to happen the next day.</span> <span id="s495">They constantly had different orders, especially with the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s496">I used to help out in the Judenrat, my father asked me to come and do some work there.</span> <span id="s497">So I would sit there and I would watch them.</span> <span id="s498">But this was relatively s – quiet the first year.</span> <span id="s499">When it became really bad was when they formed the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: What about your father’s business?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Oh, he closed his business.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: He closed his business when the Russians occupied our part of – of the city, because he was afraid that they might send him to Siberia, God forbid.</span> <span id="s504">So people who owned businesses closed them most of the – most of the time they were closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: So how did he make any money?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Well, he sat home and he was sewing himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: And doing what with the clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: He became a talor – a tailor again, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Was he a Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Was he a Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: No.</span> <span id="s513">He was very much against Zionism.</span> <span id="s514">You know, I had terrible discussions with my father.</span> <span id="s515">I was very much in favor of Israel, state of Israel forming, and my father did not.</span> <span id="s516">He said – and I very often think of his words, he said, the Arab state will never let Israel exist.</span> <span id="s517">Israel doesn’t stand a chance, he said to me, and I was very angry with him.</span> <span id="s518">I said, how can you say that?</span> <span id="s519">He says, that’s the truth, why don’t you face it?</span> <span id="s520">So now whenever something happens in Israel, I think of my father, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Whe – when did you decide to get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Well, when Julian came back from Italy in 1938, end of 1938, beginning of 1939, we started thinking about it, and eventually we thought, well he is here, he doesn’t – he has no chance to leave the country and go somewhere else.</span> <span id="s523">We – in the beginning we thought we will get married and then we will go to Italy or whe – where his brother was.</span> <span id="s524">But his brother, when Mussolini made the pact with Hitler, his brother felt that it’s time to leave.</span> <span id="s525">So the only country that gave him a visa was Australia and he went to s – to Brisbane, which we visited him about 10 years ago, we were there.</span> <span id="s526">Yeah, he was a very – he was – he was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s527">His – his brother was – was a marvelous man.</span> <span id="s528">And so we decided to get married, and in the beginning when we got married, we lived in Lvov a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Tell me about your wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: It was by Rabbi Levin.</span> <span id="s531">He was a – he was not an Orthodox rabbi, he was a – what do you call him?</span> <span id="s532">Not Reformed.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Liberal?</span> <span id="s534">Traditional?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Con – yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s536">It was at his home.</span> <span id="s537">And I had – my father made me a suit, a blue suit, and I had a white hat with a veil.</span> <span id="s538">And we had the reception at his parents’ home, which was a small apartment, just family.</span> <span id="s539">It was nice, it was really very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Was it influenced by the fact that the war had started?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Yes, absolutely, absolutely, otherwise it would have been probably much larger, much bigger wedding, but – and we lived in a small apartment in – in Lvov, when one day my father decided that it’s very dangerous in Lvov to be there and we have to come to Przemyśl.</span> <span id="s542">And he sent a – a truck with some soldiers, I don’t know, he paid them probably, I don’t know where he found them.</span> <span id="s543">And they came to get us, and we went to Przemyśl.</span> <span id="s544">And in Przemysl we lived with them until they formed a ghetto, then we moved to their apartment in the ghetto, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Did you notice any Jews being rounded up at any time?</span> <span id="s546">I’m talking about before they got out, was f –</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: In Przemysl?</span> <span id="s548">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s550">Not.</span> <span id="s551">They didn’t make any aktions, as they called it, until they formed a ghetto, because they had them all together.</span> <span id="s552">You see, it was much easier for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Did you have any restrictions when you were seeing your husband?</span> <span id="s554">Privacy restrictions because conditions had been changed – before you got married, before you got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Restrictions in what?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Well, because it was wartime, you didn’t get married til 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s558">Not really –</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Did that limit your relationship with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: No, my mother – my mother limited my relationship with him.</span> <span id="s561">She was – she – she was wonderful with him, she loved him dearly.</span> <span id="s562">And no, no, I didn't have any special restrictions.</span> <span id="s563">But we were brought up this way, that we didn’t have any relationships unless we were married, contrary what is now.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: But you would say that at that time you wanted to get married, and so you were optimistic about what the world situation –</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: You didn't sense danger at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: We didn’t sense, no, we didn’t s – we didn’t feel that danger coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Even in May 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Even in May 1940, because we were – it was relatively peaceful.</span> <span id="s570">There were not all those murders, all those concen – we didn't hear about concentration camps until later.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: So, the German reoccupied the city in June of ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And you said this – then your father was a member of the Judenrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Did he talk about it – is it a Dr. Duldig?</span> <span id="s576">Did he talk about the head of the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Ig-Ignatz Duldig.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Oh – oh yes, he talked about it.</span> <span id="s580">And they used to go to meetings and things like that, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: You had talked about trying to raise money.</span> <span id="s582">What else did your father tell you about the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Well, they came with all kinds of requirements to the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s584">And the Judenrat has to comply.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Was your father very upset?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Very upset, very often very upset, yes.</span> <span id="s587">But ne –</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: How did he handle it?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: He couldn’t do it – think about it.</span> <span id="s590">How do you handle it?</span> <span id="s591">You appease the – the enemy.</span> <span id="s592">That’s the only way you could handle it.</span> <span id="s593">Until that night when they took the 1,000 boys from the ghetto, but there’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: And did you have to hand over any of your valuables, or did your parents have to?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Well, I remember – I remember that we had a beautiful dining room set still.</span> <span id="s596">And I remember a German woman came with a soldier looking at that apartment.</span> <span id="s597">And she said to him, I want that table.</span> <span id="s598">There was a very beautiful tablecloth on the table, so my mother tried to take it off and she said no, the tablecloth goes with the table.</span> <span id="s599">And they took it.</span> <span id="s600">In other words, they could come in your house, your apartment and whatever they – they liked, they could take.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: What was your reaction to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: I don’t really remember my reaction.</span> <span id="s603">I was shocked probably, but – I couldn’t understand it how somebody – my – my mother was much, much broadminded about it.</span> <span id="s604">She says, as long they take the table, it’s all right, as long it doesn’t concern the people.</span> <span id="s605">Which was smart.</span> <span id="s606">I wasn’t so smart at that time.</span> <span id="s607">But, in other words, they could do, those wives of the officers, or SS or whatever, could come to you and take whatever they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Did you have to give up anything personal to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: My personal things?</span> <span id="s610">Well, they – they did take jewelry yes, yes, I remember that.</span> <span id="s611">But I – I have very vague impressions about that.</span> <span id="s612">Not until we came to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: What about the other anti-Jewish measures that the Germans put into effect, did you have to wear an armband with the Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, we wore an armband with the Jewish star.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: You know, it’s funny, nothing.</span> <span id="s617">Nothing, because we all wore it.</span> <span id="s618">This didn’t matter at all to us.</span> <span id="s619">And then when we were in the ghetto, of course, it was very important that you do – do some work, that you do something that might justify your existence, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: What did the armband look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: It was a white armband about that wide, and it had a – a blue St-Star of David on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: And you always wore it?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: When you go out of the ghetto, yes, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: And even before the ghetto you –</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Even before the ghetto, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: And did you register at all, as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s628">Well, the Judenrat did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Did you have special papers and special identity cards before the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: That I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s631">I am trying to remember whether I had, I – must have been some special identification card, but I don’t remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: When all – when conditions started changing and these measures came in, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: – did you talk to this – talk about this among your friends, other young women your age, contemporaries?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: You know, I keep thinking about – are you talking about ghetto years?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: No, before.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: When things started to tighten up, and – and restrictions came.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: The only person I talked about it to was my mother.</span> <span id="s640">I don’t remember talking to any girlfriends.</span> <span id="s641">I don’t remember any girlfriend – Jewish girlfriends.</span> <span id="s642">Yes, I had one girlfriend who visited me in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s643">I don’t know what happened to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Okay, now it’s 1942, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: That’s a bad year.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s647">In June things started to get bad, a thousand –</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: – a thousand men were sent to Janowska camp from Tremisz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Were you – did you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yes, we knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: What did you hear and how did you react?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: From – from my father, from the Judenrat, of course.</span> <span id="s655">He was very depressed at that time.</span> <span id="s656">He knew that we are losing it, and there was not a thing we could do about it.</span> <span id="s657">At the time when – are you talking about the ghetto years?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Yeah, immediately before, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Immediately before.</span> <span id="s660">Immediately before, we – we received an announcement that we all have to move to this part of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: This is July, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Right.</span> <span id="s663">And – and we had to find a place to live there, which we did for – my father found an apartment for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: You we – you and your husband were living with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Yes, yes, with my parents, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Was that always the case once you were married?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: No.</span> <span id="s668">No, in the beginning when we lived in Lvov, we had a little apartment.</span> <span id="s669">When we moved to Przemyśl we lived with them.</span> <span id="s670">And then, when we moved to the ghetto, we decided to get his parents from Lvov.</span> <span id="s671">So my father managed to send somebody and they brought them to Przemyśl and we found them a little apartment on the same floor where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Where was your apartment in the ghetto, on what street?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: I don’t remember the name of the street.</span> <span id="s674">It’s funny.</span> <span id="s675">It was a part of city that I never went to.</span> <span id="s676">I know you had to cross a – a bridge over the – the train station, was a bridge you ca – you had to cross the bridge and it was – it was a – a lower standard part of the city.</span> <span id="s677">And they built a f – a fence there.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Was this a wooden – a wooden fence?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: No, it was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Brick?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: – brick.</span> <span id="s682">Brick fence.</span> <span id="s683">And they moved the Judenrat there, of course, and we moved there.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Let’s talk about your – your living conditions in your apartment.</span> <span id="s685">How large was the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: The apartment in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s687">It was two rooms and a kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: For the four of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: For the four of us, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: What did you bring with you yourself when you went into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Well, we had beds.</span> <span id="s692">We had a bedroom set, my parents’ bedroom set, and there was one set for us.</span> <span id="s693">Not set, really, beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: H-How did you bring that?</span> <span id="s695">On a truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: I – I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s697">Must have been a truck, but a – must – probably my father arranged it.</span> <span id="s698">I don’t remember this.</span> <span id="s699">And then when his parents came, they had a one bedroom apartment on the same floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: What did you bring with you personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Very little, really.</span> <span id="s702">I don’t even remember.</span> <span id="s703">I don’t remember being troubled by changing my clothes or – or – or not having enough clothing.</span> <span id="s704">I must have had enough, I always had enough.</span> <span id="s705">But – but I remember very little about it, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Did you bring anything specially personal with you, that meant – that had sentimental value?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: No.</span> <span id="s708">I don’t remember that either.</span> <span id="s709">The only thing – I know that my husband, who was always a very particular dresser, and I know that I was standing there, and I had an ironing board and an iron and I would iron his pants, because he wouldn’t wear it otherwise.</span> <span id="s710">But I – I really don’t remember being involved in – or worrying about what I’m going to wear.</span> <span id="s711">This was so immaterial at the time.</span> <span id="s712">It was not important at all.</span> <span id="s713">That’s funny.</span> <span id="s714">And yet, he and I, both of us, worked outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s715">It is a very important part of my life.</span> <span id="s716">We worked in a place called – do you know German?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: No, but that’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Enklausungstella(ph).</span> <span id="s719">It was a place where they have specia – they had special machines where they brought uniforms from the front, full of lice and other things and they put them through those machines to disinfect them, to clean them.</span> <span id="s720">We would march out every morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: We being who?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Julian and I.</span> <span id="s723">He was with a group of men, I was with the women.</span> <span id="s724">And we had the armbands and we were not allowed to walk where people walked, but we had to go where the cars and th – the horses were going, in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s725">And they would take us every morning out of the ghetto, to that place where we spend the whole day, and in the evening they would – in the af – late afternoon they would bring us back.</span> <span id="s726">The reason why this is important is because there was one German – I cannot talk about it – about him without crying – whom I was so grateful to.</span> <span id="s727">The director of that camp, he was not a Nazi, he was a newspaperman from Berlin.</span> <span id="s728">He was lovely.</span> <span id="s729">He said to me – he was always address me the German way, Frau Doktor, because in German language, the woman gets the title of her husband, if he is a doctor.</span> <span id="s730">So he would come to me and he would say, I am so ashamed, I am so embarrassed, but I know I am being watched.</span> <span id="s731">And according to their rules, if somebody was caught stealing something, what could you steal something there?</span> <span id="s732">A dirty pair of socks or a dirty pair of pants.</span> <span id="s733">He has to give them public beating.</span> <span id="s734">So one day he came to me and he said – there was a 15 year old boy there working, and he was caught stealing the pair of socks, and he says, I am supposed to give him a public licking.</span> <span id="s735">Tell him to scream as loud as he can.</span> <span id="s736">I will not hurt him, but I have to pretend that I am doing it, I have been watched.</span> <span id="s737">I know I am being watched.</span> <span id="s738">So I did that.</span> <span id="s739">He didn’t let me work with the – with the uniforms.</span> <span id="s740">He says, you are not going to work there.</span> <span id="s741">You stay in the kitchen and peel potatoes.</span> <span id="s742">And to this day I cannot peel potatoes without turning my head away.</span> <span id="s743">When the SS would drop in sometimes, if they didn’t have any theater or any recreation they thought that they will go, and all the women, young or old, had to undress as God has made them.</span> <span id="s744">Totally naked.</span> <span id="s745">Stand in the row – I have seen it, and if – they would look them over, and if they didn’t like a pair of breasts, they would hit with the whip.</span> <span id="s746">Anyway they didn’t like the back, they would hit in the back.</span> <span id="s747">He would come running to the kitchen and say to me, you don’t go there.</span> <span id="s748">I will hide you and you can take a shower whenever you feel like it.</span> <span id="s749">And somebody could have thought that maybe there was a special interest in him in me, and it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s750">He was – he was as much dedicated to my husband as he was to me.</span> <span id="s751">He said to me one day, my parents have a farm near Berlin, and I’m making some papers for you so you could go there and spend the rest of the war there working on that farm.</span> <span id="s752">Then somebody gave him out, that he’s too good to the Jews.</span> <span id="s753">And one day they sent him out to the front, to the Russian front.</span> <span id="s754">And the first thing I did when I got out of hiding, I tried to find out what has happened to him.</span> <span id="s755">And I found a boy who was with him, and he told me that he was killed at the Russian front.</span> <span id="s756">I still remember his last name, Burba, b-u-r-b-a.</span> <span id="s757">He was a newspaperman.</span> <span id="s758">He was so nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: How old a man was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: I would say 26 maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: He was young?</span> <span id="s762">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: And what was his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: I don’t remember his first name, just the last name.</span> <span id="s765">He was very nice.</span> <span id="s766">He wasn’t nice only to me, he was nice to everybody.</span> <span id="s767">He really felt – he was embarrassed.</span> <span id="s768">He was very nice.</span> <span id="s769">It shows you that even among them, you could find somebody who was nice.</span> <span id="s770">So we worked there, day after day after day until – until they made another aktion, as they call it, they tried to get people.</span> <span id="s771">And I had a cousin, a young girl, who was supposed to go to the train.</span> <span id="s772">And my in-laws were supposed to go to the train.</span> <span id="s773">My husband couldn’t make himself take them, so I took them.</span> <span id="s774">I took them to the train.</span> <span id="s775">Of course, rumors were – we knew where they are going.</span> <span id="s776">They had to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: How did you know – how did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Rumors.</span> <span id="s779">Rumors started that there is a concentration camp, that they gas people.</span> <span id="s780">But we all believed that maybe it was exaggeration.</span> <span id="s781">You know, nobody wants to believe that.</span> <span id="s782">So I took them to the train and it was started to rain.</span> <span id="s783">And my mother-in-law had beautiful, heavy hair.</span> <span id="s784">She didn’t wear anything, and I had a s – some scarf around my neck.</span> <span id="s785">So I took it off and put it on her.</span> <span id="s786">And she – she – she embraced me and she said, you tell – tell my son that I said you will survive the war.</span> <span id="s787">I loved my mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s788">She was the sweetest woman.</span> <span id="s789">The nicest person.</span> <span id="s790">I never heard a word of criticism from her to any of her daughters-in-law.</span> <span id="s791">She was lovely.</span> <span id="s792">So, that was it.</span> <span id="s793">That must have been in the summer of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Right, this is – we’re talking about July ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s796">Must have been maybe later.</span> <span id="s797">While we were – funny how it happens in life.</span> <span id="s798">While we were working in that Enklausungstella(ph), Polish woman – women used to come there to buy some bargains from the Jewish women.</span> <span id="s799">We were not allowed to carry anything in our hands.</span> <span id="s800">So what we did is, I know I had all my – my beautiful pure silk nightgowns, hand embroidered, which I didn’t need.</span> <span id="s801">I used to put one on top of another on myself, and this way I could carry it with me.</span> <span id="s802">And that Polish woman, whose husband worked in that camp, because some Polish – Polish people worked in the camp when they were mechanics or they did something with the machines.</span> <span id="s803">Her husband worked there, she would come there.</span> <span id="s804">And one day we were conducting a transaction, I was selling her my nightgowns, she was buying that.</span> <span id="s805">And mind you, she was a total stranger to me.</span> <span id="s806">And I was young.</span> <span id="s807">And she would say – she said suddenly to me, my God, you are so young, and you are so pretty – I was pretty at the time – and I feel so sorry for you.</span> <span id="s808">If you want to hide, come to me.</span> <span id="s809">I was flabbergasted.</span> <span id="s810">I says, do you realize what you are saying?</span> <span id="s811">Do you know that if you are caught, they put you to death?</span> <span id="s812">She said, I don’t care, I’m not afraid.</span> <span id="s813">She was the happy-go-lucky type.</span> <span id="s814">That was our luck.</span> <span id="s815">Well, from that day on, Julian tried to find out where they lived.</span> <span id="s816">And they lived on the other side of the city, quite a distance from us.</span> <span id="s817">Her husband would come every evening to the ghetto – is it working?</span> <span id="s818">– to the ghetto wall, and Julian would make a package of our things, and through the Jewish policeman give it to him, and he would take that home.</span> <span id="s819">So, we thought, in case we would have to go and hide, we will have some things there.</span> <span id="s820">And that was going on for some while, until November ’42, when the – when the rumors started to circulate that there will be a new aktion and they will take people.</span> <span id="s821">That day Julian said, this time we are not going to give anything, we are going out.</span> <span id="s822">My father wasn’t home, because if my father had been home, he would never let me go.</span> <span id="s823">So my mother said to me, you go better before your father come home – comes home.</span> <span id="s824">We left, it was getting darker, and you know, we had a curfew hour.</span> <span id="s825">So we had to be – go out before the curfew.</span> <span id="s826">And as we were going down the stairs to go out – there was no light in the stairway at the time, it was dark – I heard my father’s footsteps, he was coming up.</span> <span id="s827">And this stands with me, all those years, I still dream of that.</span> <span id="s828">And th – my first impulse was to go to him, but Julian was behind me and he stopped me.</span> <span id="s829">And I let my father pass me, and I didn't say goodbye to him.</span> <span id="s830">That was the – the worst thing, I think, in my life.</span> <span id="s831">But before we go to that, I – I have to step back, before I tell you a –</span></p> <p><span id="s832">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collent – collection interview with Lena Jurand.</span> <span id="s834">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Well, there was one requirement of the SS.</span> <span id="s836">One day they came to the Judenrat, and they required in a very specific way, they wanted the Judenrat members to do their dirty work.</span> <span id="s837">They needed 1,000 boys, age 12 to 16 being taken from homes.</span> <span id="s838">And that was the only time I saw my father crying.</span> <span id="s839">I opened the door, he was standing there crying, and I said, what happened?</span> <span id="s840">And he was telling me, and I said to him, if they want 1,000 boys, you have to give them – them 1,000 boys.</span> <span id="s841">And he said to me, how can you say that, you are my daughter, how can – how can I go to one mother saying, you son will go, and the other mother, your son will stay?</span> <span id="s842">Am I God?</span> <span id="s843">I said, you have to do it, because if you don’t do it, you know what will happen.</span> <span id="s844">The Nazis will take this – this 1,000 boys, but they will shoot another 1,000 on the way.</span> <span id="s845">And he said, you are right.</span> <span id="s846">And they let them have 1,000 boys during that particular night.</span> <span id="s847">Nobody slept, of course.</span> <span id="s848">Of course the boys were never seen again.</span> <span id="s849">And I went out in the morning, about six o’clock in the morning, outside.</span> <span id="s850">There was not a living soul, nothing.</span> <span id="s851">Total stillness.</span> <span id="s852">There was not a bird, not a wind, not a breeze, nothing.</span> <span id="s853">I went into a rage, and I looked up and I said God damn you, wherever you are.</span> <span id="s854">This is not the God I want.</span> <span id="s855">I don’t want any part of you.</span> <span id="s856">And what’s more, I don’t want you to save me.</span> <span id="s857">That was one thing.</span> <span id="s858">As you see, it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s859">The other thing was, one day they let me know that the SS came to the Judenrat and took all the members of the Judenrat to the train.</span> <span id="s860">And I went wild.</span> <span id="s861">So I ran to the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s862">We didn't live far away, and I had some friends there, and they said to me, don’t go in.</span> <span id="s863">He is a wild animal.</span> <span id="s864">He just shot some people, he will shoot you.</span> <span id="s865">And I couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s866">I went in.</span> <span id="s867">I didn’t knock at the door, I just opened the door, and I can still see him as is it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s868">He was the most beautiful young man I have ever seen.</span> <span id="s869">Very tall, very blonde, very Nordic looking, with blue eyes like two blue ice cubes.</span> <span id="s870">And he was leaning on the desk holding in one hand, in the right hand, he had a – a gun that was obviously shot a short time ago, in the other a whip.</span> <span id="s871">I opened the door, he didn’t even look at me.</span> <span id="s872">And I didn’t – didn’t say anything, I was just standing there.</span> <span id="s873">He said to me, what do you want?</span> <span id="s874">In German.</span> <span id="s875">So I answered in German.</span> <span id="s876">I said, I came to inquire about my father.</span> <span id="s877">And I tell him he is a member of the Judenrat and I hear that he was taken.</span> <span id="s878">He still didn’t look at me.</span> <span id="s879">He wasn't interested at all in what I was saying.</span> <span id="s880">What puzzled him was that I used such a good German language.</span> <span id="s881">That impressed him.</span> <span id="s882">He said to me, where did you learn German so well?</span> <span id="s883">I said, well German was my best foreign language, I had it eight years in high school.</span> <span id="s884">And I – I really risk a lot, because I was getting fresh, and I said, would you like me to recite you some Goethe?</span> <span id="s885">Then he looked at me and he said, what about your father?</span> <span id="s886">I said, well, I hear he is on the train going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s887">He called two germ – two Jewish policemen and he said, where is that man?</span> <span id="s888">So they told him he is on the train and they are going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s889">He said to me, you go home and wait.</span> <span id="s890">I promise you I will get your father.</span> <span id="s891">I didn’t have any other – I had to go.</span> <span id="s892">I came home, and all my neighbors were there and my mother.</span> <span id="s893">And when I told them, they said, don’t believe it.</span> <span id="s894">Nobody has ever come out of the train going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s895">And we waited and waited and was getting dark outside.</span> <span id="s896">About 10 o’clock at night we heard some footsteps.</span> <span id="s897">Two Jewish policemen brought my father home.</span> <span id="s898">Later I was told that they stopped the train on the way and they started calling his name Salzburg.</span> <span id="s899">My father was so fatumult that he didn’t even react to that.</span> <span id="s900">But somebody sitting next to him said to him, isn’t that your name?</span> <span id="s901">He said yes.</span> <span id="s902">So he got up and went out of the train and those two Jewish policemen brought him home.</span> <span id="s903">He was unconscious for about two days.</span> <span id="s904">He didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s905">After he got better and he realized that he is home, he took my hand, and he said thank you.</span> <span id="s906">So I gave him a – I gave him a-about a year of miserable life, but life.</span> <span id="s907">I still to this day don’t understand what made this German keep his word.</span> <span id="s908">It was puzzling to me.</span> <span id="s909">But he did.</span> <span id="s910">They stopped the train, actually.</span> <span id="s911">Nobody believed it.</span> <span id="s912">Those are the two things I wanted to tell you about our ghetto experience.</span> <span id="s913">Now, going back to coming out of the ghetto –</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Be-Be – before we do that, let’s talk a little bit about –</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: – life in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: You were there for three months, from July to November?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s921">What about food, did people have enough food at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Well, we had enough food, because first of all my father was a member of the Judenrat, and second we had money to buy the food.</span> <span id="s923">But there was a lot of poverty.</span> <span id="s924">There were – they were – you saw in the ghetto on the streets, people lying.</span> <span id="s925">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s926">Like you see some, there’s pictures now.</span> <span id="s927">There was – there was a lot of poverty.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: How large was the Judenrat, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: The Judenrat, how many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: 12.</span> <span id="s932">12 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: And you had said that you had worked there for a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Yeah, I worked – you know, keeping sc – ma – scores – names of people and things like that.</span> <span id="s935">Nothing that’s very important, just whenever they needed me, I did some work, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Was this in the ghetto or before the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: In the ghetto, in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s939">What did other people think of the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Well, what do they think?</span> <span id="s941">They probably resented it up to a certain extent, because whenever the Germans needed something, they went to the Judenrat, and it was a vicious circle, and the Judenrat had to accommodate them, to keep peace.</span> <span id="s942">They thought they would; of course, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s943">And also, everybody was resentful to a certain extent because they thought that the Judenrat is safe, and it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s944">It was just delaying it a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Did you know other people on the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Oh yes, there was – there was – we had a neighbor who was a – a doctor and her son was a lawyer, he was a member of that Judenrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: And what were their – what was that name?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Blech, b-l-e-c-h.</span> <span id="s949">They were good people, and I don’t think they survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: The first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s952">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: You said that your father was so upset when a thousand young boys –</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: – had to be chosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: – very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Was he involved in the actual choosing, in the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: No, no, they were not.</span> <span id="s959">A – anaj – where – I mean, my father was not, because he was too old probably for that.</span> <span id="s960">For that mission they usually send some Jewish policemen with – with somebody younger.</span> <span id="s961">Well, the Jewish policemen had to do their job.</span> <span id="s962">They thought that it – probably that they will save their life, which they didn’t, cause a vicious circle.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Ho-how did you know that you were supposed to work in this uniform factory?</span> <span id="s964">How did you hear about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: I don’t remember that, that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s966">I think it must have been through the Judenrat, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Did they post signs?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Yes, they did, they did, and I – I know that th – Julian worked as a physician there, in that camp, and I worked in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s969">And as I said, he was very nice.</span> <span id="s970">He really was nice.</span> <span id="s971">So they sent him away.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Now this is the German –</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: He was so nice that –</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: – newspaperman.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: – as poor as – as preoccupied as we were, when we heard that he has to leave and go to the front, we all gave money and bought him a golden ring.</span> <span id="s976">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s977">I remember that.</span> <span id="s978">Because he was nice to everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Wher-Where did they get the golden ring from?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Somewhere in the ghetto we bought it.</span> <span id="s981">I don’t – I don’t remember the details, I only know that we gave enough money to buy a ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: What did you talk about?</span> <span id="s983">When you would come back from work, exhausted I’m sure, in the ghetto –</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: – would you sit and talk to your parents or other people that you knew about what was happening, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: We talked very little.</span> <span id="s987">We talked very little because there was nothing good to talk about.</span> <span id="s988">I remember coming back from work.</span> <span id="s989">We were – we were six people in a row working.</span> <span id="s990">And I happened to be at the end of the row.</span> <span id="s991">And a Italian officer saw me and started walking alongside with me.</span> <span id="s992">And at that time I knew a little Italian, very little, from Julian.</span> <span id="s993">And he said something to me and I answered and he – he took out the package of cigarettes and wanted to treat me to some cigarettes and I says, I don’t smoke, but may I take it for my husband?</span> <span id="s994">And he gave it to me.</span> <span id="s995">So I remember that, but I only remember that he was very nice to us, and very apologetic.</span> <span id="s996">And that really, that man who was in charge, he felt – he felt guilty, although he di – he himself didn’t do anything, but he felt guilty for his fellow – for – for other people.</span> <span id="s997">And that’s – that’s so – is amazing that I remember still his last name.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Y-You told that very moving story about the little boy that he was supposed to beat, an-and –</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Beat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: – what did you say to this young man when you went to tell him?</span> <span id="s1001">A: I said that to him, I said, scream as loudly as you can.</span> <span id="s1002">He will make believe that he’s beat – giving you a beating, but he will not hurt you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: And did the boy believe you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1005">Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s1006">He did.</span> <span id="s1007">Because I was older, and I was working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1008">He did.</span> <span id="s1009">And I said to him, don’t steal any more, because you – you – it’s not worth it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Di-Di – were people forced to watch that beating?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Na – I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s1012">No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1013">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1014">Maybe some watched it because – out of curiosity, but I don’t think they were forced to watch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Did you talk to the other women in your group as you were marching to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s1017">Very little.</span> <span id="s1018">Because, first of all, we didn’t want to attract attention, probably.</span> <span id="s1019">You tried to be as impersonal as you possibly can.</span> <span id="s1020">It’s funny, there were some women with me in the kitchen working too, and I cannot remember them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: What did you do in the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Peeled potatoes all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Only?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1025">Because they were cooking you know, for the – for the workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Did they give you any food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Yes, yes, they gave us at lunch time – noontime, some meal, so they were – we were cooking potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: What did you eat for breakfast and dinner in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s1029">A: What did I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: What did you eat for breakfast and dinner in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1032">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1033">Probably the – I don’t think we ate any meat.</span> <span id="s1034">I don’t remember having meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: How was your health at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: You know, this is the most amazing thing.</span> <span id="s1037">When we were 22 months in hiding, when we went out of the ghetto, we bribed – Julian bribed a Jewish policeman, who probably bribed the other one, and they let us out.</span> <span id="s1038">They closed their eyes.</span> <span id="s1039">Julian went with him, with her husband, who led the way, and I was behind, walking.</span> <span id="s1040">And as we had to pass the Gestapo building on the way there.</span> <span id="s1041">There was no other way to go.</span> <span id="s1042">And there was a soldier standing, watching.</span> <span id="s1043">At a certain moment, when Julian was with him, he said, halt.</span> <span id="s1044">Stopped them.</span> <span id="s1045">So Julian said – first he thought he is going to ask for his papers, so he says, I have [speaks foreign language here] which means, I have a – I am allowed to walk after curfew.</span> <span id="s1046">He had that document.</span> <span id="s1047">He says [speaks foreign language], it’s not important.</span> <span id="s1048">Julian had a – what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1049">Not lantern.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Flashlight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Flashlight in his pocket and it just happened that the flashlight was on and the light was seeking through.</span> <span id="s1052">So he – that’s why he stopped him.</span> <span id="s1053">And he thought he – he is going to ask him for papers, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1054">That was one thing.</span> <span id="s1055">Then we came there.</span> <span id="s1056">Now, we came to hide, we were hidden for 22 months, from November to August ’44.</span> <span id="s1057">It was a kitchen, you entered, there was a little hall, and a pantry without the window.</span> <span id="s1058">That pantry was very important.</span> <span id="s1059">And then you entered the kitchen and there was one room behind the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1060">There was no separate entrance to the room, it had to be through the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1061">They lived all their lives, especially in the winter, in the kitchen, because there was the stove and it was warm.</span> <span id="s1062">She entertained German soldiers in that kitchen.</span> <span id="s1063">We were in the room.</span> <span id="s1064">We could not – can you imagine in 22 months you cannot sneeze, you cannot cough, you cannot say a lot of word, and you cannot make a – a loud step, and you cannot be sick.</span> <span id="s1065">We lived like that in that room for 22 months.</span> <span id="s1066">There was no toilet in that apartment.</span> <span id="s1067">In other words, if we wanted to use the facilities, you had to go a half a flight stairs down, and there was, probably for – for many people, there was the facility.</span> <span id="s1068">People have, when I talk to my granddaughter’s class about it, one boy got up and said, how did you do without a toilet?</span> <span id="s1069">I said, that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1070">There was a fire in th – in the stove, constantly, and that fire helped.</span> <span id="s1071">Whatever you had to burn, you burned.</span> <span id="s1072">And the rest you pour out down the drain.</span> <span id="s1073">So he was satisfied when I explained to him.</span> <span id="s1074">I said, believe me, it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s1075">Julian developed such a magnificent sense of hearing that he knew what was going on in the kitchen before I knew it.</span> <span id="s1076">From certain – he knew which – which place the floor was squeaking.</span> <span id="s1077">One time an electrical man came to check the electricity.</span> <span id="s1078">We didn't know he is coming.</span> <span id="s1079">And of course he had to come to the room.</span> <span id="s1080">So that was a – there was a mirror with a – a piece of furniture with a mirror standing in the corner, but cutting off that corner, so one could hide behind it.</span> <span id="s1081">Well Julian s – only heard the words, electricity, and he pointed to me to go behind that thing and he went under the bed.</span> <span id="s1082">And the room had to look always unoccupied, always.</span> <span id="s1083">He came in with her, and I heard her say [sighs].</span> <span id="s1084">And he looked at the ri – lamps or something, checked.</span> <span id="s1085">And when he left, she came in and she says, good work guys.</span> <span id="s1086">The first 10 months, because we accumulate a lot of things, of clothing in her house, she would sell it for us, and we would give her the money for the food.</span> <span id="s1087">Well, after 10 months, my things have run out, and I told her, we don’t have any money any more.</span> <span id="s1088">So she was – she was very good about it.</span> <span id="s1089">When he didn’t see, she would open the door and quickly push in a – a – a – some soup, let’s say, or some bread.</span> <span id="s1090">We ate very little, but whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1091">There was a window in that room that was overlooking a field, and a young girl would come every day with her cow to let the cow roam around.</span> <span id="s1092">And I wouldn’t stand at the window because I was afraid somebody might spot me.</span> <span id="s1093">So I would kneel at the window and look at her.</span> <span id="s1094">And I would say to Julian, what I wouldn’t give to be this cow.</span> <span id="s1095">I mean, people don’t know what it means.</span> <span id="s1096">22 months.</span> <span id="s1097">She worked for a German place.</span> <span id="s1098">She spoke German.</span> <span id="s1099">She didn’t know how to read it, but she spoke German, for some reason she did.</span> <span id="s1100">And once in awhile she would invite those German soldiers over for a party.</span> <span id="s1101">So I help her cook and bake.</span> <span id="s1102">And then we would hide in that pantry.</span> <span id="s1103">And she would give them enough to – drinks to make them half drunk, and they would lie down on her bed and sleep.</span> <span id="s1104">And when they were asleep, we would come in, go right near.</span> <span id="s1105">I looked at them when they were asleep, and go to other room.</span> <span id="s1106">When finally the war was almost over, there was a terrible fighting between the German and the Russian armies.</span> <span id="s1107">Terrible fighting.</span> <span id="s1108">The entire household went down to the basement, except us.</span> <span id="s1109">So we were sitting in the pantry, and Julian kept his hands over my ears so I wouldn’t hear that shooting.</span> <span id="s1110">When suddenly the shooting stopped, and I said to Julian, am I crazy, or did I hear a Russian words there?</span> <span id="s1111">At the moment when I said that, she opened the door and she said, you are free.</span> <span id="s1112">The Russians are here, you can go out.</span> <span id="s1113">There was no joy in me.</span> <span id="s1114">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1115">So I said – my reaction was, now I am going to sleep.</span> <span id="s1116">And I went to sleep without fear, once.</span> <span id="s1117">At least once without fear, and I slept 24 hours.</span> <span id="s1118">Julian went out right away.</span> <span id="s1119">I couldn’t make myself go out for about a week.</span> <span id="s1120">I was afraid to face the world.</span> <span id="s1121">So finally we went out, one Sunday afternoon.</span> <span id="s1122">Beautiful, sunny afternoon.</span> <span id="s1123">My town, where I was born, where I went to school, I didn’t know a living soul.</span> <span id="s1124">And as we were walking, I said to Julian, where are we going?</span> <span id="s1125">He says, I don’t know, let’s just walk.</span> <span id="s1126">And as we were walking a man approached us.</span> <span id="s1127">And he saw me, and he stood there and said, I don’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1128">Aren’t you Isadore Salzburg’s daughter?</span> <span id="s1129">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1130">Was a lawyer, Jewish lawyer.</span> <span id="s1131">Said to us, where are you going?</span> <span id="s1132">I said, I don’t know, we don’t have a place.</span> <span id="s1133">He says, come with me, I just opened an apartment, it belonged to a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1134">So we went with him.</span> <span id="s1135">There were no beds, but it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1136">I slept on the desk, Julian slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s1137">And this was our first apartment.</span> <span id="s1138">And from that day on, I was going out every day, looking for Jews that came out from hiding.</span> <span id="s1139">And our apartment was full of people in a very short time.</span> <span id="s1140">You were – you wouldn’t believe, we would spend entire evenings telling s – each other stories.</span> <span id="s1141">Of course, I didn’t have a penny to mours – to our soul.</span> <span id="s1142">So I – one day I saw a woman coming out of hiding, and I could recognize them coming out of hiding a mile away, there was something about the – the way they were walking, like we did.</span> <span id="s1143">And I – I saw that woman coming out of hiding, and she was a wife of a lawyer, her husband died.</span> <span id="s1144">And she came out of hiding, so I said, come with me.</span> <span id="s1145">We had a – a-an apartment full of people.</span> <span id="s1146">And she – the first thing she said to me, she took out some money, pocket money – paper money from her pocket and said, do you need any money?</span> <span id="s1147">It was so unimportant.</span> <span id="s1148">Here, have some.</span> <span id="s1149">And that was the first money we got.</span> <span id="s1150">Then Julian joined the army, Polish army as a – as a physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Be-Before we go on to that, I wanted to ask you a few more questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: What was the name of the family of the woman that you – that hid you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Maria Dambrowska(ph).</span> <span id="s1155">Her grandson is still alive in Przemyśl and I sent him money.</span> <span id="s1156">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1157">And my son graduated medical school, he decided to go to Poland for a visit.</span> <span id="s1158">He understands Polish, he speaks a little Polish.</span> <span id="s1159">He went to Przemyśl, she was still alive.</span> <span id="s1160">Of course, I gave him money for her.</span> <span id="s1161">And I was very curious what she will say.</span> <span id="s1162">When he came back I said, what did she say when she saw you?</span> <span id="s1163">He says, Mother, you wouldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1164">She put her arms around me and started to cry.</span> <span id="s1165">You know, that after we moved out to that apartment that the man gave us, she couldn’t stand it.</span> <span id="s1166">She moved out from her place and moved to the same house, to the same floor, opposite our apartment.</span> <span id="s1167">So she lived there with us again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: How did you know when you were in the ghetto that you could trust her when she made the offer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Of course I didn't know, but did – did we have any choice?</span> <span id="s1170">Was either that or being on the train.</span> <span id="s1171">Sooner or later.</span> <span id="s1172">I mean, is – it was inevitable that we will end on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: How did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: Because so many people went.</span> <span id="s1175">I mean, we couldn’t be an exception.</span> <span id="s1176">Maybe not sooner, maybe a little later.</span> <span id="s1177">I finally – you know I found out that my father was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Oh, I – I didn't tell you that.</span> <span id="s1180">As we were – as we were in hiding, one evening somebody came to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1181">We didn’t know who it was, we just heard the voice.</span> <span id="s1182">And we were – from what he said we could understand that he was a Jewish man who happened to know her, he knew her.</span> <span id="s1183">And you would always try to find a way, somebody who – who could help you.</span> <span id="s1184">So he thought he would go out of the ghetto and go to her place, maybe she can take him.</span> <span id="s1185">He didn’t know she had us.</span> <span id="s1186">I felt very guilty about that later.</span> <span id="s1187">And as he was sitting in the kitchen and talking to her, she asked him what happened to Mr. Salzburg?</span> <span id="s1188">And he says, oh, he was – he and his wife were taken on the train to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1189">And when Julian heard that he put both hands on my ears so I wouldn’t hear it, but I heard it.</span> <span id="s1190">So later – my mother went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1191">After the war, I met a boy who was with my father on the train, who survived Auschwitz, and he told me that on the way to Auschwitz the SS very often was making some – they tried to find people who had money, and people usually had some money with them.</span> <span id="s1192">So my father, who was very – a person that – that caught the eye, he asks him whether he has any money.</span> <span id="s1193">He said no.</span> <span id="s1194">He started sh – looking through his pockets and he found some money.</span> <span id="s1195">So he told him to go straight ahead and he shot him in the head.</span> <span id="s1196">At least he was saved Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1197">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1198">But she did accomplish quite a lot I must say, this woman.</span> <span id="s1199">Wasn’t easy to have two people hidden in a small apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Why do you think she did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: She didn’t do it for money, because after the war, when Julian joined the army, and the first money I got, I went to her, and I gave it to – I wanted to give it to her, she wouldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s1202">I think she really felt something for us.</span> <span id="s1203">I don’t know why, I don’t know – I don’t know the reason, really, but she felt something.</span> <span id="s1204">You know, to accomplish – to have 22 months with people where you can – and I told her, when she first told me – suggested this to me, I said, do you know what will happen to you when you are caught?</span> <span id="s1205">Oh, I am not afraid.</span> <span id="s1206">She was the happy go lucky type.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: How old a woman was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: She was older than I was.</span> <span id="s1209">She was in her, maybe close to 40 at the time, maybe 35.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: And what was your relation to her husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Actually, it wasn’t her husband.</span> <span id="s1212">You know, the funny thing is that we didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1213">She was carrying his name and we thought they were married.</span> <span id="s1214">Then we found out that she’d left her husband and she – he was just living with her.</span> <span id="s1215">And th – the dangerous thing was that when he – he used to drink quite a lot.</span> <span id="s1216">And when he drank he would threaten her with us.</span> <span id="s1217">And that was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1218">So we were very afraid sometimes about him.</span> <span id="s1219">But she could control him somehow.</span> <span id="s1220">And she was funny.</span> <span id="s1221">I used to read German papers and tell her what’s going on in the world so when she would go to work – she worked for a German firm, she could tell them, and she was well informed.</span> <span id="s1222">She was a character.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: What kind of work did she do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Some – not very important.</span> <span id="s1225">Something in the – in the office, maybe.</span> <span id="s1226">But she spoke German, but she didn’t know how to read it, and she didn’t want to admit it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Now, when you were there for those 22 months, you said your health was good, you did not get sick, you or your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Not once.</span> <span id="s1229">Not once.</span> <span id="s1230">And when Doris Schulman(ph) was wondering about it, she says, don’t you get a – didn’t you get a cold, didn’t you have to sneeze?</span> <span id="s1231">I said I couldn't afford to sneeze.</span> <span id="s1232">Because well, to the kitchen, her neighbors used to come to the kitchen and they couldn’t hear us.</span> <span id="s1233">They – they – actually the first rule of being hidden by somebody in this situation was that absolutely nobody must know it, because was enough if one person would know, and the word spreads.</span> <span id="s1234">About two weeks before we were liberated, I had a friend in school who came from a very Orthodox Jewish family and the 15 people of that family were hidden somewhere.</span> <span id="s1235">And two weeks before the war ended somebody gave them out and they were all shot.</span> <span id="s1236">So this was terribly important that nobody, absolutely nobody would know.</span> <span id="s1237">Once it happened that I was wearing – I was wearing a housecoat, and she said to me, come in, and I was standing, you know, at the door of the room, between the room and the kitchen, talking to her, when her neighbor didn’t knock at the door, just opened the door, came in and saw me.</span> <span id="s1238">And my first impulse was to hide, you know, but she didn’t lose her nerve.</span> <span id="s1239">She said – she immediately had a story.</span> <span id="s1240">Tho – they were – those are Polish people and they were in black market, black marketing and the police stopped them and they came here to hide for a few hours.</span> <span id="s1241">And as soon she got her out of the apartment, that woman.</span> <span id="s1242">And then she managed to get her back – she was very clever – and she said, look through the window, there they are, you see?</span> <span id="s1243">They left now.</span> <span id="s1244">They felt more secure so they – they went away.</span> <span id="s1245">Here they are around the corner.</span> <span id="s1246">And she made it so that the woman never suspected.</span> <span id="s1247">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Lena Jurand.</span> <span id="s1249">This is tape number two, side B, and we were just talking about the conditions when you were in hiding for 22 months.</span> <span id="s1250">While you were in hiding, were you aware of what was happening in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s1251">You sa – you had mentioned about the one man coming and you heard about –</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: – your father.</span> <span id="s1254">Did you hear about other things that were going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: He sometimes went to the ghetto door – gate and got some news, als –</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Who i – who is he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: He is the – the – her supposed husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Stanislaw, I believe.</span> <span id="s1260">And he once, twice or three times brought a letter from my mother.</span> <span id="s1261">She came to the ghetto gate and probably handed him the letter.</span> <span id="s1262">And one time he brought me a – a ball of yarn, and I was very surprised to see it.</span> <span id="s1263">I was thinking what – what is – why did my mother send me a ball of yarn?</span> <span id="s1264">Then Julian started to rewind the yarn, there was a ring inside.</span> <span id="s1265">But – well, I knew that the conditions are getting worse.</span> <span id="s1266">They – they – he told me and he heard it in – and you hear it from other people talking, Polish people who are talking about the conditions.</span> <span id="s1267">It was expected.</span> <span id="s1268">As the – as the war was going to the inevitable end, it was expected that they won’t – won’t leave the Jews alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Why do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Well, they almost – they almost – all of the Jewish population of the ghetto almost went out to Auschwitz, unless you could hide, which was not very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: What did you know about Auschwitz at th – at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: We knew that they have – that they gas people.</span> <span id="s1273">Oh, we knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Where did you get that information from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Gossip.</span> <span id="s1276">Letters probably.</span> <span id="s1277">Maybe somebody escaped once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1278">I – I doubt that, but there were rumors.</span> <span id="s1279">They were not really news, they were rumors.</span> <span id="s1280">But you knew that they do something with the people.</span> <span id="s1281">They had to do something with the people.</span> <span id="s1282">You know, when the Russians came in, and finally I – we went out and had this empty apartment, I met a Russian high ranked officer on the street, who said to – the first thing he said to me is, where is your papa?</span> <span id="s1283">Where is your daddy?</span> <span id="s1284">He knew him from before.</span> <span id="s1285">He said to me, he was a fine man.</span> <span id="s1286">Strange, how this happens in life.</span> <span id="s1287">I had – I had two black women come here one day with a bible.</span> <span id="s1288">And they ask me – they wanted to convert me, and they ask me whether I believe in God, and I said no, I don’t.</span> <span id="s1289">How can I?</span> <span id="s1290">But, on the other side, I am – I am here.</span> <span id="s1291">This is my fourth life, you know.</span> <span id="s1292">First life was in Przemyśl as a girl, was very happy.</span> <span id="s1293">Very happy life, no problems.</span> <span id="s1294">Then the second life was under the occupation, and hiding.</span> <span id="s1295">And the third life was after the war.</span> <span id="s1296">And since my husband died, it’s my fourth life.</span> <span id="s1297">He didn’t have a right to leave me alone.</span> <span id="s1298">Oh, there’s something I wanted to tell you, very important.</span> <span id="s1299">When we went into hiding, we were planning it, I said to him, I won’t go u-unless you meet my conditions.</span> <span id="s1300">You have to have poison with you because I will not go in German – to German’s hands alive.</span> <span id="s1301">He says, you can be sure I’ll have it.</span> <span id="s1302">All right.</span> <span id="s1303">We went into hiding and there was one night when the German cars were passing by [makes tooting noise].</span> <span id="s1304">And a neighbor came in and said, Marie, you don’t have to be nervous, they’re just going from house to house looking for Jews.</span> <span id="s1305">Would you believe that they went from one house to another, this is the only house they didn’t enter?</span> <span id="s1306">There is something written in the stars.</span> <span id="s1307">At that time when I heard those cars and she said they are going looking for Jews, I said to Julian, I want the poison now.</span> <span id="s1308">He says no.</span> <span id="s1309">When they will enter this house, I’ll give it to you.</span> <span id="s1310">They never entered.</span> <span id="s1311">That’s na – that’s not the end of the story.</span> <span id="s1312">After the war, as Julian didn’t have anything else but one pair of pant and a shirt, and he was always a snappy dresser, he ask me to press his pants.</span> <span id="s1313">I picked them up, and you know the European pants are finished with the belt of the same material.</span> <span id="s1314">And as I picked them up, there was something stiff there.</span> <span id="s1315">So I said to him, Julian, I cannot press it like that, there is something in that belt, you have to take it out.</span> <span id="s1316">What do you think it was?</span> <span id="s1317">Poison.</span> <span id="s1318">And at that time I gave him such hell for telling me that he doesn’t have it.</span> <span id="s1319">I said, you promise, you don’t keep your promise.</span> <span id="s1320">I was angry at him.</span> <span id="s1321">He said, if I would have shown it to you, you would have taken it then.</span> <span id="s1322">This way, you waited.</span> <span id="s1323">And he took it out from his pants.</span> <span id="s1324">That’s a story, huh?</span> <span id="s1325">He was a very good man.</span> <span id="s1326">When they t – when he died they gave him a beautiful memorial at Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital.</span> <span id="s1327">He was clinical director there.</span> <span id="s1328">And they really were very nice.</span> <span id="s1329">Nice people.</span> <span id="s1330">Everybody liked him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: At the time of liberation you said you slept for 24 hours, it was the first time you could sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Peacefully, without being afraid, because you know, it’s a terrible thing when you are afraid at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: When you walked out, what was – what was it like to walk out of that apartment onto the street –</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: It was a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: – for the very first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: It was an incredible experience.</span> <span id="s1337">Julian went out the first time, he had a cane and he walked with a cane.</span> <span id="s1338">When I went with him, it’s – it’s a strange experience when you don’t own anything.</span> <span id="s1339">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1340">I had a skirt and a blouse.</span> <span id="s1341">He had a pair of pants and a shirt.</span> <span id="s1342">And we walked.</span> <span id="s1343">And we didn’t go – we didn’t know where we are going.</span> <span id="s1344">We didn’t know what – where we are going to sleep at night.</span> <span id="s1345">We didn’t own anything.</span> <span id="s1346">In a way it’s – it’s exhilarating, you don’t have to worry about anything.</span> <span id="s1347">You don’t own anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: You hadn’t really had any physical activity in those 22 months –</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: – you were confined to the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: So what kind – again, what kind of physical con-condition were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: Amazingly well.</span> <span id="s1354">Amazingly well.</span> <span id="s1355">When my friends ask me now how come I – I keep so well, I say I ha – I had a good training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Did you have any health – physical repercussions from the abortion in 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: No, healthy as a horse.</span> <span id="s1358">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1359">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Did you – while you were in hiding, did you still get your period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: How did you handle that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: The way you handle it in Europe all the way, a piece of paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: And you burned that in the stove?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1366">Amazing, amazing.</span> <span id="s1367">You know then, when Julian started with the – with the army, he made friends with – with the cook and he used to bring home pieces of meat like that, and all day long I cooked, because I had so many people.</span> <span id="s1368">Then one day, somebody knocked at my door – I wonder whether she is still alive?</span> <span id="s1369">And I opened the door, and I couldn’t figure it out, whether it was a wom – a – a girl or a man.</span> <span id="s1370">The creature was very tall, very skinny.</span> <span id="s1371">Shaven head, and she spoke German to me.</span> <span id="s1372">She was Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1373">She said she was with a group of women from Majdanek, Hungarian women, trying to go back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1374">They stopped in Przemyśl.</span> <span id="s1375">Each one of them went to a different house, knocking at the door, trying to get some food or something, some money.</span> <span id="s1376">So I said to her, come in, come in.</span> <span id="s1377">And she came in and I gave her dinner.</span> <span id="s1378">And she says she was a daughter of a restaurateur in Budapest, she doesn’t know whether her parents are alive.</span> <span id="s1379">She survived Majdanek with a group of other girls, each one were – and I told her to bring others here, I would have all fed them.</span> <span id="s1380">And I tried to get together some money for her for the train trip to – to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1381">I don’t know whether she survived that, but I was so – I was so touched by her looks.</span> <span id="s1382">I mean, she wore a – a – kind of a uniform coat, and she was so skinny.</span> <span id="s1383">Oh, the people that we had, it was very interesting after the war when I found those people coming out of hiding, and we all stayed together.</span> <span id="s1384">Didn’t matter where we slept.</span> <span id="s1385">Then I found out that two my cousins survived the war near Warsaw as Polish women.</span> <span id="s1386">And the first occasion I had, I send them money and asked them to come to me, and they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: How did you find out about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: I don’t remember who told me.</span> <span id="s1389">Somebody told me.</span> <span id="s1390">I think it was the brother of one of the girls, who is still alive in Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: How did you find out about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: That man who came looking for – for a place to stay, he said that they took Mr. Salzburg and Mrs. Salzburg.</span> <span id="s1393">So that’s how I found my mother, otherwise I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1394">But it was very interesting to see all those people and we would sit at the evening and each one could write a book.</span> <span id="s1395">And it’s amazing what people can go th – go through and survive and still have – so those cousins of mine came to me, and the first thing Julian took them to the army – to the – to the shoemaker to have them make some shoes for them.</span> <span id="s1396">One of those cousins is still alive and she lives in Milburn, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1397">The other one passed away.</span> <span id="s1398">So that was an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: So now it’s after liberation and – and can you tell me what you did then?</span> <span id="s1400">A: Well, we – we – we tried to get some beds for the apartment, and the first thing my husband bought – got for me, and I don’t know where he got it, was a concert grand piano.</span> <span id="s1401">And we put it in a room that was totally empty.</span> <span id="s1402">The concert grand was in the center of the room, so all three of us, all the two girls that came to stay with us, all three of us played the piano, so we gave concerts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: You decided to stay in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Well we stayed only temporary.</span> <span id="s1405">Then my husband was shipped as a army physician to another town called Zheshev(ph), not far from Przemyśl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: So he went into the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Oh, he went into the Polish army as a captain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Because this way he got food and everything, it was easy.</span> <span id="s1410">And they looked for doctors there, so he went as a – as a – a captain [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Was he – was he a specific kind of doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: Yes, he was.</span> <span id="s1413">It wasn’t for the army.</span> <span id="s1414">He was – his specialty was venereal diseases.</span> <span id="s1415">I used to call him the king of the horrors.</span> <span id="s1416">And we – he went to Zheshev(ph) as a – as a army physician, but he didn't want me to go there because it was a – such a small town.</span> <span id="s1417">So I and this cousin of mine, who lives in Milburn, New Jersey, we moved [phone ringing] – we moved to Kraków.</span> <span id="s1418">We stayed in Kraków only a few months.</span> <span id="s1419">In the meantime my uncle, who was in New York, found out that I am alive.</span> <span id="s1420">I wrote to him, and he had some friends, one of whom was a director of a DP camp in Munich, Germany.</span> <span id="s1421">The other was a director of a DP camp outside of Munich, Germany.</span> <span id="s1422">And those t – those two sent a Jeep with two young men dressed in UNRRA uniforms, who came from Munich, Germany to get us out of Poland.</span> <span id="s1423">And they came in and they said, you have two hours to decide.</span> <span id="s1424">We cannot stay here, we are illegally here.</span> <span id="s1425">Either you come with us, or you have to stay.</span> <span id="s1426">It happened that my husband was at that time with us in Kraków – with me in Kraków.</span> <span id="s1427">And I said, let’s go.</span> <span id="s1428">So we took our dog and we boarded the Jeep and we went to cross the Polish-Czechoslovakian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Let’s talk about your dog.</span> <span id="s1430">When did you get the dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: We got the dog when he was in the army – with the army in Przemyśl.</span> <span id="s1432">They went for some maneuvers to some residential prin – a [indecipherable] or something.</span> <span id="s1433">And the soldiers found that little puppy dog, they put him in a suitcase or whatever and brought him to me.</span> <span id="s1434">And I was so geared tomas food – towards food, that when I heard something moving in that – in that little suitcase, I was sure it’s a chicken.</span> <span id="s1435">That was the dog.</span> <span id="s1436">He was a puppy, and he became our baby.</span> <span id="s1437">So I have a picture where I’m standing on the top of a house in Cieszyn, where the border between Poland ch – Czechoslovakia was.</span> <span id="s1438">And Julian – w-we stayed with a Orthodox family, it was a Friday evening when we arrived there.</span> <span id="s1439">We stayed overnight, they were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s1440">And the next morning the daughter of the household went to talk to the soldier, because we didn’t have any papers.</span> <span id="s1441">She talked to him and she probably convinced him, so he let her open the – the – the border, the thing, the – and we went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: That was in 1944.</span> <span id="s1444">Yes, in the summer 1944, very early.</span> <span id="s1445">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: So how long did you stay in Tremisz(ph) after you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: After what?</span> <span id="s1448">After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: After you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Liberated.</span> <span id="s1451">Not long, a few months, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: What were your thoughts about leaving Poland, this is where you were born.</span> <span id="s1453">Did you consider yourself Polish then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: I had no regrets.</span> <span id="s1455">There was nothing in me.</span> <span id="s1456">Look, we went through so much, that leaving was – first of all, all my life I wanted to be in America, as I said before, as a child.</span> <span id="s1457">My father kept it up.</span> <span id="s1458">And my – I had two – two of my father’s brothers and my mother’s sister living in New York.</span> <span id="s1459">So I – I had no regrets of leaving.</span> <span id="s1460">There was nothing in me at the time.</span> <span id="s1461">And my only preoccupation was to cross those borders, because we were illegally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: When you were in Tremisz(ph) after – after you were liberated, did you see other people, besides when you talked about who you knew before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: The people that I found on the streets, yes, the ones who were hidden like a – we were, yes.</span> <span id="s1464">Oh, we talked all the time.</span> <span id="s1465">All the time, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Who was in your group as you were leaving Poland?</span> <span id="s1467">It was your husband and your cousin and you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: So it was the three of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Your cousin’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Louise Koch(ph).</span> <span id="s1473">She married.</span> <span id="s1474">That’s her m – her husband was also a medical doctor, whom I knew when I was a girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: And her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: Zarvin(ph).</span> <span id="s1477">That’s a very difficult name, Zarvin(ph).</span> <span id="s1478">She was – she was – they were – this was – her mother was the one who introduced Julian to me, and I told you, that was her mother.</span> <span id="s1479">Well, we crossed the border, we went on that trip with the dog to Praga.</span> <span id="s1480">We stayed in Praga one or two nights, I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s1481">We didn’t have a penny to our soul, we couldn’t buy anything.</span> <span id="s1482">They provided food for us, the two boys who came to get us.</span> <span id="s1483">When we – the same way we crossed the Czechoslovakian-German border, when we finally came to Munich, we were lucky because – because of my uncle’s friends, we didn’t have to stay in a DP camp, we stayed with the UNRRA people, which was lovely.</span> <span id="s1484">Beautiful house with a cook, with everything.</span> <span id="s1485">It was my first contact with Americans.</span> <span id="s1486">I used to go in a Jeep when she was touring the neighborhood, with her.</span> <span id="s1487">Was very nice.</span> <span id="s1488">And when – as we were staying there, I took a job to teach some children music in that DP camp in Munich.</span> <span id="s1489">And Julian works – works as physician there.</span> <span id="s1490">And it was very rewarding because I could give something to those children, I like that very much.</span> <span id="s1491">Except they didn’t speak my language, so I had to start with the Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: What was it like for you to put your foot down in Germany?</span> <span id="s1493">Did it mean anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: It meant a lot.</span> <span id="s1495">I hated every minute of it.</span> <span id="s1496">I – I – Julian insisted I should get a good piano teacher to continue my piano education.</span> <span id="s1497">Well, I got a teacher from the conservatory in Munich who would come home to me, but I hated him, because every time I would say something about the war, he would say, we didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s1498">And I said you mean to tell me you didn’t know?</span> <span id="s1499">All those golden teeth, you didn’t know where they came from?</span> <span id="s1500">All the jewelry?</span> <span id="s1501">The work of art?</span> <span id="s1502">I said to him, you know, if I would find one German who would say yes, I knew what was going on, but we couldn’t do anything about it, I would have some respect for him.</span> <span id="s1503">I hated – it came to a point – I found out through my cousin, the one who called here, that in a neighborhood hospital for – from where we lived, was a family, a mother and daughter and son-in-law, all three very sick people, Jews, of course.</span> <span id="s1504">So I said to her, let’s go.</span> <span id="s1505">We went to the hospital and I brought something with me and I introduced myself.</span> <span id="s1506">And we became very, very friendly, but the son-in-law had leukemia.</span> <span id="s1507">They were – they were hidden in terrible conditions and he died there in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1508">And I would go every other day, I would take the train from Munich to Garmisch-Partenkirchen where the sanitorium was.</span> <span id="s1509">And I would take my dog along, and I buy a ticket for my dog and he had a seat.</span> <span id="s1510">You know what means to be angry?</span> <span id="s1511">I was – I had so much anger in me towards this ger – German people.</span> <span id="s1512">I couldn’t help myself.</span> <span id="s1513">I would take a chocolate with me on the train, and when would I do it otherwise?</span> <span id="s1514">I saw those children, German children sitting across from me, looking at me, and they were looking at the chocolate bars that I had.</span> <span id="s1515">And I would unpack a chocolate bar and put the whole chocolate bar into my dog’s mouth.</span> <span id="s1516">I had some satisfaction.</span> <span id="s1517">Cruel, but satisfaction.</span> <span id="s1518">After awhile, I said to my husband, I don’t care why I live, I can’t stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s1519">It’s killing me.</span> <span id="s1520">Absolutely killing me.</span> <span id="s1521">So he found out that there was a train of Italians who were brought to Germany by Hitler to work in Germany and they were going back to Italy.</span> <span id="s1522">So he volunteered as a physician, I went as a nurse, and the dog we – went as a dog.</span> <span id="s1523">So we were t – to Italy by train.</span> <span id="s1524">And Julian had a very dear friend of his and his brother’s.</span> <span id="s1525">She was Dutch and she lived in Merano – Merano.</span> <span id="s1526">When we crossed the Italian border, this is where we went.</span> <span id="s1527">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: Wh-Wh-When did you leave Germany and how long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: A year.</span> <span id="s1530">A year</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: You were a year in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: A year in Germany.</span> <span id="s1533">And we went to Merano.</span> <span id="s1534">And she t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: When you were teaching – when you were teaching these students –</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: – in Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Were they German students or Jewish students?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Jewish students, all Jewish, from all kinds.</span> <span id="s1541">From Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, from every country.</span> <span id="s1542">This was a DP camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Which camp was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Neue Freiman(ph) lager.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: And so you went into the camp itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Oh yes, every day.</span> <span id="s1547">I didn’t live there, but I went to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Can you paint me a picture of what the camp looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Well, there were little wooden houses.</span> <span id="s1550">Now, Lucia, the one who called me now, she lived there, in camp.</span> <span id="s1551">Not bad.</span> <span id="s1552">They had enough food.</span> <span id="s1553">I have somewhere a picture wa – at the train station there.</span> <span id="s1554">And I went every day because I taught the kids and Julian went because he had some patients there.</span> <span id="s1555">It wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s1556">I mean, it looks like a – like a camp, but it was cleaner than most of the camps were, and the direc –</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: What were people’s state of mind then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: Where did they take money from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: No, no, no, what was their state of mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Everybody was talking about their experiences.</span> <span id="s1561">This was the – the usual team of talk.</span> <span id="s1562">We couldn't talk about anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: The children that you taught were how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: Yeah, they were mostly about six, seven, eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: How did they survive the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: Maybe hidden.</span> <span id="s1567">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1568">I didn't talk to the parents.</span> <span id="s1569">They were nice kids.</span> <span id="s1570">Maybe a little older.</span> <span id="s1571">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Did they – did they talk about their experience?</span> <span id="s1573">The children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: No.</span> <span id="s1575">Not to me.</span> <span id="s1576">I taught piano.</span> <span id="s1577">They were nice.</span> <span id="s1578">So we left finally Germany, to my joy and we went to Italy.</span> <span id="s1579">And it – Italy, we didn't have money again, we tried to find a place to stay, so we found a room on the eighth floor without an elevator, and I had the dog who had to go out three times a day.</span> <span id="s1580">It didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1581">It didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1582">Julian graduated medical school in Genoa.</span> <span id="s1583">This was his second language, Italy.</span> <span id="s1584">And he adored Italy.</span> <span id="s1585">So, because he had an Italian diploma, he could practice medicine there.</span> <span id="s1586">So we f – we found a room in the old part of Genoa in the port of Genoa where he opened his office, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1587">That’s why I called him the king of the horrors, he – we would go for a walk and from up every lantern came a greeting.</span> <span id="s1588">And I volunteered as his helper because we couldn’t afford sa – to pay somebody.</span> <span id="s1589">So I would help him, but he wasn’t pleased with me.</span> <span id="s1590">You know, hi-his specialty was skin and venereal diseases.</span> <span id="s1591">This goes together in Italy.</span> <span id="s1592">So he asked me to volunte – to stay by when he had a patient who had something that had to be burned on her skin.</span> <span id="s1593">And I don’t know whether you know what burning of skin smells like.</span> <span id="s1594">I was standing next to him and I was getting paler and paler.</span> <span id="s1595">And he gave one look at me and he said, get out.</span> <span id="s1596">I am firing you, you are not a good helper.</span> <span id="s1597">So we stayed in Italy for five years.</span> <span id="s1598">I learned Italian.</span> <span id="s1599">In the meantime, my uncle couldn't stand it, the one in New York.</span> <span id="s1600">In 1947 he send me a ticket to come to New York for a visit.</span> <span id="s1601">And I came on a Polish boat, because I couldn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s1602">I had a ball on that boat, it was lovely.</span> <span id="s1603">I came here with a visa for three months, visitor’s visa.</span> <span id="s1604">I stayed with him in Long Island where he had his house and I must say his wife was beautiful to me, she was such a lovely woman.</span> <span id="s1605">I have never met her before.</span> <span id="s1606">I have seen him because he used to come to Poland for a visit, yes, but I never knew his wife.</span> <span id="s1607">And she was very nice to me, very.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: What – what were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Salzburg.</span> <span id="s1610">Ben.</span> <span id="s1611">Ben Salzburg.</span> <span id="s1612">He had a business on 24th Street downtown, with – you know when they made “The King and I,” he – he put all those rhinestones as stones on the costumes.</span> <span id="s1613">This was his business.</span> <span id="s1614">And he would take me down there to his workers and introduce me, he was very proud of me.</span> <span id="s1615">And I stayed – and he would hire – he hired a young woman teacher from Columbia University, who came to my house every other day to give me a lesson in English.</span> <span id="s1616">So after being three months there, I had a ball.</span> <span id="s1617">I traveled all over New York, I was in love with new – I still am in love with New York.</span> <span id="s1618">And then I had an uncle, my mother’s – my – my mother’s sister’s husband, who was a photographer in Yonkers.</span> <span id="s1619">So I went there and he went absolutely bananas with me.</span> <span id="s1620">He – where is that other picture that is so beautiful I have to show you?</span> <span id="s1621">He was taking me – my pictures constantly.</span> <span id="s1622">And I would travel all over New York, and then my uncle got tired of living in Long Island because he had to commute downtown, it was a little hard on him.</span> <span id="s1623">He found an apartment on 96th West, and I had a room overlooking Central Park, which was absolutely beautiful.</span> <span id="s1624">I stayed the three months, after three months my visa was about to expire.</span> <span id="s1625">He said, I’ll send a lawyer, I have a friend lawyer who will go with you to the apart – department of – what is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Im-Immigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Yes, immigration department.</span> <span id="s1628">Maybe you can get a – prolong – prolong your visa.</span> <span id="s1629">I come with that – at that time I spoke a little English already.</span> <span id="s1630">I came to the department and he starts, well she is sick and she has to have some medical attention, and I can see in the face of that man there that he doesn’t believe a word he is saying, and I looked like a picture of health.</span> <span id="s1631">So I said, excuse me, let me talk.</span> <span id="s1632">And I said to the man, look, I am a survivor of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1633">I finally came here and I have the time of my life, and I am totally in love with New York.</span> <span id="s1634">I would like to stay another three months.</span> <span id="s1635">I have a husband in Italy and I intend to go back.</span> <span id="s1636">Without another word, I got three more months in New York.</span> <span id="s1637">Then I sent a telegram to Julian, ar-arriving Ciampino Rome, TWA, this and this time.</span> <span id="s1638">He gets the [indecipherable] and he said he knows what is Ciampino Rome, but what the devil is TWA?</span> <span id="s1639">He couldn’t figure it out.</span> <span id="s1640">He came to Rome to wait for me and I come out from the plane, I’m very proud of myself, I had the new hat, with the feather.</span> <span id="s1641">And at that time they started to wear those shoes with the strap at the ankle, and I had those shoes.</span> <span id="s1642">I was very proud of myself.</span> <span id="s1643">I had the new suit.</span> <span id="s1644">My other uncle, my – my father’s older brother was in fur business on 28th Street and he gave me a beautiful brown Persian coat, full length coat, beautiful.</span> <span id="s1645">So I was very proud of myself and I come out of the train and Julian gives one look at me, and he says, you have to ta – change those shoes, you look like an Italian whore.</span> <span id="s1646">Those were very happy months for me, I really loved it.</span> <span id="s1647">I wa – it was a love affair wi – between me and New York, a total love affair.</span> <span id="s1648">I love New York.</span> <span id="s1649">Very happy.</span> <span id="s1650">And unfortunately his wife later died, my uncle’s wife.</span> <span id="s1651">And he remarried another European woman.</span> <span id="s1652">He is dead by now.</span> <span id="s1653">He was very good to me, very good.</span> <span id="s1654">Like a – like a – he suffered because of loss of his brother.</span> <span id="s1655">So that’s my history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: So now you’re back in Italy with your husband after being in New York, and what happened?</span> <span id="s1657">A: I come back to Italy, yes, and we waited for our immigration visa.</span> <span id="s1658">And I said to my husband, what will happen if they don’t late – let the dog go to America?</span> <span id="s1659">I mean, this can happen.</span> <span id="s1660">Very seriously he said, then I won’t go.</span> <span id="s1661">He went to the American embassy in Genoa.</span> <span id="s1662">He got every shot given to the dog by the veterinarian there, we got a pile of papers, we paid $50 for his – we – we came by boat here.</span> <span id="s1663">And we were assured the accommodations for the dogs are very good.</span> <span id="s1664">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: What kind of a dog was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: This one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: No, what kind of a dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: A shepherd.</span> <span id="s1669">And he didn’t like people, so he had to wear a muzzle.</span> <span id="s1670">And we come on the boat and it was February, very cold.</span> <span id="s1671">And the first thing Julian said, I want to see the accommodations for th – my dog.</span> <span id="s1672">So he went to the upper dock – deck and he comes back and says, I am not going to put my dog there.</span> <span id="s1673">It’s bitterly cold.</span> <span id="s1674">And we had a cabin for four people, so the dog had two bunks to sleep with.</span></p> <p><span

is tape number three, side A. And you were talking about arriving in New York with your dog.</span> <span id="s1678">What was your dog’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: Macho(ph).</span> <span id="s1680">He was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: And then you – and then you said your uncle was there and he didn’t like dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: He didn’t like – he was afraid of dogs, so we stayed with him for about a few months in Long Island, watching the dog very carefully.</span> <span id="s1683">And after that Julian found – he had to make his internship here.</span> <span id="s1684">He – we went to a place called Neptune, New Jersey, where he worked in the hospital and where my son was born also, in Neptune, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1685">And we found there is, near Neptune, New Jersey is a small place where they don’t let cars on Sunday.</span> <span id="s1686">And we found an Italian woman who rented the place to us, a – a room to us with the dog, and she didn't know we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1687">And then after awhile I told her and she says, it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1688">You don’t want to park your car – you don’t want to drive your car on Sunday here.</span> <span id="s1689">It was very nice, very nice.</span> <span id="s1690">And my son was born there, and then Julian wi – got –</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: What was it like for you to give birth to a child after you had to go through the difficult –</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: It was nothing – it was absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1693">Doris – I drive her bananas when I say that I – I went to the – through the period of being pregnant with not one single illness.</span> <span id="s1694">I didn’t get – besides a local anesthesia, I didn’t get any anesthesia at all, except in that hospital where Julian was working, you know, and I gave birth to my son, the doctors were trying to be very nice to me and I was running – I was about to give birth and I was running to the bathroom when a young doctor stopped me and s – oh, how are you feeling Mrs. Jurand?</span> <span id="s1695">And I says, if you s-stop me one more minute, I’ll kill you.</span> <span id="s1696">And my son was born –</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: What about psychologically, giving birth after you had gone through this sad experience of the abortion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Oh wa – once – once I finally decided to have a baby, I guess I – I was, in a way –</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Had you hesitated about having a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Because when I came out of hiding, I swore that I will never have a cha – a child, because I saw what children went through.</span> <span id="s1703">I was totally discouraged to have any family.</span> <span id="s1704">And then my brother-in-law, Julian’s brother, who never had children, started writing letters to me begging me, if I can, to have a child.</span> <span id="s1705">So I decided maybe I’ll try it.</span> <span id="s1706">Never regretted it, he was a wonderful boy.</span> <span id="s1707">It was a good experience.</span> <span id="s1708">But, we stayed there and then Julian found a job in Grantsville, which is between Annapolis and Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1709">A state hospital.</span> <span id="s1710">And we lived there for six years, in Grantsville.</span> <span id="s1711">That was very happy years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: What kind of practice was he having?</span> <span id="s1713">Still venereal disease and dermatology?</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1715">No, he wa – since he took this – his state exam, he – he went to – to psychiatry.</span> <span id="s1716">This was a psychiatric hospital where we lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: So he got additional training?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1719">And we stayed there for six years, very happy years.</span> <span id="s1720">And from there we moved to Saint Elizabeth’s, where we lived for 14 years, on the grounds of Saint Elizabeth’s hospital and my son grew up there.</span> <span id="s1721">Very good years too, very good years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: This is in Washington, D.C.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: In Washington, D.C., yes.</span> <span id="s1724">And then Julian, with time he became clinical director of Saint Elizabeth’s hospital before he retired.</span> <span id="s1725">And then we came to this house.</span> <span id="s1726">And my son lives now in West Virginia.</span> <span id="s1727">He is also in psychiatry.</span> <span id="s1728">He goes in his father’s footsteps.</span> <span id="s1729">He just directed a play.</span> <span id="s1730">You know, we started a play – a – a – a theater in Annapolis.</span> <span id="s1731">Yes, we bought an old garage, we bought some chairs from an old movie house, and Julian directed the first play, which was Pygmalion.</span> <span id="s1732">It was a smash hit.</span> <span id="s1733">And I helped with everything.</span> <span id="s1734">Make-up, costumes, everything that was to be helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Can we talk a little bit now about some of your thoughts and your feelings about what you went through?</span> <span id="s1736">Do you think you would be a different person today if you had not gone through what you did, what you experienced during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: I am sure I would have been different.</span> <span id="s1740">First of all, maybe I would have been more religious, which I am not.</span> <span id="s1741">Second, I think it gave me a certain insight into human s-suffering, otherwise I wouldn’t have known it.</span> <span id="s1742">I led a very sheltered life as a young girl, very sheltered.</span> <span id="s1743">Good life.</span> <span id="s1744">And I didn’t know much about human suffering.</span> <span id="s1745">I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s1746">So I – I think – I think in this respect – it’s hard to say that the war was beneficial for me, it isn’t beneficial to anybody.</span> <span id="s1747">But I think that I gained more understanding for people.</span> <span id="s1748">For people suffering, especially.</span> <span id="s1749">I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: Are there any sounds or sights today that you hear or you see, or any smells that kind of bring back your experience during the war, either in get – in the ghetto, or in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: You mean sounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: Sounds, sights, smells.</span> <span id="s1753">Anything that triggers what you went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Very easily, very easily, can trigger anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Or men you – even when you listen to news and you hear – or you see people suffering in so many countries, and you think, isn’t there an end to it?</span> <span id="s1757">I – I am specially very vulnerable if it comes to children suffering.</span> <span id="s1758">And when I see, let’s say in – in Yugoslavia, the children who are without food, without medication, I suffer.</span> <span id="s1759">I do.</span> <span id="s1760">Because I thought maybe – maybe we have filled out the – the suffering of people.</span> <span id="s1761">Maybe it’s enough.</span> <span id="s1762">But it isn’t enough.</span> <span id="s1763">It goes on and on and on.</span> <span id="s1764">Why?</span> <span id="s1765">Even – even this last [indecipherable] the bombs, that so many Americans have died, and local people.</span> <span id="s1766">Any crazy person can – you know, my father was a socialist and I used to discuss politics with him, and I – I was very angry at him because he said he doesn’t believe in forming the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s1767">And I said, why?</span> <span id="s1768">He says, because the Arabs will never, never leave them alone.</span> <span id="s1769">Very often when I hear the news, I can see that he was right in many ways.</span> <span id="s1770">But, look, we will always have wars.</span> <span id="s1771">There will be always crazy people who will try to do so much damage.</span> <span id="s1772">We cannot help it.</span> <span id="s1773">We are not responsible for everybody.</span> <span id="s1774">I wish Julian would have lived longer.</span> <span id="s1775">I still feel that he didn't have any right to leave me alone.</span> <span id="s1776">He never left me alone in 57 years.</span> <span id="s1777">If it wouldn’t have been for him, I wouldn’t have survived the war.</span> <span id="s1778">I am sure of it.</span> <span id="s1779">I didn't – I was very sheltered all my life.</span> <span id="s1780">I didn’t know how to cope with it.</span> <span id="s1781">And it was he who – who staged it, who arranged it.</span> <span id="s1782">He was responsible for everything, even after the war.</span> <span id="s1783">And he left me in three days.</span> <span id="s1784">It isn’t right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: When you were raising your son, did you – and – and let’s say when he was at the age that you were when the war started, 22 when the war started.</span> <span id="s1786">Did that bring back memories for you of the war?</span> <span id="s1787">When he became the age that you were when the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: No, it didn't bring – I did tell him about everything, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1789">He knew about everything.</span> <span id="s1790">But I – I didn’t – I didn't resent his getting older.</span> <span id="s1791">Or I didn’t connect this with the war in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Wer-Were you very protective of him when he was growing up?</span> <span id="s1793">A: To some extent yes, but don’t forget that he grew up, his first years were in the country, which was very nice.</span> <span id="s1794">We had the nice community there, rather international.</span> <span id="s1795">We had a doctor from Vienna, and we had a doctor from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1796">We had a nice group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: Are you angry that you had to go through these very difficult times and others did not, sitting in this country, let’s say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: You mean, to people who were here in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: What I resent about –</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: That you had – that you had to go – are you angry that you had to go through that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: And others did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: It’s nobody’s fault.</span> <span id="s1805">It’s not – certainly not people’s fault and I – I am very happy that I came to this country.</span> <span id="s1806">I love it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: What were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: I would have killed him.</span> <span id="s1809">I was very happy that the Israelis got him.</span> <span id="s1810">Serves him right.</span> <span id="s1811">Too bad he didn't get more.</span> <span id="s1812">And I looked at him as he was standing at that trial and I was thinking, you know, he looked like a little Jewish man.</span> <span id="s1813">Didn’t he?</span> <span id="s1814">It’s funny how it happens.</span> <span id="s1815">But I was very glad they got him.</span> <span id="s1816">Very.</span> <span id="s1817">No pity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: What are your thoughts about Germany today?</span> <span id="s1819">The modern Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: I know.</span> <span id="s1821">I wouldn’t live there if you give me millions.</span> <span id="s1822">I don’t buy anything that’s made in Germany.</span> <span id="s1823">I used to tell my son, when you will be older, and you want to marry somebody, you can marry anybody of any religion you want.</span> <span id="s1824">But if you ever marry a German, I will not know you.</span> <span id="s1825">I resent them very greatly.</span> <span id="s1826">Greatly.</span> <span id="s1827">As a matter of fact I had a friend who was a wife of a rabbi.</span> <span id="s1828">She was a very dear friend of mine, she worked with my husband in the hospital here.</span> <span id="s1829">And her daughter, the daughter of a rabbi went to Germany to study something and she met a German and she married him.</span> <span id="s1830">And she lives in Germany.</span> <span id="s1831">And every time I saw her, I was thinking, how can she?</span> <span id="s1832">How can she have any relationship with those people?</span> <span id="s1833">I cannot.</span> <span id="s1834">I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1835">I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1836">As a matter of fact, about 12 years ago [indecipherable] we went to Vienna and Budapest.</span> <span id="s1837">Julian had some meeting in Budapest.</span> <span id="s1838">When we were going to Vienna, he said to me, you will love Vienna.</span> <span id="s1839">Oh, you will absol – well, I hated it.</span> <span id="s1840">Every time I was in Vienna and I had to listen to that German and I was thinking, this is the country that gave us Hitler, I couldn’t stand it.</span> <span id="s1841">I enjoyed Budapest very much, but not Vienna.</span> <span id="s1842">A funny thing happened to us, we went to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1843">There was a – Julian was supposed to read the paper, there was a psychiatric meeting in Jerusalem, and he was reading a paper on – on the war, something about the war.</span> <span id="s1844">And we were sta – we were – we were staying at the Hilton in Jerusalem and we met another couple.</span> <span id="s1845">Very handsome man, who had on a golden chain, a big letter chai.</span> <span id="s1846">So you thought he was Jewish, yeah.</span> <span id="s1847">He was a Presbyterians minister.</span> <span id="s1848">And I still have a letter that his wife wrote to me.</span> <span id="s1849">We became very friendly with this couple and we had one taxi, and the taxi driver drove us around.</span> <span id="s1850">And I said to [indecipherable] how come you speak English so well?</span> <span id="s1851">He says to me, I am from Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1852">And we were – we s – we went to a kibbutz where we spend the night.</span> <span id="s1853">Was a nice kibbutz, well kept.</span> <span id="s1854">And we went to Mosada(ph), of course.</span> <span id="s1855">And then we – we traveled to the ocean.</span> <span id="s1856">Oh, we had a great time in Jerusalem, I loved it.</span> <span id="s1857">She came running to me, his wife, on a Friday and said, Lena, quickly, quickly, you have to get ready.</span> <span id="s1858">I want to see the Jews dancing at the wailing wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: What are your thoughts about Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: I liked it very much, but – but I am not very optimistic about it – Israel.</span> <span id="s1863">You know, if they keep giving away – Israel is small, if they keep wanting more and more from Israel, how long will they stay?</span> <span id="s1864">I am – I am a little hesitant about Netanyahu, I don’t know whether he is doing such a good job.</span> <span id="s1865">But I love the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s1866">I felt very comfortable there.</span> <span id="s1867">That –</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Why did you feel comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: Because it’s such a relaxed atmosphere the Israelis have.</span> <span id="s1870">With everything that’s going around them, it’s amazing that they can forget about it.</span> <span id="s1871">Or maybe not forget, but try to forget.</span> <span id="s1872">It’s beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: Are you more comfortable around people who went through the war, than those who did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: No –</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: More comfortable around other survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: You know, this is a very strange question that you ask me, and I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s1877">There is a couple here, they’re not Jewish, very nice couple who – whom I met at some friend’s house.</span> <span id="s1878">And they probably thought – they knew somebody else who was from Poland, also a survivor.</span> <span id="s1879">So they thought that if they put me together with another survivor, I will feel mu-much more relaxed and so on.</span> <span id="s1880">And they invited me to dinner one time.</span> <span id="s1881">And I went to dinner and there was the other woman.</span> <span id="s1882">And I didn't like her and she didn't like me, and I know it.</span> <span id="s1883">So you never know.</span> <span id="s1884">I – I get beautifully along with Americans, I love Americans.</span> <span id="s1885">I think – I don’t have to have people who – who went through everything, as I did.</span> <span id="s1886">Course, we enjoy it.</span> <span id="s1887">As I was telling you that I went to see that family in the hospital with their gra – son-in-law.</span> <span id="s1888">Well, the woman, the young woman was a public prosecutor in Poland.</span> <span id="s1889">She was a lawyer by profession and she wanted to come to this country desperately.</span> <span id="s1890">So, we went together for the – you know, befo – it took five years for the amer – for the Americans immigration office to give us a visa to come here.</span> <span id="s1891">That’s why I get so upset when I see that they let so many people in without – without really knowing anything about them.</span> <span id="s1892">They x-rayed us, we went to Naples, we had to go through some questions and well, the x-rayed showed – her x-rayed showed that she had a tiny spot on her lungs.</span> <span id="s1893">Every doctor, including Julian gave her a statement that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with her lungs, they wouldn’t let her in here.</span> <span id="s1894">So she went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1895">And she became a lawyer there in Haifa.</span> <span id="s1896">We visited her when we were there.</span> <span id="s1897">And a – but why do I say that?</span> <span id="s1898">In connection with what?</span> <span id="s1899">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1900">She passed away since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: Di – did your –</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: She used to write to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Did your husband do any studies, any research on survivors?</span> <span id="s1904">You had said that he gave a paper on it – on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: Oh – oh yes, he wrote the paper, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: Did – did he do research on survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: What kind of research?</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: He met with all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s1910">I wasn't involved in that, he didn't involve me in that.</span> <span id="s1911">But he did meet with the people who survived the sp – from the psychiatric point of view, what – what’s – where they had left anything.</span> <span id="s1912">Well, of course, everybody who survived that war has to be affected in some way or other.</span> <span id="s1913">I mean, you cannot be a normal person after surviving this.</span> <span id="s1914">Like being hidden for 22 months without being able to say a word loud, or – or sneeze or cough.</span> <span id="s1915">How can you be normal?</span> <span id="s1916">I mean normal, depending what you mean by normal.</span> <span id="s1917">But that’s very hard.</span> <span id="s1918">Very hard.</span> <span id="s1919">I find that my – my attitude to people is completely different.</span> <span id="s1920">I mistrust people much more than I did when I was young.</span> <span id="s1921">I didn't know anything about life.</span> <span id="s1922">Well, here I am, at the end of my rope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: As you’ve gotten older, do you think more about this time in your life, the war time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: Do I think more?</span> <span id="s1925">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: A-As you’ve gotten older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: Yes, yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1928">Much more.</span> <span id="s1929">I analyze much more.</span> <span id="s1930">I would love to go once more to my town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: Had you ever been back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: Never.</span> <span id="s1933">Never.</span> <span id="s1934">When I left Poland I swore I’ll never come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Why do you say now you would like to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: Why do you say now that you would like to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: Cause I’m getting older.</span> <span id="s1939">I think a – it would be nice to see the old place.</span> <span id="s1940">It was such a nice town.</span> <span id="s1941">We didn't have any crime.</span> <span id="s1942">Nothing ever happened.</span> <span id="s1943">Only once a woman, a Jewish woman divorced her husband and married somebody else.</span> <span id="s1944">It was the greatest scandal the town has ever heard of.</span> <span id="s1945">It was a very peaceful life.</span> <span id="s1946">Nice life, nice life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: Do you feel Polish in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1949">I read Polish books.</span> <span id="s1950">I like the Pope because he is Polish.</span> <span id="s1951">Julian left quite a few Polish books, I didn’t realize when I was looking through the books.</span> <span id="s1952">So I started reading them.</span> <span id="s1953">I didn't read them since I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s1954">Quite an experience.</span> <span id="s1955">At the beginning I thought I’ll have a hard time, but it wasn’t working that way.</span> <span id="s1956">It’s nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: What language do you think in every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: What language do I think?</span> <span id="s1959">Mostly English, mostly English.</span> <span id="s1960">When I am with my Polish friends we speak Polish, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: These are Polish-Jewish friends, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: Not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1963">Non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: You have Polish friends here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1966">As a matter of fact, I have some books which I want to give them.</span> <span id="s1967">But I sp – I think mostly in English, yes.</span> <span id="s1968">Became a habit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: So, do you harbor any feelings, negative feelings towards the Polish people during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: I personally don’t.</span> <span id="s1971">I have no reason, I have been saved by a Polish woman.</span> <span id="s1972">I don’t think we would have survived the war without her.</span> <span id="s1973">Whether she did it – she didn’t do it for money.</span> <span id="s1974">Why she did it, I don’t know, but I’m grateful to her.</span> <span id="s1975">So that’s why I take care of her grandson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Do you receive any reparation money?</span> <span id="s1977">Money for reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: No.</span> <span id="s1979">No.</span> <span id="s1980">I know people get it from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1981">First of all, I don’t know whether my parents had any account.</span> <span id="s1982">No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s1983">I don’t need that money.</span> <span id="s1984">I – I have two granddaughters and I hope they will never know what it means to go through a war.</span> <span id="s1985">It’s devastating.</span> <span id="s1986">I often think about it.</span> <span id="s1987">But I had a good husband and he was – he pulled me through it.</span> <span id="s1988">I would have never survived without him.</span> <span id="s1989">First of all, I would have gone with my father, and second, I didn't know how to do it.</span> <span id="s1990">He was – he was the one who arranged everything for me, yeah.</span> <span id="s1991">Strange.</span> <span id="s1992">I never thought when I was young that I will go through such a war.</span> <span id="s1993">What makes one crazy man do things?</span> <span id="s1994">And they were – there were some very bright, intelligent people in his group who followed him.</span> <span id="s1995">That is the tragic thing.</span> <span id="s1996">When I read the story of – what was the name of his – his main – like here it, it was the – the forces, the – his for – he – Rommel.</span> <span id="s1997">He was a bright, intelligent man, but he was caught.</span> <span id="s1998">He was caught.</span> <span id="s1999">There were more men like that.</span> <span id="s2000">This is – this is tho – though it’s not an explanation why people followed him.</span> <span id="s2001">So you work for the memorial hospital – for the Holocaust Museum?</span> <span id="s2002">Pardon me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: Y-Yes, this is an interview for the museum.</span> <span id="s2004">You said you had spoken to your granddaughter’s class – classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: Can you tell me why you’re doing that and what your thoughts are?</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: Well, my son asked me would we sp – would – at that time Julian was with me.</span> <span id="s2008">And we spoke to her class, which was the – this – you know, she is now 13, but must have been – maybe she was eight, something like that.</span> <span id="s2009">And then they ask us in that school would we speak to the older kids, and we did.</span> <span id="s2010">And I was amazed, really amazed at the attention they gave us.</span> <span id="s2011">And the questions they ask us, they were very bright questions.</span> <span id="s2012">Especially about the – the part where we described in what conditions we were hidden.</span> <span id="s2013">Very bright.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Why did you do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: Well, he wanted us to talk to them.</span> <span id="s2016">The principal was curious and he wanted us to talk to them, and I – I thought it was – be very interesting for kids to know what people go through, and they still live a normal life.</span> <span id="s2017">And he even ask me this year too to talk to, but I didn’t, because I didn’t feel up to it, but maybe I – I’ll do it, if he asks me again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: You said you wanted to let the children know that you can go this – through this and live a normal life.</span> <span id="s2019">You feel your life was normal after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s2021">Since we came to this country, I feel that we have led a very normal life, yes.</span> <span id="s2022">I am happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Do – do you feel totally assimilated into American culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s2025">I am quite critical about the president, you know.</span> <span id="s2026">And – but yes, I am, I am.</span> <span id="s2027">I like this country.</span> <span id="s2028">I’m very happy here, and I often think of my father, he loved this country.</span> <span id="s2029">The lower east side of New York.</span> <span id="s2030">He loved it.</span> <span id="s2031">My mother had another sister who was a very active with a Jewish newspaper here in New York, is it Forward?</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: “The Forward.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2034">Yes.</span> <span id="s2035">But she passed away.</span> <span id="s2036">She lived there, downtown New York.</span> <span id="s2037">I used to visit her quite often.</span> <span id="s2038">So that’s my life history.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: Is there anything else we – you would like to say that we haven’t covered?</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: What else to say to you?</span> <span id="s2041">You know, my son, when he was 20 years old and was in medical school, he fell in love with a very lovely Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s2042">And I – I thought they were a little bit too young to marry, but he insisted – they were both 20 – he insisted they get married.</span> <span id="s2043">They got married, they had a little apartment near GW where he was going to medical school.</span> <span id="s2044">And I thought everything was beautiful until about maybe six or seven months after they got married, he ask us to come over and we did.</span> <span id="s2045">And she was sitting next to the window, and I says, what is it sweetheart?</span> <span id="s2046">Maybe we come here maybe too often, I thought, maybe it’s too much for her.</span> <span id="s2047">She says no, you know, I love you, but I just don’t want to be married any more.</span> <span id="s2048">And it was a terrific blow to him, really bad.</span> <span id="s2049">She was the one who got the divorce and as far as I know, to this day she didn’t remarry.</span> <span id="s2050">So then he met this girl, and she’s not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2051">And he married her, and seem like a good marriage.</span> <span id="s2052">She works for the World Bank.</span> <span id="s2053">She’s a good mother.</span> <span id="s2054">I would have preferred marry a Jewish girl, but who am I to say something?</span> <span id="s2055">And he seems to be working out very nicely.</span> <span id="s2056">He took over the psychiatric division of the hospital in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and he directed now a play in the theater, he goes in his father’s footsteps.</span> <span id="s2057">And he wants me to move there.</span> <span id="s2058">So I don’t know what life will bring, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s2059">And I think it’s very nice of you to sit here and listen to me for such a long time.</span> <span id="s2060">You must be exhausted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Well, thank you very, very much for doing this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: You’re very welcome.</span> <span id="s2063">It was my pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial
