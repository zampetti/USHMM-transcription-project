Just -- if we could begin by just having you say your full name, including your maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: My what?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Your full name, including your maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s20">Okay, I do -- I do begin.</span> <span id="s21">I’m Gerda Haas, born Gerda Schild, in Anspach, Germany and I’m now sitting in Minneapolis in my very comfortable home, with the sun coming in on all sides and you, Katie Davis are interviewing me on this September the 23rd, I believe, is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: 25th.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: 25th?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Right.</span> <span id="s26">And I understand that the purpose of the interview is to -- to talk mainly, but not exclusively about life after liberation and I really like to do that.</span> <span id="s27">When I first received the letter from the United States Holocaust Museum about your visit to me, I -- I really, seriously began thinking about my life after liberation.</span> <span id="s28">And it seemed a good time, too.</span> <span id="s29">This is -- in the Jewish calendar, this is what we call the Assera siamata shuva, the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, where we are supposed to think about our lives and what we have done and have we done it correctly, have we any regrets?</span> <span id="s30">Would you like to do it any differently?</span> <span id="s31">And it seemed a very appropriate time to -- to -- to go through my 75 -- 75 and a half years on this earth and thank you for giving me that opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: [inaudible] One thing we wanted to ask you, was to have you state the full name of your parents and including the maiden name of your mother.</span> <span id="s33">Both your father and your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s35">I’ll be happy to do that.</span> <span id="s36">My maiden name was Schild, that’s spelled S-c-h-i-l-d.</span> <span id="s37">My father’s name was Siegfried Schild, good German name and he came from a very small town on the Mian river, by the name of Hessdorf.</span> <span id="s38">And he was a butcher and in those days, families had to marry off their sons and daughters for a purpose, so since he was a butcher, a -- my grandparents looked for an opportunity for him to marry into a butcher shop.</span> <span id="s39">It was as simple as that.</span> <span id="s40">That’s the way it was in the olden days.</span> <span id="s41">And there was this Paula Yoksburger in Anspach, who was one of five daughters and her parents, my grandparents, Sophie and Gabriel Yoksburger were very hard up to marry off their five daughters without money.</span> <span id="s42">You see, in those days you needed to have money to marry off a daughter.</span> <span id="s43">And finally, they knew of this young man in Hessdorf who was looking for a -- what they called a shiduch, a -- a match between himself and someone who was somewheres in the butcher business.</span> <span id="s44">And it worked out fine, even though my mother was two years older and I’m sure there was no great love, but it was a marriage in those days that was called very appropriate and very good and it -- it was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: What did your maternal grandparents do?</span> <span id="s46">Wa-Was the -- your maternal grandfather a butcher?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Yes, he had a butcher shop in Anspach, no sons and he needed to have a son-in-law that would step into his butcher shop.</span> <span id="s50">And, as a matter of fact, he died very soon after his daughter’s sa -- his -- his daughter Paula was married to this young butcher boy from Hessdorf and it -- it worked out just wonderfully.</span> <span id="s51">He died and the son-in-law stepped into the butcher shop in Anspach and there was my mother and father and soon after -- a year after the marriage there was one daughter, my sister Freidel and two and a half years after that, I arrived, Gerda.</span> <span id="s52">And the only regret my father had up to his dying day, that he didn’t have a son.</span> <span id="s53">In Anspach, it would have been necessary to hand the butcher shop over to a son.</span> <span id="s54">But as it turned out, that reason fell completely away and I guess he got over not having a son.</span> <span id="s55">He -- he -- he was okay with his two daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Do you know anything more about your family in Anspach, how long they had been there and had been butchers?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes, I did a little research on my family at one time.</span> <span id="s58">The Schild family -- the ones that lived in Hessdorf, my father’s side of the family, apparently came out of Spain in the 17th or 18th century with that wave of emigration that -- that -- that was triggered by the e-emancipation in Spain.</span> <span id="s59">And apparently that’s where my family comes from, because my Jewish na -- my Hebrew name is Sprinza, which is Esperanza for -- for a young girl.</span> <span id="s60">And apparently I had a grandmother or a great-grandmother or some female ancestor -- ancestress I would say, a female ancestor, who -- who was a Spaniard.</span> <span id="s61">And apparently that’s what happened on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s62">On my mother’s side, the story is that we came -- that they came from a very small town called Yoksburg and as you probably know, in -- in the 18th century, the -- the Jews finally got last names.</span> <span id="s63">Up to then it was Moshe the butcher or Jakob -- Yakob the shoemaker, they didn’t have names.</span> <span id="s64">And apparently, when they -- when the time came, when the decree was passed down that the Jews had to have names, many of them took the name of their town -- of the town they lived in.</span> <span id="s65">So that’s why you have so many Berlinner and Hamburger and -- and of small tow -- Frankfurter or Kissinger.</span> <span id="s66">These are all people that came from particular towns and that’s how my grandparents were named Yoksburger, because they had lived in a small town called Yoksburg, which is very close to Anspach.</span> <span id="s67">You must understand that, in opposition to America, where the Jews are all clustered and -- and congregated in large cities, this was not the case in Europe.</span> <span id="s68">In Europe, Poland, Germany and all the many countries of Europe, the Jewish communities -- the strong Jewish communities were in the small towns, because there the people left them in peace.</span> <span id="s69">There was always anti-Semitism, but in small towns, very frequently they were able to buy themselves the protection of the -- of the lord.</span> <span id="s70">They were called Markgraffen or whoever owned these little towns and by being servile to these feudal lords and being useful to them, they were able to get the protection and they settled in those small towns and they remained very Orthodox, many of them.</span> <span id="s71">There was nothing else, it was Orthodoxy or nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Would you describe the community in Anspach as -- as --</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: -- a strong community by the time that you are aware of it as -- as [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s76">Yes, I would.</span> <span id="s77">We had the -- we had a rabbi who was a -- a leader in -- in -- in the -- in the ge -- in the European German commu -- Jewish community.</span> <span id="s78">His name was Eli Munck.</span> <span id="s79">He wrote several seminal books on -- on the pr -- the prayers, the world of prayer for instance and the call of the Torah.</span> <span id="s80">He was just a very great light in -- in Jewish intelligencia.</span> <span id="s81">And I -- I’d like to say this, which many people forget.</span> <span id="s82">Th-Th-Th-The German rabbis were able to become so great and to devote themselves to writing because they were not hired by the community.</span> <span id="s83">Here, a rabbi is beholden to his board of directors and to his president and to the wives, in order to keep his job and he has very little time to -- to -- to be independent, to think stuff on his own.</span> <span id="s84">But in Europe -- in Germany particularly, religion was a state -- spa -- state sponsored affair.</span> <span id="s85">Each one of us had to pay a religion tax and the Jewish religion tax went to pay the rabbis and upkeep the synagogues and the other -- the Christian religion tax went their way.</span> <span id="s86">So the rabbis were very free and we were very fortunate to have just two fantastic rabbis in a row.</span> <span id="s87">When I was very young, our rabbi was Pinhusk Horn, which was also a name that stands forever in -- in -- in Jewish history of Germany.</span> <span id="s88">And then we had this wonderful Eli Munck, who devoted himself to writing and to bringing up the youngsters, because he knew that the future of Judaism was in the youngsters.</span> <span id="s89">I -- I’d like to say one other thing that only occurred to me very recently.</span> <span id="s90">Th-The rabbis in Germany did not urge the Jews to leave and I remember my parents holding that somewhat against Rabbi Munck.</span> <span id="s91">Why didn’t he say, “Go find yourself another place to go to.”</span> <span id="s92">He never did.</span> <span id="s93">And it only occurred to me very recently that this was for the obvious reason that the rabbis were state employed, you see?</span> <span id="s94">Do you understand what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s95">They couldn’t say that or they -- or Hitler would have knocked them off in a minute.</span> <span id="s96">The rabbis were completely dominated by the state.</span> <span id="s97">And -- and the outgrowth of that thought is thank God for the separation of state and church in this country.</span> <span id="s98">So you -- you live a long time before these things really dawn on you.</span> <span id="s99">You know, we adored this rabbi and we believed everything he said and we did everything he said.</span> <span id="s100">But he didn’t tell us to leave, you see?</span> <span id="s101">Think about that.</span> <span id="s102">Is -- it’s really -- it’s a revelation when that thought came to me.</span> <span id="s103">He himself left with his family, after awhile and saved himself and his many children, but he didn’t tell us to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: How did that revelation change how you thought about him or -- or shift how you processed the whole experience?</span> <span id="s105">Because certainly --</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: -- his story, Rabbi Munck’s story is something that you mentioned several times in the previous interview --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: -- and there was something kind of nagging, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yeah, first of all, I want to spell his name, so people know who I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s111">It was Eli Munck, M-u-n-c-k.</span> <span id="s112">Dr. Eli Munck and he is very famous rabbi.</span> <span id="s113">He left and went to Paris afterwards and founded a -- a fine, deeply religious Jewish community in Paris, Ru cardet.</span> <span id="s114">And I’m still very friendly with many of his children.</span> <span id="s115">Now, how did it affect me?</span> <span id="s116">I adored the man, you see?</span> <span id="s117">In -- in -- in Germany, the rabbi was somewhere between your father and God, equi-distance.</span> <span id="s118">And I particularly liked the Munck family.</span> <span id="s119">I was like a child in their house myself.</span> <span id="s120">And it didn’t change my feelings toward him.</span> <span id="s121">Also, one of the reasons it didn’t change my feelings toward him was when I was liberated -- and now I’m jumping ahead several years -- when I was liberated to Switzerland and ended up in Montrou -- Seulemontre at Laisavont, I found out very soon that Eli Munck and his whole family had fled from Paris and had established themselves in Geneva.</span> <span id="s122">And once I knew that, I got in touch with him and he with me.</span> <span id="s123">And he was the first person I saw again, of my for-former life.</span> <span id="s124">You can’t argue with feelings, you see?</span> <span id="s125">I loved the man and here I saw him again, after all I had gone through and I credited him in a way with my res -- religiosity.</span> <span id="s126">He gave me that strong belief in God and he guided me through my younger years.</span> <span id="s127">My parents were busy and making a living and were very simple people, no education.</span> <span id="s128">And he -- he gave me a lot.</span> <span id="s129">I -- I didn’t change my feelings toward him, I have to say.</span> <span id="s130">It should have, but i-it didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Can you describe that meeting?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s133">I -- I -- I have several pictures of him.</span> <span id="s134">We were very friendly here, in this count -- after Switzerland, after I got to his -- this country, he went back -- he and his family went back to Paris and then he retired and I can’t tell you now the year, but it must have been -- oh yes, I can tell you the year.</span> <span id="s135">In the 70’s -- in the 19 six -- late 60’s or early 70’s, he and his wife retired and came over here for the same reason we came to Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s136">They had children in -- living in New York and they came over to retire in New York.</span> <span id="s137">We were still living in Maine at the time and my -- my great admiration and love for him and his wife, went so far as to make a new friendship between them and my husband and myself.</span> <span id="s138">And we visited them several times in New York and he came up to Maine and stayed with us for awhile.</span> <span id="s139">And I have several letters by him and pictures of him.</span> <span id="s140">He was a smallish man, very trim, very neat.</span> <span id="s141">Little beard and dark, alert eyes and he had a little French sing-song accent in his voice, because he was actually born in Paris, but I don’t remember how come.</span> <span id="s142">And his wife was a jolly, roundish, lovely woman, always smiling, always happy a-and I -- I just like them both.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Can you remember back to -- you said that he was the first person from your former life that you saw in Switzerland, but remember back to that meeting and what you talked about -- what you talked about at that meeting and whether or not perhaps you prayed together?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No -- well, he was -- I -- I have to tell you a very funny story.</span> <span id="s145">When we came to Switzerland -- and I like to talk about that at some more length later on, but just now, in connection with my great friendship with Eli Munck, when I was liberated to Switzerland, we -- that whole transport, were again put into a lager -- into a concentration lager, it was nothing like what I just came out of, it was the grand hotel in mont -- in -- in Seulemontre, in Laisavont.</span> <span id="s146">I might have a picture of it, it was a gorgeous hotel that was emptied out for us, so that we -- these 12 hun -- it wasn’t the whole group, it was maybe 300 people, could be put up in great comfort with this gorgeous view of Lake Geneva below us and Montplant on the other sides and -- and all the mountains around us, so don’t think it was a -- a concentration camp, but it was a concentrating lager so that we could be controlled.</span> <span id="s147">We couldn’t roam around.</span> <span id="s148">We had to check in and check out, we had guards on the doors.</span> <span id="s149">We had to always be in -- tell them where we went.</span> <span id="s150">And so, I wanted to visit my beloved Rabbi Munck in Geneva.</span> <span id="s151">And somehow -- I don’t know how, I got myself a ticket to -- to go there on the -- on the train.</span> <span id="s152">It’s -- it’s very -- it’s a very short distance, as you know.</span> <span id="s153">It’s just a -- a little bit around on the lake of Geneva.</span> <span id="s154">And I asked for permission to -- to go and the permission was denied.</span> <span id="s155">And you know what I did?</span> <span id="s156">I left secretly, on my own, to see my beloved rabbi.</span> <span id="s157">And you know what happened?</span> <span id="s158">Two Swiss policemen caught me on the train station in Montrou as I was just about to step onto that train and took me back and put me into what was like a -- a little solitary confinement.</span> <span id="s159">Again, in great luxury, but it was a locked door and a locked window and I had my food passed in and out.</span> <span id="s160">This because I needed so badly to see the rabbi and his family.</span> <span id="s161">Can you believe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: You disobeyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: I disobeyed.</span> <span id="s164">I thought -- I thought this was more important than -- I c -- I couldn’t even understand why they didn’t grant me the -- so then, to follow up on the story, I -- the rabbi heard about it, because I had told them to meet me at the train, so I had to somehow tell them that I was now imprisoned at the Grand Hotel in -- in Laisavont, so they came to see me.</span> <span id="s165">And I don’t believe that they let me out.</span> <span id="s166">I think we talked through the window.</span> <span id="s167">I -- I don’t have a recollection of actually seeing them, but we saw each other and -- and it was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s168">So then afterwards, when things loosened up a little -- this was very soon after I got there and in a way I really don’t blame them.</span> <span id="s169">We weren’t allowed to roam Switzerland at will, so here was my -- my petition was denied, but then after awhile -- this was in February, or say March, then in April, at Paisa -- Passover time, they allowed me to join the Munck family for Paisa.</span> <span id="s170">The things that I remember now, after all these years.</span> <span id="s171">And the funny thing is, tho-those Munck children, who were then -- well, the oldest daughter is six years younger than I am, so I was 20 -- I was 23 when I got out of -- was I?</span> <span id="s172">I think I was 20 f -- 23 or four when I got out of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s173">So she was six years younger and she remembers this very well.</span> <span id="s174">I’m still in great contact with them.</span> <span id="s175">She is now l-lady -- the Lady Acobowitz.</span> <span id="s176">She is now the -- the wife of the Chief Rabbi of -- the former Chief Rabbi of England -- of Great Britain.</span> <span id="s177">And we often exchange little remembrances like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Since we’re talking about this, I’ll just continue on with a few more questions about this.</span> <span id="s179">Can you tell us about going for Passover?</span> <span id="s180">I’m assuming that would be the first time you really celebrated in your faith --</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: -- after the experience of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: It was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: I remember that there was one little piece of chicken for the whole family and frau -- Dr. Munck cut it into very, very small pieces and everybody had just a little bit to eat, but it was the very first time that I ate chicken again.</span> <span id="s186">How strange that I should remember that instead of -- instead of some very spiritual emotions.</span> <span id="s187">I-It was just an emotional event.</span> <span id="s188">It was just a very emotional event.</span> <span id="s189">I was, of course, very friendly with the -- with the children that were born in Anspach, but since then they had had three more and so I was involved with those babies and -- and talking -- the one thing I remember, we didn’t talk about the Holocaust at all.</span> <span id="s190">They didn’t talk about their flight to Switzerland and I didn’t talk about my time in Theresienstadt and I didn’t talk about losing my mother and sister.</span> <span id="s191">Of course, at that point, I was still hoping to find them.</span> <span id="s192">So, it was just great to be able to travel and to -- to walk the streets and not be picked up by either Ger-Germans or Swiss, that was so funny.</span> <span id="s193">And it was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Th-There is one question I have about war time, a-and it is -- it is related to this.</span> <span id="s195">And it’s, when you were in Theresienstadt, if -- if you could talk a little bit about your relationship with God at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: With God?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: During the time that you were in the camp, were you praying, talking to God?</span> <span id="s198">What were your thoughts about your faith and your experience [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Good question, good question and it’s a question that is to date unresolved, but I’ll -- I’ll try to go back.</span> <span id="s200">I ca -- I come from a very basic Orthodox family.</span> <span id="s201">No great learning, but just simple, basic belief that God wrote the Torah and whatever is in the Torah, because God wrote it, you obey it.</span> <span id="s202">You don’t ask why, you don’t argue, you don’t go into discussions, you just do it.</span> <span id="s203">This actually helped me, because I so basically and -- and organically believed all this.</span> <span id="s204">You see, you say your night prayers every night, you get rid of all the bad things that happened during the day and you only focus on -- on -- on asking for the good things, for the health of your parents and your grandparents and your sister and your teachers and your rabbi.</span> <span id="s205">And this helped me a great deal because unquestioningly, I believed that right through the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s206">I remember having the first qualms about it, when I actually learned that my mother and sister had been killed so cruelly.</span> <span id="s207">My mother, this religious person who gave me all that wonderful belief, how could she have been killed?</span> <span id="s208">And my sister, who believed just as I did?</span> <span id="s209">And I -- I remember changing places, actually, with God.</span> <span id="s210">I -- my belief was always I had to account for the things I did wrong and all of a sudden it occurred to me, what about the things God did wrong?</span> <span id="s211">Doesn’t He have a responsibility to me too, that He killed my mother and my sister and my aunts and uncles and cousins.</span> <span id="s212">All my friends, everybody I had with the all -- sole exception of my father.</span> <span id="s213">And you know, you are -- you were so ingrained with that fear of coming up to heaven when you die and you have to give an account of yourself and it occurred to me very suddenly, God will have to give an account to me, too.</span> <span id="s214">And from then on, my faith reverted itself.</span> <span id="s215">I remember that very clearly, because it was a great struggle.</span> <span id="s216">My father remained completely religious.</span> <span id="s217">I asked him once what he thought of his wife and daughter being slaughtered like -- li -- like -- like the 6,000,000 were and everybody knows now -- we didn’t know at the time and we didn’t want to know.</span> <span id="s218">But once we knew how they died, I asked him once, “Doesn’t that impair your faith a little bit?”</span> <span id="s219">He said, “That’s the way God wanted it.</span> <span id="s220">God did it.</span> <span id="s221">God gave them life and God took it away.”</span> <span id="s222">I guess it’s one way of looking at it.</span> <span id="s223">We never ask why we are born, so we really have no reason to ask why he takes life away from us.</span> <span id="s224">But anyway, what was your question?</span> <span id="s225">How it impair -- so now my -- I’m still Orthodox.</span> <span id="s226">I still observe all the things that I learned in my youth.</span> <span id="s227">Number one, because I never wanted to disappoint my father.</span> <span id="s228">Number two, because I married a very religious man and number three, it -- it gives meaning to my life, you know?</span> <span id="s229">You observe the holidays, it’s great, the family gathers around the Yuntive table and -- and you go to synagogue.</span> <span id="s230">But that basicness that I have mentioned before, that -- that organic feeling, that’s gone.</span> <span id="s231">Now I observe the religion for -- for other reasons.</span> <span id="s232">Because I -- I have to do something.</span> <span id="s233">I have to believe in something.</span> <span id="s234">And also, one of the great reasons that I -- I still -- that I haven’t changed my ways at all is that actually God was very good to me.</span> <span id="s235">Look at my life.</span> <span id="s236">I have a great husband, I have four very, very nice children.</span> <span id="s237">I have four very nice in-law children.</span> <span id="s238">I have 11 grandkids.</span> <span id="s239">Not one of them is retarded or has crooked teeth or -- or cross-eyed or club feet.</span> <span id="s240">They’re all great people.</span> <span id="s241">So how can I not be grateful?</span> <span id="s242">How can I -- how can I be so arrogant as to say, “No, I don’t believe any more.”</span> <span id="s243">I di -- I didn’t deserve it.</span> <span id="s244">I didn’t deserve this 50 years of sunshine in my life.</span> <span id="s245">So I live with the -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas and this is tape number one, side B. Can you tell us about -- can you tell us about how you observed your faith when you were still in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes, I -- I’d like very much to talk about that.</span> <span id="s248">Let me just go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s249">After I left my parents home, at the age of just barely 18, just after my 18th birthday, in 1941 and -- in 1940 -- and went to Berlin to train as a nurse, I did -- I -- I joined the Jewish hospital in Berlin, asking immediately to be put onto the kosher side.</span> <span id="s250">At that point there was still a small table of kosher people and actually, I was able to eat kosher throughout those years that I was in -- in the Jewish hospital in Berlin.</span> <span id="s251">I don’t think I observed the Sabbath quite the way I -- I should have, but I surely didn’t go out and -- and gallivant around.</span> <span id="s252">I may have worked, but I didn’t do anything else.</span> <span id="s253">And then when I got to Theresienstadt -- and this is all still radiating from my childhood, you see, unquestioningly what ga -- God does, is the right thing.</span> <span id="s254">And then I got to Theresienstadt and then of course the food became a big problem.</span> <span id="s255">And I remember to this day, the struggle I had with myself when I finally decided that I’m going to eat that soup that had those little pieces of -- of sinister looking meat floating around in them.</span> <span id="s256">I -- I refused them for a long time, but finally I thought maybe I -- I should, in order to keep my strength up.</span> <span id="s257">And I remember quite well what a struggle that was.</span> <span id="s258">And after I had decided to do that, I -- I continued to -- to eat that -- that horrible stuff.</span> <span id="s259">Whether it did me any good or not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s260">But when I got to Switzerland, I again asked to be put into the kosher contingency.</span> <span id="s261">I-I-It didn’t work out quite that va - mu -- that way, but I’ll tell you about that later.</span> <span id="s262">And in Theresienstadt, I did continue my -- my nightly prayers.</span> <span id="s263">That became a habit, it made me feel good.</span> <span id="s264">I could fall asleep easily and I felt it was just very necessary to pray for my people.</span> <span id="s265">I knew they weren’t sitting on beds of roses.</span> <span id="s266">And I didn’t know where my father was and how he was faring and of course I always prayed that I would see everybody again.</span> <span id="s267">And I -- I think that answers your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: And you talked about a period when you began to shift and you -- as you said, traded thr -- places with God and -- and thought about how God needed to be accountable.</span> <span id="s269">When -- about when was that?</span> <span id="s270">You said it was when you realized your mother really had been killed very cruelly.</span> <span id="s271">Just approximately the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Well, I would say -- I would say that was in the 1950’s, when I definitely became aware that they were not coming back.</span> <span id="s273">Up to then, you know how it is, if you don’t see them die, they are not dead.</span> <span id="s274">Oh yes, 6,000,000 were killed, but not my mother and not my sister.</span> <span id="s275">And that feeling that the next telephone call is theirs.</span> <span id="s276">Or the next person you meet in a party is my sister and she had amnesia and she doesn’t know who she is and I recognize her and I bring back all the memories.</span> <span id="s277">These are the dreams and the hopes and the prayers that you have for a long time, until it finally sinks in that they really are dead.</span> <span id="s278">And I -- I kind of remember too, when -- when that finally happened.</span> <span id="s279">When it finally sank in.</span> <span id="s280">I guess it was when my father remarried.</span> <span id="s281">I guess then I finally gave up.</span> <span id="s282">But for a -- for a long time you -- you just -- you just don’t want to believe that.</span> <span id="s283">I -- I’d like to say something about death as such.</span> <span id="s284">Th-The -- my mother, of course, as I have said in my previous interview, was killed in Riga and most probably in -- in the woods in front of the firing squads.</span> <span id="s285">And it was a long, long, long, many years before I could say that without breaking down.</span> <span id="s286">And I’m not even sure I can do it now.</span> <span id="s287">And my sister -- it’s not very clear to me whether she was killed in -- in Auschwitz or also in front of a firing squad, but again, after I knew all that, I was still hoping maybe they died already in the -- in the trains, so that they wouldn’t have to -- to do that horrible end.</span> <span id="s288">But I wanted to say something about my father’s death.</span> <span id="s289">My father died in 1986, only 12 years ago, at the age of 92.</span> <span id="s290">And I, at that time was about 65 years old, is that correct?</span> <span id="s291">Or 63?</span> <span id="s292">Anyway, I was a -- certainly a very middle aged woman.</span> <span id="s293">And until then, I had not seen a relative of mine die of a natural death.</span> <span id="s294">And you know, it was almost a jubilation that I was able to see someone die naturally.</span> <span id="s295">That I -- I -- that I could sit Shiva, that I could all the things that one does for the dead.</span> <span id="s296">And I -- I -- I remember almost a feeling of joy.</span> <span id="s297">Of -- of -- of -- of fulfillment.</span> <span id="s298">It was very strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Were you and your father ever able to formally mark your mother’s death in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Well, we needed to keep a day for -- for Yahrtzeit, for the observation of the dead and at the time, the rabbis said that we could pick any day we wanted to.</span> <span id="s301">There was a choice of picking their birthdays or the day they were evacuated, or -- or Yom Kippur, which is coming up next week.</span> <span id="s302">A lot of people simply keep Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s303">I decided, since my husband’s mother died and we kne -- she died a natural death in Frankfurt and we of course knew the death date, I decided to s -- to pick that very day and I observe my mother’s and my sister’s Yahrtzeit at that particular date and my husband observes not only his mother’s death, who-who he knows and who is buried in Frankfurt, but also his two sisters, with their five children -- six chil -- six children -- that were killed an unknown date.</span> <span id="s304">And so, at that particular day at my mother-in-law’s day of Yahrtzeit, we light one, two, three, four, five -- we light ten Yahrtzeit lits for the people that we -- for the immediate people that we lost.</span> <span id="s305">And that’s how we resolved that particular problem.</span> <span id="s306">But did you ask me whether my father and I ever talked about my mother and my sister?</span> <span id="s307">You didn’t ask me that, but I --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: But I’d like to.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Please do.</span> <span id="s310">No.</span> <span id="s311">And that is a great source of anguish to me.</span> <span id="s312">For a long time, I -- I felt resentment that my father had left us, actually.</span> <span id="s313">I remember the day in August, the first of Augu -- no, the last days of -- the first of July in 1939, when he left on a transport to -- to Engla-England.</span> <span id="s314">And of course we hoped to follow very soon, but then the war came and we were separated, permanently, in my mother’s and sister’s case, not in mine.</span> <span id="s315">And I -- I remember feeling great resentment against that, which was illogical and uncalled for.</span> <span id="s316">But again, feelings are feelings and you ha -- you have to deal with them.</span> <span id="s317">And I particularly felt very guilty -- or -- about my mother’s and sister’s death.</span> <span id="s318">For some strange reason, I thought that I could have saved them, or I could have done -- done something for them, or I should have gone with them and be there, too.</span> <span id="s319">And my father, apparently never had these feelings.</span> <span id="s320">At least, he never voiced them in his long, long life.</span> <span id="s321">And to the very end -- I stayed with him a month before he died, knowing that he would be dying and I hung on every word of his that he still said and I was so hoping that he would say a word of -- of -- of explanation or resent -- or regret or sorrow or apology or something.</span> <span id="s322">But he didn’t and I live with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Did you ask about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No, we didn’t have that kind of a relationship.</span> <span id="s325">We weren’t brought up to question our parents.</span> <span id="s326">But I had such a guilt feeling that I actually had to go to a psychiatrist to get rid of it.</span> <span id="s327">But he apparently had not.</span> <span id="s328">And I also resented a little bit -- again, for totally illogical, because the man was 45 years old when he was alone, I resented a little bit ha -- that he married again.</span> <span id="s329">But that was, of course, stupid.</span> <span id="s330">But there is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Di-Did you ever become close with his second wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: No, unfortunately, I didn’t and I’m -- I’m very sorry about that now.</span> <span id="s333">Because she too lost a husband and two sons in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s334">And she looked to me for a replacement and I just seem -- didn’t seem to understand that.</span> <span id="s335">And just the last few years, I -- I really feel that -- that I missed the boat there.</span> <span id="s336">That I really could have done a lot better.</span> <span id="s337">But, you know, there is a [indecipherable] we had a -- a friend who was from Vienna and he -- he didn’t distinguish himself in any way, he was just a simple fellow, but he will be remembered in my family for something he said.</span> <span id="s338">And he always said to us, in his heavy Viennese accent, “You get too old too soon and too smart, too late.”</span> <span id="s339">And how true that is.</span> <span id="s340">I -- I got too smart much too late after my stepmother was long dead, I realized that I -- I really could have done a lot better.</span> <span id="s341">Well, that’s one of the things God can call me to task for.</span> <span id="s342">And He probably will and He should.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: I want to have you think back to right in th-the week or two before you leave Theresienstadt and what is your physical state at that point?</span> <span id="s344">How are you doing physically and mentally?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Well, I was in very good shape.</span> <span id="s346">Number one, I was young.</span> <span id="s347">And number two, I had worked myself up into a nurse’s position in -- into a supervisory nurse’s position in the children home.</span> <span id="s348">And that meant I got S ration -- r-ration -- special ration.</span> <span id="s349">I had no longer to go with my little food pot to -- to the window where they dished out a little ladle of soup and the next one pushed right after me and I had to leave.</span> <span id="s350">The soup was now brought to the children’s home and we had enough of that.</span> <span id="s351">Also, at that point -- I’m sure I spoke of that in my earlier recollections, I -- I had a young man who -- who liked me very much.</span> <span id="s352">It didn’t amount to anything because you know, we had curfew, we couldn’t get together, but he -- he just adored me.</span> <span id="s353">He was the brother of one of the women whose baby was in the nursing home.</span> <span id="s354">So he came and he -- he worked in the co -- into -- in the concentration camp’s bakery.</span> <span id="s355">And he, from time to time, brought me and my f -- and the woman I lived with, Eva, my girlfriend Eva, bread.</span> <span id="s356">And of course that was a lifesaver.</span> <span id="s357">It really, really was.</span> <span id="s358">And also -- you see, the Swiss people -- the -- I’m sorry, the Czech people that were in Theresienstadt were allowed to get packages and from time to time, the Czech women that we -- we lived with in that basement of ours, below the children’s home, would grudgingly share their apples or their little bits of f-food that they had, with us.</span> <span id="s359">There was a great divide between the Czech prisoners and us, but once in awhile they s -- they had pity on us.</span> <span id="s360">So I was in pretty good condition and I was picked because I was in good condition.</span> <span id="s361">We all -- y-you know the story how I was saved.</span> <span id="s362">It was 1200 Jews, each one of them had to appear before the Commandant Ram and we were picked for our looks, you see.</span> <span id="s363">If we were dehydrated and emaciated, out.</span> <span id="s364">So I was number seven -- s -- I was number 1174 and Eva was 1173 and we looked good, so we left.</span> <span id="s365">And on the train to Theresienstadt, we got all those delicacies that we didn’t even know what they were.</span> <span id="s366">Who had [indecipherable] -- who had ever seen a banana before?</span> <span id="s367">Who knew what a sardine looked like?</span> <span id="s368">So we gorged ourselves before we even got to Switzerland and in Switzerland -- I do need to say something about the feeling that is still so vivid with me, of freedom.</span> <span id="s369">Wh-What actually is freedom?</span> <span id="s370">Freedom at that point was air that smelled good.</span> <span id="s371">Air that you could take in and breathe.</span> <span id="s372">And people who were smiling.</span> <span id="s373">People on the -- on the station that looked up and smiled at you.</span> <span id="s374">People who didn’t wear stars and had nice clothes and stockings on.</span> <span id="s375">And mainly, freedom was people in uniform that didn’t hit you.</span> <span id="s376">People in uniform that spoke courteously to you.</span> <span id="s377">And freedom was beautiful landscape and -- and -- and -- and looking out the window and not being shouted at or shot at.</span> <span id="s378">And -- and freedom was just a -- a great relief.</span> <span id="s379">And also freedom was not to have -- I’ll say it in -- not in the negative, but in the positive, freedom was to have lights at night, to have a ci -- a -- a city lit up, you see?</span> <span id="s380">I had lived 12 years and six of tho -- 12 years in Nazi regime and six of those in war and every night you were taken to prison if you had a little light shining through.</span> <span id="s381">And here was this Switzerland with all the lights blazing.</span> <span id="s382">I couldn’t get over it the first night.</span> <span id="s383">Why aren’t they tel -- why aren’t they blacking out their -- it was -- don’t you forget, it was still war.</span> <span id="s384">I got to Switzerland in February -- 12th, I believe.</span> <span id="s385">And the war didn’t end and they had all their lights on.</span> <span id="s386">That’s freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: At what point did you realize you were free or truly feel free?</span> <span id="s388">Was there one moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s390">That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s391">I think perhaps it was when they told us to rip off the star and put lipstick on.</span> <span id="s392">I don’t recall that particular -- I think it was when I looked out the window and saw the people smiling and that was all -- what I have said there in such verbiosity was all just one little moment in my life.</span> <span id="s393">We got into Switzerland, th-the SS came thr -- it wasn’t the SS any more, it was the -- the Red Cross people came through, told us to rip off the star and put up -- put on lipstick and we opened up the windows.</span> <span id="s394">And then the Swiss p -- the Swiss gendarmes in their uniforms came through.</span> <span id="s395">I think that was the moment.</span> <span id="s396">And they called us nice, with names and smiled and -- and asked what we wanted and we looked -- I remember that, looking out the window, so we would le -- Eva and I -- Eva and I were inseparable at that point and I’ll have something to say about that in a moment.</span> <span id="s397">But I remember we let down the window and looked out and we smelled that air and -- of course, I’m repeating myself, but that was -- I think that was the moment.</span> <span id="s398">I -- I wanted to just say something about Eva and I being so inseparable and it ties in with the questions about religion that you asked before.</span> <span id="s399">Eva was not religious and she opted -- wh-when we got to Sengale and we had a list of -- of so -- so-called concentration hotels that we could request and she wanted to go to Les Auvants, there were others who off -- other ki -- hotels or places that offered kosher food, which I would have chosen.</span> <span id="s400">But she wanted so much to go to Les Auvants and I did not want to lose her, that I went to Les Auvants with her.</span> <span id="s401">And I remember that I -- that I didn’t eat the meat then any more, because I was so close to my old rabbi again.</span> <span id="s402">But anyway, I didn’t stay in Les Auvants very long and -- and then I went to an old friend of mine from -- from the city of Kissingin, that I found in Lucerne.</span> <span id="s403">And there again, you see, Kissinger is named because he came from that city of Kissingin, where I had a close friend.</span> <span id="s404">And when this friend of mine from -- formerly from Kissingin whose name was -- was Truda Lustig at the time, but who had married a Swiss guy by the name of Erelinger.</span> <span id="s405">When she heard that I was in that Les Auvants transport, she immediately requested that I come to her home and there I was completely rehabilitated to Kashrut and Shomair Shabbat and the whole bit.</span> <span id="s406">Oh, what a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: I -- I want to go back, actually, to the train.</span> <span id="s408">And I believe in your -- in your previous interview, you mentioned that an SS officer walked through and he said something --</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: -- behave and say nice things --</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: And think -- think of us with nice thoughts.</span> <span id="s412">Think of us kindly.</span> <span id="s413">What a farce.</span> <span id="s414">Oh, you remembered that from my interview?</span> <span id="s415">I remember it, too.</span> <span id="s416">Remember that we treated you nicely.</span> <span id="s417">What a farce.</span> <span id="s418">But we were so taken up with our own emotions, oh, the heck with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Were you frightened at all when he said something like that?</span> <span id="s420">Did you feel that perhaps the arm of the SS, if you didn’t say the right thing, could follow you?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: You know, you -- you know, you are asking a very good question and I need to come back to that later.</span> <span id="s422">Because we were frightened, we thought the SS were reaching -- we -- we had been living in fear for 12 years.</span> <span id="s423">In fear for our possessions and our lives and our people.</span> <span id="s424">Fear doesn’t go away the minute you open a window and smell freedom.</span> <span id="s425">So, yes, I would say we did.</span> <span id="s426">But I -- I -- let’s be sure that I say something about that fear that had repercussions to this very day.</span> <span id="s427">I’ll -- I’ll -- I’ll say it later, you had some other questions, didn’t you?</span> <span id="s428">Perhaps I’d better say it now, because i-it does fit into the fear business.</span> <span id="s429">When we got to Les Auvants, after he had told us to remember him kindly, I forgot that.</span> <span id="s430">Consciously I forgot it, but very obviously, sub-consciously I didn’t, because when we got to Les Auvants, one of the first things I needed to do, was to write down things from the past 12 years.</span> <span id="s431">I don’t know what the other people did, but I si-simply had this -- this -- this need to get rid of all this.</span> <span id="s432">You see, here -- here I came out of Theresienstadt into this luxury hotel with all the food I wanted, with that view in front of me and I needed a transition.</span> <span id="s433">And so I asked for a typewriter and -- and some paper, which I got and I stayed in my room for several days and just catharsis.</span> <span id="s434">And -- and then I met -- how I met Dr. Clay, I do not remember.</span> <span id="s435">I think I met him through Eli Munck.</span> <span id="s436">I met -- I met a man by the name of Dr. Clay, who was an official with the Swedish embassy -- embassy, I believe.</span> <span id="s437">He -- he was high up.</span> <span id="s438">And when he heard that I had written things down, he wanted it.</span> <span id="s439">And I let him have a copy of everything I wrote, with the condition that he not use my name.</span> <span id="s440">I still have his letter -- I can show it to you, where he answers me that he will of course honor my request.</span> <span id="s441">He would like to publish what I wrote, but he will not name me, Gerda Schild, by name.</span> <span id="s442">Now, in the 19 -- late 1980’s or even 90’s, I read a book -- I forgot the name of the author, we can look it up, by the title “Stella”, a famous book where a -- a Berlin -- a survivor of the Holocaust who stayed in Berlin, one of the hidden Jews, writes about Berlin.</span> <span id="s443">And I read this book with such intensity, because I was there.</span> <span id="s444">He talks about street corners where I lived and places where I was.</span> <span id="s445">And I come across a section in the book that was my voice.</span> <span id="s446">I -- I could -- I could tell, it was -- I said that.</span> <span id="s447">It was the story of when the nurses came to -- were taken to the Kasalen to help these people a-at the Fabric transport.</span> <span id="s448">And here I am reading, and I said to my husband, “This is my story.”</span> <span id="s449">And I go quick and I see -- I see where he got this from, he -- it’s a very well documented book.</span> <span id="s450">I forgot his name, I can look it up.</span> <span id="s451">And he -- he documents my story, anonymous nurse from Berlin and I -- I look and see where he got it from and by God, he got it out of the publication of Dr. Clay from Geneva.</span> <span id="s452">I wrote to him and I documented -- I wrote him a copy of that letter where Dr. Clay said he will publish it, but without a name and I was really hoping to hear from, but he never answered.</span> <span id="s453">He never answered and that was, of course, at least six or seven years ago.</span> <span id="s454">But, you see, that’s how the ripple of fear goes to -- to 1990.</span> <span id="s455">Here I realized -- and this document of Dr. Clay, I see by his notes -- by his footnotes, is in the librar -- in th -- in the library -- in the national library of Paris, the French National Library of Paris.</span> <span id="s456">Isn’t that some story?</span> <span id="s457">I had goosebumps when I read that.</span> <span id="s458">But the interesting thing is that I kept the Clay letter, that I know that is my story without my name.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Other experiences of fear, for instance, when you were stopped at the train station from visiting Rabbi Munck --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: What was your reaction to the people in uniform stopping you and they took you?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: I know it.</span> <span id="s463">I don’t know -- I don't remember.</span> <span id="s464">I think it was mostly -- well, I -- I don’t recall that, actually.</span> <span id="s465">I -- I do not recall.</span> <span id="s466">Some feelings have fallen through the cracks, because there were other things that were important.</span> <span id="s467">The important thing was to see Munck.</span> <span id="s468">How I felt, I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s469">I must have felt embarrassment.</span> <span id="s470">I -- I -- I’m sorry, I just don’t recall it.</span> <span id="s471">I only remember being taken back by two -- between two Swiss uniformed policemen.</span> <span id="s472">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s473">And being put into that cell -- that Grand Hotel prison.</span> <span id="s474">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s475">I don’t remember what I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas.</span> <span id="s478">This is tape number two, side A. Okay.</span> <span id="s479">Did anyone ever debrief you about your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: You ce -- well, you certainly wrote down things that had happened, but when you got to Switzerland, did the Red Cross people interview you or ask you what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s483">I don’t think we would have told them much, either.</span> <span id="s484">We didn’t feel -- w-we were very afraid.</span> <span id="s485">We were -- freedom had to grow on us very slowly.</span> <span id="s486">And that’s why I -- that’s what I like so much on this country.</span> <span id="s487">Freedom is their birthright.</span> <span id="s488">They don’t even question it.</span> <span id="s489">I like that and that’s why things lik -- like that can’t happen here.</span> <span id="s490">And I -- I -- I always could see it when I was speaking to classes.</span> <span id="s491">They ask such -- such unbelievable questions like after I told them my whole story, how we’re driven out of our home and everything, “Why did you have to leave?</span> <span id="s492">It was your house.”</span> <span id="s493">God bless them, they have freedom written all over them.</span> <span id="s494">You see?</span> <span id="s495">But we had to grow into that feeling of that very slowly.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Do you remember any other occurrences during those first weeks and months where you censored yourself?</span> <span id="s497">Where you found that you didn’t talk about what had happened?</span> <span id="s498">Or that you felt afraid, I guess is what I’m asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s500">I think we were afraid.</span> <span id="s501">D-During the first few months, I think my thoughts ta -- all clustered around the people that were still missing.</span> <span id="s502">I s -- checked every list I could get ahold of to see if my mother and sister would -- would be there.</span> <span id="s503">And I needed to find my father, I had no address for him.</span> <span id="s504">He had left for England, but then he was further evacuated to the United States.</span> <span id="s505">And we had written to each other while I was still in Munich and Berlin, but not any more in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s506">And so I -- I wrote to the Red Cross to s -- to see where -- what his address was, but before the Red Cross answered, he already had found my name on the list of those 1200 that had gone to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s507">And again, through the Red Cross, he sent me a telegram with his address and then he sent money and food and it was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s508">But to you quest -- specifically to your question, I think -- I -- I would say with certainty now, that our thoughts were forward and not backward.</span> <span id="s509">I’d gotten rid of it all, I’d written it down.</span> <span id="s510">D-Don’t forget, I was like 22 or 23 or 24 years old.</span> <span id="s511">I -- I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s512">I wanted to have nice clothes and I wanted to have a boyfriend and I wanted to go out and -- and I -- I was looking forward.</span> <span id="s513">I guess it’s human nature.</span> <span id="s514">I wanted to know where my people were and then I wanted to go on living.</span> <span id="s515">And I did.</span> <span id="s516">I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: How soon -- how soon after your liberation did you hear from your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Oh, I would say within -- within a month, I would say.</span> <span id="s519">Because those lists were immediately publicized.</span> <span id="s520">Don’t you know it was one of the conditions that Himmler set?</span> <span id="s521">He said h-he wanted money and he wanted good publicity in American papers and by gosh, he got it.</span> <span id="s522">I don’t know if it was good publicity, but he got publicity.</span> <span id="s523">The list was published and my father told me later -- he’d by then had a little butcher shop again in -- in New York, that’s all he knew.</span> <span id="s524">He -- all he knew was -- he had no education, so again he opened a little butcher shop and he said one of his customers came in with the New York Times list and he said, “Siegfried, ist dusnich stanna tauter?</span> <span id="s525">Gerda Schild?”</span> <span id="s526">And he looked at it and said, “Yes, that’s my daughter.”</span> <span id="s527">And then he immediately -- somebody helped him to ask the Red Cross where to send the letter to and I heard from him immediately then.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: What did that first telegraph say?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Ah, it was great.</span> <span id="s530">And I remember it.</span> <span id="s531">I still have it.</span> <span id="s532">It said, “Where -- where is mother and -- and sister?</span> <span id="s533">Where -- how come you are alive?”</span> <span id="s534">You know, “Where are the others?”</span> <span id="s535">He gave me quite a gui -- a guilt feeling then, too.</span> <span id="s536">I -- I never was on really intimate terms with him because I -- it was like a monolith sitting between us, unspoken.</span> <span id="s537">But it was always there.</span> <span id="s538">And, in addition to it, I always labored throughout my childhood, under the impression or certainty, I don’t know, that he liked my sister more than me.</span> <span id="s539">So, you know -- but that’s why I spent the months with him before his death, to see if he couldn’t say a word of love to me, but he never did.</span> <span id="s540">He never did, it was not in him.</span> <span id="s541">He never, never did.</span> <span id="s542">It was too bad, but I’m over it.</span> <span id="s543">So, what was your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: What did you write back?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Oh, I cabled him, but it was a prepaid cable, you see, one of those things.</span> <span id="s546">At that point, incidentally, I was as good as engaged to an old boyfriend from home, you see, that again was one of those like arranged marriages and he was here, also, so in the first -- in the first cable that he sent me and he said that he was okay and that this boyfriend of mine, whose name was Lothar, good German name again -- it shows you how integrated we were in Germany, we all had German names.</span> <span id="s547">Nobody was called a Hebrew or an Israeli name, this was unheard of.</span> <span id="s548">So anyway, this Lothar also wanted to know that I was safe and I was ha -- very happy and so I cabled back, with love to both these men, my father and -- and this young man, Lothar.</span> <span id="s549">And I cabled back that I didn’t know where my mother and sister was.</span> <span id="s550">And I have that telegram too, because my father saved everything and gave it to me afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Now, when had this match been made?</span> <span id="s552">At what point?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Oh, it was -- it was really not such a terrible match.</span> <span id="s554">It was, you know -- you know, the young ladies -- young girls in -- in Germany weren’t allowed to -- to have boyfriends or anything.</span> <span id="s555">But this boy, he liked me very much.</span> <span id="s556">He lived in Nuremberg and he came to Anspach all the time to -- to -- so to say, visit his relatives, but he really came to visit me.</span> <span id="s557">And we had, you know, one of those very innocent, very naive romances.</span> <span id="s558">Even so -- oh, I was very young then, I was maybe 15 or 16 and he wasn’t much older.</span> <span id="s559">And the only way that I was allowed to at all go out with him was that my parents said to themselves, “Well, he’ll marry her eventually.”</span> <span id="s560">Oh, that was the whole shooting match.</span> <span id="s561">He liked me enough to really wanted to marry me and he came -- must I tell you all this?</span> <span id="s562">On the day of my engagement to my husband, he came to the door with roses and a little package.</span> <span id="s563">Very obviously he was going to ask me that day to marry him.</span> <span id="s564">So he was more serious than I.</span> <span id="s565">But at that point I had already given my hand and heart to Rudy Haas.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Was he somebody you thought about then, when you were in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Yes, I did -- I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Lothar.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Lothar, yes, I thought of him a great deal.</span> <span id="s570">Why?</span> <span id="s571">It gave me like a -- like a -- a little string to hang on to.</span> <span id="s572">It wasn’t like a lifeline or anything like that, but you know, you couldn’t think about the camp all the time and death and dying and Auschwitz and the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s573">So you thought of other things.</span> <span id="s574">You thought of pleasant things in your former life.</span> <span id="s575">You see, in Theresienstadt, everything was the former life, but in Switzerland, zoom to outer space, to future.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: So you had found your father and tell us again what you had -- or h-how you had looked for your mother.</span> <span id="s577">What were the opportunities available for how you could look for your mother and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Well, in Theresienstadt, I looked for them at all the incoming transports, because at that point, I -- I really hoped that somehow they would show up, too, as I had.</span> <span id="s579">I -- I had no reason to be in Theresienstadt, it was God’s gift to me that I was there.</span> <span id="s580">As you know, it was only for old people and war veterans and very distinguished, prominent Jews and Mishlinger.</span> <span id="s581">So wa -- was -- how did I get there?</span> <span id="s582">So, I thought, as long as I got there, maybe my sister and my mother would get there, too.</span> <span id="s583">So I screened -- I was living in the bar -- in the barracks that overlooked the -- the railroad -- the mouth of the railroad and I was always looking for them.</span> <span id="s584">And then when I got to Switzerland, the only way was to call the Red Cross and ask for them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Did you find yourself, if you met someone who’d been to Riga, let’s say, asking them, or were there other ways you could look, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Not in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s587">Nobody from Riga came to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s588">But I had a distant cousin who was in Riga and who was saved also and I met her in -- in New York again.</span> <span id="s589">She was actually the only person I ever met from Riga.</span> <span id="s590">And, of course nobody saw my mother, because they were killed the minute they got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Well, how did you eventually determine that?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Simply by transport.</span> <span id="s593">I looked it up in the -- in the Yad Vashem books.</span> <span id="s594">I knew the date of her transport, it was -- it was se -- it was nov -- how could I forget this?</span> <span id="s595">I think it was November, 1940.</span> <span id="s596">No, 1941.</span> <span id="s597">Yes, it wa -- no, it was September 1941.</span> <span id="s598">Anyway, I knew the date and I don’t know how I could forget it at this point and I looked that transport up, from Munich to Riga and the fate of the transport is written in very plain language.</span> <span id="s599">They were immediately shot upon arrival, the whole transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: When did you finally do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: When I found that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Looked -- looked -- looked it up?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Oh, that was when we first visited Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s604">It wasn’t so long ago, maybe in the -- in the 70’s.</span> <span id="s605">Yeah, I would say in the 70’s.</span> <span id="s606">But I didn’t know that when I met this girl.</span> <span id="s607">But I know now why she never met my mother and she would have -- she would have seen her.</span> <span id="s608">She -- we were relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: So i-in terms of your mother and your sister, there were sort of incremental periods of acceptance?</span> <span id="s610">In other words, of their death.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: You said that when your father remarried, you really began to think, well my mother is dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Is dead, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: But in fact, you never knew exactly what happened until the 70’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s616">That’s correct.</span> <span id="s617">That’s very correct and -- and the mind plays tricks on you, too.</span> <span id="s618">The mind thinks, oh, it can’t be.</span> <span id="s619">You -- you -- you see, that’s the advantage of the Jewish ob -- ritual of -- of mourning.</span> <span id="s620">It’s -- it’s -- it’s a -- it’s a finite kind of thing.</span> <span id="s621">You grieve, you get it over with and you go on with your life.</span> <span id="s622">If you don’t have that, they are not dead.</span> <span id="s623">You don’t have a grave, you don’t have a date, you never sat Shiva.</span> <span id="s624">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: What ki -- tell us a little bit more about the contact you were having with your father, af-after the initial letters where he asks ab-about your mother and sister, when does -- does he begin to propose the idea that you would go to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Oh yes, that -- well, there was never a question about that, that was -- that was the aim of both of us.</span> <span id="s627">And it took awhile.</span> <span id="s628">I went to the home of my -- of my friend in Lucerne, where I stayed another six months.</span> <span id="s629">It took a whole year before I could -- more than a year before I could emigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s630">The war didn’t end and the -- the -- the -- the American quota system was still from 1914.</span> <span id="s631">It was only after the war that they changed it and the war board finally acknowledged that -- that we could come over.</span> <span id="s632">The Swiss needed to get rid of us.</span> <span id="s633">The Swiss were not hospitable, you see.</span> <span id="s634">The Swiss took us with the under -- I studied this after -- when I wrote my first book, I studied very closely jus-just what happened.</span> <span id="s635">And the condition that they made with -- with -- with Himmler and Muzi and the -- and the Vad har salah, which I have talked about in my previous videotaping, was that the -- the refugees did not stay in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s636">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s637">And as soon as we could, we left.</span> <span id="s638">And then they handed us a bill for our stay at the hotel, which was -- is really something.</span> <span id="s639">But my father gladly paid it, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s640">But no, he did everything he could also, to get me over.</span> <span id="s641">And we saw each other again in -- just -- just during the Passover holidays of 1946.</span> <span id="s642">I arrived by ship and he, being a very religious man, did not come to pick me up.</span> <span id="s643">He stayed in that place where he -- he went to Boston, I arrived in Boston.</span> <span id="s644">And he had been settled in New York.</span> <span id="s645">And he had asked someone -- I guess from the -- from the Joint or something to pick me up.</span> <span id="s646">He did not consecrate the holiday to drive to pick me up.</span> <span id="s647">I -- I didn’t question that at the time.</span> <span id="s648">I -- I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s649">I was so glad to be there and I consecrated the holiday by going in -- with that person who picked me up, I don’t remember who she was.</span> <span id="s650">And my father had asked someone to take him and me in and we stayed there for the holidays.</span> <span id="s651">And th-the -- the predominant remembrance of seeing my father again, he came down the stairs and I was at the bottom of the stairs, coming in the front door and the -- the -- the -- the main impression that stayed with me was that he looked just the way I remembered him.</span> <span id="s652">Young and vibrant and black hair and nicely dressed.</span> <span id="s653">After I had gone through so much, I expected him to -- to had also gone through so much and be an old, white-haired, little old -- the Jewish man.</span> <span id="s654">But he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s655">He was a young, vibrant man and we took it from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: And certainly many people that you had been living with and seeing for the past 12 years --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Had changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: -- they had been through so much and</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: -- had changed, yes, had changed very much.</span> <span id="s660">I guess I hadn’t changed really, either, because I wasn’t really in a killing camp.</span> <span id="s661">I was real-really not that badly off after I heard how everybody else had suffered.</span> <span id="s662">I wanted to say something about living with my friend in Lucerne and that goes to the point I have made before, that the Holocaust governs my whole life.</span> <span id="s663">So in Lucerne, in 1945, when I was rescued and my friend took me in, I took care of her two little kids so that she could go to work.</span> <span id="s664">I was like an au pair, you know?</span> <span id="s665">And that was a very happy time, it was a vibrant, Jewish, religious family.</span> <span id="s666">And Rosh Hashanah came and always the -- the husband brought home stray people from the synagogue to have holidays with -- with the family.</span> <span id="s667">And, you know, I helped in the kitchen, I was st -- you know, I was busy with the whole affairs and I didn’t pay too much attention whom he brought home.</span> <span id="s668">He brought home some American soldiers that year, 1945, to celebrate the Rosh Hashanah holiday with him.</span> <span id="s669">Now I am going to 1985, 40 years later and I’m -- I’m teaching elder hostel at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine and I -- I am teaching the Holocaust, upon the request of elder hostel.</span> <span id="s670">And I have my -- I tal -- taught that for 10 years.</span> <span id="s671">It was a very successful course and I -- I have very good memories of telling people what the Holocaust was all about.</span> <span id="s672">Not just what I’d gone through, but the -- the historical background, I -- I started with anti-Semitism in Germany and --and how Hitler at all got to power and -- and somehow, within that two week course, naturally, I legitimized myself and said that I was there, too, and how I had been saved and went to Switzerland and how I had stayed with this Erelinger family.</span> <span id="s673">And in one of my courses, one white haired man gets up and he says to me, “You state you were very religious at the time and you went to America and you married a physician, didn’t you?”</span> <span id="s674">And I was completely taken aback and I said, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s675">And he was one of the soldiers that Erelinger brought home.</span> <span id="s676">And I had corresponded with him, I had a little bit of a romance with this handsome soldier, he took me out and you know.</span> <span id="s677">And I had rome -- I had co-corresponded with him and I had told him, “Sorry, I got to stop this now, I’m -- I’m getting married next week to this young doctor.”</span> <span id="s678">So he recognized me from what I told him.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: His name was Segal -- Larry Segal.</span> <span id="s681">And I corresponded -- he -- he went home and found some of the letters I wrote.</span> <span id="s682">The Holocaust just stretched out it’s tentacles throughout my life.</span> <span id="s683">There was never any getting away from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Would you have liked to have gotten away from it?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: No.</span> <span id="s686">It’s -- it’s -- it shaped my personality.</span> <span id="s687">I taught the Holocaust, I wrote papers, I wrote two books, I -- I gave lectures and I was able to found the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine, which I’m very gratified for.</span> <span id="s688">And I -- I was a member of the state Board of Education because -- in Maine, because of my experiences.</span> <span id="s689">What does education mean to you, that you didn’t have it, you see?</span> <span id="s690">And it -- it -- it governed my life.</span> <span id="s691">It -- it governed my children’s lives too, but we can talk about that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: As you are waiting to leave and go to the United States, what are your thoughts about leaving Europe, especially when at this point you still do not really know about your mother and your sister?</span> <span id="s693">Do you have misgivings about actually, physically leaving or did you think that you could still trace them from the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: No, I had no qualms about leaving at all.</span> <span id="s695">I remember the train that took us from Baushawitz, which is from Theresienstadt, to Saint Gallen, went through Nuremberg and by -- by implication, it grazed Anspach and there was always this -- this happy moment in former years, when we were on the train, we could see the roof of our house, going through Anspach.</span> <span id="s696">And I remember that I didn’t even want to look.</span> <span id="s697">Out -- out -- out, I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s698">Nothing kept me there, nothing at all.</span> <span id="s699">Yeah, that was something.</span> <span id="s700">I do want to say is something about leaving Berlin, actually.</span> <span id="s701">I -- no, I -- I can’t recall now what I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s702">Ask me something.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s704">Think back to the -- several days before you are preparing to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: To leave Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: No.</span> <span id="s707">I’m talking now about leaving Switzerland and preparing to go to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Ho -- What -- was it difficult to get all these papers in order?</span> <span id="s710">Were you doing it or was your father?</span> <span id="s711">The visa, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Yes, I know what you’re asking me.</span> <span id="s713">Oh no, that went like in a trance, everybody helped.</span> <span id="s714">The Erelinger family, my father.</span> <span id="s715">Lothar sent part of the affidavit and -- and the Swiss helped, of course, coaxing me along.</span> <span id="s716">It was nothing compared to the difficulties that are -- are branded in my brains that we had to go through trying to get out of Germany, you see?</span> <span id="s717">And that is something I can’t forget either and my mother’s letters, which I still have, are filled with that.</span> <span id="s718">She says, “Every day I look for the mail and I think, there must be an affidavit for me now.”</span> <span id="s719">And then she had to wait hours and hours at the Jewish communities in Munich to -- to get a number and she never got one and to get [indecipherable] finally she had the number, then she had to wait hours and hours at the Hapak to get a -- a ship’s passage and just terrible.</span> <span id="s720">Just terrible.</span> <span id="s721">But finally, she -- she gave up.</span> <span id="s722">She didn’t give up, she was taken away.</span> <span id="s723">No, compared to that, getting out of Switzerland was a breeze.</span> <span id="s724">And of course there were no airplanes at the time, so I went in a -- in a boat.</span> <span id="s725">That was a very happy boat ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: T-Tell us about the boat --</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: -- what it looked like, who was on it --</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: -- I -- I re -- it was the SS Mulholland and of course I was ready to fall in love with every person I saw, especially Americans.</span> <span id="s730">And by then I was already very -- very much my old self again.</span> <span id="s731">And I remember that one of the ship’s officers showed me, for the first time, a Life Magazine, with that glossy picture of some pretty woman on the -- on the front, I don’t recall who it was and I remember he’s saying to me, “You could be on that cover yourself.”</span> <span id="s732">So, apparently, at that time, I was already quite nice looking again.</span> <span id="s733">And of course, I was glowing with anticipation of going to America after we had struggled so terribly.</span> <span id="s734">America, it was like -- like -- like a rainbow in the sky.</span> <span id="s735">It’s something that you just -- you see, but you can’t touch, so I was actually going there and I remember asking him lots and lots of questions.</span> <span id="s736">And then he showed me that magazine and tried to tell me a little about America.</span> <span id="s737">It was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: What did you tell him about yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Oh, nothing.</span> <span id="s740">Nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s741">I didn’t talk about the -- the concentration camp for a long time.</span> <span id="s742">I remember when my father took me to New York then and people came to visit -- I remember so clearly, one old lady said to me, “So tell us already, a little bit about the concentration camp.”</span> <span id="s743">And I was simply horrified.</span> <span id="s744">I looked at my father and I said, “Papa,” ca -- you know, like get me out of this.</span> <span id="s745">So he tried to change the subject.</span> <span id="s746">Oh, there was no way I could have opened my mouth about it at all.</span> <span id="s747">Not for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s748">I had nightmares about it constantly, but I never could talk about it.</span> <span id="s749">And except for that strange Jewish old lady, nobody really wanted to know.</span> <span id="s750">Nobody wanted to know.</span> <span id="s751">I remember when I spoke for the very first time at a group -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas.</span> <span id="s753">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: I remember, when I finally got myself to speak about my experiences -- oh, it -- it couldn’t even have been my own, maybe it was just generalization about the Holocaust, I -- I remember -- and that was very much later, that was, I would say, in the 1960’s or even -- yeah, in the 1960’s, that was in Maine and I spoke to a B’nai Brith group of women in somebody’s home.</span> <span id="s755">And here -- and was very difficult for me to get up and speak for the first time.</span> <span id="s756">And next to me or in front of me sat one of the women -- I knew all the women, they were from town and one of them pulled out her knitting and started to knit.</span> <span id="s757">And me being so nervous, I said to her, “Are you going to knit through my whole talk?</span> <span id="s758">Am I going to, you know, hear that clappering of the needles all through the talk?”</span> <span id="s759">Number one, it showed me that she really didn’t care what I was going to say.</span> <span id="s760">And number two, it -- it -- it -- it did make me even more nervous.</span> <span id="s761">And I remember her answering, “If it’s interesting, I’m going to stop.”</span> <span id="s762">So you see the -- the people didn’t really care.</span> <span id="s763">This was a Jewish woman, a young Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s764">And I started to talk and I noticed that she stopped and she didn’t knit any more.</span> <span id="s765">And f-from then on it became a little bit easier for me to talk.</span> <span id="s766">And it be-became more the thing to do to ask me to talk.</span> <span id="s767">Then, after the B’nai Brith, then every other local organization wanted me to talk, then the churches came in, the schools.</span> <span id="s768">And it became easier and easier.</span> <span id="s769">But there was a definite bar.</span> <span id="s770">There was a definite high hurdle that I had to overcome and that the listeners had to overcome.</span> <span id="s771">And once that hurdle was passed, then things were okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: After you left Theresienstadt and perhaps you’re still in Switzerland or you’re in the United States, did you see any photographs of -- these very famous photographs that were coming out, of when the United States and the British troops liberated the camps, the -- did you see these at all and what were your reactions?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: I -- one of the most unforgettable moments in my life is when I saw the photographs for the first time and it was in a moviehouse.</span> <span id="s774">You recall, in years gone by, the first thing they always showed was the -- the -- the -- the newsreel.</span> <span id="s775">And I did see one of those Auschwitz photographs for the first time.</span> <span id="s776">And maybe that was the moment when I believed that my mother and sister were dead.</span> <span id="s777">And i-it was horrible.</span> <span id="s778">And also for the first time, I heard the phrase like -- like animals to the slaughter, from the rabbi in Lewiston, Maine at -- at one of his Rosh Hashanah sermons.</span> <span id="s779">And I was terribly shocked.</span> <span id="s780">That was long before I was able to talk and long before people wanted to listen.</span> <span id="s781">But, you know, it started creeping along and there was no way of holding it back.</span> <span id="s782">It was like water lapping the shore and then -- then the whole flood finally came.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: When was that that you saw the newsreel?</span> <span id="s784">Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Oh, that must have been -- that must have been -- I was married and had one child, so th -- I would say that it was 1948 - ‘49 - ‘50 maybe, at least -- at last.</span> <span id="s786">‘48 - ‘49, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: So you saw the newsreel not right when it came out, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: I didn’t even want to.</span> <span id="s791">I was very busy putting my life together.</span> <span id="s792">Having a -- a -- a fiancé and -- and a husband and the baby and the house and being able to keep all those things.</span> <span id="s793">Nobody was taking them away from me.</span> <span id="s794">It was quite something.</span> <span id="s795">My nightmares were terrible, but my days were heaven.</span> <span id="s796">The nightmares, interestingly enough, never -- I never dream about my mother or my sister.</span> <span id="s797">I think about them a lot, but I n -- I never dream about them.</span> <span id="s798">The nightmares are always that the Nazis are coming to take my children and the life I have now.</span> <span id="s799">Very strange.</span> <span id="s800">But they’re letting off a little bit now.</span> <span id="s801">I still have them.</span> <span id="s802">Now, I have nightmares about the grandchildren.</span> <span id="s803">My last nightmare was the Nazis were coming and my little granddaughter said, “Oh, I want to run upstairs and get my party dress.”</span> <span id="s804">Yeah… But that was at least a year ago, so I haven’t had one for awhile.</span> <span id="s805">I always wake up in a cold sweat with a -- with fibrillations afterwards.</span> <span id="s806">One of the more satisfying moments of my life was when I was able to give a deposition against Alois Brunner.</span> <span id="s807">I saw a little notice in one of the Jewish papers that people who knew the SS man Brunner should come forward and -- and give a deposition to -- at -- in Boston.</span> <span id="s808">I was still living in Maine at the time.</span> <span id="s809">And I called that number and I said, “I remember Brunner only too well and I’m quite ready to give a deposition.”</span> <span id="s810">Nothing became of it.</span> <span id="s811">The Syrians didn’t release him, even so he -- he -- he was quite guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Where had you known him?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Where had you known him?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Yes, he -- he was -- he was one of the key figures in -- in Berlin when we were taken from the hospital to the -- to the Jewish community and were told that from now on, we were the agents of our own destruction.</span> <span id="s816">We jolly well could pick up our own Jews, the SS didn’t have to do that dirty work any more.</span> <span id="s817">And that we could -- that we could do duty in the -- on the trains ourselves, so the SS wouldn’t have to do all that hard work of herding the people into the -- into the -- into the -- into the freight trains.</span> <span id="s818">That was Brunner.</span> <span id="s819">And then he stayed for awhile in Berlin and I remember it very well.</span> <span id="s820">I wrote it all down and you have that on record.</span> <span id="s821">But I don’t know if I told then that I -- I had been able to give a def -- deposition, that was much later.</span> <span id="s822">I was very glad to do that, it was a long, long deposition.</span> <span id="s823">The interesting thing is that the German counsel who -- who took the deposition heard some of the things for the first time.</span> <span id="s824">So I was very happy about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Was it -- did you have to overcome your own fear to go do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: No, that was much later.</span> <span id="s827">That was much, much later.</span> <span id="s828">I wasn’t very comfortable, but it seemed necessary to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: I want to go back chronologically to you being on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: And you befriended this officer and he’s told you some about America.</span> <span id="s832">Do you -- can you tell us about your first glimpses of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Oh yes, oh yes, I can.</span> <span id="s834">I can.</span> <span id="s835">My father had met me in Boston and after the holiday was over, we traveled by train to New York and then he took a taxi from the train station to -- to his home up in Washington Heights and of course I kept looking out of the taxi window the whole time.</span> <span id="s836">It seemed difficult to see the tops of the buildings.</span> <span id="s837">I had never seen a skyscraper before and I was completely aghast at those.</span> <span id="s838">But what even impressed me more were the black people.</span> <span id="s839">At that time they were still called Negroes and what I couldn’t get over was the colors they wore.</span> <span id="s840">Green and purple and -- and red and blue.</span> <span id="s841">Loud, loud colors.</span> <span id="s842">I hadn’t seen colors for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s843">Everything was drab for 12 years.</span> <span id="s844">Black and gray and -- and green, the Nazi uniforms and -- and that was about it.</span> <span id="s845">Nobody wore colors.</span> <span id="s846">And here I saw these black people -- first of all, the black color already, was striking.</span> <span id="s847">I hadn’t seen a black person before.</span> <span id="s848">And then their hair was dark and I had only seen blonde.</span> <span id="s849">And then they had these -- these -- these rainbow colors on them, dresses and shoes and fingernails.</span> <span id="s850">Everything was blazing.</span> <span id="s851">I was very taken aback by that.</span> <span id="s852">And then we got into the house -- my father took me in and of course the apartments were so different, too.</span> <span id="s853">And the people were different, it was -- it was difficult at first, it was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Wh-What was -- what was difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Well, I was still halfway -- half-halfway i-in my former life and now I had all this -- this to cope with, thi -- it -- I think it was difficult and I was still waiting -- I still felt guilty and I was still waiting for my family.</span> <span id="s856">And it was a turmoil.</span> <span id="s857">It was a -- it -- it was -- is a tumultuous time.</span> <span id="s858">Feelings were impinging on me that I -- and impressions that I -- I couldn’t -- that I couldn’t digest right away so quickly and -- and -- and pigeonhole.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: What did your father -- tell us about your meeting.</span> <span id="s860">I sort of skipped that, but what did your father say to you when he first saw you?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s862">I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s863">I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s864">I think we didn’t talk about the past at all.</span> <span id="s865">He was, of course, settled by then and he was very proud of himself to have pulled up a little butcher store out of -- out of nothing in -- in New York, America and he was making a living and h-he was extreme -- he showed me his door, and -- and I remember he gave a -- a religious object to his synagogue in gratitude that I was saved.</span> <span id="s866">And the rabbi welcomed me from the -- from the podium in one of -- in his speech when I first came to synagogue.</span> <span id="s867">That was unheard of, I was terribly embarrassed.</span> <span id="s868">And I -- I don’t recall much about that… The name of the man who wrote the book, “Stella” is Peter Wyden, Peter W-y-d-e-n.</span> <span id="s869">Simon and Schuster, 1992.</span> <span id="s870">And my documentation is in Sumlongin, Dr. Hans Clay manuscript, CDJCXX70, Santre de document mon taisson juivre contemporare Pari.</span> <span id="s871">Anonymous parishta Annabelina Crankensfesta.</span> <span id="s872">And they were picked up by Gerhard Shernbrenner and were included in his -- in his book, “Vere haben esska sayen.”</span> <span id="s873">And that’s where this Wyden picked it up.</span> <span id="s874">If that’s important or not, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s875">But still in -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Well Gerda, we were speaking about you first getting to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Can you describe the apartment that your father took you to, that he lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: And also the neighborhood, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Yes, yes, I surely can.</span> <span id="s882">He took me to 719 179th Street.</span> <span id="s883">The building is now razed, because it made room for -- actually for -- for the bus terminal, that big bus terminal on 179th Street.</span> <span id="s884">And it was a very strange -- i-in Washington Heights, that’s in New York, but in the Washington Heights section.</span> <span id="s885">And it was a very strange building for me.</span> <span id="s886">I had only known buildings where you walk in and you’re in the living room and dining room and the kitchen and out the door into the garden and upstairs were the bedrooms.</span> <span id="s887">Well, this was an apartment building where a whole city lived.</span> <span id="s888">You walked in and you had to take the elevator up to the sixth floor and then you were confronted by long, dark, usually smelly corridors and from the corridor, on each side, doors entered.</span> <span id="s889">And little did I know that every single door was a whole apartment in itself.</span> <span id="s890">I’d never seen a construction at -- like that.</span> <span id="s891">In fact I -- I tried to explain it to one of my friends in letters and they couldn’t picture it at all, either.</span> <span id="s892">So anyway, we went through a door, number 6B, I think.</span> <span id="s893">And there, al-all of a sudden, it opened up into a re-regular apartment.</span> <span id="s894">But you just couldn’t tell that from that dark corridor.</span> <span id="s895">So here we were and of course the Mezuzah was on the door and everything was right away.</span> <span id="s896">Then when I came in, all the people hugged me and [indecipherable] me.</span> <span id="s897">There was -- my father was living with an old cousin, whose husband had just died and his brother.</span> <span id="s898">His brother and he, I think she had one bedroom and the cousin and her husband had shared the second bedroom and fortunately the husband just died so that I could have the other bed.</span> <span id="s899">Otherwise, I don’t where I would have slept.</span> <span id="s900">But how God arranges things for me is just miraculous, really.</span> <span id="s901">So I re -- I remember -- of course that -- the ca -- the husband of that cousin absolutely meant nothing to me.</span> <span id="s902">I never met the guy, he was ages old, deaf and blind and ready to die.</span> <span id="s903">I had never even heard his name.</span> <span id="s904">But he died when I was still in Switzerland and my father -- who by that time corresponded with me regularly -- didn’t tell me about his death and only told me on the train from Boston to New York that the cousin had died.</span> <span id="s905">And he said he didn’t want to tell me that because I had been surrounded by so much death and dying that he didn’t want to upset me any more.</span> <span id="s906">I think that gives you an idea of -- of how they regarded us.</span> <span id="s907">We were like -- like fragile, ethereal things that you mustn’t upset and -- and don’t tell them anything bad, they’ve gone through bad enough.</span> <span id="s908">And that was very weird.</span> <span id="s909">I -- I -- I still -- still remember that, he was afraid to tell me that this anonymous cousin of mine had died.</span> <span id="s910">Anyway, I had a good time sleeping in his bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Was there some sort of celebration when you came in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Not right away.</span> <span id="s913">On that Shabbat -- you see, that was a very -- very religious community.</span> <span id="s914">Perhaps I better say a little bit about the community, so you understand what it was like.</span> <span id="s915">In a way, it was almost like coming back to Germany.</span> <span id="s916">First of all, nobody spoke English, they were all -- also, they’d all tried very hard to learn the language and they eventually did and they all aspired to be citizens and of course they all were.</span> <span id="s917">But among themselves, they lived still way back in their little German villages.</span> <span id="s918">The gossip was tremendous.</span> <span id="s919">Everything was word of mouth.</span> <span id="s920">They all went to synagogue, of course, in their best clothes and at synagogue, if -- if you didn’t say “Good Shabbas” to somebody, he was insulted with you for the whole week.</span> <span id="s921">And it was such a narrow minded, such a petty little community, that I, who had gone through so much, just -- I -- I was aghast.</span> <span id="s922">And everybody watched everybody else, that they did everything right and whether they had a new hat on for Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s923">And one person said she’s not going to synagogue because she couldn’t afford to buy a new hat.</span> <span id="s924">So I say, “Go in the old hat.”</span> <span id="s925">“No, you can’t do that, the people will talk about you.”</span> <span id="s926">It was such a narrow minded, such a pi-pitiful community.</span> <span id="s927">They had -- you see, they had all emigrated before Hitler really did his job and so they knew nothing of the hardship we would go through.</span> <span id="s928">And so they transferred all their pettiness and all their parochialism and all their pedestrianism to this beautiful city and they just lived within that gorgeous city, still in their old, little hometown of -- of maybe 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s929">Was weird.</span> <span id="s930">I had a hard time fitting in.</span> <span id="s931">And everybody gossiped about everybody else and was not for me.</span> <span id="s932">I was glad my husband took me out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: What do you think in your experience made you less tolerant of that kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Oh, who cares whether you had a new hat?</span> <span id="s935">And who cares if you wore a nice diamond pin or not?</span> <span id="s936">But if they couldn’t catch up -- and -- and my -- my stepmother was -- fell right into that.</span> <span id="s937">Although she too had lost people, she too was in Theresienstadt, she worked in the glimmer factory, her hands off and -- and she had gone through just as much as I did.</span> <span id="s938">But as soon as she married my father, she -- she joined that -- that stampede of -- of -- of the Washington Heights Jewish women.</span> <span id="s939">You had to have exactly the right kind of jewelry and a new dress and a fur coat and -- and she was one of the worst, honestly.</span> <span id="s940">I just could -- I think that’s why I couldn’t get used to -- to her.</span> <span id="s941">My mother had been so plain, the only thing she ever possessed was her -- her engagement ring, which I fortunately still have.</span> <span id="s942">But my -- my stepmother just wasn’t like that at all.</span> <span id="s943">The first time I met her, she -- she -- that -- that was then again, much later, after I was married, she came to visit me in Lewiston with my father, in a fur coat and a fancy outfit, and I ju -- I just couldn’t -- I couldn’t get used to that.</span> <span id="s944">So, anyway, Washington Heights was a community of it’s own.</span> <span id="s945">My father only had Jewish customers.</span> <span id="s946">Only the Jewish religious people from the surrounding s -- s -- few streets came to see him.</span> <span id="s947">And once in awhile a -- an inspector would show up to inspect the cleanliness and -- and the exits and entrances and the fire escape.</span> <span id="s948">And my father always was afraid of them, because they spoke English and they were the strangers, they were them, you see?</span> <span id="s949">So that ghetto mentality was still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And even for him, who -- who -- who hadn’t experienced the length of --</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: -- of the -- of the Holocaust through the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Appears very --</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: -- powerful.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s958">He never really -- he never really became Americanized.</span> <span id="s959">He’s -- he still remained it -- remained just the way he was.</span> <span id="s960">And I think that was the -- a source of friction between us too, because I wanted to be American.</span> <span id="s961">I sa -- I didn’t want to be any more like I was in Anspach.</span> <span id="s962">I wanted to be an American woman.</span> <span id="s963">I remember when I finally went to college, and then became a librarian and took a job, his comment was, “Why do you need to work?</span> <span id="s964">Your husband will support you.”</span> <span id="s965">See, that was the mentality.</span> <span id="s966">He never understood it.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Can you talk a little bit about more -- your idea of what it was to be an American woman?</span> <span id="s968">Eve -- Especially in those -- those first few months in -- you were feeling frustrated by what you thought was the pettiness of the community, what were the things that you want people and yourself to be focusing on, to be concerned about?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Well, I -- I didn’t like the -- the Washington Heights mentality and -- and environment at all.</span> <span id="s970">I -- I -- I just wasn’t comfortable.</span> <span id="s971">I knew I was being talked about and criticized and -- and -- and I just couldn’t relate to these bosoms -- fat woman in their finery and doing really not very much.</span> <span id="s972">They just transplanted themselves.</span> <span id="s973">So when I came to Maine, my husband -- my husband also felt that way about New York and he wanted to be in a small town where he could make an impact and really -- and really be an American physician.</span> <span id="s974">Then when we moved to Maine, actually I ha -- I had a new struggle then.</span> <span id="s975">Then I was expected to be an American -- a young American wife and I didn’t know how.</span> <span id="s976">And then I -- I didn’t know how to play Bridge, that was the furthest from my mind, so I was already ostracized because I couldn’t ever be invited to Bridge games.</span> <span id="s977">What were they going to do with me?</span> <span id="s978">I couldn’t play.</span> <span id="s979">So, you know, that was already a handicap.</span> <span id="s980">And my English of course, wasn’t so great at the time.</span> <span id="s981">I remember -- I don’t know if this will sit well on tape or not, but I have a memory of trying to play Bridge and trying to fit in and finally -- and then you had to always say what you put down, what card, the King or the Queen.</span> <span id="s982">And finally one of the other three American ladies said to me, “Gerda, please stop referring to that card as the ass.</span> <span id="s983">Call it the Ace.”</span> <span id="s984">So that’s how -- that’s how ha -- ha -- I struggled.</span> <span id="s985">And I quit after awhile.</span> <span id="s986">I just couldn’t learn that stupid game.</span> <span id="s987">Also, it wasn’t important to me.</span> <span id="s988">And then soon I was pregnant and I had a child and th-that of course, was crucial.</span> <span id="s989">And I felt very much that I was saved because I should do something ex -- ec -- other than playing Bridge and learning to say the cards correctly.</span> <span id="s990">And so I -- I devoted myself to my kids.</span> <span id="s991">So much so that actually I -- I -- I became depressed after awhile.</span> <span id="s992">I -- I did nothing but worry about this firstborn of mine, because he was actually the first thing that I could call mine and I -- I knew, excepting my nightmares, I knew that he couldn’t be taken away from me.</span> <span id="s993">Nobody could come in and -- and take him, he was mine.</span> <span id="s994">And so I -- I -- I was between the reality and the nightmares, I -- I became very depressed and actually I did see a psychiatrist, upon the urging of my husband.</span> <span id="s995">And then one of the woman also -- that was also a -- a big factor in my depression -- one of the women, actually the local rabbi’s wife, who was about the age of my mother then and I being without a mother or mother-in-law or anybody and being that poor, displaced person there, she befriended me and she acted as my -- as my dominant guardian.</span> <span id="s996">And somehow, without my really understanding it, I -- I just couldn’t get along with her.</span> <span id="s997">I just feared her and I -- I -- I never knew how to -- how to talk with her and -- and she -- she was very possessive of me and I was terribly -- actually afraid of her.</span> <span id="s998">And after that went on for maybe a couple of years or so, I -- my husband, who -- who n -- who noticed that I wasn’t reacting right -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas.</span> <span id="s1000">This is tape number three, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: -- put me down sometime -- someday and -- and talk to me and try to find out why I was having such a hard time.</span> <span id="s1002">And he pointed out to me -- as so often an outsider can tell you much better what’s wrong with you -- he pointed out to me that she was moving into my mother’s place and I, having that guilt complex a ma -- about my mother, I just couldn’t relate to her.</span> <span id="s1003">I j -- I just couldn’t deal with it.</span> <span id="s1004">I was so afraid of her, although I didn’t know why and she of course, didn’t know why either.</span> <span id="s1005">And that’s when he sent me to a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s1006">And then, after a few sessions, when he pointed out to me that it was -- all this was perfectly normal and how I could deal with it, then I was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: What was it that your husband saw that gave him concern?</span> <span id="s1008">I mean [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Well, I was always afraid of this person who called me up and demanded that I call her back and I had to tell her everything that was going on in my life.</span> <span id="s1010">For instance, she was so possessive of me that when I told her that I was three months pregnant with my first child, and I told her as the first person because, you know, naturally I felt some kind of -- of a debt to her for being so nice to me and teaching me English and teaching me how to cook.</span> <span id="s1011">What did I know about cooking?</span> <span id="s1012">And teach -- and taking me to her friends and everything.</span> <span id="s1013">So I felt a certain debt to her, so she was the first one I told that I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1014">Very joyously and I thought, “Oh now she’ll be just so sweet to me.”</span> <span id="s1015">And she said, “Why didn’t you tell me this sooner?”</span> <span id="s1016">And you know, again, I sh-shrank back and this old fear of her came back to me.</span> <span id="s1017">And you know, I was just always not just right with her.</span> <span id="s1018">They invited us all the time and I always feared to go and my husband noticed that something was wrong with me -- with me and that relationship with her.</span> <span id="s1019">So finally we straightened it -- he straightened it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Tell us about your reaction when he suggested you see a psychiatrist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: That was okay.</span> <span id="s1022">I wanted to get over it myself.</span> <span id="s1023">I didn’t know what was ailing me.</span> <span id="s1024">She was a somewhat dem-demanding and domineering -- a childless woman and she kind of sucked onto me and -- and wanted me to be completely hers and I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1025">I didn’t want to be dominated again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: When you did go see the psychiatrist, what did you end up talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Oh, you know, that’s 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s1028">Let me see if I can reconstruct that.</span> <span id="s1029">First of all, at that point, it was not so accepted to go to the psychiatrist, so we -- we went to a psychiatrist in the next town, Portland and I think my husband drove me down each time.</span> <span id="s1030">I think so.</span> <span id="s1031">And he a-asked about the -- the past and the Holocaust, something about the Holocaust and my life.</span> <span id="s1032">And he also noticed that I had a guilt complex.</span> <span id="s1033">And then he told me that I was perfectly normal and that people who go through very great traumatic experiences and come out alive, whereas other people die, as for instance in the plane crash or any natural disaster, do end up with a guilt complex and he thought that was quite normal.</span> <span id="s1034">And once I knew that, I could deal with it.</span> <span id="s1035">I didn’t go many times.</span> <span id="s1036">He was very good and very kind and -- and I could deal with it.</span> <span id="s1037">Interesting enough, though, I -- I got over it and I adjusted okay, but three of my four children ended up going to a psychiatrist or a psychologist in -- in their formative years.</span> <span id="s1038">Apparently I did pass that on to them.</span> <span id="s1039">And I think they talked a lot about me and -- and my past and my relationship to them.</span> <span id="s1040">They’re all very close to me now, but there was a time when they just -- they just -- didn’t know just how to act.</span> <span id="s1041">I know for instance that -- w-we never talked about the Holocaust and we never talked German, but once the children knew that I had been in a concentration camp and -- and I’ll tell you in a minute how they found that out, then I began to realize that they were reading under their covers at night with flashlights, books about the Holocaust, but they didn’t dare to ask me, so they visualized that I went through the worst of what they were reading and I think that was the cause of their -- of their m-maladjustment.</span> <span id="s1042">And how did they find out?</span> <span id="s1043">Because after I went to college, at age 49 and then to grad school and became a librarian -- that was in ‘74, early -- maybe even before then -- then I became a book reviewer for the Library Journal and for some of the Jewish magazines.</span> <span id="s1044">And once they realized that I could deal with Holocaust books on an authentic and authoritative basis, they deluged me with Holocaust material.</span> <span id="s1045">And then my kids, of course, caught on and asked and -- and then we were okay.</span> <span id="s1046">Was the -- can you talk a little bit about your decision not to talk -- not to tell your children about it?</span> <span id="s1047">Was it a conscious decision or perhaps a decision where you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: I don’t believe that it was a conscious decision.</span> <span id="s1049">I never much talked to my husband about it, either.</span> <span id="s1050">H-He -- in the beginning, he went with me and heard me lecture, so he knew all about it, but I -- it didn’t seem something I wanted to talk with him about.</span> <span id="s1051">I wonder why?</span> <span id="s1052">It was okay to talk to the psychiatrist about it and it was okay to -- to talk to a -- to a faceless audience.</span> <span id="s1053">But it was not okay to talk to my father or my husband or my kids about it.</span> <span id="s1054">Or even my closer girlfriends.</span> <span id="s1055">I -- I did find some -- some of my colleagues from Berlin Hospital here again.</span> <span id="s1056">One of the friends I was especially close to, I found her again and then my head nurse, I found quite by chance in a little for -- Godforsaken town in Maine and that seemed okay.</span> <span id="s1057">All we ever talk about was the Holocaust and Berlin and what happened and other friends and od -- it just -- it just didn’t seem to come out with my family.</span> <span id="s1058">I don’t know why not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: What about when your friend Eva would visit or you’d visit her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Oh, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: And then the children might have been younger, would you have been talk -- did you talk to Eva about it in their -- in their presence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: There was nothing to talk about.</span> <span id="s1063">We had gone through the same thing, we were like sisters.</span> <span id="s1064">Fortunately sh-she had -- she -- she has by now forgotten everything.</span> <span id="s1065">She’s maybe getting a little bit senile, but what -- if we ever say anything, she doesn’t remember it.</span> <span id="s1066">She doesn’t remember any of the things that are so vivid in my mind.</span> <span id="s1067">Like when we washed our hair under that pump that we had to pump.</span> <span id="s1068">We had to help each other, cause one had to pump and the other one had to wash her hair.</span> <span id="s1069">I never forgot it.</span> <span id="s1070">She doesn’t remember a thing about it.</span> <span id="s1071">So, it -- I -- I have no explanation why I didn’t talk to my family.</span> <span id="s1072">There was so much else to talk about.</span> <span id="s1073">I had to learn English, I had to learn to be a wife.</span> <span id="s1074">I had to be a mother.</span> <span id="s1075">There was so much to do.</span> <span id="s1076">I had books to read.</span> <span id="s1077">I hadn’t read a book in 12 years.</span> <span id="s1078">Jews weren’t supposed to read.</span> <span id="s1079">I hadn’t listened to music, all of this I had to do now.</span> <span id="s1080">So, my husband was a big, big help to me.</span> <span id="s1081">He was just an angel.</span> <span id="s1082">And I had to get to know him.</span> <span id="s1083">I married him while being practically engaged to the other guy and I didn’t even know him.</span> <span id="s1084">We only knew each other for three months, but we truly fell in love and I knew that was the man I wanted to spend my life with.</span> <span id="s1085">We were just really so made for each other.</span> <span id="s1086">Our background was the same a-and w-we just entered a very happy marriage and we still have a very happy, functional marriage.</span> <span id="s1087">And it just didn’t seem necessary to talk about the past.</span> <span id="s1088">I somehow assumed he knew it all.</span> <span id="s1089">You know how you -- when you’re -- when you’re very close to someone?</span> <span id="s1090">He knows.</span> <span id="s1091">You know?</span> <span id="s1092">And he probably does know.</span> <span id="s1093">I’ve -- we never talk about it.</span> <span id="s1094">It’s not important, a-at least in that context.</span> <span id="s1095">I don’t know if that makes any sense or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: D-Do you have any thoughts about how your history got communicated to your children if, as you say, you didn’t talk about a lot, but somehow it affected them, is what you had said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: It did, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: And wh -- ho-how do you think that’s so?</span> <span id="s1099">How can something that’s not spoken still affect someone so profoundly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: I have to think a minute -- a minute, how to answer you that, because I had never really thought about it.</span> <span id="s1101">Well, I was -- I was a walking survivor.</span> <span id="s1102">It was probably written all over me.</span> <span id="s1103">I had such different values from other people.</span> <span id="s1104">You know, I couldn’t throw out any food.</span> <span id="s1105">I -- I would go to people’s homes to eat and whatever was on the table and didn’t get eaten, was thrown in the waste.</span> <span id="s1106">I couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1107">A-And -- and this business with having new clothes all the time.</span> <span id="s1108">Who cares?</span> <span id="s1109">I had a dress, that was great.</span> <span id="s1110">And maybe some of those things, surely it must have transmitted its-itself to the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Can you tell us the story about your son and his ideas about having children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Yes, I will, but first I want to say this, my -- my children, in a way, by osmosis almost, surmised what was going on and yet, they didn’t really understand.</span> <span id="s1113">I -- I’m sure I spoke about this when I was interviewed the first time, but it seems important enough now maybe just to touch on it once more without going into too much detail.</span> <span id="s1114">When I was -- when I was asked to be a member of the state Board of Education in Maine, I accepted, of course, greedily and then I -- a phone call came -- or rather a notice came that my confirmation hearing was on -- on a certain date in September and I looked at my calendar, it was the second day of Rosh Hashanah and I didn’t travel then.</span> <span id="s1115">So, I talked to my husband and he said, “Well, you have to call up and tell them you can’t come and probably they’ll pick someone else.”</span> <span id="s1116">So I called up and it was the Senator Katz who was on the phone, who was the chairman and of course, obviously he was also Jewish and he was such a nice guy, I became very close friends with him later.</span> <span id="s1117">And I said to him, “I’m sorry, I don’t travel on the second day of Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s1118">I can’t come.”</span> <span id="s1119">And he was quiet for a minute and then he said, “You know, I’m Jewish too, I never even knew there was a second day of Rosh Hashanah.”</span> <span id="s1120">And so we talked about that for awhile and then he said, “Well, then we’ll postpone the hearing for a week -- for a --” I don’t know how long.</span> <span id="s1121">And I was just flabbergasted that this senator from Maine ju -- postponed a hearing for me, who was persecuted for being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1122">And I talked about that werbar in front of the kids.</span> <span id="s1123">And my daughter Heddy, the one who’s living here now, said -- still ringing in my ears and she said to me -- she was then about, oh, maybe 14 or 15.</span> <span id="s1124">She said, “Why -- why do you think that’s so -- so -- so noteworthy?</span> <span id="s1125">Naturally, if you can’t come because of religious reasons, they have to postpone the date for you.”</span> <span id="s1126">You know, and I -- then I was even more flabbergasted, that my own kid didn’t understand what -- what it means to -- not to live in a democracy.</span> <span id="s1127">I -- I -- I don’t know if you understand the bigness of that thing.</span> <span id="s1128">It was such a revelation to me, such an epiphany.</span> <span id="s1129">And -- and then -- then I probably explained to her at that point that not everybody grows up in a democracy and has democracy in their bloods -- in their bloodstreams, with their mother’s milk.</span> <span id="s1130">Well, in that case, it wasn’t the case but -- but obviously she was American enough not to understand that this -- a senate does not have to postpone a hearing for a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s1131">So then I wrote my book.</span> <span id="s1132">And the book just came out of me, because I thought, “If my own kids don’t know it, other kids don’t know it either.”</span> <span id="s1133">And I -- I wrote my book then.</span> <span id="s1134">I -- it was the first one, it’s in the preface.</span> <span id="s1135">The whole preface, that’s why I wrote the book, for my kids and for other kids, who grow up blithely and -- a-and then, of course, as I was writing and researching and talking about it and speaking, then the kids know everything.</span> <span id="s1136">The kids also didn’t want to know all that much.</span> <span id="s1137">The grandchildren want to know more then the kids now.</span> <span id="s1138">But the grandchildren already don’t understand it any more.</span> <span id="s1139">They don’t understand it any -- “What did Hitler look like?</span> <span id="s1140">Did he come and kill your mother hi-himself?”</span> <span id="s1141">You know, things like that.</span> <span id="s1142">“What are you going to say to him when you meet him in heaven?”</span> <span id="s1143">There, at least I had an answer.</span> <span id="s1144">I’m not going to meet him in heaven.</span> <span id="s1145">I ain’t going there, where he is.</span> <span id="s1146">So, anyway.</span> <span id="s1147">Yes, now I want to tell you about my oldest son.</span> <span id="s1148">Somehow I -- I always felt -- or at least I rationalized -- for lack of any other rationalization, that I was saved so that I could have children and -- and somehow continue the -- the -- the re -- the depleted Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1149">So, I quickly had my four kids and -- and I’m sure that feeling translated itself in -- imbued itself into my kids.</span> <span id="s1150">They too should have kids and grandkids and the Jewish race should -- should keep going in spite of Hitler.</span> <span id="s1151">Hitler did not win.</span> <span id="s1152">He did not eradicate us all.</span> <span id="s1153">We, the survivors are starting again.</span> <span id="s1154">And after my son was married for many years and didn’t have children, he confessed to me once that this is a -- a very big problem for him because he fee -- he feels he has let me down, that he has not continue -- that I was saved and he -- he is not continuing this.</span> <span id="s1155">And of course, I was flabbergasted to hear that and I assured him that he has not let -- now, mind you, he’s a psychologist himself, he doesn’t have to go to a psychologist, he is one.</span> <span id="s1156">So he and I talked at length and he understood then that -- that he did not let me down and I never felt let down by him.</span> <span id="s1157">On the contrary, I -- I’m just extremely proud of all my kids and especially of him.</span> <span id="s1158">And then, shortly after that he -- he adopted a little girl and she’s now five and she’s -- 10 months ago he adopted a little boy and now he feels whole.</span> <span id="s1159">He has two children, that name will continue, the children have both come here to our synagogue to be -- to go to the Mikvah to become Jewish and of course the boy had his circumcision here and I ha -- my son, honestly, he’s a different person since then.</span> <span id="s1160">His head is up high and his chest is out and -- and he and I are -- are very close again.</span> <span id="s1161">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Can you tell us the names of your four children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Oh yes, of course I can, my whole pride and joy.</span> <span id="s1164">With the children, I felt I had paid my dues, at least to God and to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1165">And then the other dues I paid, I want to tell you after I tell you the children’s name.</span> <span id="s1166">So I’m looking at this picture here, which was taken at the brit of my oldest son’s little boy.</span> <span id="s1167">And it’s in front of the Kineset Isel synagogue, with the name clearly visible.</span> <span id="s1168">So there’s my husband and I and in the center iv my -- is my son Leonard.</span> <span id="s1169">Now mind you, all my kids are named after the parents we lost.</span> <span id="s1170">So Leonard -- which is a burden, actually.</span> <span id="s1171">The kids say it is a burden.</span> <span id="s1172">Leonard is named after my husband’s father, Leonard.</span> <span id="s1173">And next to him is my daughter Heddy, who is named after my husband’s mother, Hedwick.</span> <span id="s1174">And on his other side is my son David, who is named after a distant grandfather and here is my daughter Pauli, who is named after my mother, Paula.</span> <span id="s1175">And then, these are their -- their mates and then in front you have the next generation and of course their names are picked out of a hat and in fact, it is very interesting.</span> <span id="s1176">You know, Hitler had -- one of the many laws that he made against the Jews was that the Jews had to have what he thought was degrading names like Sarah and Jacob and Moses and Daniel.</span> <span id="s1177">Those were names that only Jews should have.</span> <span id="s1178">And the interesting fact is that all my grandchildren have Jewish and Hebrew names, not because Hitler decreed it, because those names are beautiful and they like them.</span> <span id="s1179">The only one that doesn’t have a Jewish name, actually, is the two adopted kids.</span> <span id="s1180">But it’s no problem.</span> <span id="s1181">So there’s Rachel and there is Tally and Ari.</span> <span id="s1182">And not on the picture are Sarah and Jonathan and Benjamin and Raphael.</span> <span id="s1183">And the two kids of my old -- of my youngest son’s, which weren’t born then -- oh yes they were -- is Jacob and Evan.</span> <span id="s1184">Isn’t that a great -- nice picture of my family and -- and I’m very proud of them.</span> <span id="s1185">So I have fulfilled my duty there and then -- and then I want to just mention a little bit that I have also fulfilled my duty to -- to this country, because after all, I owe it quite a debt.</span> <span id="s1186">Quite a debt.</span> <span id="s1187">And in that way I’m very glad that I moved to small town, but that was very se -- very secondary, only after I lived there for many years in -- in Lewiston, Maine, population maybe 60 -- maybe 50,000.</span> <span id="s1188">Only after I lived there for a long time, did I realize that the population, the general American population knows very little about Judaism and almost nothing about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1189">And so I -- I really found a fulfilling role for myself.</span> <span id="s1190">By that time I was a -- a librarian at Bates College in Lewiston and when we first moved there, in 1947, Bates College had only one Jewish professor and did not acknowledge the needs of the Jewish students.</span> <span id="s1191">Holidays, no time off.</span> <span id="s1192">Kosher food never was heard of.</span> <span id="s1193">Jewish subjects were never taught and so the Jewish population and also th-the non-Jewish population knew nothing.</span> <span id="s1194">And I was able to change that.</span> <span id="s1195">I -- I got myself some grants from the -- of course then the times were different, too.</span> <span id="s1196">This was in the 1970’s, 1980’s, I got myself some sizable grants from the Maine Human -- Council of the Humanities and with the blessing and -- and the encouragement of the Bates College president, I -- I conducted several Jewish oriented conferences.</span> <span id="s1197">And they really went over big.</span> <span id="s1198">This was for the whole state of Maine, we had a tremendous budgets, we -- the first conference I did was a month long.</span> <span id="s1199">Just informational conference on Judaism and we moved from city to city, with people and -- and videos and we talked and we an -- mostly we answered questions and many people in the hinterlands of Maine confessed that they had never seen a Jew before.</span> <span id="s1200">So I -- I really felt proud about that.</span> <span id="s1201">And then the next thing we did -- I was able to get a Jewish library -- a Rabbinic library for Bates College.</span> <span id="s1202">The -- the -- the husband of the -- of the woman that had oppressed me so, the rabbi of -- of Lewiston died and -- and by then of course I was on -- on even terms with her and I was able to -- to coax her into donating his whole Rabbinic library in toto to Bates College.</span> <span id="s1203">And it’s known now as the Rabbi David Berund Rabbinic Library of Bates College.</span> <span id="s1204">And I’m proud to say that I did it.</span> <span id="s1205">And I catalogued it -- took me several years.</span> <span id="s1206">And it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s a nice -- nice legacy.</span> <span id="s1207">And then we did s -- then again I got f-funding for several Jewish events -- Jewish music.</span> <span id="s1208">And that was all within that library, I got money for that and I was able to do a David Berund event annually.</span> <span id="s1209">And once I did a music -- Jewish music and the other time we did Jewish films and next time we did Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1210">And I got good speakers and we always had standing room only.</span> <span id="s1211">It was fabulous, it was like they needed to hear about Judaism.</span> <span id="s1212">Not only the Jews, but the non-Jews as well.</span> <span id="s1213">The students, the professors, the townspeople, the out of townspeople.</span> <span id="s1214">Was fabulous.</span> <span id="s1215">And out of that -- when I realized the need, out of that, I -- then we did Holocaust conferences, especially with teachers.</span> <span id="s1216">And again I felt this - this void.</span> <span id="s1217">This -- this -- this -- this magnetic need that I had and then we finally got together and we had a little bit of money left from the last conference -- oh, I don’t know, maybe a thousand dollars and of course we were obliged to return it to the -- to the main Humanities Council, but we asked and got permission to keep it as seed money to found the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine.</span> <span id="s1218">And we were just sailing through that.</span> <span id="s1219">It was like they just waited for us.</span> <span id="s1220">The Maine State Library sponsored us, we had our meetings there, they did all our cataloguing, all our mailing, all our newsletter, our videota -- I did a complete video and oral history tape of all the survivors in my -- Maine is such a small state, all we had was 25 survivors and maybe less than a dozen t -- much less than a dozen liberators.</span> <span id="s1221">And we -- we -- we interviewed them all.</span> <span id="s1222">We also interviewed non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1223">Our criterion for survivor simply was anyone whose life has been dramatically changed because of Hitler.</span> <span id="s1224">And that included a lot of non-Jewish, too.</span> <span id="s1225">We had a lay -- a layer of -- a s -- of a small town in Poland who wouldn’t go along with him and had to leave, with his whole family.</span> <span id="s1226">And we had a former Nazi woman who then completely turned around and married a Jewish soldier and came over to Maine and became completely de-Nazified and -- and talked about -- and she wrote a book called, “Poison in my Roots.”</span> <span id="s1227">She talked about h-h-how she couldn’t help being a Nazi, there was nothing else.</span> <span id="s1228">If she wasn’t a Nazi, she was going to be shot, as simple as that.</span> <span id="s1229">And she explained that to us.</span> <span id="s1230">So I -- I really am feeling so -- so pleased.</span> <span id="s1231">We got funding from people we -- we didn’t even approach.</span> <span id="s1232">People came to us with -- with thousands of dollars.</span> <span id="s1233">It was just fabulous.</span> <span id="s1234">Today we are a functioning, vibrant, rich, busy center.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Do you go back there from time to time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: I’m in very close contact with them.</span> <span id="s1237">Just a cu -- just a day or so ago, I had on my e-mail on my computer, a message from -- from our secretary, whom I still picked -- she was hand picked by me when I was still the -- the president and she stayed with us all these years.</span> <span id="s1238">This was like 15 years ago.</span> <span id="s1239">And she said one of the synagogues in a small town in Maine was desecrated on Yom Kip -- on Rosh Hashanah and she wanted me to -- to say something that they can put into their newsletter and of course I wrote -- I’m still very much a part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: I want to ask you about -- actually I think I will turn this tape.</span> <span id="s1241">[inaudible] End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas.</span> <span id="s1243">This is tape number three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: I -- I just want to continue on some of the things we did in Maine.</span> <span id="s1245">After we founded the Holocaust center, we had an annual reception for survivors and liberators at the Blaine House, the State House in Augusta, Maine, with the governor presiding and somebody giving a speech and the Mrs. governor passing around the famous cookies and things like that.</span> <span id="s1246">And it was always something I -- I personally felt somewhat responsible for, so I always walked around and greeted everybody and made sure they felt welcomed and made su -- and I -- I knew most of them, anyway.</span> <span id="s1247">And they knew me, too and -- and one year, I saw a man standing aside and I didn’t know him and I couldn’t place him, he didn’t look old enough to be a survivor.</span> <span id="s1248">He looked at least 10 years younger than I. And he certainly didn’t look like a liberator.</span> <span id="s1249">The liberators by then, all had a certain look.</span> <span id="s1250">They were a little bit on the heavy side, gray hair -- you know, salt of the earth kind of people.</span> <span id="s1251">And he didn’t look like that, he looked quite elegant and quite aloof and I thought, “Who is he?”</span> <span id="s1252">So I said, “Well, no -- no time is lost in finding out.”</span> <span id="s1253">And I marched right up to him, after all, I acted a little bit like the -- like the hostess in that’s -- in that context and I said, “I’m Gerda Haas.</span> <span id="s1254">Welcome to our reception.</span> <span id="s1255">May I ask who you are?</span> <span id="s1256">Are you one of our survivors or one of our liberators?”</span> <span id="s1257">And he -- he clicked his heels you know and gave me a salute.</span> <span id="s1258">He was in civilian clothes, of course, just with a military insignia on his lapel.</span> <span id="s1259">And he said, “I am Colonel Retired Manfred Kelman, US Regiment --” and I think he named it, which I have forgotten by then.</span> <span id="s1260">And I was taken aback and I said, “So you are one of our liberators?”</span> <span id="s1261">He said, “No.</span> <span id="s1262">I am a survivor.</span> <span id="s1263">I was in Theresienstadt.”</span> <span id="s1264">And I was completely baffled.</span> <span id="s1265">He didn’t look old enough and he didn’t look Jewish and he didn’t look like a survivor.</span> <span id="s1266">Neither did he act like one.</span> <span id="s1267">So he and I huddled a little bit, because I couldn’t spend too much time, but we made a date and we met later for coffee.</span> <span id="s1268">And the fellow tells me he was a Mishling.</span> <span id="s1269">He was brought up by a Jewish father and an -- and an Aryan SS mother.</span> <span id="s1270">And he was 14 years old when the Nazis finally yanked him out of his house.</span> <span id="s1271">Up to now his mother could keep him and kept her eye on him and he was a little bit protected.</span> <span id="s1272">Also, as he told me later, he had a miserable childhood.</span> <span id="s1273">He was neither Jewish nor Aryan.</span> <span id="s1274">So anyway, by the age of 14, he was sent to Theresienstadt and there he was again miserable, because he wasn’t a Jew and he had to wear the star all of a sudden and he had no friends.</span> <span id="s1275">There was nobody 14 years old in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1276">And so finally at the -- at the end of the war, his mother sent an -- an -- a still functioning army car to pick him up out of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1277">But by gosh, the guy was in Theresienstadt just like me, a prisoner of the Nazis, with his star on his left hand side.</span> <span id="s1278">And of course we became close friends.</span> <span id="s1279">I just couldn’t get over it.</span> <span id="s1280">And as soon as he -- that finished it for him.</span> <span id="s1281">As soon as he could, he took -- his father died in concentration camp and he took his mother out and came to America.</span> <span id="s1282">And of course he was a youngster, so he got his education, enrolled into the army, rose to the level of Colonel, went back to fight the Nazis and retired to Maine because it was a nice state to retire in.</span> <span id="s1283">How do you like that story?</span> <span id="s1284">That’s -- I should -- I should write that as a novel -- as a short story.</span> <span id="s1285">I’ve told it many times and it’s just flabbergasting.</span> <span id="s1286">So that’s again the envelope of -- of -- of the Holocaust, of my life.</span> <span id="s1287">And he was the nicest, nicest fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Can you talk a little bit about what it was like to be -- what I hear you say is somewhat caught between two worlds, when you get to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Washington Heights, very narrow --</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: -- that’s how you described it.</span> <span id="s1293">You weren’t interested in that world as much.</span> <span id="s1294">But then you get to Maine and again you don’t quite fit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: How did you find a place to be?</span> <span id="s1297">How did you make a place to be for -- for -- for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Well, I -- I think -- I think I was a little bit on the outside, actually.</span> <span id="s1299">I -- I think I have to say I was a little bit on the outside, by choice and by the rejection of my peers.</span> <span id="s1300">And -- and I think I made my own little world.</span> <span id="s1301">I mean, to begin with that I went back to college at the age of 49.</span> <span id="s1302">The people thought I was nuts.</span> <span id="s1303">Here I was, married to a successful physician, why should I go to college like a little girl?</span> <span id="s1304">And sure enough, I was the age of my professors.</span> <span id="s1305">And that was kind of funny at times.</span> <span id="s1306">But I went to college and then when I was done, I went to work.</span> <span id="s1307">And in -- in 1971 that was not so common in a small town for a -- for the wife of a professional to do.</span> <span id="s1308">So again, out of choice, I didn’t have time for them and they rejected me because I went a different path.</span> <span id="s1309">So, I had some close friends, but looking back, they were all Europeans.</span> <span id="s1310">No, I won’t say that, I have a couple that were Americans.</span> <span id="s1311">But, pre-predominantly, my friends in -- in Maine were Europeans.</span> <span id="s1312">And then I got so embroiled in the -- in all the activities that I have just described to you and then I got completely snowed under with the Holocaust center.</span> <span id="s1313">And they -- they didn’t take part in that at all.</span> <span id="s1314">They did come through when I did Jewish music and Jewish this and Jewish that.</span> <span id="s1315">That, they supported me in, but with the Holocaust they didn’t support me all that much.</span> <span id="s1316">And so I was on my own and I -- I was happy.</span> <span id="s1317">I -- I was satisfied.</span> <span id="s1318">I was different.</span> <span id="s1319">That’s very funny, I -- I am thinking of -- I -- I had a girlfriend who was also European and we chatted a little bit and our children were in the next room playing.</span> <span id="s1320">They were small, maybe eight.</span> <span id="s1321">And I hear one of them say, “My mother doesn’t have an accent, your mother does.”</span> <span id="s1322">And I hear my daughter reply, “No, my mother doesn’t have an accent, your mother has an accent.”</span> <span id="s1323">So I was different and yet I wasn’t, you know?</span> <span id="s1324">So, to answer your question, you know, it hurt at times when I wasn’t invited or -- or I knew they were talking about me, or -- but you see, also I was very happily married.</span> <span id="s1325">I -- I really -- you know, what did I need?</span> <span id="s1326">I had my kids, I had my husband, I still had my father at the time.</span> <span id="s1327">And also, I did not get along with him as well as I should have.</span> <span id="s1328">And I had my stepmother.</span> <span id="s1329">I had them and they were -- and they were a responsibility as they became older, you see?</span> <span id="s1330">So I -- I -- I was okay.</span> <span id="s1331">I have no qualms.</span> <span id="s1332">And then I became interested in other things and I wanted to build a nice life and -- and I -- I think I Americanized myself.</span> <span id="s1333">I had a career, I was a book reviewer.</span> <span id="s1334">I was always doing something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: This is a somewhat related question which is, if you could talk a bit about something that you mentioned in your first interview, which is that you were made t-to be -- you were made to feel subhuman and stupid about yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1337">In -- in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: What -- what became of that self-concept?</span> <span id="s1339">How did you change it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Well, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: [indecipherable] change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Well I -- I think for a long time it stayed with me.</span> <span id="s1343">See, I was 10 years old when I was declared a subhuman, an outsider.</span> <span id="s1344">A Jew.</span> <span id="s1345">I was supposed to be -- I was supposed to be ugly, with a big nose and s -- big ears and stupid and the pu -- the real sturmer picture, you know, of -- of kids that were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1346">And I was supposed to be on the outside of -- of the Aryan world, which was blonde and straight and beautiful and dancing about.</span> <span id="s1347">And I -- I think when you te-tell that to a kid of 10 for 12 years, I think it will leave an impact.</span> <span id="s1348">And I think partly that’s why I had a hard time for a long time.</span> <span id="s1349">I had to prove to myself that I -- that I was intelligent, that I could do something, that I was beautiful and that I was a good mother and a good wife.</span> <span id="s1350">I think it took awhile.</span> <span id="s1351">I -- I really do.</span> <span id="s1352">I really do.</span> <span id="s1353">And I think that’s where all the nightmares came from, also.</span> <span id="s1354">Subconsciously I was still the fugitive, the haunted one.</span> <span id="s1355">And I couldn’t shake it, for the longest time.</span> <span id="s1356">And my husband helped me a great deal in that, too.</span> <span id="s1357">He was very understanding about that.</span> <span id="s1358">Yes, but it took awhile.</span> <span id="s1359">In school we were not allowed to -- to answer, because we were not allowed to know.</span> <span id="s1360">You know, don’t rock the boat of their -- of their perception of a Jewish student.</span> <span id="s1361">We were sitting in the back and we were not allowed to answer.</span> <span id="s1362">And we to -- we got passing grades, but nothing special.</span> <span id="s1363">And -- and then, of course, I -- I picked a -- a hands on profession, I became a nurse.</span> <span id="s1364">But that was also because of necessity.</span> <span id="s1365">No college would take us.</span> <span id="s1366">Completely out of the question, because all the colleges were states colleges.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Did you ever think about nursing here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: Fleetingly.</span> <span id="s1369">I was married to a doctor and I would have to be in the same hospital and I didn’t want that.</span> <span id="s1370">And there was so much else to do.</span> <span id="s1371">I -- I didn’t want to be a nurse, I wanted to -- I wanted to be a student and I -- I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: You said several times that your husband Rudolf has been very helpful.</span> <span id="s1373">Can you t-tell us how?</span> <span id="s1374">For instance, how was he helpful in -- in helping you feel that you weren’t s-stupid, that -- that’s the last example you just gave, but you’ve mentioned that several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: Yes, well number one, he wu -- he understood me better than I understood myself.</span> <span id="s1376">He was completely able to pinpoint my problems with -- with the wife of the rabbi and he was able to lift that from me.</span> <span id="s1377">And he understood my obsession with my children very well.</span> <span id="s1378">He was very tolerant about that.</span> <span id="s1379">And -- and he never probed, he never questioned, he never -- he was never angry, which I -- I don’t think I could have taken.</span> <span id="s1380">And h-he was just -- I never quite thought about how he helped me, but as I’m thinking -- and he was the one that urged me to go to college.</span> <span id="s1381">And when I was done with college, and I graduated fabulously, coo -- summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, all the honors you can have.</span> <span id="s1382">So I said -- it was very funny too, for a graduation present, he gave me a new electric stove.</span> <span id="s1383">Stay here, cook for me.</span> <span id="s1384">But when he realized that I wasn’t very happy doing that, he urged me to go to grad school.</span> <span id="s1385">He said, “Look into librarianship, that looks like a challenging profession.”</span> <span id="s1386">And he was always the one who -- who advised me right.</span> <span id="s1387">I na -- just -- he still understands me very well.</span> <span id="s1388">He still -- he still understands everything I do and -- and he -- he himself is still very religious, but I -- my religion has shifted from point A to point B and he understands that.</span> <span id="s1389">He -- he -- he knows completely where -- where I’m coming fr -- to use that worn phrase -- where I’m coming from and where I’m going to.</span> <span id="s1390">That’s not what I want to say.</span> <span id="s1391">H-He really -- he really understands my -- my -- my background.</span> <span id="s1392">He himself is of course a refugee also, but he didn’t go through concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1393">And -- and so he -- he doesn’t consider himself a survivor, although I say he is.</span> <span id="s1394">Does that answer your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Good.</span> <span id="s1397">Let’s see if I have anything else on my thing here.</span> <span id="s1398">It was funny when I meet all these people again.</span> <span id="s1399">Did I -- did I emphasize once more why we are the last of the survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: Not on tape and I think you should.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Yeah, I’d like to -- to really press hard on that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: I-It’s so little known that one of the tenets of Nazi ideology was of course that we shouldn’t live.</span> <span id="s1404">We -- we should all be killed.</span> <span id="s1405">And that -- that is one of the laws of the -- of the Nazi party, the Jews have to be killed.</span> <span id="s1406">But then practicality took over and they figured as long as we can squeeze a little labor out of them, let’s work around that basic law and make a second law.</span> <span id="s1407">And this law -- and I have it here, in -- in Xerox copy, th-the Wannsee Conference Law of 1942 states that when the people come to concentration camp, anyone under 18 is to be killed on arrival and anyone over 45 is to be killed on arrival.</span> <span id="s1408">And so they were.</span> <span id="s1409">So that narrow gap, between 18 and 45 was allowed to sort of kill themselves.</span> <span id="s1410">Die of natural causes, namely starvation and -- and h-hard labor and beatings and infections and finally then of course also, the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1411">So this should not be forgotten.</span> <span id="s1412">So after we, who are now in our 70’s, are gone, there are very few true survivors left, because of that ominous law of killing people under 18.</span> <span id="s1413">When I tell that to students, that -- they really sit up and -- and take notice.</span> <span id="s1414">It was really beastly.</span> <span id="s1415">It was really beastly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: You spoke many times in your first interview of this sort of ingrained instinct to behave --</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: -- you grew up with.</span> <span id="s1419">To obey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: You talked a lot about that.</span> <span id="s1422">Can you speak some about -- about yourself and your instinct to obey now?</span> <span id="s1423">Is it something that you worked on to change or how has it changed over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: You’re hitting all the right spots and some of them are sore.</span> <span id="s1425">Yes, that was an ingrained instinct, not only because of the Nazis, but you know, we grew up obeying.</span> <span id="s1426">We grew up obeying our parents and our grandparents and our teachers and our rabbis.</span> <span id="s1427">And our -- our elders.</span> <span id="s1428">That’s how we were brought up.</span> <span id="s1429">That was the Jewish way and of course the German way also.</span> <span id="s1430">And then Hitler came upon the scene and suddenly we had to obey for very different reasons and -- and really k -- knuckle down and obey, or we were killed.</span> <span id="s1431">There was no question about it.</span> <span id="s1432">They came with their sticks and their dogs.</span> <span id="s1433">And to this day I -- I’m so uncomfortable around dogs and I think it’s because of that.</span> <span id="s1434">They always had their dogs with them.</span> <span id="s1435">And we had to give up all our animals, you see, so that there’d be no interaction with dogs or cats or anything, because they always had their dogs on their side.</span> <span id="s1436">So here they came, a-an -- and we didn’t even question obedience.</span> <span id="s1437">We didn’t even question it and I’m ashamed to say it today.</span> <span id="s1438">When they made us the -- the -- the -- the instigators of our own death, we obeyed.</span> <span id="s1439">Why didn’t we just lay down and die instead of -- instead of obeying them and ha -- aiding them?</span> <span id="s1440">We were going to be killed anyway.</span> <span id="s1441">You know that -- I don’t think that occurred to us.</span> <span id="s1442">We obeyed and that was all there was to it.</span> <span id="s1443">That’s the way -- you didn’t know you could disobey.</span> <span id="s1444">I -- we didn’t know there was civil disobedience.</span> <span id="s1445">That’s an American institution.</span> <span id="s1446">We didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1447">So we obeyed.</span> <span id="s1448">Now, to come to this -- to the present, how did I deal with it over here?</span> <span id="s1449">I have to really think.</span> <span id="s1450">Yeah, we were shocked at the time when the 60’s came and -- and the ki -- and our own kids were sitting s-sit-outs or sit-ins?</span> <span id="s1451">Sit ins.</span> <span id="s1452">I was shocked.</span> <span id="s1453">That didn’t occur to us.</span> <span id="s1454">And we didn’t al-allow our kids to disobey very much either.</span> <span id="s1455">It really was ingrained.</span> <span id="s1456">I guess in a way it still is.</span> <span id="s1457">I guess in a way it has never quite left.</span> <span id="s1458">I remember -- I remember very well that I was married for 19 years and I finally one day stood up to my husband.</span> <span id="s1459">And it’s a strong memory.</span> <span id="s1460">I thought, “My God, I’m married 19 years and this is the first time I’m speaking back to him.”</span> <span id="s1461">I-It -- you just didn’t.</span> <span id="s1462">But, of course the circumstances were different.</span> <span id="s1463">Nobody yells at me now or orders me to do things.</span> <span id="s1464">I do it because I want to.</span> <span id="s1465">So I think some of that is still with me.</span> <span id="s1466">I -- I think it is.</span> <span id="s1467">And the obedience to God, that really never quite left me either.</span> <span id="s1468">That is the best I can explain it.</span> <span id="s1469">But, of course I’m very much my own person now.</span> <span id="s1470">I hope.</span> <span id="s1471">I am.</span> <span id="s1472">I don’t know if that answers your question, but it’s about all I can do.</span> <span id="s1473">But you know, there is a certain freedom in obedience also.</span> <span id="s1474">I’m free to -- to do as I wish, ei-either to go along with what’s expected of me, or not to.</span> <span id="s1475">And that’s very nice too, so if I go along, it’s because I want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Do you bi -- what do you think the Holocaust and the -- the -- the knowledge that we have, how do you think that affected, in Germany especially, or maybe around the world, this behavior of blind obedience?</span> <span id="s1477">Do you think it possibly had an impact, that -- that the knowledge that we have of the Holocaust and what blind obedience led to, do you think that has changed that, culturally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: It’s very hard to say.</span> <span id="s1479">The wer -- I never thought the world would be in such dire straights as it is now.</span> <span id="s1480">I really thought they had learned a little something, but they haven’t.</span> <span id="s1481">I -- I don’t think things have changed.</span> <span id="s1482">I -- I -- I don’t think the world as such has gotten any better.</span> <span id="s1483">But I -- I think -- I think this country at least is more aware of not blindly ob-obeying.</span> <span id="s1484">Of not blindly walking along and doing their own thing and I -- I’m very thrilled about that.</span> <span id="s1485">But I think they’re going overboard now.</span> <span id="s1486">Th-This freedom to investigate everybody, that’s too much.</span> <span id="s1487">That’s almost again like Hitler, this perse -- this -- this persecution of a person or -- of a person, that -- I -- I just can’t see that.</span> <span id="s1488">That can only lead to more trouble.</span> <span id="s1489">But -- but th-the liberty to criticize anybody, right up to your president, that is a thrilling aspect.</span> <span id="s1490">That reporters can -- can have a say of what they think, that’s unheard -- that was unheard of in Germany.</span> <span id="s1491">Every newspaper had to print what Hitler told them to, you see?</span> <span id="s1492">And that’s why it -- it became so widespread.</span> <span id="s1493">So I think the world has learned some things.</span> <span id="s1494">That people have to be honest and have to say what they think and have to stand up and march for their rights.</span> <span id="s1495">But i-in other wer -- in other parts of the world, not too much has changed and things are still pretty bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: Which part of the world were you thinking of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Well, I’m thinking now of -- of where people are really oppressed.</span> <span id="s1498">Of Third World countries where people ca -- one of the truths of -- of -- of political life is that you can’t rebel unless you have already reached a certain level.</span> <span id="s1499">And Hitler made sure that the Germans never reached that level.</span> <span id="s1500">He kept them down.</span> <span id="s1501">But Third -- Third World countries can’t rebel.</span> <span id="s1502">They haven’t got enough food in their stomachs and not enough voice in their lungs.</span> <span id="s1503">But here, where everything is so great and wonderful and people can do as they wish and have the -- the personal strength to do it, they can rebel.</span> <span id="s1504">But while they were slaves, they couldn’t do anything about it either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: So there’s a -- a natural gra-gradient up the ladder where for a long time they can’t do anything about it and then as you get a little better, a little higher up, then you can object and can make yourself heard.</span> <span id="s1507">And you should.</span> <span id="s1508">But each country and each person has to find th-that uphill grade by themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas.</span> <span id="s1511">This is tape number four, side A. Have you traveled to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Yes, I went back at least twice to my town, Anspach, that beautiful, baroque town with the beautiful cobblestones and the [indecipherable] and the castle and the churches and everything.</span> <span id="s1513">See how pretty it is, with stained glass windows and these gorgeous roofs all covered with that tile.</span> <span id="s1514">And I -- I -- I -- I used to like my hometown, I w -- I was a v -- a very happy girl there, before Hitler and I used to love it.</span> <span id="s1515">I remember so many little things.</span> <span id="s1516">M-My grandmother once took me to the -- to the Hoffgarden, which is like a arboretum, at night when I was very little, because there was a Queen of the Night that was opening up at night and she wanted me to see that and I never forgot it.</span> <span id="s1517">It had such an aroma to it and at -- it -- I could see the petals opening, I was just a young girl and it was dark and there were these white petals opening up and throwing their -- their perfume at me.</span> <span id="s1518">I never forgot it.</span> <span id="s1519">So there were many reasons why I liked my hometown a lot.</span> <span id="s1520">But I went back and I -- I -- I was most unhappy there.</span> <span id="s1521">I felt so -- I felt as if I had an itchy skirt -- shirt on me.</span> <span id="s1522">As if I wanted to scratch myself all the time and get out of there.</span> <span id="s1523">And Anspach was notoriously anti-Semitic and it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1524">I -- I had -- I wanted to see the synagogue, which is a -- a beautiful, historical building.</span> <span id="s1525">It was built by the same architect that built the castle for the margraff there.</span> <span id="s1526">At that point the Jews were in -- in good standing with the margraff and they asked for a synagogue and he -- that was in 1745 -- 300 -- 500 -- 400 years ago and he gave them his own architect and helped them build this beautiful synagogue, here it is.</span> <span id="s1527">See, this is the castle and the synagogue has the same high windows, that I’ll show you in a minute, if I can find it.</span> <span id="s1528">So, I was very anxious to go back and I had to ask for the key to the synagogue at the -- at the city hall, because now it’s closed.</span> <span id="s1529">There are no Jews living there, so it’s just a memorial.</span> <span id="s1530">And I went to the city hall and I asked for the -- for the key and they told me that -- I asked in -- in German, you know, I didn’t want them to know who I am.</span> <span id="s1531">And -- and I asked and they said I had to wait a few minutes, the fellow th-that -- who I had corresponded with that I was coming, Mr. Lung, will be here in a minute, he’s out celebrating his birthday.</span> <span id="s1532">And I had noticed that on the letters that he had written to me, telling me I had to come and get the key myself, he never used his first name, he always said his title, whatever it was, Raths -- something Lung and there was no first name.</span> <span id="s1533">And so I waited a few minutes and he came back from his birthday party and I could figure out from the date that where we are now and hi -- this was his 50th birthday party, that he was born right smack in the Hitler regime.</span> <span id="s1534">And when he came in, you know, the whole office exploded, “Oh, g-glerkil -- glerklishan kiportstak, Adolf.”</span> <span id="s1535">So you see, the whole city was so anti -- so pro-Hitler that they named their little kids Adolf.</span> <span id="s1536">And that’s why he never used his -- his name, he was ashamed of -- he could change it actually, he’s sitting right there in city hall.</span> <span id="s1537">It’s not hard for him to change.</span> <span id="s1538">But you know, you’re -- you’re fine tuned.</span> <span id="s1539">You pick up things that other people would -- that then I would never have picked up.</span> <span id="s1540">He didn’t use his name and he was born just -- just 1933 and his parents named him Adolf in -- in -- in adoration of their fuehrer, you see?</span> <span id="s1541">So -- so everything contributed to my being very uncomfortable there.</span> <span id="s1542">And he gave me the key and I went through the synagogue and of course as soon as I had opened up that very beautiful synagogue, other people came, pushing in and of course he didn’t allow that, so he cut my visit short and you know, everything was just against me and I da -- I wa -- I wasn’t happy there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Did you go look at your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1545">I looked at my house, which again, I was so happy there and I thought, “Oh, I just want to see it once more.”</span> <span id="s1546">But it turned out to be a terrible experience.</span> <span id="s1547">Number one, I walked up those few steps of 200 Strasserfunfe and I look at the little plaque that’s there and it was still the man who drove us out, who got the house from us from prac -- next to nothing.</span> <span id="s1548">So, by implication, all my furniture and all my belongings and all my stuff must have still been in my house.</span> <span id="s1549">Cause he surely didn’t throw it out or do anything with it, we had left everything.</span> <span id="s1550">And he moved in.</span> <span id="s1551">He moved into a ready set table and made up beds.</span> <span id="s1552">So, I already had that feeling, oh, what am I doing here?</span> <span id="s1553">And then to make things even worse, he had one of those big German Shepherd dogs that I -- that I feared so much, both physically and mentally.</span> <span id="s1554">So, of course, I didn’t -- I asked if I could walk through and at least see -- see the garden and everything, but -- he said yes, but how could I with that dog sitting there, you know?</span> <span id="s1555">So that was a very bad experience and I turned right around and walked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: Did he know who you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: No, but I think he guessed it.</span> <span id="s1558">Who else would come and look at an o -- a house that had no historical significance?</span> <span id="s1559">I may have said I lived here once, or something.</span> <span id="s1560">But I didn’t kno -- but I had my daughter with me, who -- the one who is living in France now and we started out from Strasbourg to -- wh-where she had relatives and we were visiting and it took us very little time to come by car from Strasbourg, just across the Rhine into Anspach, it was maybe -- maybe a two hour car ride and she came with me.</span> <span id="s1561">And I was extremely taken by her reaction.</span> <span id="s1562">She -- she couldn’t believe that my hometown was -- was there.</span> <span id="s1563">You see, in her mind, it was some -- someplace on the moon, you know.</span> <span id="s1564">And that the people who bought my house were -- were there.</span> <span id="s1565">In her mind they were monsters that were living in Dante’s Inferno, you know?</span> <span id="s1566">And they were here, right there, she saw them.</span> <span id="s1567">She could touch the doorpost and -- and see their names and everything.</span> <span id="s1568">A-And she was flabbergasted that two hours from her, there was actually where it all took place.</span> <span id="s1569">I -- I never even thought of -- she was so moved by that experience, she was just beside herself.</span> <span id="s1570">And we took her to the synagogue and -- where my parents used to stand and as -- which is a beautiful, beautiful synagogue, I’m so sorry we lost that to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1571">I made a little bit of an effort to have it transposed t-to Israel, as some synagogues have been, but I didn’t get any res -- “No, that’s ours now, that’s a museum, there’s nothing to do with you any more.”</span> <span id="s1572">And then I asked for a -- some records, “Well, we don’t have them.</span> <span id="s1573">We sent them all to Israel.”</span> <span id="s1574">You know.</span> <span id="s1575">They were anti-Semites and they still are anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1576">And they always will be.</span> <span id="s1577">And my other da -- we took my other daughter, Hedwick, the one that’s named after my father’s -- my husband’s mother to the cemetery in Frankfort where my husband’s parents are buried.</span> <span id="s1578">And she had the shock of her life, too, because she saw her name on the grave-gravestone there.</span> <span id="s1579">She still goes by her maiden name, Heddy Haas and there was Hedwick Haas, buried under a stone with her name and she was also -- she finally realized she’s named after a person that’s lying there, you see?</span> <span id="s1580">So, really the children open up your eyes all over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Did you go to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: No.</span> <span id="s1583">I -- I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s1584">I -- I just don’t want to.</span> <span id="s1585">And I don’t want to go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1586">And I have a hard time going to -- to Holocaust museums.</span> <span id="s1587">I have a hard time.</span> <span id="s1588">At your museum -- at the US Holocaust Museum, I -- I -- I wa -- I was almost sick with anxiety because -- because it was the real thing, once you were in there, you couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s1589">You had to go through the whole rooms and upstairs and downstairs and this room and that room.</span> <span id="s1590">There was no way out, just like then.</span> <span id="s1591">And you had to go through it until you were finally out of there.</span> <span id="s1592">I -- I was sweating.</span> <span id="s1593">I -- so I’m not comfortable with those things at all.</span> <span id="s1594">But I can’t -- I can’t shake it, either.</span> <span id="s1595">I can’t shake it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: I want to ask you one thing, that your mother was able to send a few things, stuff them into people’s bags --</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: -- and then -- could you tell us what she was able to send and -- and how your father eventually got them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Yes, I -- I can.</span> <span id="s1600">You see, when we finally, finally realized that we really should leave -- also our rabbi never urged us to and people began to leave from Anspach, they were packing their belongings, their furniture and the whole business into large lifts and were sending them over here.</span> <span id="s1601">And my mother was able to give little packages to a few of the people to take along.</span> <span id="s1602">“Take it,” she said, “take it.</span> <span id="s1603">Maybe we’ll show up there too, someday.</span> <span id="s1604">And if not, you keep it.”</span> <span id="s1605">So these were friends, you know, it was no great danger that they would walk off with it.</span> <span id="s1606">And if they did, you know, who cared, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1607">But they -- nobody did.</span> <span id="s1608">So when I came over here -- and also when my father came over here, all of a sudden people brought him things that -- that were his and he didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1609">He didn’t know he -- I have such beautiful tablecloths that my mother and my aunt hand did and you know, th-these were important things for them.</span> <span id="s1610">And then a few pieces of silver, like this here, just a tiny little ashtray.</span> <span id="s1611">One octagonal and the other ecliptical or what do you call that shape?</span> <span id="s1612">Very finely chaste and -- and molded and lovingly polished by me, every so -- every so often, because I -- I just love those things.</span> <span id="s1613">They were my mothers and she thought enough of them to stick them into somebody’s bag and I got them again.</span> <span id="s1614">And her own -- her own engagement ring, she gave to my father to take along and he kept it on him until he was able to give it to me and I have already given it to one of my daughters and little things like that.</span> <span id="s1615">Very few things.</span> <span id="s1616">This Shabbas lamp, for instance, that is an old lamp that the people used before -- actually before wax candles and before electricity to light their Sabbath lights on.</span> <span id="s1617">It had oil in it and wicks and before Shabbat you would light all the -- all the eight arms of it and it would ga -- go for at least 10 or 12 hours and that way you had light.</span> <span id="s1618">And I happen to have the one that was in my house in Anspach.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Could you share with us -- you have mentioned before, in your first interview, the letters that were exchanged between your father and your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: And can you tell us about how you came to receive the letters and then I want to ask you to read, perhaps, the last two letters that you wrote to your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1623">Okay, these -- my father was already in -- in America and mother was stuck in Munich.</span> <span id="s1624">You see, we had to leave Anspach and had to move in with some relatives in a big city.</span> <span id="s1625">My sister was already then in Frankfort, at the Jewish hospital as a nurse and I was in Berlin as a Jewish nurse.</span> <span id="s1626">So we were all separated and in order to save postage, which was -- was a big deal in those days, we would write to my mother, to Munich and then she would include our letters into hers.</span> <span id="s1627">But, as you can see here, there’s a note from Freidel and possibly a note from me somewheres too, but not right here.</span> <span id="s1628">So here she writes, on N-November the ninth, on a Sunday, in 1941 -- yeah, I was wrong, was the September date, I -- I blacked out there for awhile.</span> <span id="s1629">September was her birthday and she wrote to him at that time -- and I think it’s in here, too, that she got as a birthday present what everybody else got too, September 19th of 1941 and that was the star.</span> <span id="s1630">And whether my father caught on or not, I don’t know, but she couldn’t outright say that.</span> <span id="s1631">But I -- I understood it when I reread her letter.</span> <span id="s1632">So I got my dates wrong.</span> <span id="s1633">On November the ninth, she was beginning to be de-deported and she says, “My dear Siegfried, it is difficult to me to wr -- for me to write to you today, because I have to give you sad news.</span> <span id="s1634">I have gotten my notification for transport, for the transport that leaves here on Tuesday.</span> <span id="s1635">I’m so sorry for you and for the children.</span> <span id="s1636">I know you will be upset, but I beg you, dear Siegfried, don’t grieve and don’t be pessimistic.</span> <span id="s1637">I am calm and I’m not excited.</span> <span id="s1638">The children feared deporta-deportation already for a long time and have been worried about me all this time.</span> <span id="s1639">Tomorrow I must call them and talk to them.</span> <span id="s1640">I only hope that they will be spared.</span> <span id="s1641">I beg you, dear Siegfried, don’t be upset and don’t be sad and most of all, do not blame yourself.</span> <span id="s1642">If anyone deserves to be blamed, it is I, because it was I who urged you to leave without us.</span> <span id="s1643">We human beings are a thing of naught.</span> <span id="s1644">I see it clearer now than ever before.</span> <span id="s1645">All our planning, our hopes and toil comes to nothing when God decides differently.</span> <span id="s1646">I think now, if only I had done this or that, but it’s no use.</span> <span id="s1647">It’s all destined by God.</span> <span id="s1648">Here I am, making a farewell speech, but as yet I hope that I can write to you where I’m going.</span> <span id="s1649">I haven’t heard anything from mother in Redensberg or from Berta in Aidid.</span> <span id="s1650">I hope they will be spared.</span> <span id="s1651">I will write to you a second letter today before I must go.</span> <span id="s1652">Lovingly, Paula.”</span> <span id="s1653">Yeah, that was the ninth of November, 1941.</span> <span id="s1654">And she wrote that same day, another letter.</span> <span id="s1655">“My dear Siegfried, to continue, I have a letter to send you from the children also; it’s a week old.</span> <span id="s1656">I had hoped so much that Freidel would be able to come for a few days before I would be deported, but really, I didn’t believe that I would actually be called up.</span> <span id="s1657">And now it’s a reality, as I told you in the first letter.</span> <span id="s1658">I am in the first evacuation from Munich.</span> <span id="s1659">I don’t imagine it as all too black and I’m not upset and of course I’ll write to you from there as soon as possible, but don’t be concerned if it takes long.</span> <span id="s1660">And I repeat, dear Siegfried, don’t worry about me and don’t reproach yourself.</span> <span id="s1661">Fate is stronger than we are.</span> <span id="s1662">If it’s God will that we will be reunited, He can arrange that from there, just as it is His will that I could not get to you from here.</span> <span id="s1663">I’ve packed already, have taken all my warm clothes along.</span> <span id="s1664">Frau Kaufman, the old lady who lives with me is also in the transport and many of my old friends.</span> <span id="s1665">Together our lot will be easier to pare -- bear.</span> <span id="s1666">Now my dear Siegfried, I have just talked with the children.</span> <span id="s1667">Freidel wants to come with me and Gerda too.</span> <span id="s1668">I don’t know if they can get travel permission and at any rate, they should stay and keep in contact with you.</span> <span id="s1669">Farewell.”</span> <span id="s1670">On the 11th she was deported to Ausch -- to Riga.</span> <span id="s1671">She was 45 years old.</span> <span id="s1672">On the ninth she was called and on the 11th she was deported.</span> <span id="s1673">And the ways of God are indeed strange.</span> <span id="s1674">My first son was born on the ninth and my second son on the 11th of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: And when did you receive those letters [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: My father gave those to me when I came over here in ‘46.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: So it was right away in ‘46?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1679">He might not have given them to me, but of course I knew about them.</span> <span id="s1680">I tell you, he gave them to me when I was writing the book, in ‘83, but I -- I was aware of them anyway.</span> <span id="s1681">I knew he had them, they were all still in their original envelopes and of course the envelope had to say, Sarah Paula Sarah Schil-Schild and -- and it also had to say who took the letter to the Post Office and then it was opened up by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1682">It’s weird -- weird.</span> <span id="s1683">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: We were speaking about your books and the -- the writing that you’ve done has also sparked letters from various people and you’ve mentioned this letter from a young girl and I wonder if you could tell a little bit about that letter --</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: -- and then perhaps read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: We’ll wind up, yes.</span> <span id="s1688">I have a stack of letters here that you can see is quite an impressive collection of -- of -- of letters that I received from my first book.</span> <span id="s1689">And you know, I got only one criticism in that whole time on the first book and it was from a Polish man -- a Pole, not a Jew, who objected to my stating in the book that the Poles were the most anti-Semitic nation in -- in Europe and he pointed out to me in that letter, which of course I saved, that the Poles had done a lot for the Jews back in the olden days, which is correct.</span> <span id="s1690">The kings of Pole -- Poland took the Jews in and let them prosper there and indeed they prospered in Poland.</span> <span id="s1691">The Jewish community of Poland was outstanding.</span> <span id="s1692">But during Hitler time, I remain with my -- with my statement that Poland was the most violently anti-Semitic country in Europe.</span> <span id="s1693">But all the other letters, except for that one, were -- were with me -- were with me.</span> <span id="s1694">Some were eye openers, that they didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1695">Some said, “Yeah, I was there too and you described it just right.”</span> <span id="s1696">Others thanked me for opening up and others complimented me for being able to do it.</span> <span id="s1697">And that was, of course, in ‘83, after my first book came out.</span> <span id="s1698">Now I wrote a second book and that came out in ‘93 and I wrote that for a younger audience and you know, the interesting thing is, I did not get the response that I got the first time.</span> <span id="s1699">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1700">It may have to do with the editor’s broadcasting it less, publish it -- publicizing it less.</span> <span id="s1701">But I give the book to Bat Mitzvah and Bas Mitzvah -- and Bar Mitzvah kids and kids that I think would understand.</span> <span id="s1702">They are 12 and 13 years old and they should know.</span> <span id="s1703">And I gave it recently to one of my little -- little 13 year -- 12 year old friends who had a -- a -- a Bat Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1704">She lives actually right across the street from me and she writes me, “Dear Dr. and Mrs. Rudolf Haas, thank you very much for celebrating this special occasion with me.</span> <span id="s1705">Your gift was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1706">I finished the book with a completely different attitude toward the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1707">I was often afraid to read Holocaust books, because I feared they would give me nightmares.</span> <span id="s1708">Reading the stories of all these people made me realize how many good people there were.</span> <span id="s1709">I also need to remember that the Holocaust was a reality and it wasn’t a nightmare.</span> <span id="s1710">Thank you for everything you have done for me.</span> <span id="s1711">Sincerely, Sophie Rappaport.”</span> <span id="s1712">And that was now -- that’s a young girl, that -- the third generation after me.</span> <span id="s1713">It still lives and they still want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1716">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: This has been a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum oral history interview with Gerda Haas.</span> <span id="s1718">This concludes the
