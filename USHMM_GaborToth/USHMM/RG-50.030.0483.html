<p><span id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gitta Sereny, conducted by Vera Frankel on February 28th, 2004, in London.</span> <span id="s12">This is tape number one, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Not yet?</span> <span id="s14">God, I hate these tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: All right, first of all I wanted to ask you really just about your background, your family, your childhood in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Oh my God.</span> <span id="s17">Well, my childhood -- course in Austria as you probably know, I didn’t stay there very long.</span> <span id="s18">I mean I -- I was born in Vienna.</span> <span id="s19">My father was Hungarian, my mother German, and they went to Vienna, it’s no secret really, because my father’s family would not have my mother, who was a very pretty young actress, much younger than my father, but extremely pretty, well they would not have her in Hungary, not at -- at his place.</span> <span id="s20">So he had to give all this up, and he did, he gave it all up for her and bought a flat in Vienna, and came to live in Vienna, which is -- I -- it must have been -- I didn’t know him, you know, he died when I was two, so I never knew him, but I gather he was a charming man, I bet he was.</span> <span id="s21">But he was 30 years older than she.</span> <span id="s22">So it -- one can imagine, can’t one?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Let [tape break] right --</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: So they hear my dirty laugh all the way.</span> <span id="s25">Well, never mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: They hear your dirty laugh all the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: That’s their loss or gain.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: So you father died when you were two, but how were you brought up, in what kind of atmosphere, and what kind of ideas were you brought up with?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Well, ideas, my mother didn’t have ideas, she was an actress, and she was very beautiful, and she was you know, surrounded by elegant and charming men, which was rather nice, you know, I rather enjoyed that.</span> <span id="s30">But she was very childlike.</span> <span id="s31">And she -- she certainly liked la grande vie, and she created this grande vie, which was, I think, brave of her.</span> <span id="s32">She continued to have it after my father died, when there was some money, but not much.</span> <span id="s33">And when it was gone she was particularly brave because she spoke absolutely perfect English, and she took to translating plays, which was -- course was a very, very good thing at the time in Vienna because they had no plays of their own in the 20’s.</span> <span id="s34">Later, Thomas Bennett came, but there were no Austrian playwrights.</span> <span id="s35">Well, of course there were the -- Schnitzler and old ones, you know, but not modern ones.</span> <span id="s36">So all the plays came from France and England, and America, too, but England was the -- and she did rather well, and she worked extremely hard.</span> <span id="s37">This I respected, I mean I -- I -- you know, I -- I think that I learned a lot from that, because I -- I -- I didn’t respect her for her childishness.</span> <span id="s38">I --I did think that, you know, by the time I was 10, I felt that really she should be more grown up.</span> <span id="s39">But -- but I did respect her staying up late, late, late into the night working so that she could get -- offer us this life, which she thought was essential.</span> <span id="s40">Of course, I would never have thought it was essential.</span> <span id="s41">But she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: And what kind of people did she surround you with?</span> <span id="s43">I mean, were they actors, were they playwrights?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Well, they were partly actors, and partly ar -- aristocrats, because she was very -- as I said, she was very -- you know, a very sort.</span> <span id="s45">She went out a lot, she had absolutely beautiful clothes made by a little seamstress from models.</span> <span id="s46">The seamstress came once a week for two days.</span> <span id="s47">Abso --</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: As often as that?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: As often as that.</span> <span id="s50">She had a lot of clothes, and she would go to all the sales, sometimes dragging me along, and buy these abso -- the remnants, you know, of beautiful, beautiful materials.</span> <span id="s51">And this little seamstress, who was absolutely splendid, and was able to copy models.</span> <span id="s52">So anyway, all this, this was the sort of child life, until I was 11, and then by this time I had changed schools, had gone from, you know, my elementary school, which was a very ordinary state school, which I loved.</span> <span id="s53">I loved school anyway.</span> <span id="s54">I had gone to a riyah gimnasium, which is sort of -- you know, a private high school for girls, called Lueetlan.</span> <span id="s55">And -- and at 11 I was sent to England.</span> <span id="s56">My brother -- I had a brother who was four years older than I, Guido.</span> <span id="s57">Guido had already been sent to England years before, also at -- no he -- he ma -- he was sent at 12 actually, because my father wanted us brought up in England, which was a very wise idea, I think.</span> <span id="s58">I mean, he also wanted us brought up in France, which also happened, so you know -- not my brother, but I.</span> <span id="s59">So I -- I was able to speak these languages, you know, which is good.</span> <span id="s60">And then I came back to Vienna to go to dramatic school.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Now there’s an extraordinary incident that you’ve written about in 1934, when your train broke down as you were going back to school in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s65">I was -- it was very interesting, I mean a -- it -- it broke down in Nuremberg, and it was the time of the Nuremberg party day.</span> <span id="s66">And the train, they couldn’t find --- well, I gath -- I gather they couldn’t find a train to replace it, so they had to repair it, which was going to take five hours.</span> <span id="s67">And so the -- there was another child on this train by itself, so we were unaccompanied children.</span> <span id="s68">I was in my school uniform, which is brown and green, and the German Red Cross took us over, this little girl and me, who was also going to school, not my school, but another school, and took us to the party day.</span> <span id="s69">And we were taken to the -- there was a children’s sort of gallendare if you -- if you know what that means.</span> <span id="s70">I mean, it was just a -- you know, rows and rows of -- of -- of benches going up, all children, it was only children.</span> <span id="s71">And so we were taken way up, because there was -- there wasn’t any space, as you can imagine.</span> <span id="s72">But they put us in there, and I just thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.</span> <span id="s73">It was absolutely magnificent.</span> <span id="s74">And you know, all the -- the -- the -- this wonderful rhythm and these -- these -- these clean looking boys and -- and girls -- I mean and also marching, you know, people.</span> <span id="s75">And then of course there were these speeches, and I had absolutely no idea what they were saying.</span> <span id="s76">I mean, I didn’t understand a word.</span> <span id="s77">But I screamed like everybody else.</span> <span id="s78">I mean, I thought it was just so exciting.</span> <span id="s79">I had never been so excited in my life, I think.</span> <span id="s80">The colors, and the -- I don’t know, the -- the music, and the -- the rhythm, you know, there was just -- it was theater like you -- one -- it’s almost indescribable of course, you -- you’ve seen it, everybody has seen it on film.</span> <span id="s81">But of course here I was actually seeing it, you know, and the colors are quite different when you are actually watching these -- these -- these flags wave, you know, in the wind.</span> <span id="s82">And you’re there, and they’re -- and you -- you get the wind, the -- that the s -- that the flags made, that they were all -- all around, they were everywhere, and there were thousands of flags.</span> <span id="s83">It was just beautiful.</span> <span id="s84">And anyway, so I -- I screamed like everybody else, heil, heil, and I don’t know who he was -- I didn’t know who he was, but anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Did you have any idea what it was about, what it signified?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: No, I knew it was the German National -- you know, I knew he was the leader of Germany, and I knew that I had heard of course grown-ups, my mother -- my -- my mother’s friends.</span> <span id="s87">I had heard people say that he was a bad man, but of course I had no idea why he should be a bad man, it was so pretty.</span> <span id="s88">Why should he be bad, you know?</span> <span id="s89">And -- and to me it was just absolutely wonderful, as to everybody else there.</span> <span id="s90">So anyway then -- then there was the interesting thing, which I have written about, I came to -- came to school in England.</span> <span id="s91">I had this wonderful teacher whom I adored, Lee Hindly.</span> <span id="s92">She died fairly recently.</span> <span id="s93">Lee Chadwick afterwards.</span> <span id="s94">Well Lee Hindly, who I thought was a -- you know, fantastically grown up lady, becau -- I think she was 24, I mean -- and she was a very, very English, English girl -- young woman, with this wonderful voice, and this -- you know, this -- this absolutely beautiful -- not o -- Oxford English, but just the real sort of -- I-I can’t describe it, I mean, I just thought it was divine, and of course she taught me every word I learned.</span> <span id="s95">I mean, I knew -- I didn’t know a word of English when I came there.</span> <span id="s96">And she was very, very kind, and I adored her.</span> <span id="s97">Anyway, I arrived back to school and -- and I wrote this -- we were supposed to write this, you know, this [indecipherable] this eg -- essay about our most beautiful day of the holidays.</span> <span id="s98">Well, naturally I wrote about this.</span> <span id="s99">And -- and she read it, and -- and having read all the others, a prize was given for a girl who wrote -- little girl who wrote about a stallion having -- I mean, not a stallion, a -- a -- a horse having a baby, I me -- wonderful, wonderful story.</span> <span id="s100">And -- and she -- she said to me, that’s a very good job of work, so that was enough for me.</span> <span id="s101">And then she said, “Can you stay here a minute afterwards?”</span> <span id="s102">After the lessons, so I did.</span> <span id="s103">And she said, “I brought this for you, and I want you to read it.”</span> <span id="s104">And she gave me this book, in English.</span> <span id="s105">And I said, “What is it?”</span> <span id="s106">It said Mein Kampf in German underneath, and said, you know, my battle.</span> <span id="s107">And I said, “What is this?”</span> <span id="s108">And she said, “Well, the man you saw speak wrote this book about his plans for Europe, and I want you to read it.”</span> <span id="s109">And I said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s110">And she said, “Because anybody who comes from your corner of the world needs to read this book.”</span> <span id="s111">She -- I later found out, I didn’t know this, nobody knew this -- she was a member of the Communist party, and she became really very active indeed.</span> <span id="s112">In fact, you know later, much later, years later, she became a councilor for the Communist party in Oldeburough, in Laseton where she lived, having married twice, and so on.</span> <span id="s113">Anyway, she was -- she continued to be absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s114">And I read this book.</span> <span id="s115">I mean, I can’t say I read this book, but I read into this book.</span> <span id="s116">It was impossible for me to read the whole book, you know.</span> <span id="s117">I wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: You were 11, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: I was -- yes, I was 11.</span> <span id="s120">I mean, I was -- I was 11 and a half by then, because it was six months -- I’d been in this school for six months by then.</span> <span id="s121">And you know, I -- I did understand it.</span> <span id="s122">I mean, I would -- well, I would have said probably I read a third of it, you know, read here -- reading here and there, and there, and there, jumping, of course, which she knew I would.</span> <span id="s123">I mean it was impossible to read for -- for an 11 year old.</span> <span id="s124">But I -- I knew perfectly well that -- I saw perfectly well.</span> <span id="s125">I never understood how people told me afterwards they -- well, they couldn’t read it to start out with, they hadn’t read it, which was a lie.</span> <span id="s126">Everybody said they hadn’t read it.</span> <span id="s127">All -- all ger -- I don’t think I -- well no, I did meet some Germans who admitted to having read it, but most Germans, including Speer, indeed, said they hadn’t read it, that you know it was that Hitler wa -- ca -- in Speer’s case, Hitler told him it was -- it was way over, it was -- it was too late, not to bother.</span> <span id="s128">I mean, so many things had happened that it was -- we were holed, as they said.</span> <span id="s129">Anyway, so I brought it back to Lee, to Miss Hindly, and -- and she said, “Well what did you think of it?”</span> <span id="s130">And I said, “Well, I da -- I -- two things.</span> <span id="s131">I mean, what I -- I mean, how is he go -- I mean, he wants to -- he wants Europe, he wants to rule over Europe, that seems quite clear.</span> <span id="s132">But how can he do this,” I ask, “without a war?”</span> <span id="s133">And she said, “Well, I’m asking you, you tell me.”</span> <span id="s134">I said, “Well, I mean, other countries aren’t just going to give him their country.”</span> <span id="s135">And she said, “Uh-huh, mm-hm.”</span> <span id="s136">And I said, “And what is he going on about the Jews?</span> <span id="s137">I mean, he keeps talking about the Jews, and he says awfully nasty things about them.”</span> <span id="s138">And she said, “He hates them.”</span> <span id="s139">So I said, “But why?”</span> <span id="s140">And she said, “I don’t know.</span> <span id="s141">You will have to make up your mind yourself in the end.</span> <span id="s142">Learn it, read, and maybe you’ll find out.”</span> <span id="s143">But of course I never did until, you know, until I did this work, which I did much later.</span> <span id="s144">Probably this is where of my -- my wish to do something started, without my knowing it, of course, you know.</span> <span id="s145">Anyway, that’s my childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Now, you’ve written that your most influential and important years were your teens and 20’s.</span> <span id="s147">What was it like to grow up at a time when the world’s being turned upside down in front of your own eyes?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Well, I think actually I d -- I didn’t say that, I think of a -- ba -- I said something slightly different, my -- I think my most important time was -- the two moments, both when I worked with children.</span> <span id="s149">First during the war, when I was in France, because the war came when I had been sent to study in France.</span> <span id="s150">And I stayed, I’d -- I fell in love with an English boy, and I was not going to go to -- my mother had married somebody in Geneva, and had gone to live in Geneva, and I was damned if I was going to live in Geneva.</span> <span id="s151">Sh -- they put me into a pensionnat de jeune filles there, you know, and I ran away.</span> <span id="s152">I mean, it was just outrageous.</span> <span id="s153">Somebody who had been in the Reinhardt [indecipherable] you know -- you know, to be then put into a pensionnat de jeune filles, I mean, you must imagine this, us walking in twos, you know?</span> <span id="s154">I mean outrageous.</span> <span id="s155">Anyway, so I ran away.</span> <span id="s156">But they were quite sensible, and they left me in -- in France, and they -- finally my -- my mother and stepfather -- and they very sweetly, you know, paid for me to live with a family then, which was the most sensible thing.</span> <span id="s157">I mean, I was 15.</span> <span id="s158">So anyway -- I can’t remember what I said.</span> <span id="s159">Oh yes, well the war came, and I decided to work in a ca -- in a -- with an organization called the Auxiliaire Soc-Sociale, who were taking care of -- well really, what we later called displaced persons, but that is not -- they were called refugees then -- came into Paris from, you know, all the places that the Germans had already overrun.</span> <span id="s160">And I was put in charge by the -- the person who was a -- who was the president of this organization, a woman called Isabelle de la Bouillerie, who came -- who was in my life for quite awhile afterwards.</span> <span id="s161">Anyway, Isabelle put me in charge of the nursery.</span> <span id="s162">And we had a nursery for -- we -- we took -- didn’t took take away, but we -- we accepted, and the women who came with small babies were absolutely delighted, you know, after walking in the -- on the roads with small babies, they were all exhausted.</span> <span id="s163">I mean, that was the main thing that I think I -- I experienced for the first time, you know, the exhaustion of people who run away.</span> <span id="s164">It is just terrible.</span> <span id="s165">And if you ha -- if you are holding onto perhaps a small child and a baby, as many of them were, it -- it was killing.</span> <span id="s166">It was killing.</span> <span id="s167">They were -- they all arrived, you know, filthy and pale, and oh, awful.</span> <span id="s168">And when we offered to take the babies and they could come and see the babies whenever they liked, of course.</span> <span id="s169">Some of them were nursing the babies and they came quite often, but anyway, in the night I mean.</span> <span id="s170">We didn’t have a single nerve, not a single one.</span> <span id="s171">And we ended up at one point with 56 babies in that room.</span> <span id="s172">And we had -- we had American members of the Auxiliaire Sociale who were very rich, and it was absolutely extraordinary because first we started of course, with six babies, you know, and we had eight cots.</span> <span id="s173">And I said to one of the -- to this woman, who -- this American who was part of the organization, I said, “You know, I think there are going to be a lot more.”</span> <span id="s174">And she said, “How many do you think there might be?”</span> <span id="s175">“I don’t know,” I said, “I don’t know, 10 - 20?”</span> <span id="s176">She said, “Right.”</span> <span id="s177">And you know, it was not two hours later that 20 cots arrived, and two nights later we had 56, and they came during the day, and we had 56 cots by that night.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: How was sh -- how was that organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: She bought them.</span> <span id="s180">She was a millionaire.</span> <span id="s181">I mean it’s wonderful when you’re very rich, you know, you just pa -- pick up the telephone.</span> <span id="s182">She picked up the telephone, she ordered 56 cots.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: What was the extent of your duties while you were doing this work?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Oh, this was really just taking care of babies, you know, c-cleaning them, washing them, you know, feeding them, of course, if they were not on the breast.</span> <span id="s185">Well, really hugging them, you know, cuddling them.</span> <span id="s186">They all needed a lot of cuddling.</span> <span id="s187">We had a lot of baby clothes, again, from all these people who were very rich, who was in the Auxiliaire Sociale.</span> <span id="s188">So we had mountains of material, so we were able to change them, and of course this made the mothers incredibly happy, suddenly to be able to be without them for a little while, know where they are, they were safe, they were being cleaned.</span> <span id="s189">And then they got them back looking absolutely gorgeous.</span> <span id="s190">It was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Where had these women come from?</span> <span id="s192">I mean, from --</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Well, they came from the north of France, which had already been overrun.</span> <span id="s194">And they came from -- they came from the borderlands, you know, on the -- on the east side, which hadn’t already been overrun.</span> <span id="s195">I mean it’s -- it was -- as you know, this was very quick.</span> <span id="s196">I mean, the Auxiliaire Sociale in Paris only lasted from the 10th of May --</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: -- oh, sorry, from the fifth of May, I think to the 20th of May.</span> <span id="s199">And by the 20th of May, we knew that we were -- we were going to be left with any number of abandoned children, or lost children, or orphan children.</span> <span id="s200">And we set up again, because all these people, you know, all these backers of the Auxiliaire Sociale, lucky they were very rich, and many of them had castles in various corners of -- of France and we got a series of castles -- part of castles put at our disposal for them -- for starting children’s centers.</span> <span id="s201">And I took 16 kids on -- I can’t remember the date, but it was the end of May, before the Germans came into Paris, just before to -- to Villandry, which was one of the great châteaux of the Loire, and belonged to Isabelle de la Bouillerie, or rather her mother, who was American.</span> <span id="s202">Ann Crawford -- I can’t remember what her se -- second name was.</span> <span id="s203">Anyway, she had married this Spaniard, who owned this wonderful castle.</span> <span id="s204">And they gave us the stables, and they had -- before we came they had some of the castle workers, you know, put beds, iron bedsteads and mattresses into -- and upstairs, they had actually in the stables, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s205">And this is where we had our children’s center.</span> <span id="s206">And actually we ended up with I think 20 or 21 children.</span> <span id="s207">So that was all right, it was -- it was a very -- you know, it was a -- it was certainly for me an incredible lesson when the Germans arrived, and I adore the French.</span> <span id="s208">I mean, I was so pro-French, for no reason.</span> <span id="s209">I mean, I had nothing to fear with the Germans, and I had no reason to dislike the Germans, except what I had heard, all these elegant people around my mother say -- some of them -- some of them of course were Jews, because you know, most of the -- most of the theater people really were Jewish, and -- and most of -- my mother was -- had a lot of newspaper friends, there were a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s210">And so I -- I certainly heard in ma -- my subconscious I heard more things than in my conscious, but I had a real dislike for the Germans, which when they actually came into France, I couldn’t find a reason for.</span> <span id="s211">They were very nice when they came to France.</span> <span id="s212">They were very nice to the French.</span> <span id="s213">They were absolutely charming to me.</span> <span id="s214">You know, I had a -- a -- a -- I was introduced by Isabelle, of course it was not beyond making use of whatever she could make use of, so she introduced me with my father’s title, which of course didn’t give me anything at all, but she invented one.</span> <span id="s215">So -- because the -- in Hungary the daughter of a count has no title.</span> <span id="s216">So -- but I very quickly became countess, and they absolutely adored that, they loved this little Hungarian countess, you know, who spoke perfect German -- Viennese German at that, Volksdeutsch with a [indecipherable] art, you know, loved it -- if you understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Viennese Volksdeutsch.</span> <span id="s219">Anyway, so -- so I became her -- Isabelle’s interpreter, which was very useful for her, but extremely useful for me, because I -- you know, I learned more, I think, from that than I could have learned any other way.</span> <span id="s220">I mean, I spoke to so many Germans, most of them as I say, very nice.</span> <span id="s221">As the year went on, and things began to happen, you know, people began to be locked up, including friends of mine in Paris, it was less nice.</span> <span id="s222">And of course I was able to approach them on this, I mean ask them why, you know.</span> <span id="s223">And of course, a lot of Jews in Paris were arrested, which Isabelle learned about very quickly, as she had a very wide circle.</span> <span id="s224">And -- and I -- I -- I challenged them on that.</span> <span id="s225">And you know, most of them really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s226">They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s227">Of course, most of the people we saw were army officers, you know, they were -- those were the people who came to see the chateaux.</span> <span id="s228">I mean, you weren’t going to have the privates come and see chateaux, on the whole.</span> <span id="s229">So the army officers, most of them professional army officers, they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s230">They said, “Well, you know, it’s the law, it’s the law.”</span> <span id="s231">And I -- I would ask, “Why is it the law?”</span> <span id="s232">I had great argument with two people who -- and this is the terrible thing, it’s a terrible -- I’ll never forget that, I -- I mean, I’m partly to blame for what happened, I think.</span> <span id="s233">Isabelle became very friendly with a German doctor, and a -- I wrote about that, the -- so you know about it already, a da -- da -- a school -- former school director.</span> <span id="s234">And they came all the time.</span> <span id="s235">I mean, they came -- I think they must have come three times a week at least, to have tea with her, to have lunch with her, to have dinner even with her, you know, and she always called me in whenever I could get away from the children, and we both -- she very elegantly, and me not elegantly at all, would challenge them on all these things.</span> <span id="s236">Her secretary, who she had with her, was Jewish, Jacqueline, I can’t remember her other name, and she was very protective of -- of certainly of Jacqueline, and I think of -- or we -- two of our Auxiliaire nurses -- well, yeah, but they weren’t nurses, they were like me, I mean we were volunteers, and a mother and daughter, very good looking, were both Jew -- well, obviously both, but they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s237">So she was very protective of them, and these two people just took it, you know.</span> <span id="s238">And they -- I would ask and ask and ask, and they would say there is no explanation, it is the law, and most people agree with it, and blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s239">Anyway, this went on and on, and one day they disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: The two German officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s242">And I had made another friend, who in fact saved me in the end, who was the head of intelligence, military intelligence, in Tours, which was the nearest city.</span> <span id="s243">And I went to see him, and I said, “These were our friends, what’s happened -- well, these are our friends, where are they?”</span> <span id="s244">And he said, “I don’t want you ever to ask about them again.”</span> <span id="s245">And I said, “No, but you have to tell us what happened, if you know what happened.</span> <span id="s246">Where are they?”</span> <span id="s247">And he said, “I’m afraid they were arrested.”</span> <span id="s248">I said, “But why?”</span> <span id="s249">And he said, “Because they saw too much of you French.”</span> <span id="s250">And I don -- then later, you know, also through him, found out that the doctor was sent to the Russian -- to the Russian front, and he was killed very soon.</span> <span id="s251">He was the -- sent as a medic, but he was killed very soon.</span> <span id="s252">And -- and the school director was sent to a concentration camp, he was fat.</span> <span id="s253">You know, he was -- he -- i-impossible for him to do anything in a concentration camp, he couldn’t have.</span> <span id="s254">And he died, too.</span> <span id="s255">So you know we -- we really -- I mean this is something we -- we -- we really made their lives, I think, very unhappy these last weeks they had, which is quite awful.</span> <span id="s256">Anyway, there you are.</span> <span id="s257">That’s how, you know, how it went there.</span> <span id="s258">Anyway, by this time, I was doing little things, very small things, nothing of note, nothing heroic for -- for the resistance.</span> <span id="s259">B -- it was just starting, you know, the resistance really, in 1941 barely existed, barely.</span> <span id="s260">It existed in places like Paris, and Lyon, but in the countryside of course, there was no resistance, I mean good God.</span> <span id="s261">So what we did, the only things we did was on two occasions we managed to -- we managed to take care of some British fliers who -- who crashed, and who happened to crash -- one of them actually crashed in the park, which was extremely convenient, yes.</span> <span id="s262">But the other one crashed, and somehow made his way to us, so we hid these two.</span> <span id="s263">And we hid them by putting them in the children’s dormitory.</span> <span id="s264">The children just loved it.</span> <span id="s265">The two oldest boys gave up their beds.</span> <span id="s266">I mean, one on one occasion, and the other on the other occasion.</span> <span id="s267">And these bo -- these boys, you know, these young RAF boys, I mean, they were -- they were 18 - 19.</span> <span id="s268">I mean, they were children.</span> <span id="s269">And they -- our children were so excited.</span> <span id="s270">You know, now they were part of it.</span> <span id="s271">Anyway, however --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: I’ve got to just turn -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: This is tape number one, side B, of an interview with Gitta Sereny.</span> <span id="s274">For every [indecipherable] in England … i-if I remember rightly, you were fourteen in March 1938, when the Nazis marched into Vienna --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: No, I 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Were you 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: I was 15, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: What do you recollect about that happening, about the atmosphere, the general reaction, and your own reaction to all that?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Well, you know, that was the -- the odd thing, because this is the first time, of course, I saw them again since 1934.</span> <span id="s280">So I was not -- you know, I was not as concerned as, of course, some of my mother’s friends were, and my mother.</span> <span id="s281">My mother ha -- was very concerned.</span> <span id="s282">She had become engaged to a famous economist called Ludwig von Mises, who was Jewish, and -- but a very, very eminent man, and who is -- who had been already, for four years at the Ecole de Zoadsetude in Geneva, so he was not there.</span> <span id="s283">I mean, they would -- he would come back every summer to go mountain climbing with her, that was their thing, and they were -- they were real, real country nuts, real mountain nuts.</span> <span id="s284">I hardly knew him.</span> <span id="s285">I mean, he was -- he didn’t come close to me at all, there was -- very severe man, I thought.</span> <span id="s286">I couldn’t -- I could not understand how she could be in love with him, but there you are, there you are.</span> <span id="s287">And so -- so this was a worry of course, that she -- that she was very concerned, she was very worried about all of it.</span> <span id="s288">And -- and then of course, you know, it began, I mean you -- you -- you -- there were an awf -- as I told you, there were an awful lot of -- of Jews in the theater world, and I was at the Reinhardt seminar which was -- well, I mean, Reinhardt of course was a Jew.</span> <span id="s289">He was not there, I mean he had left in -- he was in Vienna last -- I can’t remember, but I think it was in January of that year.</span> <span id="s290">He had done a wonderful production at his theater, which we all, of course, went to the rehearsals, and it was just absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s291">But then he left, and with him his -- his wife, Helene Thimig, who was -- you know, for whom we all -- I mean, we just adored her, I mean she was the most wonderful actress.</span> <span id="s292">I mean, probably there were two great, great actresses in Austria.</span> <span id="s293">There was she, and Paula Wessely, two really great actress, and of course we, as very young people, we -- we just had adorations for these people, you know.</span> <span id="s294">Anyway, she left.</span> <span id="s295">That was a blow because we -- we did find out that she left because Reinhardt was a Jew, and he thought that the Germans were coming in.</span> <span id="s296">And he was damn right.</span> <span id="s297">He thought that the Austrians would not be able to withstand it, and he thought they were -- this I found out much later, but I mean, this is what happened.</span> <span id="s298">So, you know, I was a little bit preconditioned against them by this time, all this.</span> <span id="s299">And then they came in, and it was really quite strange, because you know, Vienna didn’t suit them, or they didn’t suit Vienna.</span> <span id="s300">I mean, they -- they were -- they were incredibly different.</span> <span id="s301">I mean, the Viennese are -- I mean, I don’t necessarily like the Viennese all that much, but they -- the -- the -- they are a very special breed, and it’s not a German breed.</span> <span id="s302">It just isn’t.</span> <span id="s303">You know, it -- it -- it -- it dates back to the empire, the -- this extraordinary mixture, if you take a Viennese telephone book -- I don’t know whether you’ve ever done this, you take a Viennese telephone book, and you will see all the names in the world, I mean Polish, Czech, it’s all from eastern Europe, Hungarian.</span> <span id="s304">And you will hardly see German names.</span> <span id="s305">You know, and this -- this speaks -- this -- this says something, you know, and so when these Germans came in, all just like in 1934, looking wonderful, clean, you know, beautiful.</span> <span id="s306">They were beautiful men, but they didn’t fit.</span> <span id="s307">They didn’t fit.</span> <span id="s308">And then, within two days we had really, at the seminar we had a real shock, because the seminar -- all the schools reopened, the university and -- and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Within two days?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Within two days, yes, on the 15th they reopened.</span> <span id="s311">And so we went to school and the first thing we saw was the administrator who Reinhardt had put in, Dr. Neidafuhr, wearing a swastika.</span> <span id="s312">And this was absolutely extraordinary.</span> <span id="s313">Now this is when -- no, it was not then, it was a little bit later, I realized something that had happened, which I had not really sort of ful -- fully taken in the real reason for.</span> <span id="s314">We were -- we were preparing, or we did -- you know, we had these student performances of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: [coughing] Forgive me.</span> <span id="s316">Do go on, so sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: No, that’s all right.</span> <span id="s318">Well anyway, a couple of months before we had prepared this -- this is -- not a couple mo -- it was in -- before Christmas, before Christmas ’37, we were preparing Gorky’s, “The Buffoon,” I don’t know whether you know that play.</span> <span id="s319">And a -- there were these two women’s parts, Natasha and Natalia, I think.</span> <span id="s320">And I played one of them, and we had two casts, who would play alternative -- you know, alternately, for a week.</span> <span id="s321">And I was in the first cast.</span> <span id="s322">And th-the play was being -- there -- there’s a story, there’s -- the play was being produced -- directed by of course a student, but under the supervision of a man called Geyer, G-e-y-e-r, who was the most charming man.</span> <span id="s323">He was the -- he was the director of a big theater in Vienna called the Volkes theater, and he was one of our teachers.</span> <span id="s324">I mean, they were all people like that, you see?</span> <span id="s325">And -- and he was charming.</span> <span id="s326">He was incapable of ever telling anyone that he was no good.</span> <span id="s327">So everybody adored him, you know.</span> <span id="s328">And he had given these parts, he had you know, assigned these parts to the people he wanted.</span> <span id="s329">And the girl who had my part in the second cast, I thought was very good, you know?</span> <span id="s330">And suddenly it was taken away from her.</span> <span id="s331">And there was sort of gossip going on that Neidafuhr had taken it away from her, and she was absolutely in despair.</span> <span id="s332">And it is only much later that I found out that she was Jewish, because you know, really nobody -- this is something that people find very difficult to understand, but really we didn’t know who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s333">There were -- I think there were six Jewish students, I afterwards of course, found out.</span> <span id="s334">In -- in the -- in the two year -- in the two year --</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Course.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yeah, the courses last two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: So there were -- I don’t know there were -- all together I think there were 70 students.</span> <span id="s339">And there were six Jewish students, and she was one of them, which we found out, of course, when all this happened, when the nat -- when the Nazis came in, cause they disappeared very quickly.</span> <span id="s340">I mean, it’s not that they were arrested or anything, but they were taken out of the school, or they were expelled.</span> <span id="s341">Then I realized that she had been taken -- that he had taken -- when I saw him with the swastika, I discussed it with some friends, and we decided, having then -- by then found out that she was Jewish, that he had taken it away from her because she was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: But nothing was said?</span> <span id="s343">A: No, nothing was said.</span> <span id="s344">I mean, what could you say?</span> <span id="s345">Wo -- how can you attack as a -- as a student, how can -- you -- we were all very young, and you know, we’re not -- we were not educated in this -- in this civic response thing, which -- you know, which one gained with time.</span> <span id="s346">I mean, which then I gained of course in the -- and -- and exercised on these poor two Germans who we became friends with, you know.</span> <span id="s347">But that -- back home in ’38 -- I mean in Austria, we had -- there was less civic conscience around than -- than you can possibly imagine.</span> <span id="s348">I mean, good God, they de -- they haven’t had any civic conscience until 1986 when Waldheim -- when the Waldheim story arose, then civic conscience at last became a reality in Austria, and now, it’s different.</span> <span id="s349">But it’s taken a long time, hasn’t it?</span> <span id="s350">Anyway, in ’38 -- listen, the long and short of it is that the Viennese were absolutely delighted by the arrival of the na -- of the Germans.</span> <span id="s351">And of course, it was not only the -- the Viennese, I mean the Austrians were delighted, and one has to see this unemotionally as one can.</span> <span id="s352">Austria was a country that was economically unviable.</span> <span id="s353">It only existed in tourism.</span> <span id="s354">There was no other way for Austria to exist.</span> <span id="s355">And since -- I mean, now of course I found out so much more, you know, I know so much more now than I did, I didn’t know any of this of course, because I was -- I had absolutely nothing to do with politics, but I know now, I mean that -- that the social democrats, can you believe it, were the first, who in the early 20’s wanted an annexi -- an -- an annexation to Germany.</span> <span id="s356">You see?</span> <span id="s357">Without -- I mean, at that time of course, they were not the Nazis, but they were -- this -- this anschluss to Germany was the thing that had gone through the 20th century, the early 20th century, and the more people realized, after the empire died, that the only way that Germany -- that Austria could survive was as part of Germany.</span> <span id="s358">The more people, you know, felt this, and this was not -- really not because they were -- I mean, in America you see mostly, but also elsewhere, this became a -- well, it became thought of as everything stemming from anti-Semitism, and this isn’t true, never was true.</span> <span id="s359">Of course the -- all -- a -- Austria, you know, was -- was -- was -- behaved absolutely atrociously about it’s Jews.</span> <span id="s360">I mean, really atrociously, worse than the Germans.</span> <span id="s361">But it -- it was not really -- that was not the reasons why they wanted the Germans, it was economic.</span> <span id="s362">And the ideological part was very small.</span> <span id="s363">Very powerful, but very small.</span> <span id="s364">Very powerful, alas.</span> <span id="s365">And becoming more powerful all the time.</span> <span id="s366">As the Germans came in, things became much better very quickly.</span> <span id="s367">And for the first year they were there -- and I was not there then any more because my mother really had to leave, you know, with being this -- this marriage well known -- I mean, this about to be married to Louie -- to Lou.</span> <span id="s368">So we -- we left at the end of May, so I was only there for two months, in Nazi -- occupied Nazi -- not occupied, Nazi Vienna, really.</span> <span id="s369">It was -- it wasn’t occupied, I mean, it was not a victim, they were not victims.</span> <span id="s370">Really not.</span> <span id="s371">I mean, they wanted the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: You’ve written that you were struck very early on by the Nazi’s behavior to the Jews, and this --</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yes, we did see that, as I -- I’ve written this, though, and you know it, and it’s all -- it’s all --</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Well, I know it, but there’s one -- one anecdote that I find very striking, I think you were coming with your friend Elfie from school, and you noticed a group of people, including your pediatrician.</span> <span id="s375">Can you -- can you describe that anecdote?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Well yes, that was -- that was -- that was the one I wrote in fact, the -- it’s -- that was really shocking.</span> <span id="s377">I mean, we were walking -- it was actually not coming from school, we were going for a walk, and I think, I honestly think it was a Saturday, but I’m not sure, because w-we would have been in school.</span> <span id="s378">Or maybe it was the 14th, no I think it was on the 14th, it’s before the school reopened.</span> <span id="s379">That’s it, of course.</span> <span id="s380">And he -- she and I went for a walk through the innerashtatsa -- through the inner city, you know where -- which is where I lived.</span> <span id="s381">She didn’t, in fact, she lived in the fourth district, but she came and w-we -- we were always together, so we went for this walk.</span> <span id="s382">And we were walking along the Graben, which is a beautiful, beautiful street, right -- you know, it’s right in the center, it was two minutes from where I lived.</span> <span id="s383">And -- and we saw this -- this -- this group of laughing people, and there were two -- two Germans -- I mean, or maybe they weren’t, maybe they were Austrians, but they were in uniform, black uniforms with, you know, swastika arm bands.</span> <span id="s384">And we made our way through this crowd, there were probably about 50 - 60 people, a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: So we couldn’t see anything from -- from outside that circle, but we made our way through, and -- and there we saw these -- this -- this group of -- of elder -- really elderly -- well, elderly, I mean they were not young, ladies and gentlemen, because that’s what they all were.</span> <span id="s387">You know, you could see it, I mean it was -- you could see it in their clothes, you could see it in their faces, I mean it was not -- it was not -- it was not criminals, that’s what I’m trying to say, they were ladies and gentlemen.</span> <span id="s388">And they were brushing -- they were cleaning the pavement with toothbrushes.</span> <span id="s389">And I recognized Dr. Berggrün who was my pediatrician -- who had been my pediatrician.</span> <span id="s390">And I loved him when I was a small girl.</span> <span id="s391">He was -- and he saved my life, as a matter of fact, when I had diphtheria.</span> <span id="s392">Anyway -- and he was one of them, and his wife, whom I didn’t know, but I ne -- finally found out, of course, that she was his wife, was with him, and she was doing this.</span> <span id="s393">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: On hands and knees, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Oh yes, absolutely, on their knees.</span> <span id="s396">And -- and we went -- and they had a couple of, you know, buckets where they dunk the -- soapy buckets where they dunk the toothbrush in.</span> <span id="s397">Anyway, so I went up to one of these Nazis and said, “Are you mad?</span> <span id="s398">Are you completely mad?</span> <span id="s399">What are you doing there?”</span> <span id="s400">I said, “Did -- did you realize that one of these men -- I mean, I don’t know who the others are, but one of these men is a savior of lives?</span> <span id="s401">He saved my life when I was a baby.”</span> <span id="s402">He said, “What are you, a Jew?”</span> <span id="s403">And I said, “No, but what does that got to do with it?”</span> <span id="s404">And -- but Elfie was much more effective than I, because I was rather dumpy little girl.</span> <span id="s405">I mean, I was not ugly, but I was dumpy, you know.</span> <span id="s406">I was not a beauty at all.</span> <span id="s407">She was a raving beauty.</span> <span id="s408">She was a dancer you know, she has a wonderful little body, and -- and she was am -- actually a few months younger than I, I think she was still 14.</span> <span id="s409">And she had this -- this thing, this black -- sorry, this black hair, but you know all silk.</span> <span id="s410">I mean, it was the most beautiful thing you can imagine, I mean she -- she really was su -- I mean, people would turn around in the street when we walked along the street, I mean, she was so incredible.</span> <span id="s411">And she had a wonderful voice, and then she became an operetta star.</span> <span id="s412">But never mind.</span> <span id="s413">She wen -- she was go -- we were both going up to these -- to these characters.</span> <span id="s414">And she said, “Is that what you call our liberation?”</span> <span id="s415">And she sang it out, you know, and it -- it we -- I think the whole street must have heard it, in this wonderful -- she had this wonderful voice, and she had -- really she was working extremely hard at the seminar on her voice, because she had this beautiful singing voice, too.</span> <span id="s416">And so they -- they really -- they -- she -- they all knew she was going to be a star.</span> <span id="s417">I mean, there was just no doubt, she was so beautiful, you know, and talented, I mean she was talented.</span> <span id="s418">She was not a great dr-dramatic talent, but oh, wonderful personality.</span> <span id="s419">And do you know, it was really the most extraordinary thing that you can imagine.</span> <span id="s420">All these people who’ve been around there laughing, you know, and -- and -- was disgusting, it was a disgusting sight, they all melted away.</span> <span id="s421">I don’t think it took more than five seconds and they were gone.</span> <span id="s422">And then these two characters disappeared, and then there were only these people, all still on their knees.</span> <span id="s423">I don’t know how many there were, you know, I didn’t count them.</span> <span id="s424">And then slowly they got up and they disappeared.</span> <span id="s425">And then prof -- Dr. Berggrün, he was a professor as a matter of fact, Dr. Berggrün came up to us, with his wife, he -- which I now realize that was his wife, little woman, little round woman.</span> <span id="s426">Oh, her face, you know, was just so exhausted, and so frightened.</span> <span id="s427">And he said in a very severe voice, “You must never do this again, never.</span> <span id="s428">It is very dangerous for you.”</span> <span id="s429">And then I found out they killed him, later.</span> <span id="s430">They killed him in Sobibor in ’43.</span> <span id="s431">And her, no doubt, I mean I -- you know, I only found this out much later, but that was absolutely terrible, and of course it stayed with us.</span> <span id="s432">Elfie too.</span> <span id="s433">You know, Elfie, too, I mean I left and then I -- but Elfie and I remained in correspondence for a long time, until she really didn’t dare to write any more.</span> <span id="s434">But she -- she really loathed them.</span> <span id="s435">She loathed them also partly because she found out that her father had been an illegal Nazi, and -- and he had told her, the day before this happened, on the 13th of March, my birthday, he had told her that -- or was it even on the 12th, at dinnertime, he said that she was never to talk to any Jew again, and that all these s-sou -- Saujuden they called them, they would all be taken care of, or whatever, you know, eliminated.</span> <span id="s436">And she told me this.</span> <span id="s437">She was in despair.</span> <span id="s438">She was really in despair, because we loved all these teachers, you see.</span> <span id="s439">They were very important to us, I mean they were our lives.</span> <span id="s440">They were very important people in Vienna, but it was not because of that we loved them.</span> <span id="s441">They were -- even those -- I mean there was one who was actu -- actually really disliked by everybody except me.</span> <span id="s442">It’s really true, I was the only person who liked him.</span> <span id="s443">He was the director of Reinhardt’s theater, his name was Anslotter, and he was a fine novelist.</span> <span id="s444">He wrote really wonderful novels, which I had read all his novels, so I liked him already for that.</span> <span id="s445">And then for some or other reason he liked me, I don’t know why, but he did, because I really was not a -- I was not a -- well, I mean there were very talented people at the -- you know f-for -- for acting at the -- at the school, and I was not one of the most talented ones.</span> <span id="s446">I was not without talent, but I was not -- you know, I would never have been a great actress.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: I would have been useful.</span> <span id="s449">But he liked me, and he put me into one of the other of his productions.</span> <span id="s450">Three productions he put me in.</span> <span id="s451">In one of them a lead.</span> <span id="s452">I think I was pretty bad, but never mind.</span> <span id="s453">Sa -- it was a -- is a play which you probably don’t know, it was -- it’s called in German, “Geshwista siblings,” by Gerta.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Yeah, I got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: And I was the sister, God.</span> <span id="s456">A very difficult play [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s457">Course I didn’t understand, I mean I was much too young for the seminar.</span> <span id="s458">Well, never mind.</span> <span id="s459">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Do you want a breather now?</span> <span id="s461">Do you want a little rest?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Do you want a little tea?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Absolute --</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Go straight … So, after spending part of the war in the U.S., you returned to Europe a few months before the end of the war, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Tell me --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: I returned with UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: You returned with UNRRA.</span> <span id="s470">Tell me what you did with them, and where you were, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Well, I returned for the purpose of serving in displaced person’s camps.</span> <span id="s472">They needed people with languages, and of course they needed to -- they were very keen to have somebody who already had experience with children -- with children such as the children I had taken care of in France.</span> <span id="s473">And so I -- I was sent -- I was engaged as a -- as an assistant, because I was young, an assistant child welfare officer.</span> <span id="s474">I then became a -- you know, I was promoted, but I went there in a rather junior position, and I’m trying to think where my first assignment was.</span> <span id="s475">Yes, my first assignment -- well, I was first, as a matter of fact, my very first assignment was in Dachau, which was quite a shock because I’d -- I didn’t realize that that would be my first assignment.</span> <span id="s476">We were all -- we all went first to a t -- a -- a city called Karlsruhe, which was the -- the western allied headquarters for UNRRA.</span> <span id="s477">And a huge, huge sort of -- oh, it was this -- you know, former I don’t know what it was, but hundreds of barracks and things, and -- and that’s where we all stayed for awhile, had various lessons in this and that, and orientation, and then were assigned from there.</span> <span id="s478">And to my great surprise, I was called in and I was told that I was going to Dachau.</span> <span id="s479">And I said, “But there are no children in Dachau.”</span> <span id="s480">And the -- the woman who was talking to me, she said, “I’m afraid you’re going to have a rather shocking surprise.”</span> <span id="s481">Which I did.</span> <span id="s482">I really did have a shocking surprise, because there were a lot of children.</span> <span id="s483">Of course, Dachau was not -- you know, Dachau is much misunderstood in the -- in the literature, and by historians.</span> <span id="s484">Dachau, as you probably know, was the fi -- I shouldn’t be addressing you, but anyway, Dachau was the first concentration camp the Nazis opened, and it was purely a political camp.</span> <span id="s485">It was for -- it was intended for German political prisoners, and some cr -- and some criminal prisoners, who usually became, in fact, the kapos.</span> <span id="s486">It was not intended for Jews at all.</span> <span id="s487">And later it was represented as an extermination camp, which it never was.</span> <span id="s488">I have just read a -- a completely new book, which in fact has not yet been published, but is about to be published in three weeks in America, and it still has this presentation of it, which is really a great shame.</span> <span id="s489">This is particularly in America that they misrepresented.</span> <span id="s490">It is as if it’s a need, always to associate, you know, the Nazis with the crime against the Jews.</span> <span id="s491">Now, of course, all of us who write, up to a point, have to do this, because it was the worst thing they did, and you cannot not do it.</span> <span id="s492">But if you do that exclusively, then you are misrepresenting history.</span> <span id="s493">And you’re misrepresenting what Hitler was, what his plan was, what the whole thing was, and why the danger was so enormous, you know, for the whole of Europe, or the world.</span> <span id="s494">I mean, the death of the Jews was the worst thing, of course, and the factory killings, and -- but it was -- basically it was a part of a huge geopolitical program which really the -- most of the world doesn’t know because it has so focused on that one part of it.</span> <span id="s495">And it’s understandable, I mean, emotion is understandable, but historically it’s wrong.</span> <span id="s496">Anyway, so when I came to Dachau, there was -- there were all these kids.</span> <span id="s497">And there were two groups of kids, which is also extremely interesting.</span> <span id="s498">There were the child -- there were no Jewish children, virtually no Jewish children.</span> <span id="s499">Maybe one or two somewhere, but this was not -- you know, the Jewish children -- no, there were more than one or two, there were -- there were a few, but it was -- there -- that was the easiest.</span> <span id="s500">They brought in -- UNRRA had a -- had a special issue, like a special division for taking care of -- of Jews who survived the Nazis, and they very sensibly assigned to this, or made responsible for this division, Jewish UNRRA officials.</span> <span id="s501">I mean, it was the right thing to do, because they understood better, and they can deal with it better, and they could -- and they would be accepted much better by these victims.</span> <span id="s502">And so this is what happened.</span> <span id="s503">So in Dachau too, within da -- I mean, I came there very soon after it was -- after the Americans arrived.</span> <span id="s504">I mean, really within days.</span> <span id="s505">And within -- again within days, some of UNRRA officers arrived, who took away the Jewish children.</span> <span id="s506">That was -- you know, that was wonderfully organized.</span> <span id="s507">So I was left with another -- with another UNRRA.</span> <span id="s508">I think she was -- I think she was a higher rank than I.</span> <span id="s509">But anyway, we were friends, though, and oh became -- had become friends.</span> <span id="s510">And we put in -- were in charge of these children.</span> <span id="s511">And you have -- these were all on the one hand, children whose parents had been brought into -- into Germany as forced laborers.</span> <span id="s512">So they were mostly Polish and Russian children.</span> <span id="s513">They spoke no German, they spoke Polish and Russian, and a few words of German here and there.</span> <span id="s514">Some Czech children, but mostly, as I say, it was eastern European children, who had either been brought in by themselves, or they had been brought in after their parents had been taken in with them.</span> <span id="s515">Because in quite many -- in quite a few cases, the Nazis brought in people from eastern Europe to work in Germany, letting them take their smaller children.</span> <span id="s516">In quite a few cases, not -- not -- not -- not -- it was not a rarity.</span> <span id="s517">So we were landed with quite a few quite young children, who couldn’t speak [indecipherable] the girl who was -- sorry, the girl who was with me was of Polish descent, an American of Polish descent.</span> <span id="s518">She spoke Polish, which was a great help.</span> <span id="s519">Anyway, so that was one group, and the other group were German children.</span> <span id="s520">And they were the children of the 20th of July German officers, who had been in the assassination plan against Hitler.</span> <span id="s521">This was an extraordinary thing, because here you had these German children, who had gone to elite schools, you know, who were very, very German children.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: They were all absolutely beautiful, almost -- almost all of them.</span> <span id="s524">And they were living with children who they had been taught to despise, from countries they had been taught to hate.</span> <span id="s525">And they were really very dependent on these children, because you know, where the children were older, they were put in charge of the groups, I mean, they had group leaders and so on.</span> <span id="s526">And they had no German group leaders.</span> <span id="s527">Of course not.</span> <span id="s528">Can you imagine the Americans allowing German group leaders?</span> <span id="s529">No sir, not even amongst children.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning of Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gitta Sereny, conducted by Vera Frankel on February 28th, 2004, in London.</span> <span id="s532">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: So in fact it became very soon one of my great problems because, I mean, I was only there for two and a half weeks, but I was told from the beginning that I had no responsibility for the German children.</span> <span id="s534">Well this, of course, was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s535">I mean, to me it was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s536">You couldn’t -- I mean, this was a terrible place, because while it had been intended for -- as I told wa -- told you before, what -- what -- what it was intended for by the Germans originally, but over the last -- over the last six months of the war, as the war turned against the Germans, they walked people from the eastern camps, including Auschwitz and so on, they walked them all the way down to -- to -- to southern Germany.</span> <span id="s537">And this camp, Dachau, which was meant for -- I cannot remember really how many, but certainly not more than five to eight thousand, and when I came there, there were 30,000.</span> <span id="s538">So I mean, it was just absolutely appalling, and impossible for the inmates, you know, to keep it clean.</span> <span id="s539">I mean, you ca -- if you -- i -- i -- one has to imagine, for instance, the hygienic possibilities, which really were perfectly all right, I’m sure, when they started this thing.</span> <span id="s540">Cause they were very hot on hygien -- hygienic matters, the Germans, and -- and you know the -- one could see -- I could see ho -- what there was originally.</span> <span id="s541">I mean, there were enough loos, certainly, for 5,000 prisoners, and certainly enough ablution, as they called it.</span> <span id="s542">It was just sort of -- oh, well it was taps, with water.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: But you know, with the -- lots of them.</span> <span id="s545">And certainly enough for five thousand people to wash, but not 30,000.</span> <span id="s546">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s547">And it was impossible to keep the loos ti -- clean.</span> <span id="s548">It was absolutely impossible, particularly as most of them had diarrhea, and all kinds of nasty things.</span> <span id="s549">So it was a terrible place when we got there, really terrible.</span> <span id="s550">And there wasn’t very much we could do except what really our job was, which was to get the children out.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Our job, our -- this was our -- we were commissioned to do this, to get the children out, into UNRRA installations, which were being -- were just being opened.</span> <span id="s553">I mean, it was completely new, you see.</span> <span id="s554">But w-w-we did, we -- we got, in these two and a half weeks, which were all we were allowed, we -- we did get, probably about a thousand children out.</span> <span id="s555">And we couldn’t get the German children out.</span> <span id="s556">We were told this was the business of the German Red Cross, and it was -- well, I had terrible fights with the Americans about this, because it was the German Red Cross, but they wouldn’t allow the German Red Cross into Dachau.</span> <span id="s557">This was the sort of thing that happened there, and so it was a -- you know, it was a -- a -- a total impossibility, the little German children could not be taken care of.</span> <span id="s558">So of course we took care of them.</span> <span id="s559">I mean, of course we did, against -- you know, against -- but we couldn’t get them out.</span> <span id="s560">That was impossible.</span> <span id="s561">So when we left, having transported, or having arranged for transport for these about thousand children, w-we saw behind us these German children.</span> <span id="s562">There weren’t that many, I mean, there were probably about a hundred.</span> <span id="s563">A hundred is a hundred, you know.</span> <span id="s564">And there was no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: The children you got out, where were they destined to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Well their -- they were -- that was -- I mean, we did organize that, of course.</span> <span id="s567">I mean, by that time they had -- there had been emergency -- the Americans were very good about that, they helped UNRRA to set up emergency camps, and there were four, I think, by that time, four children’s camps which had been set up with American troops partly in charge, and partly UNRRA officials who -- for whom this was a completely new job.</span> <span id="s568">I mean, all of them, but -- have come from London, or -- or Washington, as I did, totally inexperienced in all this, most of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: How shocking was it for you to see what awaited you there?</span> <span id="s570">Wh -- I mean, what did -- what -- what do you imagine when [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: The UNRRA -- once we got into the UNRRA camps, you know, it was -- I mean, I got in my -- my first camp was in -- in -- in a place called Vilshofen, which is a little village.</span> <span id="s572">I was trying to think a -- near -- well, I can’t -- nobody would know it anyway.</span> <span id="s573">But it was not far from the Austrian border at Passau.</span> <span id="s574">And -- and a very pretty village.</span> <span id="s575">And we -- it was rather terrible what we did, but we had to do it, of course.</span> <span id="s576">We had to requisition housing to create this camp.</span> <span id="s577">And we empt -- they had -- there were four or five, sort of what we would call here in England council housing, but very pretty council housing, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: So kind of subsidized housing --</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Or subsidized housing, but -- but the Germans did this sort of thing -- the Nazis did this sort of thing very, very well.</span> <span id="s580">I mean, they were all rather pretty flats, with all the conveniences you can possibly think of.</span> <span id="s581">And we threw out about 4,000 people, and took their flats.</span> <span id="s582">And of course they loathed us, as you can imagine.</span> <span id="s583">But that is where -- well of cour -- I ha -- didn’t have the thousand children, you know, I had about a hundred of these thousand children.</span> <span id="s584">And so I -- I was in charge of these hundred kids.</span> <span id="s585">No, this was not a shock, you know.</span> <span id="s586">I very quickly found Polish DPs, Polish false laborers, and -- who came because they heard the camp was there, and w -- had been established -- or was being established.</span> <span id="s587">They were extraordinarily good.</span> <span id="s588">I mean, they were -- you know, there were also some former officers, I mean.</span> <span id="s589">It was very quickly -- I felt th -- as I remember it, it was quite extraordinary, how within one week we had set up a whole hierarchy of -- of helpers who could speak, of course, to the children, to start out with.</span> <span id="s590">Who were teachers, had been teachers in their lives.</span> <span id="s591">Had -- there were two doctors, you know, we had all -- we had -- we had several who had been professional officers.</span> <span id="s592">In fact one of them became the head of the -- of the DP camp, in the end.</span> <span id="s593">I mean, the -- the DP head -- there was always a DP hierarchy.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: You established that, and you were above it, but I mean, basically you weren’t.</span> <span id="s596">I mean, they did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: You just were there to -- to help them with any, really, bureaucratic problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I also did do some -- you know, some welfare work, because I had -- I’d -- I’d trained to do this, you know, and -- and of course I loved doing it, particularly with the children, I mean children -- there were problems with the children, as you can imagine, I mean they were -- they were -- they were alone, they -- they didn’t know where their parents were, they -- I mean, they were homesick, they were th -- million things.</span> <span id="s601">But no, I was not shocked, it was -- it was a -- this is really what I meant in -- I wrote in one of my books that -- that certainly what happened in UNRRA, and what I saw and learned there, was the most valuable experience of my life.</span> <span id="s602">I think it di -- it -- it -- I think it orientated, if you like, everything that I have done since.</span> <span id="s603">I mean that -- all my thinking, and -- so it’s -- it’s extraordinary what you learn when you are -- you know, when you are close for two years to -- to people with appalling problems.</span> <span id="s604">Then you -- you -- well, above all, of course, you realize that whatever your private little problems are, they’re nothing.</span> <span id="s605">They’re nothing.</span> <span id="s606">You are extraordinarily lucky.</span> <span id="s607">You know, you have -- y-you have -- I, in fact, had -- had no roots, because I had no home really.</span> <span id="s608">But I never minded, because I always saw myself as a European.</span> <span id="s609">So it -- it meant -- made absolutely no difference, I -- I didn’t -- I wasn’t -- I -- I didn’t miss anywhere.</span> <span id="s610">I di-didn’t miss Vienna, though I loved it, but I didn’t miss it.</span> <span id="s611">If -- if I missed anything, probably, aside from my adoration for France, I missed England most, where I had three very happy years in school.</span> <span id="s612">You know, I really loved it.</span> <span id="s613">And -- and really I was extremely happy when I -- when I met my husband and he -- years later in France, and he was a “Vogue” photographer, and -- and he was sent to London -- we were sent to London, and he fell in love with London, and that was a very happy thing for me, because there we were, two of us, in love with England.</span> <span id="s614">So that was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Now, unless I’m mistaken, you’ve said your most difficult UNRRA posting was to Regensburg, in -- in ’56?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s617">Regensburg was very difficult because it was a huge camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: 20,000?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: 20,000 Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s620">And you really have to be with 20,000 Ukrainians to understand what that is.</span> <span id="s621">I mean, it’s -- it -- they are -- they are the most stubborn people, and I don’t want to call -- that’s always stupid, I want to -- don’t want to generalize and say they were self-serving, but certainly their -- the he -- the people who headed that, completely different from my Poles in Vilshofen, and the next place where I was, I also had a Polish camp.</span> <span id="s622">Th -- wh -- who -- who were totally unself-serving.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Now, the Ukrainians were th -- j-ju-just -- and they -- they didn’t -- the -- the heads of -- of that 20,000, you know, group, they did not care who knew it, they were the heads of it, and never mind the foot soldiers.</span> <span id="s625">So it -- it -- it -- it really was a -- a difficult thing, and to think that these people came -- you know, came out of a Communist -- basically out of a Communist, if you like, childhood and past.</span> <span id="s626">Maybe it was the reaction to it, because it seemed to me that they were more fascist, but -- than -- than -- than most Nazis I had known, and I knew a hell of a lot of Nazis, you know?</span> <span id="s627">They were also violently anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s628">I mean, they were much more anti-Semitic than any Nazis I had ever met.</span> <span id="s629">And this is something that in UNRRA was a -- was a -- a -- a real problem, because we -- you know, we -- we didn’t have actually -- I mean, I didn’t take care of -- I told you that’s a -- I already said this, of course, the -- the Jewish DP’s were taken care of separately by UNRRA, and that was the right thing to do, because they were able to care for them properly.</span> <span id="s630">But there were, amongst us staff, of course there were Jews.</span> <span id="s631">We were totally mixed.</span> <span id="s632">I mean, we came from -- I don’t know, there were 12 countries represented in UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: And the teams were totally mixed, and nobody knew who was what religion.</span> <span id="s635">But it came out, you see, when there was this terrible anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Because somehow they knew who amongst the UNRRA staff was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: And so what would happen, what would that provoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Oh, they would call them names in -- in -- in Ukrainian, and things, which then we were told by our interpreters what they had said.</span> <span id="s640">And all of -- all of -- all of the staff were told, so of course, that created a very difficult situation, because you see, none of us really could be in any way, anything but neutral.</span> <span id="s641">We had to be neutral toward all of them.</span> <span id="s642">And you really couldn’t expect people who heard themselves called these names, like you know, Jewish pigs and all that sort of stuff, you couldn’t really expect them to behave neutrally toward the people who -- who -- who behaved like this, DPs who behaved like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Extraordinary in this time but -- and this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Extraordinary.</span> <span id="s645">Absolutely extraordinary.</span> <span id="s646">So th -- it was -- it -- but it was not just this that made it difficult, I mean there were -- there were huge difficulties, because of course the one thing these people who all -- who had all decided to stay in Germany, not to go back to the Ukraine, and the one thing they were afraid of were the Soviet liaison officers.</span> <span id="s647">[phone ringing] That’s yours, not mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: That’s ma --</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Well, so this was a -- this was very -- there were very, very many, you know, conflicts in that camp.</span> <span id="s650">And solving the conflicts, and remaining neutral, and yet being in an atmosphere which was profoundly political was really very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s651">And it was not only, of course, the -- the DPs who -- who were difficult, but as I already indicated, the -- the -- the UNRRA team was very divided, you know, and we had a -- we had in -- in -- in that place, we had an American director, whose name I will not mention, who knew absolutely nothing -- like many Americans, I’m sorry to say, at the time -- nothing about the problems of eastern Europeans.</span> <span id="s652">And you know, to be in that position, and not to know anything about eastern Europe, that was impossible.</span> <span id="s653">It was really impossible, you -- you -- you did a lot of harm then.</span> <span id="s654">And we really would have needed, and certainly didn’t get while I was there, a director who -- you know, who was -- we had an Australian who was the deputy director, and he was excellent.</span> <span id="s655">He was a historian, I mean he had a degree in history and was deeply interested in history.</span> <span id="s656">And he was splendid.</span> <span id="s657">Without him, I think -- I don’t know, I -- I think we would have had tragedies.</span> <span id="s658">And with tragedies I meant -- I mean more suicides.</span> <span id="s659">We had suicides, but we would have more suicides, we would have had more violence; we had violence.</span> <span id="s660">So you know, we had all the things that we were there to prevent.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: And lurking among those 20,000 were probably some pretty unsavory characters.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Oh, very unsavory characters, I mean, I wrote about this, I mean, somewhere.</span> <span id="s663">I don’t know whether I wrote about it in any of the books, but -- but I certainly wrote about it for the times.</span> <span id="s664">I mean, we -- I mean we had former -- former concentration camp guards in there, which -- who -- who -- in -- in a few cases were in fact identified by former prisoners.</span> <span id="s665">But it was very frightening, I mean some of them were really frightening people.</span> <span id="s666">I remember one person who was actually on the war crime list, and -- and I -- I found him.</span> <span id="s667">I -- I found this man.</span> <span id="s668">He was a Czech, oddly enough, and was hiding as a Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s669">Spoke some Polish, and was very bright, and had done the most awful things.</span> <span id="s670">I mean really awful things.</span> <span id="s671">And as I say, I was able to identify him, and the Americans, you know, sent a team to arrest him, and that was a very frightening evening, I tell you.</span> <span id="s672">Because I was absolutely certain, I had no way of -- of proving this before, but I was absolutely certain that he was armed, which afterwards was found true, his -- his barrack -- in fact, the whole barrack was under his thumb, and they were armed to the teeth.</span> <span id="s673">And of course, nobody was allowed to be armed in any UNRRA camp, you know.</span> <span id="s674">And we had -- we had some, but it’s only the American army who were allowed to search barracks.</span> <span id="s675">We were not -- nor did we want to, because it would have destroyed our -- our relationship with them, you know?</span> <span id="s676">But we had never searched this barrack, and I was absolutely certain they were armed.</span> <span id="s677">And it turned out -- I mean, it was -- it was really scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Had they brought these arms with them, or smuggled them in, or how did they go --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: God knows, God knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: You don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Never found out.</span> <span id="s682">All these -- the people in that barrack were all taken out of this particular team area, and were -- that was very wise, and they were sent to camps in different parts of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Talk to me now about the stolen children, and about the story of Johann and Marie in -- in particular, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yes, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: I don’t know, in any way that you’d like.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Well the stolen children is again, you know, it’s a -- it was a -- a very complicated thing which -- which is true, I mean, I was certainly one of the people who found out about this, it was a -- because -- I mean, probably because I -- I spoke, of course, fluent German, which very few of the UNRRA people did.</span> <span id="s687">Most of the UNRRA people came, as I said, from America, or -- or some -- or from England.</span> <span id="s688">And then there were, of course, from the 12 nations, but -- but really I had -- I only knew one other person who spoke German, fluent German.</span> <span id="s689">So I did find out about this problem.</span> <span id="s690">I had no idea how wide it was.</span> <span id="s691">I mean, that only came out when the American army people -- I mean the Intelligence people really went into it and they -- they -- well, they investigated this pretty thoroughly, and so did the British.</span> <span id="s692">And it was found that, I mean, the -- these children, you know, were all over Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: E-Explain for people who might not know what the stolen children are, who they were, and how many --</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Well, the stolen children, n -- ne -- of course this is very important because it’s -- it’s -- it’s part of what I was saying before, you know, about the problem that people see the Nazis, they still see the Nazis, particularly in America, as purely a Jewish problem.</span> <span id="s695">And of course, the stolen children are a very, very important proof that it was not that.</span> <span id="s696">The stolen children were a part of Hitler’s racial plan.</span> <span id="s697">And it was a racial, it was purely racial.</span> <span id="s698">These children all came, almost all -- there were some Greek children, but most of them, the vast majority, they were supposed to have been in -- I can’t -- I can’t swear to this, a -- we were given this figure, and it may be right, it may not be right, but there was supposed to be 250,000 of them.</span> <span id="s699">And most of them, by far, far -- and the -- th -- this was -- of course, the -- the figure, which was confirmed by the Poles, because most of them came from Poland and the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s700">The Nazis had ordered that a certain number, and I don’t know whether they put this number, I have no idea, but that their officials, who were specially assigned for this program, because this was a huge project, were to bring into Germany, children as of age one, who were blonde and blue eyed.</span> <span id="s701">They only wanted blonde and blue eyed children, which -- which of course turned out to be a total nonsense because almost all children are blonde and blue eyed when they’re born, and remain this for, you know, quite a long time, into -- may well be two years.</span> <span id="s702">I mean, I had one little thing, a little girl, who I finally got, you know.</span> <span id="s703">And who had been -- who I found -- and who had been stolen, and who was apparently blonde and blue eyed.</span> <span id="s704">Her foster parents, as I call them, I mean they ri -- she s -- she thought they were her parents, and she adored them, her German parents.</span> <span id="s705">And they told me oh, she was the most beautiful blonde, blue eyed baby.</span> <span id="s706">And do you know she was almost black haired?</span> <span id="s707">And -- and her eyes were brown.</span> <span id="s708">It was absolutely extraordinary, she was no -- and they had -- you know, they didn’t see this.</span> <span id="s709">When this woman, she was in Wirtsburg -- I’m going to start, this all comes back to me.</span> <span id="s710">This is not this Johann and -- and -- as I called them, yo -- mem -- Johann and Maria.</span> <span id="s711">These are just names I invented, you know, but this woman, when I -- when I saw this little girl, you know, who was adorable, by the way.</span> <span id="s712">But -- she was four, not three, she was four.</span> <span id="s713">And here’s this dark haired, brown eyed child, who I wasn’t at all sure wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s714">And this woman in Wirtsburg, this mum, who adored this child, went on and on about this lovely blue eyed, blonde child.</span> <span id="s715">I finally said that frau whatever her name was, “She’s absolutely adorable, and you’ve done a wonderful job with her, but she is very dark haired and brown eyed.”</span> <span id="s716">[indecipherable], she said.</span> <span id="s717">And she -- and she looked, and st -- and really she gave me the impression -- I may be talking nonsense -- but she gave me the impression as if she had never noticed it.</span> <span id="s718">To her, this was the blonde, blue eyed baby who had been given to her.</span> <span id="s719">Now these children who were given only -- let me just say this, they were only given to members of the Nazi party of good s -- in good standing, who wanted children, who either couldn’t have children, or whose children had died, or -- or whatever.</span> <span id="s720">There was always a good reason.</span> <span id="s721">And who were known to be, in all probability would be good parents.</span> <span id="s722">They were very, very careful about this.</span> <span id="s723">And I did not -- I met a lot of the parents, and of course I met a lot of the children.</span> <span id="s724">I did not meet one single child or one German parent where they didn’t love each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: But of course the Germans were less careful, the Nazis were less careful about how they actually got these children.</span> <span id="s726">They kidnapped them from this --</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Oh no, they -- they were totally uncareful.</span> <span id="s728">I mean, they kidnapped them off the streets, they went int -- they went into nurseries, they went into -- into schools.</span> <span id="s729">I mean, it was absolutely appalling how they did it.</span> <span id="s730">And the parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Did the program have a name?</span> <span id="s732">I mean, th --</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: In -- the German name, there was a name, but I’ve forgotten it now.</span> <span id="s734">I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: I’ve forgotten that it -- it did have a name, but I’ve forgotten it.</span> <span id="s737">I can look it up, but that’s too late for you.</span> <span id="s738">No, I’ve forgotten what the German name was.</span> <span id="s739">But they -- but I certainly know how they did it, and of course I -- I -- I managed to see -- I -- I took one train back, of -- of stolen children.</span> <span id="s740">We -- of course we found quite a few of them, and this one train I took back, it was an extraordinary experience, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Back to Poland, yes, and these were desperate children, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: How old were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Well, there were small ones.</span> <span id="s745">I mean, this is -- the four year old was part of it, of this particular group.</span> <span id="s746">But I mean, they were up to, you know, 10.</span> <span id="s747">They tried to take them under 10, below 10.</span> <span id="s748">But they did have some children who were school children.</span> <span id="s749">I mean eight -- seven, eight, nine.</span> <span id="s750">And -- and this was particularly difficult for them, too, because the smaller ones, of course, you know, they didn’t know really, what had happened.</span> <span id="s751">If they were very small, I mean babies, like my little -- this little four year old, she didn’t -- she had absolutely no idea that there was a Polish parent.</span> <span id="s752">Of course not.</span> <span id="s753">And she adored her -- of course she adored her -- her Wirtsburg parents.</span> <span id="s754">But the older children -- I mean, we had -- we already, when we had them in our camp, because we would -- we had them in conditioning camps, you know, we opened special stolen children conditioning centers.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Wh -- kind of a staging post that --</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Staging post, conditioning centers we called them to ourselves, where the children received that kind of care that -- you know, that was needed at the time.</span> <span id="s757">I mean, also they received lessons in Polish or Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s758">And so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s759">And -- and -- and they stayed for awhile, I mean they stayed two, three months in these camps, and were very unhappy, very unhappy.</span> <span id="s760">They’ve been taken away from people they loved, even though they knew that there were -- the older ones I’m now speaking of -- they knew that there were parents elsewhere who were their real parents.</span> <span id="s761">But you see they -- they had been there for three or four years in Germany, they had had no bad experiences.</span> <span id="s762">They had only been loved.</span> <span id="s763">And if they had not been, because some of them could not be kept in families, and they were sent to Hitler youth, well really centers.</span> <span id="s764">But there again, you see, I mean I’ve -- you know, I’ve been to these Hitler youth centers, and I -- I know it’s not popular, particularly in America for one to say this, but you know, they were very well run.</span> <span id="s765">And the young people who were in charge of them were good people.</span> <span id="s766">They were not bad people.</span> <span id="s767">And they -- when they got these young, foreign kids, they were nice to them.</span> <span id="s768">There was a lot of tenderness.</span> <span id="s769">I mean, I went to one camp where they were in fact I -- I -- I fo -- I found, you know, one -- one little eight year old boy who had been there for two years.</span> <span id="s770">And -- and I stayed in a -- in an UNRRA center, in an untr -- UNRRA camp -- not camp, but in an UNRRA team in the same town.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: And -- because I wanted this little boy to get to know me slowly, because I was going to take him away.</span> <span id="s773">And he had been taken away now so many times, you know.</span> <span id="s774">So I didn’t want to do this suddenly.</span> <span id="s775">So I thought I’d give him four days, which isn’t long.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: But you know, it’s as long as one could -- could afford really, in a way.</span> <span id="s778">And so I would go and spend most of the day there, so that he would see me all the time.</span> <span id="s779">And I would be there in the evening, and I saw these Hitler youth leaders, as they were called, go around the beds, and kiss the children good night, and tuck them in, and you know, and -- and -- and smooth their hair, and -- oh, and they also asked, did you clean your teeth and all the rest.</span> <span id="s780">[indecipherable] like all parents do.</span> <span id="s781">But I never heard any cross word.</span> <span id="s782">Of course, boys of that age, I mean, th-they also learned to march.</span> <span id="s783">Well of course they did, but of course they adored that, they liked it.</span> <span id="s784">Then they had open fires you know, in the evening, and they sang songs, and these little Polish boys, well they would -- when they came, I was told, they would -- they would -- they didn’t speak any German, and so they would slowly be taught by the other children, who were absolutely charming to them.</span> <span id="s785">It was -- it was strange, because I knew that I was -- I was seeing something that one would t -- y -- di -- you know, that one should really, you know, hate, because it was -- it was [indecipherable] being hateful.</span> <span id="s786">And not at all, they were all terribly nice.</span> <span id="s787">You know, life was more complex then.</span> <span id="s788">Primo Levi wrote in one of his books that --</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: May we turn this -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: This is tape number two, side B, of an interview with Gitta Sereny.</span> <span id="s791">Sorry, you were saying Primo Levi.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes, but I can’t -- I can’t remember unfortunately, the exact quote, so I’m -- I’m not saying that I’m quoting him verbatim, but he said something about that nothing in these situations was black and white, it was all gray.</span> <span id="s793">And that is, you know, the fantastic lesson that those of us who really worked with this -- with this -- these DPs, and with these children and -- and with the Germans who -- who -- who had these children, and all the rest of it, you know -- and then with the Polish parents -- oh God almighty, the Polish parents, who of course, you know, they -- I was coming to that, but I’m -- it was -- it was all gray.</span> <span id="s794">There was no -- there was nobody who was terrible, or who was -- who was wonderful.</span> <span id="s795">It wasn’t really like that.</span> <span id="s796">They were just ordinary, really, in a way.</span> <span id="s797">But everybody -- that’s the extraordinary thing, everybody was capable of love for children.</span> <span id="s798">It was certainly true of all the parents I met, and I certainly met -- I would have thought, at least a hundred couples who had such children.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: You know, I really don’t envy you this job.</span> <span id="s800">Did you actually have to remove children from one set of --</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: -- parents and deliver them to --</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Yeah, we did, yeah, terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s804">But thank God I didn’t have to do it often.</span> <span id="s805">I mean thank God by that time I was promoted and you know, this was left to -- oh, this -- I was able to you know, peop -- other people could do this, so I didn’t have to do this.</span> <span id="s806">It was a terrible thing, terrible.</span> <span id="s807">It was a terr -- and -- and you know, one didn’t know what was right.</span> <span id="s808">One really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s809">I mean, I cannot tell you how many cases there were where I -- I really wondered whether I was doing the right thing.</span> <span id="s810">Should they not be staying with these -- particularly the little ones, should they not be staying with these parents they adored, who adored them?</span> <span id="s811">They were children who had never learned any language except German.</span> <span id="s812">They knew nothing about Poland or the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s813">And what was going to meet them when they went back?</span> <span id="s814">And that’s what I found out of course, when I took that one train back.</span> <span id="s815">It was -- you know, it was a -- a traumatic experience, because the -- the -- the -- the children were isolated from these parents, who were expecting them with open -- oops, sorry --</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: -- with open arms, and with open emotions and with -- you know, it was all so emotional.</span> <span id="s818">And -- and the children could not give.</span> <span id="s819">They couldn’t give what these parents wanted.</span> <span id="s820">And when these parents took them in their arms, the children shied away from them.</span> <span id="s821">It was absolutely terrible.</span> <span id="s822">And there was one -- I mean, there was -- I -- I made one trip afterwards, and went back to three of these couples.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: I was going to ask you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: I went back to three, I couldn’t do more.</span> <span id="s825">But I went back to three of the couples.</span> <span id="s826">In only one of them it had worked.</span> <span id="s827">And I was told that it hardly worked in any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: When you say worked, I mean, the children run away, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: The children -- no, the chil -- the children ran away, the children were traumatized, the children wer -- were doing terribly badly at school, the children were -- were -- were naughty, were -- were violent, were everything you -- every problem that we know that children have, they had.</span> <span id="s830">The children wanted back.</span> <span id="s831">I mean the two of the ones where I went, of the three, the children told me where they want back, they wanted to go back to Germany, they hated Poland, they hated every minute they had spent there.</span> <span id="s832">They couldn’t get on with anybody, the language is horrible, their language is German.</span> <span id="s833">They didn’t like the music, and you know, Polish music is beautiful.</span> <span id="s834">They didn’t like the music, they didn’t like anything.</span> <span id="s835">And I said, “You’re being totally,” -- these were older -- these two were older.</span> <span id="s836">I said, “You’re being totally negative, this is, you know, quite wrong, you’re not helping.”</span> <span id="s837">“We are too young to help.”</span> <span id="s838">Quite right, too.</span> <span id="s839">They were too young to help.</span> <span id="s840">It was asking too much of children, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: So what was -- what was the effect on you of having to, you know, witness these ghastly things, and do these pretty ghastly jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Well, you -- you say ghastly, but of course, you know, they weren’t ghastly at the time.</span> <span id="s843">I mean, the problems were terrible, but you know, we are -- we are -- if we are adults, you know, if we are adults, and I of course, became adult very early.</span> <span id="s844">And if you are -- in particular if you are -- were also a man, it’s -- I was just going to say particularly if you are a girl, but it’s not so.</span> <span id="s845">I mean, I -- we -- I had colleagues, particularly if I think of this Australian I have already mentioned, you know, who had exactly the same, if you like, gifts that I had, which was A, to be able to see both sides, which is very important, cause it’s the only way to be -- to maintain some kind of objectivity or neutrality, is to be able to see both sides of each question.</span> <span id="s846">But also who -- you a -- you know, who had the kind of need to give to children.</span> <span id="s847">This is one of the things that you really needed.</span> <span id="s848">You needed to be the kind of person -- I mean, if you were a child welfare officer in UNRRA, you needed to be the kind of person who needed to give to children.</span> <span id="s849">Of course, if I turn this on, it won’t come on.</span> <span id="s850">I have to turn it on over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Don’t worry, I’ll do it.</span> <span id="s852">Let me --</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: No, no, it has to be over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: I’ll go over there [tape break] … ask you about the German NS trials and what -- what it was like to be there, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Well, sure, I don’t know what to say about that.</span> <span id="s856">I mean, I went to so many of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Why did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Well I -- I really went because I was very interested, but also because I was working for the “Daily Telegraph Magazine” at the time, and they had a wonderful editor there, I wrote about him, John Anstey, and -- and he was very interested in this problem, and so he -- he backed me, you know, he backed me for all these things, and you -- you had to have somebody like that if you were going to go do -- you know, I mean I -- I went to these trials for six months.</span> <span id="s859">So of course he -- he paid all the expenses.</span> <span id="s860">I mean, you can imagine what that costs.</span> <span id="s861">Not to speak of my time, but he didn’t pay much for that, I’ve got to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: But you went backwards and forwards, or you stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Yeah -- no, no, I s -- I would stay for -- for weeks and come back, which was not very good for my family, I mean it was -- it’s terrible what one does to one’s family, really, you know.</span> <span id="s864">One thinks that this is all so important, but of course, as I found out later, I mean it certainly -- I -- I -- I -- it was not very good for my boy, who was, of course, in boarding school, but I mean, even so, it was not good for him.</span> <span id="s865">He didn’t see very much of me.</span> <span id="s866">Well, anyway -- but these trials were, of course, fascinating, and it was fascinating to write about them, you know.</span> <span id="s867">And I learned an awful lot.</span> <span id="s868">But what -- what was most important to me in the end was that -- that it was not through trials that one could find out what these people were about, because trials are limited in what they can find out, however good the prosecutor is, you know.</span> <span id="s869">And this -- it happened to be the one -- the one who was involved in most of these trials in Düsseldorf was a very, very good prosecutor called Alfred Spiess, who became a great friend of mine, at last he died.</span> <span id="s870">But he -- he was a -- a very bright man, and he tried in fact, to enlarge these questions, too, because he also wanted to know, you know?</span> <span id="s871">But he had to find out that it was simply not possible.</span> <span id="s872">I mean, the courtroom does not lend itself to this.</span> <span id="s873">So this is where I really got the idea.</span> <span id="s874">Wit -- no, it wasn’t where I got the idea, but certainly where the idea strengthened in my mind that -- that I wanted to find somebody I could talk to.</span> <span id="s875">One of these people who -- cause most of them, you see, just said they were not guilty, they -- you know, they -- they -- they -- they were acting under orders, which is true of course, they were acting under orders and they -- they couldn’t have done anything but what they did, which of course is not true.</span> <span id="s876">But that’s all they -- that’s all, really, one got out of most of them.</span> <span id="s877">And I was looking for one where there was -- there was some remnant of conscience.</span> <span id="s878">I can’t tell you how difficult that was.</span> <span id="s879">I mean, all the trials I saw, the one I found, finally found Stangl, was the only one And Spiess said the same thing.</span> <span id="s880">He may -- he -- you know, brought my attention to -- to Stangl, he really presented him to me.</span> <span id="s881">He -- he phoned me and said, “Look, I think I’ve now got the man here in front of me.</span> <span id="s882">You must come very quickly.”</span> <span id="s883">And so I took the next plane to Düsseldorf, and went to the trial, to the Stangl trial, which went on for 10 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Was this 1970?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: It was 1969, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: ’69.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s888">I’m not absolutely sure about that, but I think so.</span> <span id="s889">Anyway, it’s in my book.</span> <span id="s890">And you know, after one day of sitting there, I knew that -- that -- that Spiess had hit the nail on the head.</span> <span id="s891">This was a slightly different man.</span> <span id="s892">It was -- the degree was very small, how he was different, but there was just -- there was a sadness about Stangl, which I had not found in any of the others, and which Spiess had not found in any of the others.</span> <span id="s893">They were arrogant, they were hard.</span> <span id="s894">They were proud of what they had done.</span> <span id="s895">Stangl was not proud.</span> <span id="s896">And quite aside from that, he was sad.</span> <span id="s897">And I thought, if he was capable of being sad, unless we find out that it’s only about his situation, if he was capable of being sad about the whole thing, then there was that remnant of conscience, which of course I did find in him.</span> <span id="s898">Took me a long time.</span> <span id="s899">Took me a very long time to find it, but I did find it.</span> <span id="s900">And he was the right choice.</span> <span id="s901">I mean, I couldn’t have done this with -- with any of the others.</span> <span id="s902">I met several of the others before, and of course after I met him.</span> <span id="s903">And -- and tried to talk to them, too.</span> <span id="s904">And only one of I met, who -- but he was not -- he was just not as intelligent.</span> <span id="s905">I mean, Stangl was not very intelligent, but he was more intelligent.</span> <span id="s906">And in fact, if he hadn’t been more intelligent, he wouldn’t have been given the job he was given.</span> <span id="s907">I mean, he was a -- he had an enormous job.</span> <span id="s908">I mean, commandant of Treblinka and commandant of Sobibor, you could not have a bigger job in that branch of the SS or Gestapo.</span> <span id="s909">It was impossible to have a bigger job.</span> <span id="s910">So of course he had the qualifications.</span> <span id="s911">He was a brilliant organizer, which is what was mostly needed.</span> <span id="s912">And -- and he was a -- he was a man, in a way -- don’t misunderstand it, but he -- he was a man in a way, of quality, in that he had no -- no vices.</span> <span id="s913">He was not a drunkard, he didn’t play around with women.</span> <span id="s914">He didn’t, of course, didn’t gamble, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s915">And he was not a man given to violence.</span> <span id="s916">So there were four things, which no doubt the Nazi bigwigs who appointed him saw just as much as I did.</span> <span id="s917">I mean, they had him first -- his first assignment, his first -- I mean, he was a police officer, of course, an Austrian.</span> <span id="s918">He was from Wels in Austria.</span> <span id="s919">He was a provincial.</span> <span id="s920">And his first assignment as a police officer, was to become the police head of Schloss Hartheim, which was a euthanasia institute.</span> <span id="s921">Bad enough, God knows.</span> <span id="s922">And there -- and th-these euthanasia institutes, where they appointed 96 SS people to become either heads or, you know, or officials there.</span> <span id="s923">Always in higher positions, of course.</span> <span id="s924">Under them they would have Ukrainians and Latvians, and usually Baltics.</span> <span id="s925">They could, of course observe and -- and see these quote, qualities, unquote, which I have mentioned.</span> <span id="s926">Because already in the euthanasia institute, I mean, it was quite clear that he had these qualities.</span> <span id="s927">And so he was -- he was predestined to be promoted, there’s no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s928">And then he -- he -- he got these two jobs, first at -- in Sobibor, as a kind of preparation, which he opened, which he started, built.</span> <span id="s929">And then of course, the worst one of them all, Treblinka, I mean that was the worst place.</span> <span id="s930">Oh, I don’t know whether any of them were worse than any other.</span> <span id="s931">I mean, the -- that’s -- they -- they were places, you know, which only existed for killing, I mean, they were not for anything else.</span> <span id="s932">Which probably it’s -- it’s too extraordinary that -- that -- that 60 years later you have the same misapprehension, or miscomprehension of these places, which ha -- which existed then.</span> <span id="s933">I mean, even now, again, this book I’ve just finished reading, which is about to come out in America, I mean again, I mean these places are -- Dachau is conc -- is -- is described as an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s934">I mean, total nonsense, you know, it’s full of total nonsense.</span> <span id="s935">The -- the whole problem, which has been written about more than any other -- what, any other event in history, this extermination of the Jews, I mean it’s -- really, it’s -- it’s just incredible the number of books and -- and essays, and newspaper a -- films, what -- what have you, which have been done on this subject, and still people don’t know.</span> <span id="s936">Too extraordinary.</span> <span id="s937">Anyway, there were only -- there were only four of such camps, which were only there for exterminating people, that nobody spent a night there, nobody had a meal there.</span> <span id="s938">Nobody washed there.</span> <span id="s939">They came in, they were killed, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: There was nothing except --</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Well, there was a -- there were so-called work Jews, where they took out of every transport which arrived, of perhaps, you know, up to 10,000 people, they would take five, or whatever, who looked young and strong, possibly spoke a language or two.</span> <span id="s942">Possibly somebody liked the looks of them.</span> <span id="s943">Ho -- what do I know how I chose them?</span> <span id="s944">But they chose them, and -- and they were allowed to live for a while, working the camp.</span> <span id="s945">The camp had to be worked.</span> <span id="s946">The Germans didn’t work the camp, and the Baltics didn’t work the camp.</span> <span id="s947">It’s perfectly true that the work Jews worked the camp.</span> <span id="s948">And it allowed them to survive, maybe for a week, maybe for a month.</span> <span id="s949">Some of them just survived.</span> <span id="s950">And you know this was a question I asked -- have asked myself a million times since then -- not a million, but one says a million, but countless times -- what would I have done?</span> <span id="s951">And all these people who so readily judge such men and women, instead of judging they should ask themselves this question.</span> <span id="s952">I mean, how dear is life to us.</span> <span id="s953">And I tell you life is very dear to us, and I am not sure, I am not sure at all, and really I do have principles, but I’m not sure at all that I would not have done what they did.</span> <span id="s954">After all, as work Jews, they could help people.</span> <span id="s955">They could, and did, very often.</span> <span id="s956">They also could be absolutely terrible, and some of them were.</span> <span id="s957">Absolutely terrible.</span> <span id="s958">Worse than the Germans, certainly.</span> <span id="s959">But my God, what would you choose?</span> <span id="s960">What would you have chosen?</span> <span id="s961">Did you ever think about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Many times.</span> <span id="s963">Many times.</span> <span id="s964">I’m just very grateful I was never tested.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Yeah, so am I.</span> <span id="s966">So am I, because my God, you know, to answer that honestly is very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: But I think I would have accepted the offer, to stay alive.</span> <span id="s969">You know, some -- I mean, I’ve talked to -- to women, not many, but I’ve talked to women who -- who did it by -- by becoming -- you know, by becoming the mistress of -- of this or that -- either -- either [indecipherable] or German SS.</span> <span id="s970">Well, I don’t know whether I wouldn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: I’m not sure I wouldn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: It’s impossible to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: The thing is that death was so obvious.</span> <span id="s975">You see, it is -- I mean, they say now that these people didn’t know.</span> <span id="s976">Well, of course they didn’t know when they arrived, but my God, within minutes, within seconds they knew, because the work Jews told them at once.</span> <span id="s977">They had not even got off the trains and they knew.</span> <span id="s978">And if -- if -- if the work Jews saw somebody they liked, whose looks they liked, or who smiled at them even, I mean the smallest thing could do it.</span> <span id="s979">They would say don’t do that, don’t do that.</span> <span id="s980">Say you are that, say you are this, when you are asked.</span> <span id="s981">Behave like this or that.</span> <span id="s982">They would whisper to them, in whatever language, you know, communication -- they could communicate.</span> <span id="s983">And they saved lives that way, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: So y -- to take you back to Stangl, you’ve explained your motivation in seeking him out, can you remind us very swiftly how he escaped, and how he came to trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: How he escaped, oh God.</span> <span id="s986">Well, he escaped in Austria.</span> <span id="s987">Let me try and think, I’ve forgotten now.</span> <span id="s988">Oh, he escaped, how did he escape?</span> <span id="s989">I’ve forgotten how he escaped, I’d have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: Was it with the help of the Vatican [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: -- I’d have the -- well, no, no, he didn’t escape with the help of the aust -- I mean he -- he escaped with his own -- you know, by his own intelligence, but he -- he -- he esca -- he used the Vatican escape route.</span> <span id="s992">There was an Austrian -- an Austrian bishop, whose name I’ve now forgotten.</span> <span id="s993">You know, it’s impossible to -- to keep all these names in one’s mind.</span> <span id="s994">But anyway, whose name I have now forgotten, but this bishop was the link man for this so-called Vatican escape route, and had also the means -- I mean, was able to provide them with the means -- that is, Red Cross passports, and things like this, which they had to have because they had to cross borders, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: And they had to get to Rome.</span> <span id="s997">I mean, they have to get Rome if they were going to get anywhere.</span> <span id="s998">And this is certainly what happened in Stangl’s case.</span> <span id="s999">I mean, he was -- he was -- he went to this, he heard about this bishop, he went to him, he -- the bishop kept him there for a wh -- a few days, to let him rest and to -- and to prepare the papers.</span> <span id="s1000">And then he gave him the papers he needed, gave him some money.</span> <span id="s1001">And of course this is a terrible thing, an absolutely terrible thing, but there you were.</span> <span id="s1002">The Catholic church did many terrible things, they did many not terrible things.</span> <span id="s1003">It’s -- again, it’s a gray area.</span> <span id="s1004">Again, nothing is black and white.</span> <span id="s1005">You know, and they were wonderful people, they were nuns.</span> <span id="s1006">I mean, God almighty, what the nuns did in Austria and Germany is fantastic.</span> <span id="s1007">You know, the number of people they hid, children.</span> <span id="s1008">They hid Jewish children, but not you f -- for -- for a night or for a week, but for months, months.</span> <span id="s1009">And you -- you have to try and imagine what it’s like to live in a Nazi country, and to hide a number of Jewish grown-ups, Jewish children.</span> <span id="s1010">It -- it -- it -- I mean -- you know, death was always around the corner, I mean just around the corner.</span> <span id="s1011">And the Nazis had absolutely no reason to -- to -- to spare a nun.</span> <span id="s1012">They disliked the nuns as much as they dus -- disliked anybody.</span> <span id="s1013">They disliked the Catholics.</span> <span id="s1014">So, it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1015">So if -- if we say, you know, that like this bishop, he ju -- he was doing terrible things by saving people such as Stangl, yes he did, he was.</span> <span id="s1016">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s1017">But just at the same time, there were wonderful people who saved people.</span> <span id="s1018">And it is absolutely true that this bishop, of course, did not know what Stangl had done, because of course, he wasn’t told.</span> <span id="s1019">They were very careful not to tell him what these individuals had done.</span> <span id="s1020">Would he have helped him anyway?</span> <span id="s1021">I think he would have.</span> <span id="s1022">Because A, I think he was a Nazi, and B, he was not a good man.</span> <span id="s1023">I think he would have, but purely factually, he did not know who these people were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Stangl was finally tracked down where, in Brazil?</span> <span id="s1025">Was he brought back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: In Brazil, he was tracked down -- he was tracked down in fact -- well, Wiesenthal, Simon Wiesenthal said he tracked him down.</span> <span id="s1027">Stangl said this was not true.</span> <span id="s1028">But you know, are we going to believe Stangl rather than Simon Wiesenthal, it’s very difficult.</span> <span id="s1029">It’s a very complicated story how he was tracked down, and it -- and I think that actually Wiesenthal did have a hand in it.</span> <span id="s1030">I don’t think he actually discovered him, but he had a hand in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: What persuaded Stangl to sit down and talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: I tell you something, I think all -- all people want to talk.</span> <span id="s1033">Except me, I’m not very eager to talk.</span> <span id="s1034">But then, I really have nothing to hide, I don’t think.</span> <span id="s1035">But all these people who lived hidden lives, they all wanted to talk.</span> <span id="s1036">I think that basically, I mean, if you want to talk ab -- if you want to consider this from a human point of -- or a humane point of view, I think they were all very lonely.</span> <span id="s1037">You know, most of them were separated by prison and other, from their families, their wives, their children.</span> <span id="s1038">I mean, certainly in Stangl’s case this was so.</span> <span id="s1039">Saw themselves sentenced, if not to death, because the death penalty had been abolished, but certainly to life in prison.</span> <span id="s1040">You know, and they were young, I mean, they were not old men.</span> <span id="s1041">Stangl, I can’t remember how old he was, but he was certainly not more than what, 35 or 38, I mean he was -- he was young.</span> <span id="s1042">And the earliest he could have got out of prison -- this is -- he was sentenced to life imprisonment, was when he was 60.</span> <span id="s1043">Now just imagine a life like that.</span> <span id="s1044">Well, I mean, course criminals, you know, we know this, this happens to -- to many criminals.</span> <span id="s1045">But of course, he didn’t consider himself a criminal, not until after he talked to me that he began to see what the rest of us thought.</span> <span id="s1046">However, there were other reasons why he -- I think, why he -- at wa -- he talked -- he started to agree to talk to me because his appeal was going to come up, and he thought that I was going to help him.</span> <span id="s1047">Now, I -- I -- I -- I -- I’d disabused him of this idea, because I had told him immediately that I would not help, and that what I would write would do absolutely nothing toward helping his appeal.</span> <span id="s1048">But that if he talked to me, and if he talked to me fully, I would write everything he said, everything for, everything against, whatever he said, I would write it.</span> <span id="s1049">And by this time there was the other element, which was A, Stangl -- you have to understand this, Stangl was an Austrian, this why I immediately said he was a provincial Austrian.</span> <span id="s1050">And we talked to, in my kind of German, which is of course upper class German, we talked to by a young woman, which I was at the time -- I mean, a youngish woman.</span> <span id="s1051">A youngish woman, you know, a -- somebody who represented something.</span> <span id="s1052">A lady.</span> <span id="s1053">He’d never met a lady in his life.</span> <span id="s1054">And suddenly there was this lady who was willing to talk to him, and listen to him.</span> <span id="s1055">This was extraordinary for him.</span> <span id="s1056">It’s very hard to explain this to people who don’t know Europe.</span> <span id="s1057">You know, who don’t know what a provincial Austrian is, or Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1058">It’s very much the same.</span> <span id="s1059">And I think that this weighed as heavily finally, as anythi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: So it was a kind of an honor to him to be talking --</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: It was a kind of an honor, and the -- the director of the prison in Düsseldorf, whose name is Mies, and who is a really good man, very good wife, too.</span> <span id="s1062">I saw a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1063">And he said that -- he went to see Stangl quite often, quite often in the evening after he had talked to me.</span> <span id="s1064">And Stangl was in a state of -- this was such an experience for him, you know?</span> <span id="s1065">And he would start talking about, you know, the way I asked him questions and so on.</span> <span id="s1066">And he would tell him that -- that, you know, she asked me -- he would tell Mies that, well [inaudible] I was the countess, of course, yeah -- what can I do?</span> <span id="s1067">“You know,” he said, “the countess asks me such difficult questions.</span> <span id="s1068">They are really very, very difficult, but she asks them in such a way, you know, that I -- I feel I -- nots -- not that I can, I must answer.”</span> <span id="s1069">It’s wonderful, I mean it’s -- it’s really wonderful, but it’s -- it’s -- you know, I’ve said this to lots and lots of young journalists, who of course, I mean, would love to do this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1070">But honestly you have to -- you -- you really have to think whether you can confront people like this.</span> <span id="s1071">And whether you can be -- it’s very difficult -- whether you can remain -- not just pretend, that’s easy, but inside yourself, retain some kind of objectivity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gitta Sereny, conducted by Vera Frankel on February 28th, 2004, in London.</span> <span id="s1074">This is tape number three, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: I mean that -- that [tape pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: What made it possible for you to do that?</span> <span id="s1077">Where d -- what is it, do you think, that made it possible for you to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Well, I think it’s A, it’s because I’m not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1079">I don’t think this is possible for a Jewish girl, or a Jewish woman to do.</span> <span id="s1080">It’s not -- it’s not possible, it’s just too difficult.</span> <span id="s1081">It’s emotionally impossible, because this is the man who killed them, and you can’t, I mean you can’t.</span> <span id="s1082">If you -- if you carry the weight of your religion, or your -- you know, or your background, your roots, your parents, your grandparents, I mean how can you?</span> <span id="s1083">How can you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Nonetheless, how did you feel, knowing who he was, sitting down, looking at him for the first time, beginning to delve around in his psyche --</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Listen, he was just a man.</span> <span id="s1086">He was just a man.</span> <span id="s1087">He was -- he -- he became a bad man, but he was not bad man when he was born, you know?</span> <span id="s1088">He was a perfectly okay man when he was born.</span> <span id="s1089">He had a terrible childhood, which always counts.</span> <span id="s1090">It’s always very important.</span> <span id="s1091">A terrible childhood, and he somehow got through this childhood because he fell in love.</span> <span id="s1092">And he really adored his wife, who was almost as guilty as he in my eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Well, she could have stopped him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Oh, she had the power, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Of course she had the power.</span> <span id="s1097">She had the power, and you know what her power was, a -- her sex was the power.</span> <span id="s1098">They were two people who were sexually so attuned to each other, and so important to each other, that the relationship was three quarters sexual, and one quarter whatever else there is.</span> <span id="s1099">In most our relationships with our husbands, you know, it’s the other way -- it becomes to be the other way around, because you can’t maintain this sexual excitement, you know, for more than what, three years?</span> <span id="s1100">I mean, that’s already extraordinary if you maintain it for three years.</span> <span id="s1101">Afterwards, well, it’s -- sex is part of it, but it’s a tiny part of a re -- a relationship.</span> <span id="s1102">A relationship is -- is friendship, is love.</span> <span id="s1103">And their love was very sexual.</span> <span id="s1104">And had she been a better woman, a stronger woman, and not just a -- a devout Catholic, as the book says you must be a devout Catholic, that’s all she was.</span> <span id="s1105">She could have used that sex to get him out of it, because she should have known that even according to her own religion, which she so -- you know, so devoutly believed in, he was going to hell.</span> <span id="s1106">He was lost.</span> <span id="s1107">And she allowed him to be lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: It’s interesting, you seem at this stage to have more compassion for him than for her, in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Yes, because women have terrible power, you know, and if they don’t use this power the right way, I despise them.</span> <span id="s1110">I despise them.</span> <span id="s1111">I think -- and it isn’t, you know, it really isn’t that women don’t know that they have this power.</span> <span id="s1112">You don’t have to be an intelligent woman to know that you have power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: But you have to have some qualities that ar -- that are irresistible, and be aware that you have them.</span> <span id="s1114">I don’t think all women can be said to be aware of that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1115">I mean, doubtless this, you know, this woman clearly was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: I think that if you -- if -- if you have a very strong sexual relationship with a man, you already know that you have the power, you know?</span> <span id="s1117">Or, if you have love, and even if you don’t have that sexual relationship any more, you know what the love means to the man.</span> <span id="s1118">And what the withdrawal of such love would mean.</span> <span id="s1119">No, no, no, women are very powerful.</span> <span id="s1120">I’m not saying all women are equally powerful, but women on the whole, are very powerful.</span> <span id="s1121">And if they don’t use this power for the good, their own good, their husband’s good, ha -- their children’s good, then they are despicable.</span> <span id="s1122">Much more despicable than men, who are very often quite weak.</span> <span id="s1123">Stangl was certainly weak, I mean there’s no doubt about it, he was weak.</span> <span id="s1124">Which is one of the reasons, probably why he did what he did, cause it made him feel strong.</span> <span id="s1125">I mean, it was incredible to be -- can you imagine what it is like to be in the position where you are the -- the -- the -- the -- the god over life and death, not just of a few people, but of hundred thousands of people?</span> <span id="s1126">I mean, i-is it imaginable?</span> <span id="s1127">Q: But did you get any clue as he -- ho -- as to how he did this day to day?</span> <span id="s1128">Where he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Oh yes, I mean certainly, my -- my book is full of it, it tells it very clearly, but I mean, I can’t do this here, it wa -- it’s a huge --</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Give me a sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: -- long story, I mean wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Give me a sense of how a person does that, or how Stangl did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Well he -- how did he do it?</span> <span id="s1134">I mean, I’m just -- don’t quite know how I could answer that question how.</span> <span id="s1135">I mean the qu -- better question is probably why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: Why did he do it?</span> <span id="s1138">And I think he did it because yes, it made him feel strong.</span> <span id="s1139">He knew of his weakness, and he had to be strong, because his wife, who was more important to him than life, really, could not love a weak man.</span> <span id="s1140">So you see, he accepted a job in the police.</span> <span id="s1141">You remember, accepted a job in the police, that was when he was a very young man, and he -- he was a weaver by profession.</span> <span id="s1142">Gave that up, went into the police, why did he go in the police?</span> <span id="s1143">I asked him why, why?</span> <span id="s1144">And he said, “Oh, you know, they had these wonderful uniforms, and they were so important.”</span> <span id="s1145">That’s where it started.</span> <span id="s1146">And the m -- you know, the further he went, then the euthanasia, for God’s sake.</span> <span id="s1147">I mean, think of the importance -- how important he was in a place where they were murdering -- we call it murder, they of course, didn’t.</span> <span id="s1148">Mercy killing they called it, which is not something that is completely strange to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Is that what he called it still when he spoke to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1151">He said you cannot -- you -- you find this in there, he wa -- you cannot imagine what they were like.</span> <span id="s1152">You cannot imagine when they arrived, what they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Well of course I can imagine.</span> <span id="s1154">I mean, I have been in insane asylums.</span> <span id="s1155">I have been in many handicapped institutions -- in-institutions for the handicapped.</span> <span id="s1156">And the -- it can be terrible, and if you are uninterested, or if you are not capable of -- of communicating, if you like, i-inside, with the -- the spirit of these people, of such people -- and you know with -- with many insane, you cannot communicate, but with the handicapped, you can communicate.</span> <span id="s1157">But if you are incapable of it, and only see these totally destroyed bodies, which is very often the case, well then you -- you know then of course you will think they would be better off dead, as one of the nuns he talked to, a Mother Superior said she felt they were better off bed in -- dead in heaven.</span> <span id="s1158">Well of course she would feel that, wouldn’t she?</span> <span id="s1159">No, not of course, but it is understandable that she might.</span> <span id="s1160">But think what science, what our -- what our generation -- and I know nothing about this, you know, because I am not a scientist, I am not a mathematician, I -- it’s simply not my thing.</span> <span id="s1161">But what would our generation have done without Stephen Hawking?</span> <span id="s1162">And here is a man whose body is totally destroyed, and whose spirit is totally there.</span> <span id="s1163">Now what -- what -- can you imagine what the Nazis would have done to Stephen Hawking?</span> <span id="s1164">I mean, people should think that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: And of course Stangl would have thought that it was a mercy to kill Stephen Haw -- Stephen Hawking.</span> <span id="s1167">Because he would never, never have been capable of seeing that spirit, of feeling that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: And what did he feel at Treblinka, what did he come to feel, if anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: At Treblinka, well that was different, of course.</span> <span id="s1170">I mean, this -- the -- one -- one cannot for a moment forget the pre -- you know, conditioning all these Austrians and Germans -- mostly Austrians by the way, who were the supervisors of these extermination camps.</span> <span id="s1171">I mean, their -- their -- you know, their preconditioning was the most extreme that you can think of -- which ended, of course, if you like, or it began with the euthanasia.</span> <span id="s1172">But -- but -- by the time they were sent to the euthanasia institutions, th -- the -- the authorities knew that they were capable of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: How do you test these people, before he goes, say to that institution?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: He was -- he was a bl -- I mean, I was absolutely convinced from what he told me, that he wa -- that he was, you know, even before he was sent to Berlin to talk to psychiatrists, which they did before he was assigned to the euthanasia.</span> <span id="s1175">But even before that, they -- of course they observed him.</span> <span id="s1176">They observed him in his police work.</span> <span id="s1177">He said they couldn’t have observed me, because I didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1178">You don’t have to do anything.</span> <span id="s1179">The question is how you behave.</span> <span id="s1180">How you talk to your superiors, or to your comrades, or to those you arrest, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1181">There are a million ways.</span> <span id="s1182">I mean, you can do this here.</span> <span id="s1183">You can talk, you can find out -- I mean, you could -- you could -- you could talk to different police officers here, and after half an hour, you, for instance, you would know what they were about.</span> <span id="s1184">And I would know what they were about.</span> <span id="s1185">You know, it’s -- it’s -- it’s impossible to hide if you are a certain kind of person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: But there must be a difference.</span> <span id="s1187">I mean, there must be a -- th -- th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: I’m not saying that every police officer --</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: -- but I don’t mean that at all, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: No, but there must -- must have been something in him that -- you know, that Treblinka was so special, and so awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yeah, but there were 96 SS men, young men like he, and even younger, who were part of this, in these four camps.</span> <span id="s1193">96 of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: How old was he when he became commandant, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: I don’t remember, no, but it’s in the book, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s1196">I don’t remember how old he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: And how did you bring yourself day after day to go back and listen, and probe, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: Oh, but -- but -- but listen, this was fascinating.</span> <span id="s1199">Let’s not forget this.</span> <span id="s1200">I mean, first of all I was doing something -- and I really don’t mean this in any, you know, in any journalistic way, but I mean it was something that hadn’t been done before, and that needed to be done, to my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: And I was -- I was getting -- very slowly getting a feel of -- of -- you know, of the thing that I was looking for, very slowly.</span> <span id="s1203">Took a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: How long did you spend with him in all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: I spent three weeks with him, every day.</span> <span id="s1206">And then I went back and spent another week with him.</span> <span id="s1207">So all together I spent four weeks with him.</span> <span id="s1208">But this -- these were long days, you know.</span> <span id="s1209">I mean, I came there at nine in the morning, stayed until half past 12, I think it was, came back at a half past one, and stayed until five.</span> <span id="s1210">Now -- during which time he talked all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: What is it that’s kind of burned itself into your mind of -- of what he told you?</span> <span id="s1212">What are the images, or the particular stories that you can’t forget?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Well, first, no -- I do -- I can’t tell the stories, but I mean what -- what set -- burnt itself into my mind at first, and which has been confirmed by -- you know, by -- by many other talks I’ve had with people such as Stangl, is their self pity.</span> <span id="s1214">I mean, first there is the self pity which is perfectly justified, about their childhoods.</span> <span id="s1215">Every one of them had a terrible childhood, I mean it’s extraordinary.</span> <span id="s1216">It’s extraordinary, I’m -- I’m horrified at the number of terrible childhoods there are.</span> <span id="s1217">And it’s true, you know, because I looked into it afterwards in each case, and I found out, absolutely confirmed, beaten, all the rest of it, you know.</span> <span id="s1218">Absolutely true.</span> <span id="s1219">And -- and these children are conditioned, for God’s sake, for violence.</span> <span id="s1220">You be violent with a child, and the child in conditioned toward violence.</span> <span id="s1221">I’m not saying that every child that is beaten as a child is going to become a Stangl, of course not.</span> <span id="s1222">But if the circumstances are created, where becoming a Stangl, or something like that, is admirable in the eyes of the community, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1223">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1224">And -- and for Stangl this was exactly it, I mean it was admirable what he was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: So from what you tell me, I mean there is no sense of, you know, being when you -- you’re in a room with Stangl, of being in the presence of evil.</span> <span id="s1226">You’re in a room with a provincial Austrian policeman who got lucky, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: No, you’re in the room with a -- it’s not -- that’s too simple, really.</span> <span id="s1228">And you’re just saying this to draw me out, I know.</span> <span id="s1229">But of course it’s too simple.</span> <span id="s1230">You can never simplify somebody like Stangl, you can say -- I can say here is just a provincial Austrian.</span> <span id="s1231">Of course he was just a convincial -- provincial Austrian.</span> <span id="s1232">But he was a provincial Austrian who went through a series of experiences which burned itself into his spirit, and corrupted him totally.</span> <span id="s1233">He was a totally corrupt man.</span> <span id="s1234">A man who should never have been allowed again into the presence of children.</span> <span id="s1235">Which is what his wife felt, eventually, you know?</span> <span id="s1236">I mean -- and -- and I’m not even saying that -- you know, I’m not even saying that you can blame only Stangl for this.</span> <span id="s1237">You have to blame -- you have to blame the whole -- the circumstances, and the environment.</span> <span id="s1238">So the people who created this environment, are of course as blameworthy as Stangl.</span> <span id="s1239">Do you see what I mean?</span> <span id="s1240">I mean, of course Stangl, had he had the right help from his wife, he could have got out of it.</span> <span id="s1241">But it would have been difficult, and demanded, you know, character.</span> <span id="s1242">I mean, the kind of character he didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1243">I mean the kind of civic courage that he didn’t have, and also some conviction of sorts that he didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1244">For instance, the conviction that no one person, because he was Jewish, is bad, rather than another person is good.</span> <span id="s1245">I mean, it -- it simply -- thi -- thi -- this is -- the moment this division exists in the person, where to him, you know, where a Russian is bad, and an Englishman is good -- I mean, this is total bullshit of course, total nonsense.</span> <span id="s1246">And the moment you feel anything like that, which is one of the dangers of war by the way, you’re lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: What was the experience like for you?</span> <span id="s1248">Apart -- you’ve said that it was fascinating, but when you open that door every morning, okay you’re fascinated, and you want to know, and you’re getting somewhere, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: No, but it’s not okay you’re fascinated.</span> <span id="s1250">I mean the fascination is -- you know, the intellectual challenge is tremendous.</span> <span id="s1251">I mean, it’s a tremendous -- I mean it’s like -- it’s like alcohol.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: You know, it’s a tremendous thing, in which -- which is -- which was one thing with Stangl where I was -- where I was -- the one thing I was worried about, about myself with these conversations with Stangl, is that I was constantly the superior.</span> <span id="s1254">This is very dangerous for anyone’s character.</span> <span id="s1255">It’s very bad for you.</span> <span id="s1256">And I was lucky enough that, you know, I had this wonderful family at home.</span> <span id="s1257">I had the counterweight of my extremely intelligent husband, and you know, very intelligent children.</span> <span id="s1258">So not -- I’m saying intelligent because you know, you feel that you are so much in command, that your brain is more in your mind than anything else.</span> <span id="s1259">I mean, there were moments when I -- I -- I knew I couldn’t go on, and I then could go on, because that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s1260">But -- but it was very different, of course, when I undertook this thing with sha -- with Speer.</span> <span id="s1261">Because Speer was not just my equal, but he was way superior to me in intellect.</span> <span id="s1262">He was far more cultivé than -- than I was at the time, you know.</span> <span id="s1263">He had read far more.</span> <span id="s1264">He -- he -- he was a -- an absolutely extraordinary man, and so it -- it was a completely different challenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Tell me a little about it.</span> <span id="s1266">Let’s move on to Speer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Well, Speer -- Speer, whom I didn’t like when he -- when h-he -- Speer asked me to do this.</span> <span id="s1268">I mean, he got in touch with me having read, “Into That Darkness.”</span> <span id="s1269">And obviously -- I mean, as I said before, these people want to speak, they want to talk.</span> <span id="s1270">And Speer read, “Into That Darkness,” which kept him sleepless, he said, for several nights.</span> <span id="s1271">And -- and he decided that this was somebody he could talk to.</span> <span id="s1272">Now Speer had talked to a lot of people, you know, because he was, of course, a huge personality, of enormous importance historically.</span> <span id="s1273">And I suppose every major journalist in the world -- certainly in the western world, tried to talk to Speer.</span> <span id="s1274">I mean, it would have been insane not to.</span> <span id="s1275">I didn’t like him.</span> <span id="s1276">I saw him on TV, I -- you know, I read -- of course I read his books.</span> <span id="s1277">I thought he was an arrogant man.</span> <span id="s1278">His charm did not charm me.</span> <span id="s1279">I thought his -- he was very suave, and I couldn’t bear it.</span> <span id="s1280">So when he -- when he wrote to me, and then followed this up with quite a lot of phone calls, I was -- I was very reluctant indeed.</span> <span id="s1281">He became -- he became very atta -- not attached, that’s the wrong word, but he -- he liked my husband very much, already on the telephone.</span> <span id="s1282">I mean, they had these long conversations on art, about which Speer knew, I mean far more than either of us, of course.</span> <span id="s1283">But also, Don knows far more than I, but Speer knew far, far more than -- and -- and it was quite interesting for my husband, you know, who was still very actively on “Vogue,” and doing lots of photography, also to do with artists and so on.</span> <span id="s1284">So it was all very interesting for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: And he -- he didn’t like Speer very much, any more than I did, but -- on the phone, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: But somehow a kind of relationship developed, and when there had been, you know, something -- I don’t know how many weeks it was, it was several weeks of these phone calls which came in from Speer, all asking me, well when would I come to Heidelberg, and I mean wasn’t I planning?</span> <span id="s1289">I was so often in Germany, wasn’t I -- blah, blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s1290">And finally I thought, what is the matter with me?</span> <span id="s1291">I mean, if th -- this man is so desperate for me to do a Stangl on him, okay.</span> <span id="s1292">I’ll do it.</span> <span id="s1293">You know, as vulgarly as that, I thought.</span> <span id="s1294">And of course that kind of thought immediately disappeared the moment I met him.</span> <span id="s1295">I’ve got to say, I mean really.</span> <span id="s1296">I mean, we were -- we went to have lunch with him and his wife in a Heidelberg [indecipherable], and there was this humble man.</span> <span id="s1297">On the telephone he was just as arrogant as on TV.</span> <span id="s1298">So every tra -- telephone call supported my -- exta -- not every, some of them there was this curious humility.</span> <span id="s1299">Anyway, at lunch, I mean, you know, there was a different man.</span> <span id="s1300">And I thought, well wait a minute, maybe I’m all wrong about this.</span> <span id="s1301">What is this man, you know?</span> <span id="s1302">What is this?</span> <span id="s1303">And of course, he talked a lot during a long, long lunch.</span> <span id="s1304">And talked a lot about it, about Hitler, which is what I encouraged him to do.</span> <span id="s1305">And by the end of the lunch, and Don and I went back to our hotel, I said, “Jesus, of course the one thing that in all these weeks I didn’t think about, was that this man was the closest to Hitler of anyone in Germany.</span> <span id="s1306">Am I crazy not to want to talk to him?”</span> <span id="s1307">Don said, “Oh yes, you’re crazy.”</span> <span id="s1308">So -- so anyway, that’s how it started, you know, and of course the moment I started talking to him, I -- one’s attitude changes.</span> <span id="s1309">Once -- as I told you, once -- once people start talking about their childhood, and with me they always have to talk about their childhood first, because I think everything starts in childhood.</span> <span id="s1310">I know that this is a -- a cliché thing to say, and Freudian and all the rest of it, but it’s not Freudian, it’s -- it’s purely human.</span> <span id="s1311">It doesn’t apply to everybody either, I have to say.</span> <span id="s1312">Because you can have a rotten childhood, or a difficult childhood, and still become a perfectly ordinary and good person.</span> <span id="s1313">So it doesn’t apply to everybody, but somebody who then develops in a certain way, and has had a terrible childhood, then you can find -- you know, you can find connections.</span> <span id="s1314">And certainly with Speer there were very, very strong connections.</span> <span id="s1315">He was extraordinary lonely as a child.</span> <span id="s1316">I mean, the middle child of three, and neither liked by his father, nor by his mother, who liked the two at the other -- one each, you know, of the other brothers.</span> <span id="s1317">He was very alone throughout his childhood.</span> <span id="s1318">And -- and -- an-and really suffered under it, I mean, he -- he suffer -- he had a -- he had a suffering childhood, Speer, which is odd.</span> <span id="s1319">So when he found Hitler, of course it must have been the most extraordinary experience.</span> <span id="s1320">And when Hitler found Speer it must have been the extraordinary experience, because, you know, if you want to make it very simple -- and why not make it simple, then a man who had never been a father, found a son.</span> <span id="s1321">And a son who had never had a father, found a father.</span> <span id="s1322">It’s as simple as that, really, except it’s much more complicated.</span> <span id="s1323">But start with the simple things, and you find answers.</span> <span id="s1324">Because certainly Speer and Hitler loved each other.</span> <span id="s1325">They loved each other.</span> <span id="s1326">And it took Speer -- it took Speer all those years to understand, partly, that there was something terribly wrong.</span> <span id="s1327">And he never, never understood it really, until he was in Spandau, and was alone, and could read.</span> <span id="s1328">You know, he read 5,000 books in Spandau.</span> <span id="s1329">And boy, he could read, you know.</span> <span id="s1330">And he c -- he -- by the time I met him, he knew -- boy, he knew more than anybody else did.</span> <span id="s1331">He really did.</span> <span id="s1332">I think he knew more about the Nazis -- of course, knew more about Hitler than everybody else did, but he understood more than anybody else did.</span> <span id="s1333">And as for this one part of this Nazism, which everybody, of course, as you -- as you know, I think, is exclusively concerned with, Speer was never an ideological anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s1334">He was an anti-Semite because they were all anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1335">But he was not an ideological anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s1336">He could manage with anybody, actually.</span> <span id="s1337">And he could manage, of course after -- I mean, after Spandau, I mean my God, I mean in Spandau he -- you know, in Spandau he had a -- a great deal to do with -- with Jewish officers, and actually had -- I mean, he even emotionally changed a lot there.</span> <span id="s1338">You see, it was a -- it was a tremendous opening of understanding of what people were, you know.</span> <span id="s1339">People, that it’s not -- it’s not where they come from, it -- but what they are.</span> <span id="s1340">Which is the only thing that counts.</span> <span id="s1341">I mean, it doesn’t matter where anybody comes from, what religion, or what they like to call race.</span> <span id="s1342">I mean, this ridiculous and dreadful word, race.</span> <span id="s1343">It’s -- it’s totally unimportant, the only thing that matters is what the individual is, with a capital I. And that’s what Speer -- what Speer certainly learned in Spandau.</span> <span id="s1344">So you know by the time -- by the time he came to me, I mean he was really preconditioned to really talking.</span> <span id="s1345">And he did, I mean he -- he -- Speer t-taught me more than I could ever give him.</span> <span id="s1346">He would have hated this book, of course, absolutely hated it.</span> <span id="s1347">He was very, you know, he was very, very dubious about what I would write.</span> <span id="s1348">And he was so right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: But thi -- and this is -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: This is tape number three, side B of an interview with Gitta Sereny.</span> <span id="s1351">[tape pause] -- dubious or not, he talked to you anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: Yes, he -- b-because once, you see that that’s -- that of course is -- I mean, it’s the secret, you know, I mean what have I been doing for the last three hours -- you know, three and a half hours, when I really told myself, and told Don, three hours is it, no more.</span> <span id="s1353">And -- and I have talked to you.</span> <span id="s1354">When people start to talk, they talk, because the point is that -- and this applies to almost everybody, as you have found, too, I’m quite sure in your professional life.</span> <span id="s1355">But people like Speer -- and I won’t say people like I, because I don’t mean to compare myself to Speer, but -- but -- but people of some, if you like, some intellect, or some -- they are not protected by this.</span> <span id="s1356">They need it just as much, or it happens just as much.</span> <span id="s1357">And certainly Speer -- I mean there were days when he -- when he obviously had had some experience with jailers, or whatever, I don’t know, when he -- when it was really very difficult to get him to go on.</span> <span id="s1358">But on the whole, he was completely different, of course, from Stangl, I mean obviously.</span> <span id="s1359">But he was looking forward to these conversations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: How tortured was he emotionally by the process you put him through, and the process he put himself through in Spandau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: He was -- Speer was -- I tell you Speer was more tortured by guilt than anybody I’ve ever met.</span> <span id="s1362">He felt guilty for every Jewish death.</span> <span id="s1363">Every one of the six million.</span> <span id="s1364">And he never said that, but I know this, I know this.</span> <span id="s1365">He was desperate about it.</span> <span id="s1366">The only mistake was -- and I could never, never -- I could never persuade him of this, that he too felt that that was the only thing he needed to feel guilty about.</span> <span id="s1367">And when I said to him, and I did of course, not once, but oh, how many times, you brought the forced laborers to Germany, you are responsible for the death of a hundred thousand of them.</span> <span id="s1368">This was your work, not Sowers, who was hanged for it.</span> <span id="s1369">He was under your orders, it was yours.</span> <span id="s1370">It simply didn’t touch him, it was like -- as if I didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s1371">I might as well have kept my mouth shut.</span> <span id="s1372">He felt no guilt for this.</span> <span id="s1373">This was part of his -- I won’t call it duty, but it was -- it was simply part of what he was there for.</span> <span id="s1374">And as far as he was concerned, of course -- and this is true, I mean, of course I checked all this.</span> <span id="s1375">When he found out that foreign laborers -- I mean, fo -- he called them Gastarbeiter, but hell, they weren’t Gastarbeiter.</span> <span id="s1376">When fo -- foreign laborers were mistreated anywhere, if he found out, he took measures.</span> <span id="s1377">He did.</span> <span id="s1378">And -- and you know, he mentioned a number of occasions to me.</span> <span id="s1379">Every occasion that I could look into, I did.</span> <span id="s1380">Every single one of them was confirmed.</span> <span id="s1381">He took steps, it was changed, the people were properly treated, they were moved into different places where they were properly treat -- or whatever.</span> <span id="s1382">So, he did.</span> <span id="s1383">Even so, the system, it is the system, and he agreed to the system, and he supported it, and he was Hitler’s closest friend, and he was responsible for God’s sake.</span> <span id="s1384">He was responsible, he was responsible for their deaths.</span> <span id="s1385">But he knew it, you see, and he was -- he was the unhappiest man of all the Nazis I met.</span> <span id="s1386">He was the most important, and he was the unhappiest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
