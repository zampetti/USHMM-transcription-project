That’s the official business.</span> <span id="s16">I wanted to just go back and ask you, your parents, I needed to know their names and their -- what they did for a living, what your father or your mother did for a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: My father’s name was Elkanon Fochs.</span> <span id="s18">My mother’s name was Gitl.</span> <span id="s19">Gitl translates to Tova.</span> <span id="s20">They called her in Polish Gutcha and my father was called Henry.</span> <span id="s21">T-They had a -- a store in Warsaw, haberdashery.</span> <span id="s22">Also, in those days, you needed license for selling tobacco or lottery tickets.</span> <span id="s23">My father had both and they used to sell both.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What was the name of his store?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: There was no name, just -- just haberdashery store and I don’t remember seeing any name over a particular store.</span> <span id="s26">Although, next door, there was my grandmother’s store and she had electrical appliances and her store had a name.</span> <span id="s27">So I -- I don’t know why my parent’s store had no name.</span> <span id="s28">My grandmother’s store na -- store’s name was Znicz.</span> <span id="s29">Znicz, Z-n-i-c-z in Poland, and that means a flare or a -- in Hebrew, mare tahmid, a light forever, Znicz.</span> <span id="s30">And that was my grandmother’s store, which was next door to my parent’s store.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Okay, and you had -- your sister was older than you, or younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: My sister was older than I, five years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: And her name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Her name -- the Jewish name was Malka Arahel.</span> <span id="s35">Malka Rachel.</span> <span id="s36">She was commonly known at home as Mareesha.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Five years older, okay.</span> <span id="s38">You mentioned in the videotaped interview, back in 1990, that your parents disappeared at certain points during the war.</span> <span id="s39">Do you remember what years those were or how old you would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: I can give you approximate times.</span> <span id="s41">A-All I remember, actually, was the seasons of the year, whether it was cold or hot.</span> <span id="s42">My mother disappeared, I think it was 1942 and it must have been July, or August, was very hot.</span> <span id="s43">And I understand that there was a big German aktion in town and that’s when she -- when she was caught in the street and brought to the Umschlagplatz, which was the -- the railroad station, where they took all the people, to send them out.</span> <span id="s44">I found out later on that people who were caught and -- that day, were sent to Treblinka right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: So that was 1942, in the summer --</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Yes, 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What about your dad, was that earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: No, later.</span> <span id="s49">That was later.</span> <span id="s50">When there were the factories, the German factories opened up in -- in Warsaw ghetto, there were different factories in different parts of -- of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s51">Where we lived, we went to work at the brush makers, making brushes.</span> <span id="s52">And my father and my sister and I, we lived at the Narlefke Street.</span> <span id="s53">This was already maybe the third or fourth time that we have moved, since we were thrown out of our own apartment and moved into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s54">My father went to work at that particular time and did not return.</span> <span id="s55">It seems to have been an aktion and all people from the factory were taken out.</span> <span id="s56">So he never returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Do you have any idea when that was?</span> <span id="s58">A: It must have been a few months later.</span> <span id="s59">Must have been a few months later, can’t remember the date.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Okay, so we’re still probably in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Late ‘42, I would think, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s63">And it was then after that, that your sister was captured?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Do you remember when that would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: After my father.</span> <span id="s67">I-It must have been -- it must have been the end of ‘42, I think.</span> <span id="s68">There was an aktion where the Germans came into the building and flushed out -- or at least tried to flush out everybody from their hiding places.</span> <span id="s69">And at that time, we were in an apartment on -- on the street floor, just a few steps going up.</span> <span id="s70">And the -- We were left -- my aunt was left, my Aunt Esther.</span> <span id="s71">My grandmother was left.</span> <span id="s72">My Aunt Esther’s little boy, who was about three years old, yeah, it must have been ‘42.</span> <span id="s73">And my sister and I. And when we heard that the Germans are coming in, we started hiding.</span> <span id="s74">Now, my grandmother, my aunt and her little boy, went to a little cabinet underneath the window, which was used instead of -- instead of a refrigerator.</span> <span id="s75">And th-the walls of the building were thick, so there was enough room for those people to get in and I closed the door and put a chair in front of it.</span> <span id="s76">And my sister didn’t know -- I -- we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s77">So we had a folding bed that when it was folded up, it looked like a table.</span> <span id="s78">And she crawled in there and I put a -- a cover over it and then I didn’t know what to do, the Germans were already in, so I opened the door to the bathroom, but they looked in the bathroom, too.</span> <span id="s79">Then I saw on the -- at the wall -- on the wall of the bathroom, it was a ladder and on top of it was a shelf.</span> <span id="s80">There was also a light bulb above the shelf.</span> <span id="s81">And I don’t know how I was able to, but I really went up the ladder and sat down on the shelf and unscrewed the bulb, making sure that no-none of my clothes hang down.</span> <span id="s82">By that time, I could hear the Germans in the hallway, coming in and my heart was banging so hard I hoped they didn’t hear it.</span> <span id="s83">And that’s when they found my sister, and they took her out.</span> <span id="s84">At that time they didn’t find my grandmother, my aunt or my little cousin.</span> <span id="s85">But they did find my sister.</span> <span id="s86">Some people told me afterwards, some neighbors, that she was shot.</span> <span id="s87">I cannot recall -- I was in such shock, that I don’t remember what I heard and what I saw.</span> <span id="s88">I just remembered that I heard her cry and they took her out.</span> <span id="s89">They found her in the bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And she would have been about 17, it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: I’m curious, with -- with your mother and your father, your description in your videotaped interview was, they went out and they never came back.</span> <span id="s93">And I wonder what that was like for you, what you remember feeling, that you never really knew what happened to them, you s -- they just disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, where my mother’s concerned, we heard from her from Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s95">She managed to send word that she is there and asked [phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Before the phone rang, we were talking about yo-your mother and your father, when they disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yeah, well we got word from Umschlagplatz that my mother was there and she was asking for help.</span> <span id="s98">And my uncle, at that time, tried to -- to contact some friends who worked with the police -- with the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s99">But, before anything could happen, we got word that the trains left.</span> <span id="s100">So, we know that she was caught there and that she was there.</span> <span id="s101">And of course, the trains left to Treblinka, that’s what we were advised.</span> <span id="s102">When my father didn’t come back, we did not hear anything, except that there was the aktion in the factory and the people were taken out.</span> <span id="s103">And this was, oh, I would estimate maybe two months or three months after my mother, because I remember the weather was windy.</span> <span id="s104">I really had to judge everything by the weather.</span> <span id="s105">I had no knowledge of dates.</span> <span id="s106">There was no calendar to look at.</span> <span id="s107">And I think that I was too young or inexperienced to -- to really remember dates.</span> <span id="s108">Life there was like life of a rat that is hiding and it’s constantly chased.</span> <span id="s109">And one does not know exactly where and when it is, day, night, summer, winter.</span> <span id="s110">This kind of sticks in the mind because it is -- you remember whether you were cold or -- or hot.</span> <span id="s111">But the dates -- exact dates are not known to me.</span> <span id="s112">Later on, when I listened to some people, who were a little bit older, even three, four years older than I am, they knew dates.</span> <span id="s113">I have a friend who is 10 years my senior, she remembers every date and she has a terrific memory.</span> <span id="s114">But I don’t remember the exact dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Do you remember what you were thinking or feeling?</span> <span id="s116">You were about 12 now, a very difficult time --</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Yeah, 12 and a half, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Do you remember how -- what -- how you reacted when you found out about this?</span> <span id="s119">When you realized that first your mother, then your father was gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: I was in shock and I don’t know if I can -- if I can assign any thoughts to that period.</span> <span id="s121">I know that I was in shock.</span> <span id="s122">I know that the thought that was the most important, was survival and probably I -- probably I thought, “How can I survive without them?”</span> <span id="s123">It was actually a -- a selfish feeling, probably.</span> <span id="s124">It’s very hard to describe, I even get goosebumps when I -- when I talk about it, even now, because now I -- I miss them.</span> <span id="s125">For all these years, I’ve been missing them.</span> <span id="s126">But in those days, I think it was more of a -- of a self-preservation feeling.</span> <span id="s127">Of a, ‘What am I going to do without them?’</span> <span id="s128">And that’s all that comes to mind.</span> <span id="s129">What next, how to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Were you very close to your parents?</span> <span id="s131">A: Very close.</span> <span id="s132">Very close to my parents, to my grandparent.</span> <span id="s133">I was the youngest grandchild until my little cousin was born.</span> <span id="s134">I was quite spoiled as a child.</span> <span id="s135">Had terrific childhood, very, very good.</span> <span id="s136">I had good school, good teachers.</span> <span id="s137">I had everything I needed or I wanted.</span> <span id="s138">I can’t imagine anybody having a better life than I did at home.</span> <span id="s139">My sister and I, we were kind of spoiled children.</span> <span id="s140">But I was even more, because I was the younger one, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: You mentioned in the videotaped interview that -- that you had made efforts after your sister disappeared to try to find her and I’m curious what -- what you did -- that you just sort of were never sure she was really gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: I was never sure that she was gone, because I didn’t hear or see anything.</span> <span id="s143">And the efforts I tried to make would be after the war.</span> <span id="s144">I tried to put ads in paper.</span> <span id="s145">Went to agent -- Jewish agencies to look for survivor’s names.</span> <span id="s146">I wrote to the international Red Cross.</span> <span id="s147">I even wrote to them to find out if they heard anything from my parents, because I hadn’t seen them being killed and -- and -- and I thought that maybe miracle do happen and people do survive.</span> <span id="s148">But everywhere I turned there was a closed door.</span> <span id="s149">There was -- Not a closed door, but there was a ‘no’ answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Was this when you were in -- where were you when you were making contact in the papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: I was -- I started doing that when I was still in Germany.</span> <span id="s152">And then I went to Israel, tried from there.</span> <span id="s153">And when I came to America, tried again.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: And did they have any record of your mother at Treblinka, any --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: No records whatsoever, not that I could find any.</span> <span id="s158">There is one place, very curious.</span> <span id="s159">It -- It happened kind of in the last two or three years, that I came across a book of pictures.</span> <span id="s160">And those pictures were compiled by a professor from -- from California and I contacted him and he said that he went to the archives in Koblins, Germany, where they have many, many films taken by German soldiers during the war, and the pictures -- th-the films have only dates on them, dates and places, but of course, no names of people or what th-they took pictures of.</span> <span id="s161">And I looked through -- through this book and I found two pictures where my uncle was in it and that’s when I contacted that professor and I wanted to know and that’s what he told me.</span> <span id="s162">He said if I went to Koblins, the people there are very accommodating and I could look through any pictures I want to.</span> <span id="s163">But of course, I didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s164">I had a sick son, whom I lost since.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: I’m very sorry.</span> <span id="s166">The uncle, whose pictures you saw, which uncle was this and where was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: This was the uncle who helped my escape, as well as the escape of my grandmother, my aunt and her boy and his brother and the wife.</span> <span id="s168">He helped us all escape from the ghetto, just as the Warsaw ghetto uprising started in ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: His Jewish name was Mordechai, but he went by the name of Mietek.</span> <span id="s171">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: And where were these pictures taken, that the professor had?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: It seems to me that it was taken on the stage of a theater in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s174">There were two or three theaters, one of which was familiar to me because my uncle performed there.</span> <span id="s175">And th-the name of the theater was Azazel.</span> <span id="s176">And I used to go there, almost daily to watch the performances of -- of the theater, I used to love it.</span> <span id="s177">And I used to go there every day after so-called school.</span> <span id="s178">There was no school for us, but we had a professor who formed classes in his house.</span> <span id="s179">And he was paid by my parent with whatever they had.</span> <span id="s180">Could be a pair of socks for his children or whatever.</span> <span id="s181">And he formed a class.</span> <span id="s182">So some of us -- we started out with about eight or 10 children in the class and little by little, there were fewer, because they were caught, they died, or whatever.</span> <span id="s183">So, every day after the classes, I would run over to the theater and watch the performances.</span> <span id="s184">So, when I saw the pictures, I saw also the other actors, whom I knew, whom I met there.</span> <span id="s185">And I tried to even locate them, but it -- it is not very easy.</span> <span id="s186">Although I was good at locating people -- I knew where to go and how to go about it, but those people I couldn’t locate.</span> <span id="s187">So, I recognize on the picture the stage, and it must have been taken there.</span> <span id="s188">I would have loved to go there, to Koblins and look for more pictures and God knows whom I -- I could identify.</span> <span id="s189">But, at that time, my younger son was very, very sick and I just -- I just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s190">I went away somewhere for a week or 10 days, I think to Florida and -- and I was sorry I did, because he couldn’t -- he couldn’t really look after himself, he was very ill.</span> <span id="s191">And he passed away Friday the 13th of December, of ‘96.</span> <span id="s192">So this Friday -- that -- this 13th of December that’s coming, will be two years that I lost him.</span> <span id="s193">So I didn’t pursue any more looking and with me getting so -- falling apart, kind of.</span> <span id="s194">It’s -- It’s tough to -- to concentrate on everything.</span> <span id="s195">Q: You mentioned that Uncle Mietek was the one who smuggled you out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yeah, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Forgive me for asking you a date again, but do you remember what -- around when that would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s199">It would have been in 1943, a little before or after my birthday, which is in March.</span> <span id="s200">Probably was in March, maybe in April of ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s202">And then you describe that there was a period of you living outside and then at one point, you went back to Warsaw on the train.</span> <span id="s203">And that would have been ‘44?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Oh, that was still ‘43.</span> <span id="s205">When -- When we were at -- when my uncle smuggled us out of the ghetto, we -- he prepared, with the help of my other uncle, his brother and -- and her -- and his wife, they prepared an apartment.</span> <span id="s206">And my aunt’s brother made a double wall in a room without a window and we could hide there.</span> <span id="s207">So, if anybody knocked on the door or anything like this, we would just crawl in and hide there until we were found out and of course, thrown out.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: When -- After you went back to Warsaw, after your uncle was shot, you went back to Warsaw and you described that the city was -- everyone was forced onto trains and you ultimately went to Ravensbrück.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Well, that was a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: That was -- I would say more than a year later.</span> <span id="s212">The -- The ghetto revolt was Passover of ‘43 and the Polish revolt was September of ‘44.</span> <span id="s213">So, it was a year and a half later.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: What do you remember about those two events?</span> <span id="s215">Were you in Warsaw at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yes, I was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s217">I was working as a cook’s helper, in one of the suburbs that’s called Jolybush.</span> <span id="s218">When the -- When the Polish revolt started in September, at that time, my aunt was across the river, in Pragga and her little boy was on our side, in Warsaw, take -- being taken care of by a Polish woman named Olga -- Ola.</span> <span id="s219">I remembered that day.</span> <span id="s220">I went to visit my aunt in Pragga and she knitted a sweater for her s-son.</span> <span id="s221">She gave me that sweater -- of course, nobody knew we were Jewish -- she gave me that sweater, I brought it to her son and by the time I got back to Jolybush, I heard shots.</span> <span id="s222">And that was when the Polish revolt started, September of ‘44, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: And what -- And what was -- What was going through your mind at that time?</span> <span id="s224">What did you think was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: I was not terribly emotional about that.</span> <span id="s226">I just thought, this is a war.</span> <span id="s227">Nobody’s after me, specifically.</span> <span id="s228">This is a war, there were all kinds of rumors going on, because at -- at some point, we were -- we were bombed by the Cartushas from -- from the other side of the river.</span> <span id="s229">And they were, I think, the Russian Cartushas.</span> <span id="s230">And sometimes we heard airplanes and shooting, lot of shooting, and there were some direct hits.</span> <span id="s231">But it was a different feeling for me.</span> <span id="s232">They were not chasing me because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s233">It was just a war.</span> <span id="s234">And of course, we want to stay alive and we want to survive the war, but it was not the same as being chased because you’re Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: When you got on the train and you were being taken to Ravensbrück, had you heard any stories about what went on there?</span> <span id="s236">You described that when you went to take a shower, you thought that you would be gassed.</span> <span id="s237">And I was curious how you even would have known about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: We have heard that in the ghetto, some time before.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: They were -- It seems that there were some people who jumped the trains and came back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s241">And since the ghetto was very small, they -- they were tightening it all the time and rumors spread all the time.</span> <span id="s242">There were some rumors to that effect.</span> <span id="s243">So, when we were taken, in ‘44, as Christians, there was a thought about it, but the thought was immediately countered by a feeling that this cannot happen because I’m here among Christians and not Jews and they probably would not do that.</span> <span id="s244">At one time, there was a possibility to escape and I did not take that chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: When -- When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: The train slowed down and it was not part of the way, it was an half open wagon where they keep cattle, in a half open wagon.</span> <span id="s247">They -- Only later they switched to a all closed.</span> <span id="s248">But at that time -- and it was still on Polish soil, there was a -- a way to jump out of -- of a train when it slowed down.</span> <span id="s249">But I did not take the chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Why not, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Well, I was with my friend, Peppy.</span> <span id="s252">We looked at each other and I think -- I don’t think we talked about it, but we both felt that this -- they are not going to kill us.</span> <span id="s253">And I don’t think I could jump or she could jump.</span> <span id="s254">We were not that a-athletic.</span> <span id="s255">So -- And it was just a matter of a short time when the possibility presented itself.</span> <span id="s256">The trains were -- were watched by the German soldiers with rifles, so no, we didn’t take the chance.</span> <span id="s257">Just like we didn’t take the chance to swallow the poison.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Do you remember being afraid on that train, as you were going to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yeah, yeah, of course.</span> <span id="s260">But, you were with other people who were talking and -- and they never heard of dying or being gassed or anything like that.</span> <span id="s261">The mood was different.</span> <span id="s262">It was like we know that we’re political prisoners.</span> <span id="s263">We were taken as political prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Because they didn’t know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: I want to ask you about that, let me just -- I’m curious how -- you -- you’d had to hide your identity, I’d -- I don’t know, did your identification papers say you were Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Yeah, Catholic.</span> <span id="s269">How was that for you?</span> <span id="s270">You’d been raised in a Jewish home?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Wh-What did that do to you, to be suddenly Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Well, it meant to survive.</span> <span id="s274">I also went to see a priest.</span> <span id="s275">And the priest apparently was very smart, because he told me that -- that religion -- God is for all -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Doris Greenberg.</span> <span id="s277">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s278">You were talking about the priest who you’d come to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yes, I had -- I had gone to see him more than once and he was encouraging all the time.</span> <span id="s280">Sometimes I -- I thought that he probably knows who I was.</span> <span id="s281">Sometimes he would -- he’d give me some nuts and candy to take with me in my pocket.</span> <span id="s282">And he was very encouraging and very nice.</span> <span id="s283">Kept me going.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Was there any -- Did you feel any conflict internally, th -- wa -- about having to hide your identity as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Absolutely, yes.</span> <span id="s286">I knew very well that I’m not supposed to be in church.</span> <span id="s287">And yet for -- in order to survive, I had to go to church.</span> <span id="s288">I had to do what every -- every other person did upon entering the church, put the holy water or make the sign of the crest or whatever.</span> <span id="s289">Yes, I felt very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s290">But the thought of survival meant more than anything else.</span> <span id="s291">And I just kept thinking, when I -- if I survive -- when I survive, I’m going to be who I am and not who I pretend to be.</span> <span id="s292">And I also know that Jewish religion tells you that life -- a human life is very dear and should be preserved.</span> <span id="s293">People are allowed to eat on Yom Kippur, if their life depends upon it.</span> <span id="s294">So, I thought that I’m allowed to -- to go to church and pray, because my life depends upon it.</span> <span id="s295">It was -- This was my mediation in church, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Did the -- Did the religion -- Did that faith in church, was it a comfort to you, to be able to do -- worship in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s298">I -- I think that my religion was my religion and whenever there was a speech by -- by the -- by the priest, it was a good speech, but I -- I can not identify with Jesus.</span> <span id="s299">I -- I am -- I wasn’t brought up that way.</span> <span id="s300">I couldn’t identify.</span> <span id="s301">But, in my mind, I would just substitute the word God.</span> <span id="s302">I was praying to God, no names, just God.</span> <span id="s303">And that’s what made it possible for me.</span> <span id="s304">And this was my meditation, that I’m preserving my life.</span> <span id="s305">That’s what I have to do to preserve it.</span> <span id="s306">Same thing with eating non-kosher food, I have to do it.</span> <span id="s307">And that was the -- the power of survival is enormous -- is enormous.</span> <span id="s308">I went once to a course, oh, years later, here in -- in New York.</span> <span id="s309">Was a course of -- I think the power of negotiation or something like that.</span> <span id="s310">Was given by a very good instructor.</span> <span id="s311">And before the course, the instructor told us to write down everything we know how to do.</span> <span id="s312">And people were writing and writing and writing and I just wrote one word, survive.</span> <span id="s313">The instructor was not very pleased and she wanted explanation.</span> <span id="s314">But that was what I thought my main achievement in life, to survive.</span> <span id="s315">It is -- That feeling is terribly strong, especially it was for me, I -- I -- I figured fo-for everybody.</span> <span id="s316">And people did lot of things to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: What -- When you -- When you got to Ravensbrück -- on the video interview you described seeing writing on the wall in Yiddish from something.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Were there Jews at Ravensbrück still when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: There were none, no.</span> <span id="s323">The only way -- because Peppy could read Yiddish and she pointed out very discreetly, so that other people cannot see what we’re looking at and she showed me that there were Jewish names and I -- I don’t know what else was on it, but there were messages in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: That must have been a real moment, I would think, that hit home, that had your identity been known, your fate might have been very different.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Oh, we knew that all along.</span> <span id="s326">We knew that all along.</span> <span id="s327">We had to even be very careful sleeping, not to talk in our sleep.</span> <span id="s328">When -- Because we were not alone, we were in big barracks.</span> <span id="s329">And if we would say one word that the people don’t understand or they think it’s Yiddish or anything like that, it would be bad.</span> <span id="s330">I thought later on, not at the time -- at the time it didn’t bother me, because I didn’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s331">So I -- If I dreamed, it would be in -- in Polish.</span> <span id="s332">So, it didn’t bother me, but I remember it did bother my friend Peppy, who spoke Polish and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s333">And we had to watch each other, to kind of -- not to talk in our sleep.</span> <span id="s334">There’s so many details when you -- when you want to hide under somebody -- to be somebody else.</span> <span id="s335">Doesn’t pay, unless your life depends on it, it does not pay.</span> <span id="s336">It’s a -- I-It’s a very, very i-involved task.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: You went to a labor camp after Ravensbrück --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Do you remember the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Noibrandenberg -- Noibrandenberg.</span> <span id="s341">That was in a forest.</span> <span id="s342">There were barracks dug in the ground and also barracks of factories.</span> <span id="s343">So -- huge barracks and the factories were outside of the camp, but also in barracks.</span> <span id="s344">So, we were brought there and I remember the walls were dripping with water and when -- this was wintertime, yeah.</span> <span id="s345">We were brought there, was wintertime, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: 1944, right.</span> <span id="s348">And then they sent us out to the -- a -- a group of laborers, women laborers, we laid tracks for a train.</span> <span id="s349">So we -- They used to march us out with SS people and dogs and went to -- marched to -- to the place where they wanted us to put their railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s350">We worked for 12 hours a day and then they marched us back.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: You then went to something called free work and I’m curious if you had any notion of what that was, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Yeah, when I said free work, I meant that there was no camp.</span> <span id="s353">That you living in freedom, that you can go out on the street or -- or go where and come wherever you want.</span> <span id="s354">That it was not in a camp, not in a jail.</span> <span id="s355">That is what I called free.</span> <span id="s356">Although you were assi -- I was assigned to a couple who owned a store downstairs and they lived upstairs and I think they were assigned a slave, me, because they had a daughter who was an SS person.</span> <span id="s357">I didn’t know it at the beginning, but I was assigned to this elderly couple and they were quite good to me.</span> <span id="s358">They demanded their work and they gave me a place to sleep and some food to eat.</span> <span id="s359">They did not hit me, they did not treat me badly, so it was okay, except when their daughter came to visit.</span> <span id="s360">They were shaking, they were very nervous, and I didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s361">Come to think of it, maybe they were afraid of her, too.</span> <span id="s362">And when she saw me, that daughter, she wanted to know if I understand a lot of German, because it’s similar to Yiddish and if I can say something so that she could see that I speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s363">Ma -- I don’t know whether it was my imagination or -- or it was for real, but she did a-ask me questions and most of the time I -- I just didn’t know what to say.</span> <span id="s364">I could say yes, I could say no and -- or I could gesture with my hands like maybe.</span> <span id="s365">And she was quite unnerving me.</span> <span id="s366">I think maybe she was doing the same to her parents.</span> <span id="s367">I noticed they felt much better when she left.</span> <span id="s368">So that’s what I called free work.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: When they announced that they were going to be sending you there, do you remember what your emotions were?</span> <span id="s370">I mean, did you sort of feel like the worst was over?</span> <span id="s371">Was it any kind of relief or did it not seem that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: They did not announce anything.</span> <span id="s373">They just put you on the train and -- and got you there.</span> <span id="s374">They didn’t announce anything.</span> <span id="s375">In the last minute, they say, “You are going be here.</span> <span id="s376">You are going to work here.”</span> <span id="s377">But, in the camp, they did not announce anything.</span> <span id="s378">Said that we’re going to go out to work.</span> <span id="s379">We really didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s380">But it turned out that -- that’s where we went.</span> <span id="s381">And it must have been -- must have been what -- end of ‘44, beginning of fort -- no, it was in ‘45.</span> <span id="s382">It was already in ‘45, because I remember being there not a very long time, when we were liberated.</span> <span id="s383">And we’re liberated in May of ‘45.</span> <span id="s384">So we must have gone to that place in ‘45, I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: So you were there for a few months?</span> <span id="s386">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s389">I want to ask you about liberation.</span> <span id="s390">Can you tell me what you remember about that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Oh, that was a miserable day for me.</span> <span id="s392">It was awful.</span> <span id="s393">I got almost killed.</span> <span id="s394">The Russians came to town and apparently they had to fight very hard and they were very excited about everything.</span> <span id="s395">And their idea of survivors was a mistaken idea that whoever survived, must have cooperated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s396">And out of this assumption, they almost killed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: We talked.</span> <span id="s399">They talked to me, I talked to them and I talked again and again.</span> <span id="s400">The whole day went by talking.</span> <span id="s401">And for some reason, there were other soldiers that came in and talked to others and somehow we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Do you remember -- I’m curious how it happened, did -- did you see troops all of a sudden, did they walk up to the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yeah, yeah, oh yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Oh yes, the-they -- they went into the house.</span> <span id="s406">They were looking for things that they wanted.</span> <span id="s407">Food, drinks, watches, bicycles, anywh -- anything.</span> <span id="s408">And there was a bicycle upstairs in the attic.</span> <span id="s409">It must have been the bicycle of their daughter, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s410">But they went up and they found it and they took it.</span> <span id="s411">They wanted me to go upstairs and -- with them, but I was afraid, so I didn’t.</span> <span id="s412">And I just told them where the bicycle was.</span> <span id="s413">Now, those people had the store with foodstuff.</span> <span id="s414">There was sugar, there was flour.</span> <span id="s415">And I don’t know they took anything, they must have taken some edible things that you don’t have to cook, but they did take the bicycle and they were running around looking for things that they wanted.</span> <span id="s416">And at -- at the same time, they were talking about the survivors who were cooperating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s417">And I kind of tried to stay away, if I could.</span> <span id="s418">Then another group came in and they met and they talked and they talked to me and to the -- to the German couple.</span> <span id="s419">They really were looking for things, maybe they took something from them, their watches I suppose, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s420">And -- And they -- Then they went the next house.</span> <span id="s421">So it was a very, very tough day.</span> <span id="s422">At the evening, after I was all alone, I decided to go to Peppy.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: What happened to the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Oh, they stayed there, they were fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Oh, you said you were all alone, so the soldiers had left?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yeah, the soldiers were gone, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Okay, you mentioned you had been afraid to go upstairs with them.</span> <span id="s428">What were you -- What were you afraid of?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: My room was upstairs and there was a bed and things.</span> <span id="s430">And I didn’t want them to -- to go to my room with -- with me in it.</span> <span id="s431">So, I didn’t want to go upstairs.</span> <span id="s432">And they went and they got their bicycle or whatever else in the attic and there were others who -- wh -- when -- when this group was upstairs, others came in, because they were coming in -- the troops were coming in, pouring in.</span> <span id="s433">And they came and went and whoever got what.</span> <span id="s434">I suppose they wanted to be ahead of their friends to get more stuff, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s435">I was scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Did they mistreat you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: No, except that they talked to me like that.</span> <span id="s438">Not all of them, but many of them would say, “You’ll get yours.</span> <span id="s439">You cooperated with the Germans.”</span> <span id="s440">I never mentioned to anybody that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s441">I was still afraid.</span> <span id="s442">So, i-it was tough.</span> <span id="s443">It was very, very scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: And they left the couple alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s446">I suppose they left everybody alone after they took what they wanted and after they had a night’s sleep, when the fighting stopped.</span> <span id="s447">They seemed to be very excited, nervous, tired, hungry.</span> <span id="s448">They were the -- the front line soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: And it’s curious to me, they were essentially setting you free, but it do -- doesn’t sound like you viewed them as your ally at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Well, I did, in my head, I did.</span> <span id="s451">Because they -- they freed me from the Germans.</span> <span id="s452">So, I -- I felt very good towards them, but they put other thoughts -- they had other thoughts in their mind about people like myself, who survived.</span> <span id="s453">Maybe they were told that this is the -- the case.</span> <span id="s454">Maybe it was their own idea.</span> <span id="s455">I’m not talking about a whole regiment of soldiers, I’m talking about those who came my way.</span> <span id="s456">And those that came my way, some of them -- many of them had that idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: How did that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: It made me feel helpless.</span> <span id="s459">And not knowing what to do.</span> <span id="s460">What do I tell those people, no, you’re wrong?</span> <span id="s461">And all together, your -- you’re wrong assuming anything that you assume, because I’m not really the person that you think I am.</span> <span id="s462">Couldn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s463">I -- I was really upset and -- and helpless.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And you didn’t tell them you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Wh-Why didn’t you tell them that?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Because I learned by then that nobody likes Jews.</span> <span id="s468">And therefore it isn’t going to do me any good.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: So, even though they were the liberators, presumably they were not the enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: They were not the enemy.</span> <span id="s471">They were -- They were the liberators.</span> <span id="s472">I wish they could behave a little better than they did, but yes, I was glad to be liberated from the Germans, yeah.</span> <span id="s473">I heard later on different stories of different people who were treated very badly by the Russian liberators, but I have not experienced that and I have not seen that.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Treated badly how?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Oh, there are people who told me that they were mugged.</span> <span id="s476">That they were -- they were hit.</span> <span id="s477">I hadn’t seen anything like that.</span> <span id="s478">I -- I can tell you what I saw and I’m telling you what I heard, but I felt good to be liberated from the Germans and that was the main thing, but they scared me because of their thoughts of why I was spared.</span> <span id="s479">Because they were mistaken.</span> <span id="s480">I did not cooperate with Germans, besides, no German wanted my cooperation.</span> <span id="s481">I -- I just rode out the waves of the war and I was glad that the war is over and maybe some peace will come and -- and I -- even then I hoped that I could find some of my family.</span> <span id="s482">That was always, in my head.</span> <span id="s483">So, I -- I felt good about being liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: And you went to find your friend, how did you get to her house?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: I walked.</span> <span id="s486">I walked.</span> <span id="s487">At that time I would walk a couple -- a few miles.</span> <span id="s488">She was in a very small place a -- that -- ba -- at a farm.</span> <span id="s489">Th -- She was farmed out to the farmer from the camp.</span> <span id="s490">And it just so happened -- happened that in that farm where she was, I -- I came there to -- to be with her, because I was very much afraid.</span> <span id="s491">And then the Russians decided to be there to -- to take that farm as their headquarters in the area.</span> <span id="s492">So, i-it was -- it was an unexpected event.</span> <span id="s493">However, it was not bad because by that time when I went there, she represented herself as my mother.</span> <span id="s494">So I kind of felt protection.</span> <span id="s495">And indeed, I got a lot of protection because they knew that there is a mother and daughter, and that we were Polish.</span> <span id="s496">So, it went much easier.</span> <span id="s497">And those people who came there, the Russian military, not all of them had this idea that the survivors were cooperating.</span> <span id="s498">They set up their headquarters and they had Peppy work for them, interpret.</span> <span id="s499">And Peppy said to them that she will be very glad, but to announce that her daughter is here and she is not to be touched.</span> <span id="s500">And that’s exactly what happened, so I was protected.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: And how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: We stayed there not long.</span> <span id="s503">Maybe some -- Maybe two months.</span> <span id="s504">It was still not cold out when -- it was still summer, maybe deep summer, we set out to go to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Now, how did you decide to go to Berlin?</span> <span id="s506">Did Peppy decide?</span> <span id="s507">Did you talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Oh, we talked about it, sure.</span> <span id="s509">And by that time we knew that in Berlin there were armies of all the allies and we better get there as a first stop and then see if we could go back to our respective homes, to hope to meet our survivors -- our family who survived.</span> <span id="s510">But Berlin was the first stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: And how did you -- how did you get there?</span> <span id="s512">How far away were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: We were very far away.</span> <span id="s514">We had -- the farmer had a horse and the Russian found, in another farmer’s place, a little carriage, which they took.</span> <span id="s515">And what they did, they brought Peppy and me to the railroad station on that horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s516">And then we went on the -- on the train to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Tell me about Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Well, we came to Berlin and we wanted to s -- and we went to the Jewish -- society or Jewish headquarters or what do they call it here?</span> <span id="s519">The Jewish government kind of -- was in Oranyanboogerstrasser.</span> <span id="s520">The Yiddish Agaminda.</span> <span id="s521">And at that time, it -- there was some people there and it was not excellently organized, but pretty good.</span> <span id="s522">And there was -- there were some people coming and needing things and there were local people who manned that -- that -- what shall I call it, club, or the Jewish -- what do they call it?</span> <span id="s523">The Jewish government, if there is such a thing.</span> <span id="s524">Anyway, I was interviewed by one of the people there and when I told him that I was Jewish, he wouldn’t believe me.</span> <span id="s525">He thought that I told him I was Jewish so that I can get a package of food, or a place to stay from the UNRRA.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: United Nations Relief wor -- agency?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s528">Which at that time -- I found out later it was bringing a lot of help, blankets and clothes and food to Berlin for the DP’s, displaced persons.</span> <span id="s529">And this particular person that interviewed me was under the impression that I’m telling him I was Jewish so that I could get some of the goodies.</span> <span id="s530">Well, I had a problem convincing him.</span> <span id="s531">And he asked all kinds of question and then he asked me to recite the shmisered, the prayer.</span> <span id="s532">I didn’t know the whole thing, but I knew some of it.</span> <span id="s533">Although -- he asked me the names of my parents and I told him the Jewish name.</span> <span id="s534">I told him my Jewish name.</span> <span id="s535">I had to recite the schma, which I did a poor job, but I did some.</span> <span id="s536">And finally, reluctantly, he thought that I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: That’s a curious thing, isn’t it --</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: -- because you’d been having to deny that Jewishness --</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: -- for so long, and here was someone who didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s542">How -- How did that register for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Ver-Very awkward.</span> <span id="s544">Very awkward.</span> <span id="s545">I had the same comment you just did.</span> <span id="s546">I had to fight all this time to dispel from other people’s minds that I might be Jewish, and here I’m trying to tell him I am and he doesn’t believe me.</span> <span id="s547">Very awkward.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Where were you staying when you were in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: We found Peppy -- Peppy found actually, an apartment of a young, German lady with a baby.</span> <span id="s550">Her husband, I think was a -- a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s551">And she had an extra bedroom.</span> <span id="s552">So she rented us the bedroom for some food.</span> <span id="s553">I don’t think we paid her anything but food.</span> <span id="s554">Peppy made the arrangements, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s555">But she gave us that bedroom, which was very nice and finally we could sleep in a -- in a bed, in a house, rather than all kinds of other bad places.</span> <span id="s556">So that was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Do you remember that first night, when you actually had a bed in a safe place?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s559">It was very, very funny, w -- because the -- the apartment, th-the room, everything was very nice, but I thought, “Oh, I’m loo -- going to look around and see what it is like.”</span> <span id="s560">Well, I fell asleep like a log, did not enjoy anything else but sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And you stayed in Berlin about how long, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: I stayed in Berlin, let’s see, four, five, probably six to eight months, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: That’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Why don’t we take a break here, the tape’s running out.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Doris Greenberg.</span> <span id="s568">This is tape number two, side A. We’re still in Berlin.</span> <span id="s569">Tell me what the -- what the atmosphere was like at that time.</span> <span id="s570">Was it filled with people?</span> <span id="s571">Did it -- What did it seem like?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Well, the atmosphere was chaotic.</span> <span id="s573">There were a lot of foreigners, many people, many survivors came.</span> <span id="s574">They were military of all area -- al-allied groups.</span> <span id="s575">And people are trying to find things -- find other people, find their relatives, find a place to stay, acquire some clothes, acquire some food.</span> <span id="s576">It was quite chaotic, but the allies brought in a lot of help.</span> <span id="s577">There was one synagogue, I remember, and in that synagogue, they had brought in blankets and clothes and some food packages I think, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s578">And they were distributed to -- to people who needed them.</span> <span id="s579">The German people were -- also were quite depressed and they needed some help, too; they had no food.</span> <span id="s580">However, it was in a short period of time, there was -- a black market developed.</span> <span id="s581">I’ll never forget that, it was called Alexanderplatz and in -- in that place, you could probably trade for everything you needed.</span> <span id="s582">You could buy or sell or whatever.</span> <span id="s583">The German people would bring out their wares, maybe their clothes or their watches or whatever, to sell, to exchange for food.</span> <span id="s584">The survivors were -- were looking for everything that they couldn’t get from the Jewish agency.</span> <span id="s585">Oh, that’s the word I was looking, the Jewish agency, not government.</span> <span id="s586">So, it was a time of confusion and people, being very eager and looking for things and for people.</span> <span id="s587">Somehow, one tried to help the other.</span> <span id="s588">It was a very nice day and I can’t remember what kind of a Jewi-Jewish holiday it was, it’s very hard for me to tell.</span> <span id="s589">There was a Jewish holiday and Peppy invited the Jewish soldiers from the allied armies to come and celebrate the Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s590">And I remember they were Russians, they were Americans, British, French.</span> <span id="s591">I don’t think there were any Polish.</span> <span id="s592">And whatever Peppy cou-could get in the way of food, she would prepare and there were candles lit and this was -- this was a -- a thing that will always bring tears to my eyes, because this is the first time that people in different uniforms of different countries, sat at the table and recited the same prayer.</span> <span id="s593">Whatever food there was, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s594">Probably wasn’t much and probably some of it was that the allies brought in in cans or whatever.</span> <span id="s595">But the li -- the -- the candles were lit and all the different nations, who couldn’t speak to each other because of the language barrier, they could recite the same prayer.</span> <span id="s596">And that was something that I will always remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Did you -- Did you start going to synagogue regularly?</span> <span id="s598">Were there places to worship for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s600">I did not go to worship anyplace at that time.</span> <span id="s601">I just didn’t know where I was, what I was doing and I was planning to -- to look for my family, if anybody -- and -- and I figured that if anybody survived, they’ll go back home.</span> <span id="s602">So, I wanted to go to Warsaw and go to the house where we lived and see if anybody shows up.</span> <span id="s603">Or go to the Jewish agency and see if anybody registered.</span> <span id="s604">That was my first and only thought at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: And did you -- did you do that?</span> <span id="s606">Were you able to go to Warsaw?</span> <span id="s607">A: Well, I started.</span> <span id="s608">I was on my way in a train, from Berlin, to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s609">And in a town of Dresden, the train was held up by the Russians and all the foreigners were taken off.</span> <span id="s610">I don’t know if the Germans were taken off or not, but all the foreigners were taken off the train and hold into the jail.</span> <span id="s611">And the explanation given was, that the Russians are going to help us go home.</span> <span id="s612">Originally, I wasn’t worried, well if -- if the Russians are going to help me to go home, that would be fine.</span> <span id="s613">That’s where I was going anywhere.</span> <span id="s614">But, as we were put in the jail cells, there were some people from Ukraine.</span> <span id="s615">And they told me that you really don’t go home, they don’t send you home.</span> <span id="s616">They send you somewhere in Russia, wherever they want to.</span> <span id="s617">I was scared.</span> <span id="s618">I don’t want to go anywhere in Russia, I wanted to go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s619">And the mere fact that we were locked up and not let out, scared me again.</span> <span id="s620">So this -- this person that was there told me how to escape, and I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Well, you asked the guard to escort you to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s623">And the bathroom was on the entrance, on the street level, kind of.</span> <span id="s624">Just a few steps.</span> <span id="s625">So, he escorted me to the bathroom and he was walking up and down the hallway, huge hallway.</span> <span id="s626">So, I watched when he was very far away with the back to me, and I walked out and down the stairs and I -- very wide stairs.</span> <span id="s627">On each side there were policeman.</span> <span id="s628">Polish -- No, not a Pole -- German police and German soldier, I think.</span> <span id="s629">I remember the police, but there were two of them on each side.</span> <span id="s630">And when I walked out, I walked in the middle of the stairs, head high and very sure of myself.</span> <span id="s631">And nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s632">I -- I looked left and right, wherever I saw a corner of the -- of the street, closer.</span> <span id="s633">I think it was to the right.</span> <span id="s634">I turned right and I walked -- I kind of marched, until I hit the corner.</span> <span id="s635">When I went around the corner, I started running.</span> <span id="s636">And I ran very quickly.</span> <span id="s637">I went back to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s638">I had no money for a ticket, but it was -- I just went so quickly and I yelled something, I think in Russian or in Polish, when they wanted a ticket -- I didn’t give them.</span> <span id="s639">And -- and because I saw the train started moving and I hopped in the train.</span> <span id="s640">And the train took me back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s641">It was the only train I could see there.</span> <span id="s642">It lucky took me to Berlin, it could have taken me somewhere else.</span> <span id="s643">So I went back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s644">On the way, they stopped and they looked for people again, but then I was lucky.</span> <span id="s645">I -- When -- When I jumped in to the train and I saw there were some Russian officers sitting and they showed me that I could sit next to them, so I did.</span> <span id="s646">And that’s where my Russian language kind of -- although broken, but it was helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">And they started talking to me a-and I said, “I’m on my way.”</span> <span id="s648">They told me, “Are you going to Berlin, too?”</span> <span id="s649">So I said yes.</span> <span id="s650">I was glad to know it’s Berlin.</span> <span id="s651">And I told them yes, I was going to Berlin too, to see my relatives, who were there after the war.</span> <span id="s652">And we developed a nice conversation.</span> <span id="s653">And when the train stopped at night and the other Russian soldiers came to look for foreigners, this particular officer, who sat across this -- the bench from me, he said to the soldiers, “Go away, it’s middle of the night, we’re all sleepy.</span> <span id="s654">Go away.”</span> <span id="s655">I couldn’t be happier.</span> <span id="s656">And the soldier went away.</span> <span id="s657">So I could go back -- otherwise, I would be caught again and brought to jail again.</span> <span id="s658">And I didn’t know -- it -- it scared me, the fact that -- that they put us in jail before they send me away, that scared me.</span> <span id="s659">I would have been glad to go home, just because I was on my way.</span> <span id="s660">And -- And that’s why I -- I never went back to -- to Warsaw after the war.</span> <span id="s661">I came back to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: I’m curious about that, you mentioned about being back in jail.</span> <span id="s663">I’m wondering if, in the time that you were berl -- in Berlin, did you feel genuinely free?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: More or less, yes.</span> <span id="s665">I felt good because I was with Peppy and she -- she really took good care of me.</span> <span id="s666">It was not only name that -- that she was my mother, she -- she really tried her best to be my mother and she behaved like one.</span> <span id="s667">It was a -- a great feeling to have somebody watching over you.</span> <span id="s668">Oh, many times I gave her aggravation.</span> <span id="s669">Refused to do whatever she said, you know, but -- but it’s part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: So, on this train to Berlin, I’m figuring you were about 16?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: All by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: She let you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: And then you f -- How did you find her when you got back to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Well, we were in the same apartment in -- in that place where we had the room, a bedroom.</span> <span id="s680">And she was there, so I could go there.</span> <span id="s681">As a matter of fact, this officer, who sat across from me, he apologized aft -- to yell -- for yelling at the soldier.</span> <span id="s682">And I said, “That’s okay.”</span> <span id="s683">He was a gentleman and -- and I told him that I was going to Berlin and my mother is there and all that.</span> <span id="s684">And he wanted the address and I gave him.</span> <span id="s685">And he showed up.</span> <span id="s686">He showed up, he came in, he -- had a very nice reception, Peppy and I.</span> <span id="s687">He -- He had tea, or whatever there was.</span> <span id="s688">And we had a very nice visit and he apologized again for yelling at the soldier and he left.</span> <span id="s689">Wasn’t that nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: You had mentioned earlier that you were trying to find your family.</span> <span id="s691">Ha -- Did you try to do that in Berlin?</span> <span id="s692">How would you go about doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Well, in Berlin, there were several ways that ja -- that one could do it.</span> <span id="s694">The Jewish agency, they had registry.</span> <span id="s695">People that came in from other countries, they would register there that they are alive.</span> <span id="s696">There were also soldiers from different countries.</span> <span id="s697">Some of them took -- I asked them to put ads in the paper.</span> <span id="s698">There was the international Red Cross.</span> <span id="s699">I tried to -- to reach -- to find where they are.</span> <span id="s700">It wasn’t easy, because it was all chaotic and -- and it was all new established and some offices there were before, were not any more.</span> <span id="s701">But it was possible to find.</span> <span id="s702">And -- And I put in inquires everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Did you have any luck?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: None.</span> <span id="s705">There is one thing that -- one thing that came out of it is that after awhile the -- I asked a British person, who went home for vacation, to put in England an ad, because my father had a brother in England with family, for many years.</span> <span id="s706">So, they put an ad, and sure enough, I found my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Which uncle is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: My father’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Philip.</span> <span id="s711">And -- Philip Fox.</span> <span id="s712">And he -- his friend saw the ad in the paper and called him and within a little while -- there were some British soldiers in the area and my uncle knew their parents.</span> <span id="s713">And they wrote to them and they came to visit and I was in -- in the orphanage then.</span> <span id="s714">They came to visit, they said their parents wrote that here I was, to find out how I am and if I want to go to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: I want to get back to that in a second, but I’m still curious about one other thing in Berlin.</span> <span id="s716">Was it even anything as -- I imagine you would be walking down the street just looking at faces, trying to find familiar faces, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: All the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: I look at faces wherever I go, for 50 years or more, hoping to find a familiar face.</span> <span id="s720">I joined the [indecipherable] the Warsaw ghetto resistance organization in New York, because for awhile we lived in New York, in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s721">So I joined them, and every time there was a meeting, I would just go there and stare at faces.</span> <span id="s722">I didn’t find anybody.</span> <span id="s723">A friend of mine find -- found friends.</span> <span id="s724">The one that is a little older and she could remember better, or maybe her friends didn’t change as much.</span> <span id="s725">I didn’t find a soul that I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: What is that like when you’re looking at faces?</span> <span id="s727">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Very disappointing, and the question is here, look at me, don’t you know me?</span> <span id="s729">It’s not as if I am supposed to know you, because I am a child.</span> <span id="s730">It’s that you are supposed to recognize me.</span> <span id="s731">Without realizing that this is not possible, children change faster than adults.</span> <span id="s732">Didn’t realize that.</span> <span id="s733">Don’t -- Doesn’t anybody know me?</span> <span id="s734">Nobody knew me.</span> <span id="s735">Even if they did know my parents, they wouldn’t recognize me.</span> <span id="s736">I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s737">So this looking at faces, whenever you are at a Jewish gathering, is something that I do automatic, wherever I go.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Well, your next stop after Berlin, what was that and how -- how did you decide where you were going?</span> <span id="s739">How did that get figured out?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Well, to begin with, after -- after a little while, the -- Berlin was divided into zones, into different zones.</span> <span id="s741">And there was Russian, an American, a British, a French.</span> <span id="s742">And they started closing in.</span> <span id="s743">At that time, Peppy, who was very active in helping everybody and she got me involved in it, too.</span> <span id="s744">Like when -- when some survivors came in, she would say, here is the Jewish agency and here is their -- the synagogue and what -- she tried to -- to help a lot of people.</span> <span id="s745">She got me involved in it and -- and at one time, she said to me that she and some other people organized for a group of orphans to go to the British zone.</span> <span id="s746">But I -- I have to be in that orphanage.</span> <span id="s747">So she registered me in that orphanage in Berlin.</span> <span id="s748">And one day there was a British truck, covered truck.</span> <span id="s749">Came up, pick up the children from the orphanage, including me, and they drove us off to -- to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s750">And that’s how I got to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Did you know where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: And had you said goodbye to Peppy?</span> <span id="s754">Did -- What --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Peppy said that she will come as soon as she can.</span> <span id="s756">That she will come to the British so -- zone, as soon as she can.</span> <span id="s757">Becau -- She got involved in helping others so much that people came to depend on her and she didn’t want to let them down.</span> <span id="s758">So, she send me out and she knew where we’re going, because it was arranged.</span> <span id="s759">And then she said that as soon as she can, she will come to join me.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Did you know that you were going to a place that had been a camp, during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Well, we did not go to a place that was a camp, it was the same town, but the orphanage was in the barracks of -- in the former barracks of the soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Was not the camp.</span> <span id="s764">It was a building and it was in-indoors, it was in a nice area.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Like a -- a barracks, but built out of brick.</span> <span id="s767">I even have the pictures of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: And tell me about that time.</span> <span id="s769">How -- How did you feel about being there?</span> <span id="s770">What was it like?</span> <span id="s771">A: It felt like a temporary assignment, like a temporary thing, because it was in the back of my head still to go back to Warsaw to find relatives.</span> <span id="s772">I thought about that most of the time and it felt like this is a good stop, a place to stop and wait until the opportunity presents itself to travel to Warsaw, to find my relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: What -- How were you -- How were you treated?</span> <span id="s774">What were -- What were the conditions like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: I was treated as good as could be.</span> <span id="s776">Everybody had to eat -- needed things and people mainly were survivors there.</span> <span id="s777">Conditions were not that great, but they were the best they could be.</span> <span id="s778">They gave us some clothes, they gave us a place to sleep, food to eat and then -- th-th -- there was one nurse there, I -- I just went to visit with her in Ramatgan.</span> <span id="s779">She was just fantastic, she would care about all the children.</span> <span id="s780">She would act like a mother to everybody.</span> <span id="s781">And that’s where I met her.</span> <span id="s782">She apparently was liberated from the camp in Bergen-Belsen with a group of children and when they brought us from Berlin, we were just additional children.</span> <span id="s783">And it was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: What’s her name?</span> <span id="s785">Tell me about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Oh, her name is Hela.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Hela what?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: When I met her, her name was Hela Wash.</span> <span id="s789">Of course, now her name is Hela Yafare.</span> <span id="s790">She was -- She is a fantastic lady.</span> <span id="s791">She treated us well, she was -- ca -- she cared about all the children.</span> <span id="s792">Now, when I was in Ramatgan, and I came to visit with her.</span> <span id="s793">I came with my son and daughter-in-law and she was at home with her husband and she kept referring, whenever she talked to my son and daughter-in-law, she kept referring to me as her children.</span> <span id="s794">She would say, you know, another one of my children, such and such, called.</span> <span id="s795">And -- So we were her children.</span> <span id="s796">And it was great to see her.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Have you -- you’ve stayed in touch with her all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s800">Ha-Has -- Tell me about that, how have you -- how did you find her and how did you keep in touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Well, we -- we went to Israel and we were in, Kayata Navim and she came to Israel, she came to visit and the whole group just loved her.</span> <span id="s802">And for awhile she was there and then she moved to -- to Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s803">And we each visited her whenever we had a day off, or so.</span> <span id="s804">We would visit and she would visit and we -- we stayed in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: I’ll come back to the Israel chapter in a little bit, but I want to get you there first.</span> <span id="s806">How many -- Was it all girls at fir -- at the orphanage camp, was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Oh no, girls and boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Girls and boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: About how many, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: In the orphanage, I don’t know how many there were.</span> <span id="s812">But, when we went to Israel, out of that place, I know we were 80, a group of 80.</span> <span id="s813">We were divided into two groups and each one went to a different kibbutz, cause they had the reunion fo-for which I -- I got a tape of the reunion, I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s814">I was there in the previous reunion, but this reunion I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s815">And they made me -- for me a -- a tape, which I brought with me, I saw it.</span> <span id="s816">And she was there at the reunion, she’s there at every reunion.</span> <span id="s817">She’s just a fantastic lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Did you -- I don’t -- How long were you at Bergen-Belsen [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: We were at Bergen-Belsen just a couple of months -- a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: And we’re transferred to a -- ablankanasia, which is near Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: There was a -- an estate, I think the Varburg estate.</span> <span id="s824">And they have arranged for us to be there to -- to transform it into an orphanage and we were brought over there, so it was beautiful, it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s825">And from there, we were sent to Israel, via Marseilles.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s827">Now, in this time, when you were at these orphanages, did you -- did you have any kind of boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Not really boyfriend, but developed friendship with a few people, girls as well as boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s830">These people you’re still in touch with, besides the -- the nurse?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Some people, yes.</span> <span id="s832">One of them brought a book, and when I got there now to Israel, there was a copy of the book for me, with her writing because she couldn’t come to meet me, she was going out of town to a seminar.</span> <span id="s833">So -- and I was so sick, I read the book.</span> <span id="s834">I was surprised that I could still read Hebrew with -- without punctuation.</span> <span id="s835">I haven’t done it in a long time, but slowly it came back to me and I read her book about her life.</span> <span id="s836">Very interesting.</span> <span id="s837">And then I went to visit my room mate and she invited a few people from the same group, who came to visit and brought pictures.</span> <span id="s838">So, it was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Th-The children, or young adults -- you were, at this point, I guess 16 -- 15 -16, at the camp, did you tell each other about your experiences di -- during the war?</span> <span id="s840">Did people talk about it?</span> <span id="s841">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s842">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s843">The main thing was i-if -- when you made acquaintance with another survivor, the main questions was -- were, which camp did you go to?</span> <span id="s844">Which camp did you survive?</span> <span id="s845">If the camp was the same as that person, then they would compare notes to people they knew or the -- the bad guys or what -- what it was like in the camp.</span> <span id="s846">But, this is how people got acquainted, what camp were you in.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Did you see a lot -- any evidence of trauma, of people who were really scarred after the war emotionally or physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: We were all scarred.</span> <span id="s849">We were all scarred and I think that this is going to last a lifetime.</span> <span id="s850">I thought that I can always point out a person -- a survivor -- from any group of people.</span> <span id="s851">I can do that, I think.</span> <span id="s852">Because we have a scar.</span> <span id="s853">We have a certain way of behavior, a certain way of speaking or behaving that points to the fact that we’re survivors.</span> <span id="s854">That’s in my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: When we change sides, I want to ask you about that a little bit more.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Doris Greenberg.</span> <span id="s858">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s859">You were talking about being able to recognize survivors.</span> <span id="s860">Tell -- Tell me what you mean by that.</span> <span id="s861">What do you -- What do you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: I find that we survivors have a certain way of speaking, of behaving, that I don’t find among other people, who never went through the hell we did.</span> <span id="s863">That’s how it seems to me.</span> <span id="s864">We -- We can compare -- We can compare to each other, but we don’t have the good times that other people talk about.</span> <span id="s865">There’s some among us that block out the -- the happenings during the war, although it was just a few years, but it left a big scar on everybody.</span> <span id="s866">And even, it -- just like in the Jewish religion, whenever there is a holiday, there is an eeskar.</span> <span id="s867">That’s the prayer for the departed.</span> <span id="s868">I find that whenever we have even the greatest simcha, which is a celebration, we always remember the bad times.</span> <span id="s869">And I find it many times in people’s eyes, in their voices and behavior.</span> <span id="s870">I’m not trying to analyze, but it seems to me that I can recognize people who are survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Other kinds of survivors, as well?</span> <span id="s872">I mean, if you were to find someone who’d survived Cambodia, or Rwanda or any other sort of mass slaughter of people, do you think it would be the same, or is there something unique?</span> <span id="s873">A: Well, I can only speculate on that.</span> <span id="s874">My speculations would point out that yes, you can.</span> <span id="s875">Because people who have such past, where they suffered a lot, they usually behave in a milder way, I think.</span> <span id="s876">But that would be just speculation.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s878">I think where we left off, you were -- you had just left Bergen-Belsen, you were in the other camp in -- oh, I wanted to mention one more thing at Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s879">You had mentioned a woman, Haddassah Rosenzaft, who was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Tell me about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Well, Haddassah Rosenzaft, when I met her in Bergen-Belsen, her name was Haddassah Bimko.</span> <span id="s883">She is also a survivor -- was -- she passed away since.</span> <span id="s884">She was in the camp of Bergen-Belsen, and sister the -- we call her Sister Hela, the one I spoke about before, the nurse, sister.</span> <span id="s885">Everybody called her Shustra Hela.</span> <span id="s886">Polish, shustra means sister.</span> <span id="s887">She knew Dr. Bimko quite a lot from the camp and they were apparently saving a lot of children in Bergen-Belsen camp during the war.</span> <span id="s888">And Dr. Bimko was very helpful in securing things that the children needed.</span> <span id="s889">Hela was in -- in the orphanage all the time and also trying to help out.</span> <span id="s890">Dr. Bimko did not reside there, I don’t think so, but she was in different committees to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Do you have any strong memories of her, of things she did?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s893">I remember that she got married in the camp, to ros -- Mr. Rosen -- Mr. Rosenzaft.</span> <span id="s894">Was his name Joseph?</span> <span id="s895">I don’t remember -- Yosela, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s896">I can’t remember his first name.</span> <span id="s897">I used to -- to know it, because it went together in my mind, but something happened to my mind since then.</span> <span id="s898">She married Mr. Rosenzaft.</span> <span id="s899">And then I met their son.</span> <span id="s900">I think he was born in -- in Bergen-Belsen., Menachim Rosenzaft.</span> <span id="s901">Dr. Bimko, well Haddassah Rosenzaft, she traveled with me to Washington, to bring me to the Holocaust Museum, to do the tape.</span> <span id="s902">It’s -- Actually, she contacted me and she made all the arrangements for travel.</span> <span id="s903">And we flew together, there and back, so we could talk a little.</span> <span id="s904">And then we were in touch on the phone.</span> <span id="s905">And then, one day I went to visit Hela in Florida and she told me that Dr. Bim -- Dr. Haddassah Rosenzaft passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Had either of the two of them, over the years, mentioned Anne Frank?</span> <span id="s907">I’m wondering if they knew her at Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: No, no, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s909">I don’t think I knew that name at all.</span> <span id="s910">I think Anne Frank came from a different country, she went to different camp, that we -- the people from our area did not go to.</span> <span id="s911">So, I don’t remember hearing anything about Anne Frank.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s913">So you’ve now left Bergen-Belsen, you’ve gone to another orphanage in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: And then -- How is it -- Did you decide where you wanted to go?</span> <span id="s916">Did you know where you wanted to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Well, actually, the whole group was talking.</span> <span id="s918">We had some people from Israel come.</span> <span id="s919">We had even from the Jewish brigade, that joined the British army, they were stationed somewhere in Holland, I think.</span> <span id="s920">And they send us gifts for Hanukah, with letters.</span> <span id="s921">Each one wrote a letter to the kids and another roommate of mine got a letter in her package and she did not want to respond.</span> <span id="s922">She gave it to me and I responded.</span> <span id="s923">Developed great friendship with a young man.</span> <span id="s924">As a matter of fact, I visited him, too, and his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: In Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s927">First through the mails, and then, when I was in Israel and he was discharged from the for-forces, he came to visit, so we could meet in person.</span> <span id="s928">Also, some other members of the Jewish brigade came to teach us.</span> <span id="s929">They formed a school.</span> <span id="s930">They taught us English, math, whatever we could, whatever they could teach us and give us and do for us, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: That was -- It started in Bergen-Belsen, and it continued in -- in Blankanasa.</span> <span id="s933">And then later on, when we were in Israel, we stayed in touch with them.</span> <span id="s934">The tape I mentioned before, of the reunion, has one of them giving a terrific speech.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Couldn’t recognize him, because he’s all gray and when we went to visit Hela, she had copies of the same pictures that I had and I showed my son and daughter-in-law this -- this particular soldier -- he taught us I think, math.</span> <span id="s937">No, he did not teach us math.</span> <span id="s938">For math, there was a Mr. Kaplan, Shopdike Kaplan.</span> <span id="s939">He taught us math.</span> <span id="s940">This particular one, Alleeyahu Benyuhuda, I don’t remember was -- what he was teaching us, but there were classes and there was another one, Mr. Schwartz, Aria Schwartz, from the Jewish brigade.</span> <span id="s941">We kept in touch with them all these years.</span> <span id="s942">They came to reunions.</span> <span id="s943">And the reunions happened every five years now.</span> <span id="s944">I don’t know if there is another planned, because we’re getting old.</span> <span id="s945">We’re getting old.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Well, how -- how was it decided then, that you would go to Israel from the camps [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Well, since we were in a group, and we had all the influence of the Jewish brigade, we also had visits from Golda Meir.</span> <span id="s948">We had a visit from Ben -- Ben-Gurion, who came to talk to us.</span> <span id="s949">There was no doubt about it and no question about it, that that’s -- we’re going to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Tell me about those visits.</span> <span id="s951">Where was this and what -- tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Well, the visits happen in -- in Bergen-Belsen, and of course Ben-Gurion came to talk to us in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s953">He talked to all the survivors and of course, we were there to hear his speech.</span> <span id="s954">So, i-it -- it was very, very -- how to say -- it was ins-inspirational.</span> <span id="s955">And, after being treated so well, and taught -- we were taught the alphabet or Hebrew, there was no doubt about it, there were a few people who -- who didn’t -- there were maybe a few people who didn’t want to go or had found relatives, I don’t know, but the whole group -- it was decided for us and nobody objected.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Tell me more about that speech.</span> <span id="s957">Do you remember what he said, or how -- what -- what were you thinking when you -- did you know who he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: I didn’t, originally.</span> <span id="s959">Originally, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s960">And the speech was mainly about -- about Jews having a country.</span> <span id="s961">And that -- that we’re this -- he came to greet the survivors, invite us to build -- to build Palestine -- it was Palestine at that time, and it was mainly an invitation to come and help them build.</span> <span id="s962">This was before the state was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Do you remember what you were feeling when you heard this?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: I don’t remember, really, how I felt about it.</span> <span id="s965">I thought it was a good vibration, it was something that, oh yes, let’s go and do it.</span> <span id="s966">Something like that.</span> <span id="s967">Although, all the time, in the back of my head was to go to Warsaw and find family and then maybe go together with the family.</span> <span id="s968">I was not -- I was undecided, really.</span> <span id="s969">But it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s970">This -- There was freedom, there was enough food, there was what to wear and nobody chased me.</span> <span id="s971">And that was good enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Where did -- Did Golda Meir come to Bergen-Belsen as well?</span> <span id="s973">What was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Golda Meir came to Bergen-Belsen too, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Together?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: No, no, at different occasions.</span> <span id="s977">But I hadn’t heard her speech.</span> <span id="s978">Sometimes, when -- when things got a little organized, they were having -- they formed commissions and -- and different organizations and they had everything indoors, and it became not as outdoorsy as at the beginning.</span> <span id="s979">Maybe the weather also interfered, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s980">But later on, we could -- we knew that somebody was in town, but not necessarily -- we were not necessarily invited.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s982">But you did hear him?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s984">I heard -- he spoke in Yiddish, I could understand it, but this was not my language.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: But I could understand what -- the gist of it.</span> <span id="s987">Years later, I found out that I can speak Yiddish, too, which I never tried before, I never knew I could.</span> <span id="s988">But I could understand because my mother and grandmother, whenever they didn’t want me to understand something, that’s how they spoke.</span> <span id="s989">So, maybe that’s why I -- I could understand.</span> <span id="s990">Later on -- years, years later, I found out that I could speak it too.</span> <span id="s991">I tried and it went.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Were you concerned that you’re going to Palestine or Israel meant, in some sense, that you were giving up on finding your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s994">No, because you could find people wherever you are.</span> <span id="s995">You could write letters, you could teleph -- well, telephones were not that popular at that time, but you could always write and there were always people who traveled and they’re helpful.</span> <span id="s996">They want to help you.</span> <span id="s997">So, you could ask somebody to place an ad in the paper or I could write to Warsaw, whether I am in Israel or in Germany.</span> <span id="s998">So, no, I was not fearful.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1000">And how did you get to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Oh, we -- we got to Israel in a -- in a great big, old ship, by the name of Champalion, which afterwards sank.</span> <span id="s1002">Yeah, we went from Marseilles to Haifa and the ship was packed with people, there was no place to lie down or sit down, just to stand up, almost.</span> <span id="s1003">The trip was not very comfortable, but we were moving across the at -- the sea, the Mediterranean, towards Israel and we got there and the British put us in a camp again, in Atleet, there was a camp.</span> <span id="s1004">But we were in -- not too long there, and we were assigned our destination and we went to -- my group went to Kayata Navim, which is not far from Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Had you ever seen water like that before?</span> <span id="s1006">Had you ever been to the sea before?</span> <span id="s1007">A: I don’t think so, no.</span> <span id="s1008">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1009">I have hardly traveled -- when I was a child, I hardly traveled out of Warsaw, just for summertime.</span> <span id="s1010">My parents used to rent a place outside of town, which was reachable within an hour, so that my parents could come out for the weekend to be with us.</span> <span id="s1011">And that was the extent of travel I did before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Do you remember any impression once you were on the Mediterranean of seeing what you were seeing, or seeing Israel for the first time?</span> <span id="s1013">A: If I was lucky, I could see it, because there were so many people around, you can’t even see out.</span> <span id="s1014">Th-Th-The boat -- The ship was really full, because among us who -- who had legal papers, there were many more who were just smuggling through.</span> <span id="s1015">So that’s why the ship was so packed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1017">And there were how many of you together, the group that you were with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Well, we were 80 in our group from the -- from the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: And tell me about your impressions when you first arrived in Israel.</span> <span id="s1020">What do you remember?</span> <span id="s1021">A: I remember being in -- in Atleet, in the camp, the British camp and it was terribly hot.</span> <span id="s1022">Was very hot and I did not have a lot of clothes to wear, ex -- but I did have a little coat.</span> <span id="s1023">And it was too hot with the coat and I couldn’t take it off, because what I was wearing underneath was -- wasn’t good.</span> <span id="s1024">So I remember that, suffering from the heat.</span> <span id="s1025">But, as I said, we did not stay there long, because of the fact that we were children and we came legally, we were assigned our respective places quite quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: And do you remember what -- when this was that you came to Israel, what the date would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: I have -- I have a document there that tells the day -- with a picture, you should see that picture.</span> <span id="s1028">I think it was April, ‘46, if I’m not mistaken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: So you’re 16?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1032">And where were you sent?</span> <span id="s1033">What -- What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: We were -- We were sent to Kayata Navim, and there was a program that the Jewish agency had -- the program was deyuse aleeya.</span> <span id="s1035">And within that program, they send us to Kayata Navim, where we were supposed to work a half a day and study a half a day, and that’s what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Is this a kibbutz?</span> <span id="s1037">A: It’s really a kwootsa, but everybody called it a kibbutz, but it was kwootsa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1039">And what were your impressions?</span> <span id="s1040">Was it a -- did you like being there?</span> <span id="s1041">Was it hard work?</span> <span id="s1042">What -- Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: No, it was not hard work, and if it was, it was the -- the -- the feeling of doing something, accomplishing and -- and being proud of it, so whatever assignment we got, it was fine.</span> <span id="s1044">We were taught a -- a lot of stuff.</span> <span id="s1045">We were treated well, we were given clean rooms, with clean beds, with clothes to wear, with food to eat.</span> <span id="s1046">We were treated well, just -- some people talked to us Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1047">They assumed that everybody knows it.</span> <span id="s1048">And sometimes it was hard on me.</span> <span id="s1049">So, we had to study Hebrew quite quickly, to be able to communicate.</span> <span id="s1050">And we worked and we studied.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: What had happened to Peppy at this time?</span> <span id="s1052">Were you still in touch with her?</span> <span id="s1053">A: I was in touch -- She was in touch with me, actually.</span> <span id="s1054">She -- At that time, when I came to Israel, well, let me tell you what happened before.</span> <span id="s1055">In the train from Hanover -- from Hamburg to Marseilles, we were on the border of France, I think, when my roommate heard somebody calling out my name as the train was stopping.</span> <span id="s1056">And sure enough, it was Peppy.</span> <span id="s1057">Peppy was on that train and she was running alongside to -- to find where I was.</span> <span id="s1058">So, I saw her and she was traveling with some people from the UNRRA and from the Joint -- AJDC, American Joint Distribution Committee, and she was traveling with them to accompany the -- all the people who go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1059">And she told me that she’ll see me as soon as we are in Marseilles, which really did happen.</span> <span id="s1060">So she saw me off to the -- to the ship.</span> <span id="s1061">She also gave me a name and address of her husband’s nephew, who was supposed to live in Israel.</span> <span id="s1062">There was also a gentleman from America, who was in the armed forces, who accompanied our group on the ship.</span> <span id="s1063">And Peppy was going back to France, to Paris.</span> <span id="s1064">Apparently she -- she was involved in rescuing some children from different countries or from different places -- rescuing Jewish children.</span> <span id="s1065">And she was going back to France, to -- to Paris from Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1066">This gentleman, who was in the armed forces, the American one, David Eisenberg, a redhead -- I remember him so well.</span> <span id="s1067">He accompanied the -- the ship, with the children.</span> <span id="s1068">And we got to Israel and after we settled in Kayata Navim, he came to visit.</span> <span id="s1069">And I asked him to help me find my uncle.</span> <span id="s1070">I knew I had an uncle there, my mother’s brother.</span> <span id="s1071">And I asked him to help me to find Peppy’s husband’s nephew.</span> <span id="s1072">Well, he found the nephew very quickly.</span> <span id="s1073">I called him, told him where Peppy is and then I didn’t hear from him any more.</span> <span id="s1074">This David Eisenberg, he traveled with me to find my uncle.</span> <span id="s1075">And we traveled quite awhile, we traced him down, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1076">I remember that he lived somewhere in Rananna.</span> <span id="s1077">We went to Rananna, he wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1078">We went to the post office, we inquired, we asked.</span> <span id="s1079">Somebody walked in and knew -- and knew my uncle’s wife’s sister lived in Rananna.</span> <span id="s1080">We went there and they told us where my uncle was, in Haifa.</span> <span id="s1081">So David Eisenberg really helped me a lot, finding people.</span> <span id="s1082">Well, coming back to Peppy.</span> <span id="s1083">When I found the nephew and -- actually, David found the nephew and he was informed where Peppy was, apparently he got in touch with Peppy and told her that her husband is alive.</span> <span id="s1084">He was in Russia somewhere and he survived, and that he came back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1085">So Peppy went there to see him, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: So at this point you had found one uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: And did you stay in Israel?</span> <span id="s1089">What happened next?</span> <span id="s1090">A: Well, I stayed in kibbutz, yes.</span> <span id="s1091">I went to visit with my uncle and aunt and their two children.</span> <span id="s1092">One was jumping around in his playpen and the other one was outdoors, so they must have been like a year and a half, or -- and the other one, maybe six, seven.</span> <span id="s1093">Little kids.</span> <span id="s1094">I just saw the -- the one that was older, is a grandfather, yeah.</span> <span id="s1095">Anyway, that -- time flies unbelievably fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: How was that, to find that you had some family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Well, it was great.</span> <span id="s1098">And my uncle Aram, he spoke to me Yiddish, too.</span> <span id="s1099">And he likes to speak Yiddish or Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1100">He knew I don’t speak Hebrew, so he spoke to me Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1101">And I tried to do my best, so I replied, because I took some lessons in German and I could speak at that time, German.</span> <span id="s1102">And he laughed at me, that I don’t speak well Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1103">So I said, “Let’s speak Polish.”</span> <span id="s1104">He said, “Nah.”</span> <span id="s1105">And it was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s1106">And the second time I went to visit with him, which must have been a holiday, he told me that he got the letter from his sister, my aunt.</span> <span id="s1107">The one I hid under the -- the window in -- in that room with her little boy.</span> <span id="s1108">That she survived and her husband was in Russia and she found him, too, cause he returned to Poland with the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1109">And that they were hoping to find their son, the little boy.</span> <span id="s1110">Which they found.</span> <span id="s1111">So that’s what I learned from my Uncle Aram.</span> <span id="s1112">And sure enough, I wrote to them that I am around.</span> <span id="s1113">That letter that my Uncle Aram received, stated that my aunt thought that maybe I am alive, because she saw me -- so -- she saw me in -- must have been September ‘44, was the last day I saw her and she thought maybe I was still alive.</span> <span id="s1114">So, I wrote her and it was -- it was quite a -- quite a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Did -- Y-You were in Israel in -- during the War of Independence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Were you involved with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Well, from -- from the time that we arrived there, we were studying, we were working and we were also involved in military exercise.</span> <span id="s1121">It started as a gymnastics, as a field trips and it turned into throwing stones and then throwing grenades and then a little rifle -- target, and little MG 34’s, shooting and stuff.</span> <span id="s1122">We were involved in exercise, war -- war exercise, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1123">They taught us about it.</span> <span id="s1124">I don’t remember how often it was, but quite often.</span> <span id="s1125">Boys and girls.</span> <span id="s1126">And when the war started, we were -- we were involved in doing all the services that everybody else did.</span> <span id="s1127">And then there was the pamah that came and they were -- they were even having uniforms and stuff.</span> <span id="s1128">And our group --</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Oops.</span> <span id="s1130">Hold up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Doris Greenberg.</span> <span id="s1133">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1134">You were talking about the War of Independence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1136">Well, when the pamah came in, they had the command an-and things and actually, we were supposed to do whatever we were assigned to and some of our boys were assigned to join an-and go to a -- how do you call that?</span> <span id="s1137">The positions that were prepared -- and the girls, too.</span> <span id="s1138">So, we were actually kind of mobilized to -- to be -- to help with the pamah.</span> <span id="s1139">And I know that some of the elders from the kibbutz were also in charge.</span> <span id="s1140">So, there must have been cooperation of forces, and we were involved in that.</span> <span id="s1141">They needed a lot of help.</span> <span id="s1142">It was -- It was a very bad area where the war was concerned, near Jerusalem and th-the location of our kibbutz was very vulnerable.</span> <span id="s1143">Well, we participated in -- in that war and we were assigned different duties.</span> <span id="s1144">I remember I w -- I tried to help out as a nurse, and when they brought the -- a wounded soldier and I was supposed to wash his head -- he was wounded in the head -- I was supposed to wash off from the blood, so that he can be treated, and -- and I kind of blacked out.</span> <span id="s1145">I think that was the -- the end of my nursing career, very short-lived nursing career.</span> <span id="s1146">And I was assigned then to communications.</span> <span id="s1147">That lasted.</span> <span id="s1148">So I was involved in communications.</span> <span id="s1149">We also went on patrols, night patrols, day patrols and whatever needed to be done, we did participate.</span> <span id="s1150">However, I understand that we were not sent out of the area.</span> <span id="s1151">We were only in that area, because I remembered when a different group of pamah came in.</span> <span id="s1152">One group moved and one group came in.</span> <span id="s1153">But we were on the left, where we were.</span> <span id="s1154">So we’re actually under their orders when they were there, but would -- we were in the -- in Kayata Navim for the defense of the place.</span> <span id="s1155">So we lasted there quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1156">And you know the outcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: How do you think your -- your past experience as a Holocaust survivor affected how you viewed that war?</span> <span id="s1158">Did that -- Did the two come into connection at some point in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Sometimes, but not very often.</span> <span id="s1160">Don’t forget that at this age, you don’t think much about comparing things.</span> <span id="s1161">But sometimes a thought came to mind, like why doesn’t anybody like us?</span> <span id="s1162">What is it that we have done to the world?</span> <span id="s1163">The Germans don’t like us.</span> <span id="s1164">The Arabs don’ t like us.</span> <span id="s1165">I was not a good politician, I never was, I never will be.</span> <span id="s1166">I just see things from the point of view of -- of being human, being a person.</span> <span id="s1167">So my concern sometimes was, why don’t they like us?</span> <span id="s1168">What have we done to be so disliked?</span> <span id="s1169">And I couldn’t figure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: How -- Tell me about how you met your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1172">Well, I -- I went to visit my uncle, eventually, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Which uncle is this?</span> <span id="s1174">A: My Uncle Philip in London, in England.</span> <span id="s1175">I went to visit and I stayed there for about a year or so, came back -- I came back to Israel and I stayed with my Aunt Esther -- the one that survived -- her husband Shalom and their little boy, Yakov.</span> <span id="s1176">I stayed with them in Ako and there was their cousin -- my Uncle Shalom’s cousin, I think and his wife, who had the little place also in Ako, but it was not in the town, it was kind of out of town, where the government built places to live.</span> <span id="s1177">Actually it was like a barrack or some, but it -- it was -- people have a little room, kitchen, share a toilet with a next door neighbor, and a shower.</span> <span id="s1178">These cousins, they lived there and we used to see each other once a week or so.</span> <span id="s1179">At one time, I had a little dispute with my aunt and uncle and decided to leave, and of course, where did I go, I went to the cousins.</span> <span id="s1180">They invited me to stay.</span> <span id="s1181">So I went there and those cousin -- in the same place where they lived, lived my husband, and they introduced us.</span> <span id="s1182">So, we met, we went out a few times and I don’t know, we -- we -- we were dating for about two years before we were married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: And you were married in what year?</span> <span id="s1184">A: 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: ‘52.</span> <span id="s1186">Did you talk with him about your experiences during the war, as a survivor?</span> <span id="s1187">Was he also a survivor, or was h -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: No.</span> <span id="s1189">He had a good time.</span> <span id="s1190">He -- He lived in China, in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1191">And anytime -- if I met -- if I met a friend who was a survivor or I talked to my friend as a survivor, he just couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1192">Say, “Oh, what a terrible thing, what a -- we knew about it, but much later,” he says.</span> <span id="s1193">And I said, “What have you done during that time?”</span> <span id="s1194">He says, “I had a good time.</span> <span id="s1195">Went to cabaret, nightclub, theater, lived it up.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: So, he couldn’t understand really, what you’d been through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: This I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1198">This I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: But he had different past.</span> <span id="s1201">His childhood and youth were different from mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Was it -- When you got to know each other, was it a problem that you had had such a different recent past?</span> <span id="s1203">A: It was not a problem for me, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1204">As a matter of fact, I thought it would -- it was very nice to listen to good stuff.</span> <span id="s1205">It was not as depressing as to listen to the bad stuff, so it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: So you married in ‘52 and at some point you came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1207">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Well, my husband’s parents came to the United States from -- from China and they also had a daughter in the United States, my husband’s sister.</span> <span id="s1209">And they wanted to have both children near them.</span> <span id="s1210">I asked my husband to write them and invite them to come to Israel, but a letter came back in which they said, “If we come here, we still have one child somewhere else.”</span> <span id="s1211">So we decided to go.</span> <span id="s1212">At that time, the parents wrote to -- to him about coming to America and -- and settling down and having his parents nearby and -- and I thought that if my parents lived anywhere, I would go there.</span> <span id="s1213">And, of course, I wanted to be good, enjoy parents.</span> <span id="s1214">So we wen -- we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: And when did you come -- when did you come and where did you enter?</span> <span id="s1216">Do you remember what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: W-We came here, I think it was November of ‘55.</span> <span id="s1218">November of ‘55 and we went to my in-laws house.</span> <span id="s1219">They had a pretty large apartment in Manhattan, on 79th Street.</span> <span id="s1220">And they gave us a bedroom with a bath and it was very, very beautiful, very beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Did you come on a boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: No, we flew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: You flew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Do you remember what your -- what your feelings were about coming to America, leaving Israel, coming this far?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: I really didn’t feel great about it, no.</span> <span id="s1227">I wanted to stay in Israel.</span> <span id="s1228">The family I had, whatever it was, it was family, friends, and I thought I wanted to stay in Israel.</span> <span id="s1229">But I also thought that, as I said, if I had parents in Siberia, I would try and get there.</span> <span id="s1230">So -- So we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: And you had one son at this point, with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1233">He was born there.</span> <span id="s1234">He was about a year and a half, or a year and three months, that -- when -- when we took him in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Did -- Did your husband or you begin working in New York, did you stay in New York?</span> <span id="s1236">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Oh, we -- we came in -- we came -- end of November.</span> <span id="s1238">In December I had a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Assistant -- Assistant to the bookkeeper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Of what -- of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: There was a factor -- an office, Dunmore.</span> <span id="s1243">This was an office of a manufacturer of boy’s wear.</span> <span id="s1244">And th-they had a bookkeeper who was actually an office manager.</span> <span id="s1245">She -- The books -- She had -- She -- A lot of people that worked there and did the payroll and stuff.</span> <span id="s1246">So, I was her assistant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: And your husband?</span> <span id="s1248">A: He -- He tried to get all kinds of jobs as a salesman.</span> <span id="s1249">Actually, he used to deal in furs, in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1250">He’s -- He tried to get into the fur business here, but he found it impossible, almost.</span> <span id="s1251">So, he tried other jobs, a salesman, he sold eyeglasses for awhile.</span> <span id="s1252">He also -- He also went -- in order to get som -- to earn some money, he went to the funeral parlors to be a night watchman.</span> <span id="s1253">Slowly, he developed all kinds of theories and tried all kinds of things to make a better living.</span> <span id="s1254">I was working all the time.</span> <span id="s1255">I was lucky that my mother-in-law took care of the baby.</span> <span id="s1256">I could leave the baby at home and go to work.</span> <span id="s1257">And that was pretty -- a great help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: And you had a second child.</span> <span id="s1259">How -- When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: He was born in 1959, in Mount Sinai Hospital, in New York.</span> <span id="s1261">And by that time, we moved out from my in-law’s place and we had an apartment on Riverside Drive.</span> <span id="s1262">And my Hank, my bigger boy, went to -- well, he started with the nursery, then he went to school, went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s1263">And when -- when my younger son was born, Sid, Hank was five, so he was going -- he was going at that time, I think, to the nursery school.</span> <span id="s1264">And I took some time off from work and then later on, hired a babysitter so I could go back to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: During this time when you were here in New York, did you talk about your war experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Did you seek out any other survivors?</span> <span id="s1268">A: No, did not talk about it, did not seek out anybody.</span> <span id="s1269">I was quite busy with work and family.</span> <span id="s1270">The only thing that I did do, was, soon as I heard from this organization, Bugrow, I joined them in hope of -- of finding somebody that I know or that kn-knew my people.</span> <span id="s1271">So I used to go with my husband to their meetings.</span> <span id="s1272">But that was about the only thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: And he would go with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1275">Very sociable fellow, likes company.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1277">As your children got older, enough to understand the war, did you talk to them about what you had gone through?</span> <span id="s1278">Were they curious about it?</span> <span id="s1279">A: Yes, my older son, he gave me an assignment to write my memoirs, of which I wrote five pages.</span> <span id="s1280">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s1281">He would -- is very curious.</span> <span id="s1282">Always asks questions.</span> <span id="s1283">Even when we went now to visit my old friends, he wanted to know more, and his wife, too.</span> <span id="s1284">She’s a journalist, so i-it was for her also something probably interesting to hear.</span> <span id="s1285">The younger son, he would ask a question or two.</span> <span id="s1286">I think that -- that he was not up to it yet.</span> <span id="s1287">There -- There has to be a time in one’s life when one becomes to -- becomes -- comes to a point where he needs other information -- more information or where he wants to know different things.</span> <span id="s1288">It is -- probably happens to everybody.</span> <span id="s1289">He would ask some questions, but he was not as persistent.</span> <span id="s1290">My Hank tells me quite often and he’s persistent -- maybe also different character, different types of people.</span> <span id="s1291">He could have wanted me to do that, but did not want to press on me.</span> <span id="s1292">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: And with your husband, was he curious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Not in particular, no.</span> <span id="s1295">I think that he -- he was satisfied with what he knew and what he read and what he heard from other people, and from me sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: I’m wondering how he reacted to that.</span> <span id="s1297">I mean, did you feel like you had enough chance to talk about it, or did you feel you didn’t need to talk about it so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Well, I wasn’t looking for chances to talk.</span> <span id="s1299">As matter of fact -- and right after the war, for quite a few years, I couldn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1300">I remember when I was in England and my aunt and uncle wanted to talk, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1301">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s1302">It took quite some time to be able to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1303">It -- The whole thing, it was such a humiliating experience, to be chased, to be -- to be at the target of somebody who wants to kill you because why?</span> <span id="s1304">And the way we were treated by the Germans, it was so humiliating.</span> <span id="s1305">This wa -- This was probably what they wanted to do, so that we can forget that we’re human beings.</span> <span id="s1306">It was very humiliating.</span> <span id="s1307">It was very tough to -- to reverse that, to say well, it is not what anybody else thinks, we are people, we have feelings, we’re -- if -- we’re not better, but just as good at least, as anybody else.</span> <span id="s1308">Took a long time to -- to get back to what I call, to normal.</span> <span id="s1309">Maybe that’s the reason that I can recognize survivors.</span> <span id="s1310">There is something that tells us, oh, we’re all right.</span> <span id="s1311">We’re okay.</span> <span id="s1312">We’re not what the Nazis told -- told the world that we are.</span> <span id="s1313">We’re a people and some of us are -- are really nice.</span> <span id="s1314">And then, when you think about it and you read about it, we have given the world quite a few good things.</span> <span id="s1315">So, I don’t think anybody should hate us, but that’s my opinion.</span> <span id="s1316">That’s my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Do you think your experience as a survivor, especially the notion that you had to hide who you were for so long, affected how you raised your kids, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Yes, I think it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: I raised my kids to like everybody, to begin with, and treat everybody very, very well.</span> <span id="s1321">And -- And they ask, “No matter what?”</span> <span id="s1322">Well, it’s not no matter what.</span> <span id="s1323">If they don’t treat you well, you can find out why or you can not communicate with these people any more.</span> <span id="s1324">But you, as my child, your approach should be to everybody, treat them the same and treat them well.</span> <span id="s1325">I think I did the right thing by telling them that.</span> <span id="s1326">I even look back and I see -- you saw now my friend that came in to -- to -- to do the air conditioning [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s1327">This person, I don’t think I have anything in common with that person, and yet, he’s my friend.</span> <span id="s1328">I have quite a few friends with whom I have nothing in common, not in the past and not in the present.</span> <span id="s1329">But I met them and they’re nice people and I like them and they like me and we’re friends.</span> <span id="s1330">I find this to be the right thing for me.</span> <span id="s1331">It always -- It is sa-said, you have to choose your friends.</span> <span id="s1332">That’s true.</span> <span id="s1333">You don’t become close friends with just anybody, but you -- there is a difference between friends and -- and -- and acquaintances.</span> <span id="s1334">Your acquaintances can be very friendly and if you treat them the same and they treat you, that’s what I find.</span> <span id="s1335">I have a lot of -- not a lot, some different -- some -- different friends who -- with whom I have nothing in common, and yet we’re friendly.</span> <span id="s1336">And we see each other and we discuss things.</span> <span id="s1337">I’m glad to learn their point of view and hear what they have to say.</span> <span id="s1338">And I have nothing but the best wishes for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: I’m curious too, since you lost your parents when you were so young, you were, I guess, 12.</span> <span id="s1340">You didn’t know what it was like to be an adult with parents.</span> <span id="s1341">I wonder if that affected your parenting and the way you’ve raised your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: I can’t tell that.</span> <span id="s1343">I think you have to ask my son.</span> <span id="s1344">But, very often, when I hear or read about people who have difficulties communicating with their mothers, usually mothers and daughters have problems.</span> <span id="s1345">I can’t understand that.</span> <span id="s1346">I simply cannot understand that and I cannot see why that would happen.</span> <span id="s1347">Well, maybe there is a reason, but I don’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Why is that, do you think?</span> <span id="s1349">The -- The -- That that’s your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: I really don’t know, but if I were to speculate, I would think that maybe the both parties want to -- to impose their views on the other party, whether it’s mothers and daughters or vice versa.</span> <span id="s1351">I find it possible to express my views to my son and not impose on it.</span> <span id="s1352">He should know my views.</span> <span id="s1353">If I wouldn’t tell him, it wouldn’t be fair.</span> <span id="s1354">He should know his mother just like I would like to know him.</span> <span id="s1355">He would know my views, but I don’t impose.</span> <span id="s1356">Maybe those people try to impose those views, one upon the other.</span> <span id="s1357">I don’t know, but that’s how I would speculate it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: You mentioned that you -- I believe you had gone back to Warsaw for the 50th anniversary, tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1360">My son Hank -- that was the same year that the museum was opened and I received and invitation as one of the, I don’t know, not founders, but people who gave their -- their life stories or whatever and I was supposed to go to Washington, DC for that opening.</span> <span id="s1361">But my son suggested that since the whole thing is happening in Warsaw, we should go there, so we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: This was -- What was it exactly that was going on?</span> <span id="s1363">A: It was the 50th anniversary of the ghetto Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1364">And, I still have an uncle in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1365">I saw him, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: So tell me about that, you went with your son and anyone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: No, just with my son.</span> <span id="s1368">We booked a one week tour of the -- of the camps and the important places during the co -- Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1369">So we were driven by bus and we had a ga -- a tour guide and we visited the camps and this was for one week.</span> <span id="s1370">And the second week, we spend two days with my uncle and then we went back to Kraków to look around ourselves for things that we didn’t have a chance to -- to see enough or we wanted to revisit.</span> <span id="s1371">And we saw a lot of stuff.</span> <span id="s1372">We also, one day, went back -- he wanted to know where I was born and where I lived and my side of the family, because some years back, he went to China to see where his father grew up.</span> <span id="s1373">So this time he wanted to see about me, so we went, we took some pictures in front of the house and we walked around, we saw where it was and then we went -- I explained to him a few things that I remembered.</span> <span id="s1374">He was very impressed.</span> <span id="s1375">My uncle took us to an Israeli restaurant in Warsaw, which was -- by which I was very impressed.</span> <span id="s1376">And I recalled a few things that happened and where it happened.</span> <span id="s1377">I think my son was very impressed wi-with -- with things that he heard about and now he saw, but he was -- he was so upset when we went to the camps.</span> <span id="s1378">Couldn’t -- Couldn’t tear him away from looking at those shoes and those glasses and -- and things he -- he was -- he was really upset.</span> <span id="s1379">And then we had some experience with the modern anti-Semitic behavior.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Let me just [indecipherable] tape for a second.</span> <span id="s1381">Actually no, I think we’re okay.</span> <span id="s1382">Wh-Wh-What experience was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Well, there were still signs on some buildings and especially in the -- in the -- where the train goes, on the sides, there were walls and there were still signs there that said, ‘Out with the Jews’.</span> <span id="s1384">You know, derogatory statements for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1385">There -- There are still people who speak badly about us, and when I’d experienced that a little bit.</span> <span id="s1386">So, on the other hand, they cook very delicious food, very rich and delicious food and they have some nice things.</span> <span id="s1387">But the ghetto Warsaw is non-existent.</span> <span id="s1388">And when we tried to see -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Doris Greenberg.</span> <span id="s1390">This it tape number three, side B.</span> <span id="s1391">How -- How did you respond when you saw that graffiti, that -- in the place where you had grown up and seen so much pain?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: Well, I had -- I had no one to respond to.</span> <span id="s1393">I just felt that it’s insulting, it still exists and it’s bad.</span> <span id="s1394">And nowadays we hear even more about it, of what is going on in Russia and in other countries.</span> <span id="s1395">It’s very upsetting and I cannot respond to that.</span> <span id="s1396">I wish it was nonexistent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: And it was upsetting for your son, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Very much, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Did you go back to Ravensbrück, was that one of the camps that you visited?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: No.</span> <span id="s1403">We went to Majdanek, to Treblinka, to Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Was it an emotional thing for you to be back in Warsaw, to be back?</span> <span id="s1405">A: It was.</span> <span id="s1406">It was emotional f-for s-several reasons.</span> <span id="s1407">To begin with, it’s the place that you thought you know.</span> <span id="s1408">And all of a sudden, I find that I couldn’t recognize everything.</span> <span id="s1409">Mainly the things that were rebuilt and of course, they could have been rebuilt a little differently.</span> <span id="s1410">But, also, I couldn’t recognize -- I thought there was a street somewhere and then you go there, no, that there was no street, there is just a block.</span> <span id="s1411">In other words, the memory plays a little trick.</span> <span id="s1412">And I was upset about that.</span> <span id="s1413">On the other hand, there were some things that I remembered and I told my son, “When we’ll go around the corner, we’ll see steps mai --” At that time they were made of stone, I think.</span> <span id="s1414">But they go all the way down to the -- to the river.</span> <span id="s1415">And he looks at me, we take a walk.</span> <span id="s1416">Just around the corner, here are the steps, only they are made of wood and they are much nicer now.</span> <span id="s1417">So, it brought back -- it brought back my -- my self confidence.</span> <span id="s1418">We had -- he -- his birthday was while we were there, so we went to a very fancy restaurant and we were much impressed with -- with the restaurant and with the food they served and with the service they had.</span> <span id="s1419">So that was one nice thing about it.</span> <span id="s1420">But, when we went to another place, we found some -- some anti-Semitism exists, yeah.</span> <span id="s1421">Which was not that great, and I wish it would go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Is that also something you’ve confronted here in the United States, ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: I did not confront it here as openly as in Europe, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1425">And when you confronted it there, it was in the graffiti that you saw or was there anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: There was graffiti, there was also -- some expressions exist that people use.</span> <span id="s1427">I know that there are some expressions in America, too, but I didn’t hear them -- I didn’t hear them being used.</span> <span id="s1428">Over there, I s -- I heard them being used a lot and it seems to be kind of degrading.</span> <span id="s1429">Why don’t they get rid of those expressions?</span> <span id="s1430">There -- There are very few Jews now in Poland, very few, and mainly they are old and they are there because they have no place to go.</span> <span id="s1431">I wonder why the people are so angry with us.</span> <span id="s1432">There are no Jews there for 50 years.</span> <span id="s1433">What could we do -- what we could have done to make those people still angry with us?</span> <span id="s1434">A-And they are still using some expressions, they probably inherited them.</span> <span id="s1435">Maybe they -- I don’t know if they stop to think, but they should.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: I want to ask you finally just to -- if you wa -- can give me some sense of how your experience during the war has shaped your life now.</span> <span id="s1437">What do you think the most long lasting effect of that has been?</span> <span id="s1438">A: I think that -- that I have become a milder person, a more understanding person of others.</span> <span id="s1439">And if somebody is persecuted or singled out, for anything for the bad, I -- I really feel for them and I wish it would go away.</span> <span id="s1440">Of course, when I say singled out, I don’t mean people who are lawless.</span> <span id="s1441">I’m talking about the political things that are happening.</span> <span id="s1442">For politics people get killed and mistreated.</span> <span id="s1443">I simply wish it would go away, because it -- it isn’t worth it.</span> <span id="s1444">Life is so short and when you treat people nice, you treat everybody nice and everybody treats you nice, isn’t that a world we want to live in?</span> <span id="s1445">To help one another, rather than to fight.</span> <span id="s1446">I see no good reason to -- to have any wars.</span> <span id="s1447">I may be very, very stupid, I see no reasons for it, or -- we’re talking now about -- about preparing weapons of mass destruction.</span> <span id="s1448">That is awful.</span> <span id="s1449">Who needs that?</span> <span id="s1450">And sometimes I think that having gone through what I have, I wish I could live in a world that is peaceful and the same for my children, my son and daughter-in-law, their families.</span> <span id="s1451">For my friends, I wish we had peace, we -- everybody would really benefit from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Are there particular events, political events that have happened over the last 50 years, that have really triggered a response for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: I cannot very well answer this, because I am very -- a very poor politician.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Or -- Not necessarily political, but historical events, and -- you know, there have been any number of things.</span> <span id="s1455">The Civil Rights movement, the Women’s movement, the McCarthy era.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: I think the McCarthy era was before my time here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: Women’s movement, in my mind -- in my mind, women should get paid the same if they do the same work as men.</span> <span id="s1459">Women should get jobs that they are good for, just like men should get jobs that they are good for.</span> <span id="s1460">I don’t think that they should be chosen on the basis of their sex, but because of what they can do on a job.</span> <span id="s1461">That’s what they should do.</span> <span id="s1462">But, I also believe that women are different from men.</span> <span id="s1463">So, some of those movements that you mention, don’t fall into any category.</span> <span id="s1464">I would pull out -- some points out of it and say, where work is concerned, it goes by ability, who is able to do what.</span> <span id="s1465">Should be doing th-that thing and get paid the same.</span> <span id="s1466">When it comes to personal lives, women are different from men, period, no matter what.</span> <span id="s1467">And as -- as such, we have to behave as such and we shouldn’t change our behavior.</span> <span id="s1468">I don’t like to see boys walking around in dresses or -- or -- or -- or girls wearing man’s suits.</span> <span id="s1469">We are -- I feel that in private life, in personal life, men are men and women are women, should act as such and behave as such.</span> <span id="s1470">That does not mean that it’s a woman’s job to cook the supper.</span> <span id="s1471">If he is a better cook, he should do it.</span> <span id="s1472">If he comes home earlier from work, he should do it.</span> <span id="s1473">It is sharing, it is -- it is equality in where it counts.</span> <span id="s1474">But we’re -- we’re not the same, we’re much different.</span> <span id="s1475">And as they say, vive la différence.</span> <span id="s1476">I believe in that.</span> <span id="s1477">But I’d like to get paid as much as a man if I do the work that a man does.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Great.</span> <span id="s1479">I think we can stop there.</span> <span id="s1480">I want to just give you a chance, if there was something else you wanted to add, that I didn’t get to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: I don’t know of what I wanted to add, because I didn’t plan on what you’re going to ask.</span> <span id="s1482">I’ll be glad to answer any questions if you have any.</span> <span id="s1483">If I can, I will answer, be truthful.</span> <span id="s1484">But I really don’t know what you would like to hear.</span> <span id="s1485">To encapsulate 50 years in two or three hours, is very hard.</span> <span id="s1486">And I’m sure that when you leave, I will probably think, oh why didn’t I say so and so or such and such or explain this event or that.</span> <span id="s1487">It’s very hard, but it might happen.</span> <span id="s1488">So, I’m glad that I could answer some of what you asked and if you have any more questions, I’ll be glad to -- to supply my answers, however poorly they may sound.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: It was terrific.</span> <span id="s1490">Thank you,
