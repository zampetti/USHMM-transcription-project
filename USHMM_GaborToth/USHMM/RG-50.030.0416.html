camp, it was a half a mile is -- is like bones, is frozen.</span> <span id="s674">I never sneezed.</span> <span id="s675">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s676">You become sometimes, you know, so s-strong that you wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s677">Many people just came a -- and once -- once a Russian --</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: -- a Russian prisoner of war, he was in this camp too, he escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: With the civilians.</span> <span id="s682">So they were -- they -- they -- they -- they were looking for him and counted us again and again and again.</span> <span id="s683">I was thinking a -- in this cold place, in [indecipherable] they call them appelleplatz

I didn’t got enemies, it is very important.</span> <span id="s696">I -- I go -- I -- I afraid we gonna miss a very important parts.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: This is a very important part.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: We are still in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- in the concen -- in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s699">Then remind me how did I escape, how did

id="s703">Q: But this, what you’re talking about now, I think, is also very important, how somebody survives.</span> <span id="s704">It’s -- also depends on how others react to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Yeah, but beca -- well, for example, was a -- was there a Pan Traibush.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: I w-want to come to him later.</span> <span id="s708">He -- every day he brewed for himself, he was about 60 year old man, he breweded him two pieces of bread with -- with schmaltz.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: With

<p><span id="s713">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Every single day for months.</span> <span id="s715">And he’s a second one like Dr. Orlich who saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: So he was the second Dr. Orlich for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s718">And I didn’t forgot when I c -- escaped and I c -- was going home, I made five [indecipherable] five extra miles to meet this, and tell him [indecipherable] and kiss his hand.</span> <span id="s719">And he said, Andrei, here is a bread, he said, got how much you want.</span> <span id="s720">I said, I ashame, I can’t eat all this bread.</span> <span id="s721">You give me better a b -- you give me a bi-bigger piece than I ha -- I will take it.</span> <span id="s722">And he got me -- he gived me the -- the bread to eat, and I got more bread with -- from another resources and I went to the concentration camp, and I left with him and I told him thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: This Pan Traibush, was he a prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: No, he was a civilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: He was a civilian, he was a Polish civilian?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: A Polish civilian, Pan -- Pan -- Pan Traibush.</span> <span id="s727">He got a big family.</span> <span id="s728">I was in his home when returning home.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: So what was his job in the -- in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: He -- he -- he was a coal miner, a real coal miner.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: He was a real coal miner.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: So in a way can you say -- i-is it what you’re saying is that he kept you alive by giving you that piece of bread all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s737">And when I was coming back, a German prisoner of war, 17 year old guy like me, he see it -- he was in the same camp and I was, but they divided the camp in two.</span> <span id="s738">In one, I was -- I was going for the first one, certain people was sick and they didn’t go with us for the march when [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s739">I want to know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s740">They survived, nobody touch them.</span> <span id="s741">And -- and -- and -- and the Germans lo -- run away and they were alive.</span> <span id="s742">And th-the other [indecipherable] the other half, they were German prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s743">And to the fence came a German 17 year old boy like me and he -- he gave his hand, he s -- ask me for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s744">I break it and I give it to him.</span> <span id="s745">And people was telling me, some people, that you’re crazy, he just killed [indecipherable] your people and -- and [indecipherable] not he.</span> <span id="s746">He didn’t kill.</span> <span id="s747">I don’t know what he did, you don’t know what he did.</span> <span id="s748">You can’t s -- you can’t say what he did or how long, you don’t see it.</span> <span id="s749">I survived with help of Germans, Polish people and others, so it was my due to make him survive.</span> <span id="s750">I -- I didn’t know that he is a murder or something.</span> <span id="s751">Was a kid, who was drafted to the army.</span> <span id="s752">He couldn’t say Hitler, no I’m not going, he would shoot him.</span> <span id="s753">You can’t judge -- you know, you got people like that, you got people -- you know, you cannot unify people, th -- ba -- or go by -- by nationality or by religious.</span> <span id="s754">That’s not the right way to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: I want to ask you something that’s a little harder to ask.</span> <span id="s756">You -- you’re mentioning people who helped --</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: -- and who helped you survive and how you helped somebody else survive.</span> <span id="s759">Did you also experience people who betrayed you?</span> <span id="s760">Did you, either in Uszhorod before 1944, or afterwards when you were in the camps, did you also see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: No -- no adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: No adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: A -- children I -- I -- I -- I -- I didn’t blame because children are children, th-they don’t know what -- you know, no adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: No adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: No.</span> <span id="s767">Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: [indecipherable] happen, not

Jew.</span> <span id="s772">I was maybe 12 year old.</span> <span id="s773">I took a couple of stones and I threw it on him who was attacking a-and I knew it he won’t catch me, he was trying to, but I was -- know I-I-I’m faster.</span> <span id="s774">And this o -- that -- that time this Jew escaped.</span> <span id="s775">I bring down -- that’s the way I could bring down, you know.</span> <span
