<span id="s3">Do you like Steffi or Stephanie?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">SS: Steffi.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">EA: Steffi.</span> <span id="s6">Steffi also came from Germany to England on the Kindertransport, and hopefully we will find out something about your experiences, Steffi.</span> <span id="s7">How old were you when you left Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">SS: Eleven...the day after I arrived.</span> <span id="s9">In other words, I was ten, and I had my eleventh birthday on the day...after we arrived in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">EA: So you didn't have your eleventh birthday any more with your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">SS: No, it was two days later, in the new country.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">EA: Oh my.</span> <span id="s13">Did you celebrate before?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">SS: No, I don't think there was much celebration.</span> <span id="s15">It was a week, as far as I re member, of...sadness.</span> <span id="s16">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s17">EA: You already knew, when did you know that you would be leaving?</span> <span id="s18">How long in advance?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">SS: About a year, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">EA: A whole year?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">SS: Approximately, but I..</span> <span id="s22">.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">EA: Let's start a little earlier on.</span> <span id="s24">I, we'll come...</span></p> <p><span id="s25">SS: I can't vouch for that exactly, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">EA: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s27">Steffi, you were not the only child in your family, am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">SS: No, we're two sisters, and my sister is nearly two years younger than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">EA: Is it indiscreet to ask what year?</span> <span id="s30">You don't have to say exactly the age, just what year you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">SS: In 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">EA: 1928, so, and then you lived with your parents, and your siblings, your two sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">SS: No, only one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">EA: Oh, there were two of you, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s35">SS: Two of us, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">EA: You, and only one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">SS: Only one sister.</span> <span id="s38">And there were never any other brothers or sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">EA: Did you have other relatives living near you?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">SS: My grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">EA: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">SS: My grandmother, who was at that time in her 70's.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">EA: That's mother's mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">SS: Mother's mother, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">EA: And where...were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">SS: I was born in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">EA: And were both your parents born in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">SS: My mother was born in Berlin, but my father was born in Niederschlesien [Lower Silesia], in Sagan.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">EA: So but, they were both...</span></p> <p><span id="s50">SS: Which is now Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">EA: And would you say that you remember a happy childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">SS: Extremely happy, and harmonious, and warm, and lovely, and...wise, as far as my parents were concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">EA: In what way do you think they were wise?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">SS: Let's say wise in their rearing of children, I would say.</span> <span id="s55">There was a very, very well balanced and firm relationship between them, between my parents...and, which lasted to the end, right up to the end when my father was very ill.</span> <span id="s56">And, when I say wise, I think no favoritism between the two of us, and a very good...we...were educated in a, let's say, I can't express it exactly, maybe we had a very good foundation, in every respect, up to the time we left.</span> <span id="s57">A very good foundation as far as human living is concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">EA: Were...</span></p> <p><span id="s59">SS: We weren't a wealthy family.</span> <span id="s60">My parents were not wealthy, but comfortably off.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">EA: What did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">SS: Well, at the time when we left Germany, of course, he had been thrown out of his...job.</span> <span id="s63">He was thrown out of his job in 1933 when, the year Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s64">He was the Director of the, of a big international advertisement, advertising agency called ALA, Allgemeine Annoncen Expedition.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">EA: And he was thrown out in '33 already?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">SS: He was thrown out initially when the first dismissals came about.</span> <span id="s67">And...he also acted as Vice Council for Brazil...there in Berlin, but this was before Hitler came to power, in the '20s, before I was born, for a few years, as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">EA: Did he serve in the First World War, in the German Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">SS: No, not at, I think he was, he did something in a journalistic capacity, as far as I know.</span> <span id="s70">But...not active service, because he had bad eyesight.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">EA: Tell me, would you describe your home as religious?</span> <span id="s72">See, were you Conservative, or Orthodox, or what was your direction in Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">SS: Reform.</span> <span id="s74">Reformgemeinde.</span> <span id="s75">There again, it's a disparity between my parents.</span> <span id="s76">My father came from a traditional but very tolerant home background.</span> <span id="s77">And he...grew up with general observance.</span> <span id="s78">Whereas my mother, from an ultra assimilistic [assimilated] background, where I think they knew nothing about Judaism, the brothers, I believe, were not even circumcised.</span> <span id="s79">And all they knew approximately, I think, that they didn't go to school on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s80">And, they knew vaguely that they were Jewish, but no...emphasis was put on it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">EA: What do you recall, if anything, of course you were very young, about the Nazi regime in Berlin, as a child?</span> <span id="s82">What do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">SS: I recall very little.</span> <span id="s84">Strongly the marching up and down in the street of the S.A.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">EA: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">SS: Anxious.</span> <span id="s87">Anxious.</span> <span id="s88">I recall the Stürmer caricatures in the, which were put up in different places, caricatures of Jews, which of course I didn't go up to read.</span> <span id="s89">But I mean they existed.</span> <span id="s90">In the latter period I remember that we couldn't go to the cinema or couldn't go to the theater and couldn't sit on park benches.</span> <span id="s91">But I think most of all, I remember my parents in the early years telling us, "Du musst vorsichtig sein, was Du auf der strasse sagst!"</span></p> <p><span id="s92">EA: "You have to be careful what you say in the streets."</span></p> <p><span id="s93">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s94">You have to, oh, you want it all in English, eh?</span> <span id="s95">And we...</span></p> <p><span id="s96">EA: No, no, that's quite all right.</span> <span id="s97">That's quite all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">SS: O.K.</span> <span id="s99">What you say in the street, and of course in the early years, that, you ought to strike that out, that doesn't make sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">EA: What doesn't make sense?</span> <span id="s101">Everything makes sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">SS: Everything makes sense.</span> <span id="s103">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">EA: You're not writing a book.</span> <span id="s105">We are just talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">SS: O.K. Well, of course, I went straight away to a Jewish school, and didn't attend another school.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">EA: So you were born in '28.</span> <span id="s108">So you were five in '33 already.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">EA: So you went to...</span></p> <p><span id="s111">SS: So I went straight...</span></p> <p><span id="s112">EA: Straight to a Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s113">SS: To a Jewish school, which was, of course, a sheltered environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">EA: Right.</span> <span id="s115">Was it an Orthodox school?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">SS: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">EA: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">SS: The...elementary school I attended for four years, I believe, from the age of 6 to 8.</span> <span id="s119">It was run by two...ladies—it was a Familienschule—who were converted to Christianity but remained, but all the Jews and half-Jews in the neighborhood attended.</span> <span id="s120">In other words, it was a, the...half Jews, Mischlinge, attended there.</span> <span id="s121">We [?]</span> <span id="s122">were taught the New Testament, and we were taught only the Old Testament.</span> <span id="s123">But it was...a school run in an extremely, in a wonderful way, I would say.</span> <span id="s124">They were ideal teachers, the two of them, and humanitarians.</span> <span id="s125">And we were a mixed bag of...assimilated Jews, can’t say observing Jews, but not Orthodox, and half and half.</span> <span id="s126">I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s127">EA: But not fully Aryans.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">SS: Children from...mixed marriages.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">EA: But not total Aryans.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">SS: No Aryans at all.</span> <span id="s131">Only the mixed, children of mixed marriages.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">EA: O.K. And that remained open up to...</span></p> <p><span id="s133">SS: It remained open but I think it closed quite soon because they escaped to Sweden, the two...teachers who, owners of the school, I mean...Schulleiterinen, escaped to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">EA: So you had...</span></p> <p><span id="s135">SS: But that, I didn't stay there till the end, because I moved to a Jewish high school after, I think, after the age of 8, which was one of the largest Jewish high schools in Berlin—Goldschmidtschule, where I could, if times hadn't been, stayed normal, taken the Abitur... The English matriculation certificate.</span> <span id="s136">And that's what some of the older girls managed to do, the ones who were already in the higher...forms.</span> <span id="s137">Before emigration they took the matriculation.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">EA: Irrespective of their age?</span> <span id="s139">Because eight years in high, if you're eight years old and you went to high school, that's very early.</span> <span id="s140">You must have done the...</span></p> <p><span id="s141">SS: Well I'm...</span></p> <p><span id="s142">EA: You must have been a smart kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">SS: No, it wasn't that I'm smart.</span> <span id="s144">I know, because I only had two years of high school before emigration.</span> <span id="s145">And if I emigrated at 11, practically 11, 10, 9, or maybe 9 of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">EA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">SS: But they, it was probably intermediate and high together, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s148">EA: Right, right.</span> <span id="s149">But you feel you had a good basic education?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">SS: Very good, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s151">But I, then there was this...break in England when I again missed quite a lot, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">EA: Yeah.</span> <span id="s153">What do you remember about your parents talking about any possible emigration, and staying in Germany, or not staying in Germany?</span> <span id="s154">Do you remember anything at all in that...area?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">SS: Well, one must take into account that my father was suffering from Parkinson's disease, for several years, and I think it started more or less in 1934.</span> <span id="s156">And he gradually deteriorated.</span> <span id="s157">And although we were not told, I think this was the main reason that we didn't all get out of the country together, with my parents and the two of us.</span> <span id="s158">Because many, many years later, after the war, I..</span> <span id="s159">.</span> <span id="s160">was told that there were visas to South America for all of us, and, yet, because of my father's illness, he couldn't have used them.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">EA: He would not have been admitted to South America?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">SS: No, no, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s163">EA: Because of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">SS: To any country for that matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">EA: Because of this disease.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">SS: And, my mother, of course, didn't want to leave him.</span> <span id="s167">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">EA: Oh, what a dilemma.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">SS: So, that was the decision they came to, to send my sister and I, and myself, with the Children's Transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">EA: How do you, how did they prepare you for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">SS: I think it came very quickly.</span> <span id="s172">I may make a mistake that I knew a year ahead, but I really can't quite honestly remember now.</span> <span id="s173">But it was quite soon after my parents read about this advertisement of an English Jewish doctor who wanted to guarantee for twelve children.</span> <span id="s174">And consequently they contacted the person who was dealing with it in Berlin.</span> <span id="s175">And then the ball started rolling.</span> <span id="s176">And so, I think, about a year before, or some months before, I remember my mother saying to us, "Was denkt ihr, wollt ihr vielleicht nach England gehen?</span> <span id="s177">."</span> <span id="s178">[What do you think, would you maybe like to go to England?]</span> <span id="s179">And that's how it started.</span> <span id="s180">But it came all very quickly, so that the events tumbled one on top of the other more or less.</span> <span id="s181">So, I think we were given to understand that they would follow us, even my father.</span> <span id="s182">That's what they gave us to understand and to believe.</span> <span id="s183">“Wir kommen nach.”</span> <span id="s184">["We are coming after."]</span></p> <p><span id="s185">EA: So, what month are we talking about that you actually left?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">SS: In March the, I left, we left Berlin on the 15th of March, 1939, and arrived in England on the 16th of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">EA: So you were in Berlin at the Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s189">I was in Berlin for the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s190">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s191">EA: Do you have any recollection at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">SS: I think that...yes, I have very sort of vivid recollections, sitting in a class in the Goldschmidtschule.</span> <span id="s193">I think we were approximately thirty children in the class, boys and girls.</span> <span id="s194">And suddenly most of the children said their fathers had been arrested.</span> <span id="s195">And then we suddenly heard that the synagogues had burned.</span> <span id="s196">And how, somehow this was a sudden, this was a, like a general calamisis [must mean ‘calamity’] I would say.</span> <span id="s197">And I never went to see...our synagogue an der Prinzregentenstrasse.</span> <span id="s198">I never, I didn't go to see it after it had been burned down.</span> <span id="s199">And I think that was, and then things happened...very quickly.</span> <span id="s200">And as far as I remember, we had one meeting of all the children who were coming as a group, to try and get to know each other, the twelve of us, but only eleven because one came from some wheres in the Harz mountains or somewhere, from a different part of Germany.</span> <span id="s201">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s202">EA: So you did meet the other students...</span></p> <p><span id="s203">SS: But only once.</span> <span id="s204">Only once.</span> <span id="s205">So, we, I think we only got to know each other better on, when we got to England afterwards, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">EA: Have you any idea how you were selected?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">SS: Only very, very, very vaguely, or generally.</span> <span id="s208">I think Dr. Schlesinger, who was...the guarantor, was looking for...Jewish children from educated homes, let's say aca-, not exactly academic, but how, good Jewish homes with education, and the one very strong factor was where it wasn't sure that the parents would be able to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">EA: Did they have any specifications as to what religiosity they would belong to?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">SS: None at all.</span> <span id="s211">None at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">EA: So that wasn't a discriminating...</span></p> <p><span id="s213">SS: That wasn't a factor.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">EA: So they just had to...</span></p> <p><span id="s215">SS: That wasn't a factor at all.</span> <span id="s216">The Schlesingers themselves were very, very assimilated Jews.</span> <span id="s217">Very conscious, but very assimilated into English society.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">EA: Did your parents know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">SS: No.</span> <span id="s220">No.</span> <span id="s221">They didn't know them at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">EA: They just...</span></p> <p><span id="s223">SS: They were in England...</span></p> <p><span id="s224">EA: Yeah, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s225">SS: And they never came to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">EA: They just read the ad?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">SS: They had an inter-, they had a mediator in Germany to select the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">EA: Ah ha, there was a mediator.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s230">And that was Frau Kaufmann.</span> <span id="s231">I don't know if she's still alive.</span> <span id="s232">And I don't remember her first name.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">EA: Do you know if any monies were exchanged at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">SS: No.</span> <span id="s235">As far as I know, no money at all.</span> <span id="s236">But there had to have been an ausstattung.</span> <span id="s237">[equipment] Our parents bought a great deal of chinaware to contribute to the hostel, and...I remember very strongly that they were all colored, Bakelite plates and cups and saucers.</span> <span id="s238">And, of course, the linen, bed linen and clothing, up to the age of 16.</span> <span id="s239">That we all had with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">EA: How, you, how, I mean, you obviously couldn't carry it.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">SS: No, that... Was sent by a lift.</span> <span id="s242">That was sent separately afterwards.</span> <span id="s243">But each parent...</span></p> <p><span id="s244">EA: And in...</span></p> <p><span id="s245">SS: Had to provide that.</span> <span id="s246">Yeah, in other words, the parents provided for their children... As far as clothing and bedding and everything, household goods are concerned, up to the age, for several years, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">EA: So as late as February, '39, lifts could be sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">SS: Even later, I believe, yes.</span> <span id="s249">But not all of them arrived, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">EA: Did your lift come?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">SS: Ours arrived.</span> <span id="s252">All the lifts of the children arrived, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">EA: And what was the address to the, I mean there was a definite address, the Schlesingers' address, do you remember where it was sent to?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">SS: No, it was sent I believe to the hostel, where we were...already in the hostel.</span> <span id="s255">And that was in Shepherd's Hill in Highgate.</span> <span id="s256">I mean we didn't live with the Schlesingers.</span> <span id="s257">The Schlesingers had their, lived by themselves with their big family and they opened a hostel for, just for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">EA: For twelve children.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">SS: For the twelve children.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">EA: For the twelve children, more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">SS: With a Jewish staff, all from Germany themselves.</span> <span id="s262">And one was the cook, and one was looking after the girls, and one was looking after the boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">EA: And they lived nearby, the Schlesingers?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">SS: Not exactly.</span> <span id="s265">They lived in London, but it wasn't so close by.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">EA: They didn't supervise the living...</span></p> <p><span id="s267">SS: No, no, they didn't supervise, but they took a very, they had us visiting, and they paid visits themselves, and they took us to the beach.</span> <span id="s268">And they, but, on the whole, they passed over the care, the day to day care to these, to the staff there.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">EA: Do you think they were refugees themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">SS: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s271">EA: They were all...</span></p> <p><span id="s272">SS: I don't think, they were all refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">EA: They were all refugees.</span> <span id="s274">Young?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">SS: Well, they were young at that time.</span> <span id="s276">I mean, they were, I suppose, about 18 or 20, something like that, maybe a bit more.</span> <span id="s277">And they were all trained in the Liegnitz, how would you call, Internat for care...of...children, child care.</span> <span id="s278">They all passed a child care course, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">EA: So they did have some training.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">SS: They had training in Germany, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">EA: Well, this is interesting, because a lot of the hostels were run by youngsters who really weren't much older than the children themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">SS: No, they were, these were quite a lot older than we were.</span> <span id="s283">Maybe they were in their early 20's, somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">EA: Do you remember the journey at all?</span> <span id="s285">Is that very painful?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">SS: It's not painful now.</span> <span id="s287">I can re-, I remember it very well, and I can talk about it, the most painful and sad, it's more than sad, heartbreaking part is, of course, the leaving home and going to the Bahnhof Zoo [train station zoo] where we met all the others.</span> <span id="s288">And as far as I remember, my mother took us there.</span> <span id="s289">My father, the last...memory I have of him is, although he was bed ridden, he got up, and he blessed my sister and myself.</span> <span id="s290">And...that was that.</span> <span id="s291">And then how we got to Bahnhof Zoo, whether it was in a taxi or not, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s292">I just remember that we all, we were all assembled there, together with hundreds and hundreds of children who, of course, we didn't know, because they all were going on the Children's Transport.</span> <span id="s293">And then the last I know of my mother—Shall I go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">EA: Yes, indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">SS: My mother waving while the train, and I think my mother even raced, or some how, from one...railway station to the other.</span> <span id="s296">I have forgotten what the other railway station was called.</span> <span id="s297">One was Bahnhof Zoo and the other one was another railway station, to catch a last glimpse of us.</span> <span id="s298">That was, of course, the hardest part, except for what happened in the years to come.</span> <span id="s299">Maybe, I suddenly remembered,...a few odd little things before our leaving.</span> <span id="s300">I remember very strongly the collections the Gestapo made, or the police made, of all the valuables in the...house, like the candles, the silver candlesticks, all the silver and all the jewel-, whatever jewelry there was, although, of course, I as a child didn't see it.</span> <span id="s301">And, but all the...household valuables, stands and everything, whatever we had to...give up.</span> <span id="s302">That was all standing in the...salon, in the, I think in the dining room on the floor, before we left.</span> <span id="s303">So that was a bit depressing, too.</span> <span id="s304">But that's, no, we didn't pay much attention to that.</span> <span id="s305">There are so many things I remember as far as the general, going back a bit.</span> <span id="s306">This is not exactly with the day I left, but going back before, the last two or three years, what the general atmosphere in...Berlin, the sort of congestion, if one can put it that way.</span> <span id="s307">We all felt that, we felt a need to...run away, a need to get...away.</span> <span id="s308">And it, but events happened so quickly that we weren't really get, given much of a chance to think.</span> <span id="s309">I think my sister even remembers much less, because she was younger, and many things were kept from her.</span> <span id="s310">But I, talking personally, I knew very well what was happening.</span> <span id="s311">We didn't, all we knew, we didn't know, of course, what happened in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s312">We didn't even, all we knew that the stet-, the fathers were being arrested.</span> <span id="s313">Not my, our father, because he was an invalid.</span> <span id="s314">At that time they didn't arrest him.</span> <span id="s315">But the other fathers were sent to camps.</span> <span id="s316">But we weren't, we didn't know what was hap-, what exactly was happening there.</span> <span id="s317">But this was still in 1938, before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s318">And some of them were released quite...quickly after that.</span> <span id="s319">We knew that there was persecution and...discrimination going back for years, and that we were hampered from our, from...various pursuits, and that we...had to give up our valuables, and that we had to... And we also knew very well that we could only escape the country with about five marks in our pocket, with not any more or less.</span> <span id="s320">And coming back, going back to the journey to England, to the...escape from Germany, we were all somehow numbed, I would say.</span> <span id="s321">Some were crying.</span> <span id="s322">Some were just numbed, some, many of the children.</span> <span id="s323">And we passed through...we somehow, through all the German territory, passed through it without hardly saying a word.</span> <span id="s324">I must add here that maybe some did say things, but after all there were hundreds of children...in the railway carriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">EA: Was it night time?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">SS: It was, in the beginning it was...day time.</span> <span id="s327">And then we got to the Dutch border.</span> <span id="s328">And the last, at last, the last German official examined us and our baggage.</span> <span id="s329">And suddenly we passed the border into Holland.</span> <span id="s330">And I'll never forget the change and the difference, and suddenly the feeling of release.</span> <span id="s331">We suddenly saw a whole lot of women, Dutch women, standing at the platform, with grins, with smiles, with food.</span> <span id="s332">It was like going from darkness into light.</span> <span id="s333">And, it's one of those things which I will never forget in my life.</span> <span id="s334">I don't think we stayed there very long.</span> <span id="s335">We passed through the...stations pretty quickly.</span> <span id="s336">But suddenly we felt we could breathe.</span> <span id="s337">I might add here we, that my sister and I waited for my uncle, who about a few months earlier had escaped to...Amsterdam to join his fiancée .</span> <span id="s338">But he was completely illegally in...Holland and somehow couldn't get to the train.</span> <span id="s339">Somehow he was...hampered to get to the train.</span> <span id="s340">And so then we got to...the Hook van Holland, and the journey to England went, was by night.</span> <span id="s341">And all I remember from that was that I got to know the other girl who, from the twelve, who didn't come from Berlin, Vera Thayer who is now...Ellis and lives in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s342">And somehow, and then we got to Liverpool Station the next day, on the 16th of March, and were met by Mrs. Schle-, Dr. and Mrs. Schlesinger, with two cars, and brought to the hostel.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">EA: You, of course, didn't know the Schlesingers.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">SS: No, we didn't know the Schlesingers.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">EA: Did you know, get to know the other eleven children, or were you all lumped together?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">SS: Where, do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">EA: You said there were hundreds of children at the...</span></p> <p><span id="s348">SS: Ah, no, no, we got to know each other.</span> <span id="s349">[chuckles] We were, that, I think, on the boat we more or less were a group.</span> <span id="s350">But I can't guarantee it.</span> <span id="s351">Now it may have only been after...we reached London.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">EA: This lady you mentioned, Mrs. Kaufmann, do you think she was accompanying you on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">SS: No, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s354">I think she st-, I don't think so, no, but there were many social workers accompanying the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">EA: Do you remember any faces.</span> <span id="s356">Do you remember any importance.</span> <span id="s357">Did they interact with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">SS: No, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s359">No, I don't remember that at all, from, as far as the Germans are concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">EA: You don't re-, you just remember the children and the silence and no adults present, particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">SS: Not in particular, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">EA: Nothing that stands out in your mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">SS: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">EA: It must have felt very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s365">Was it eased by the fact that your sister was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">SS: Not necessarily.</span> <span id="s367">I think maybe she was eased that I was with her.</span> <span id="s368">I think it was more a case of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">EA: Did you feel responsible for her?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">SS: Yes, very much.</span> <span id="s371">And that carried on like up to, for another several years, as a matter of fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">EA: Did your parents sort of say to you, "Now, Steffi, take care of your sister?"</span></p> <p><span id="s373">SS: I think they did.</span> <span id="s374">They said it in few words somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">EA: That's quite a responsibility, isn't it, for an eleven-year-old.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">SS: Yes, but I think there were in our group some older children who also felt that responsibility towards the younger children.</span> <span id="s377">And, the positive side of it is that as soon as we got to the hostel, and we were all together, that we were there as a family, as a substitute family.</span> <span id="s378">And so, right up to the time of the outbreak of war, when we were evacuated, we were like a family unit, a rather large family unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">EA: Boys and girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">SS: Boys and, five boys and seven girls, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">EA: What ages, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">SS: At what time, or, I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s383">EA: No, where were, all right, you were eleven, your sister was nine.</span> <span id="s384">Were the others...</span></p> <p><span id="s385">SS: Yes, I think most of were, the eldest one was...fifteen, I believe, and the others were more or less all the same age.</span> <span id="s386">My, I think the youngest one was perhaps only...eight.</span> <span id="s387">So it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s388">EA: So they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s389">SS: The youngest one was eight, but most of them were...around about eleven and twelve, I would say.</span> <span id="s390">We all were approximately the same age, but I think there were one or two, I think the, Walter Blütek was at that time fifteen, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">EA: And, were there other siblings other than the two of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">SS: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">EA: Just the two of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">SS: We were the only ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">EA: The others were all single children.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">SS: All single children, or they had...brothers or sisters who sometimes...who came out later with the parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">EA: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">SS: One or two cases like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">EA: Are you still in touch with any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">SS: I'm in touch with some of them, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">EA: Really.</span> <span id="s402">After so many, fifty year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">SS: Oh, I'm in touch with one or two, and they are in touch with others and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">EA: Tell me, did you know any English?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">SS: Yes, I knew English, first of all, because both my parents were English speaking.</span> <span id="s406">I mean, they didn't speak to us in English day by day, but they did give us a few, let's say songs and even earlier on, quite apart from the emigration.</span> <span id="s407">But I learned English at the Goldschmidtschule, for two years.</span> <span id="s408">And so, but I couldn't speak when I got there.</span> <span id="s409">I don't think I could speak but we picked it up very quickly, after three months or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">EA: And so the others were, the hostel parents were also refugees.</span> <span id="s411">What was the main language spoken, German?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">SS: I think it was German for quite a time, yes.</span> <span id="s413">It was German, but then we went to the local council school [local public elementary school -ed.]</span> <span id="s414">and then, of course, we all felt we wanted to assimilate very much.</span> <span id="s415">And then when the war came, we didn't want to be German any more.</span> <span id="s416">In fact we didn't want to be German speaking anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">EA: You wanted to feel the same as the English children at the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">SS: Of course, very much.</span> <span id="s419">But we couldn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s420">EA: Do you remember your first school days?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s422">The first school days were in London while we were still in the hostel.</span> <span id="s423">Not straight away, because I think first we had a few private English...lessons because we weren't really, couldn't fit in straight away.</span> <span id="s424">So we had a few private English lessons and then went to the local council school.</span> <span id="s425">I don't, remember the teacher introducing us not as Jewish, but as young, as children who have now come from Germany.</span> <span id="s426">And we weren't very happy about that.</span> <span id="s427">But we didn't really get to know any of the children and then we were evacuated and dispersed all of us in Cuffley, Middlesex [directly north of London].</span></p> <p><span id="s428">EA: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s429">That's six months that you were at the, in Highgate?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">SS: No, we were in Highgate from March to September.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">EA: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">SS: A few days before...</span></p> <p><span id="s433">EA: That is six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">EA: Let's talk about those.</span> <span id="s436">You had contact with your parents during those six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">SS: Yes, very much by letter, many, many letters.</span> <span id="s438">I think every...week, and a minimum of every week, and one or two telephone calls.</span> <span id="s439">But I think my mother on purpose didn't phone very much, because she knew my father would be terribly, terribly nervous, and we might even be more unhappy than happy, in a way.</span> <span id="s440">And we might...be more, it might upset us even more, to talk on the telephone.</span> <span id="s441">But, she wrote to us practically every day.</span> <span id="s442">And I have many of those letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">EA: Do you?</span> <span id="s444">That is great.</span> <span id="s445">Do you remember changing from German to English?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">SS: I think it was a gradual process, in a way.</span> <span id="s447">But I think when we changed, we didn't fall back into German, as far as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">EA: It's unbelievable, isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">SS: Only when... When older people came, new refugees who escaped and came to, friends of my parents who arrived in England.</span> <span id="s450">And of course they didn't speak to us in English.</span> <span id="s451">They spoke to us in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">EA: And they looked you up and there were...</span></p> <p><span id="s453">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">EA: Several...</span></p> <p><span id="s455">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s456">There were one or two, not many.</span> <span id="s457">But one or two.</span> <span id="s458">Because not everyone got to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">EA: Of course not, yes.</span> <span id="s460">And at school you said you didn't make much, have much contact with the English children, and you were, were you ashamed of being German?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">SS: I'm only talking about the elementary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">EA: Well, in the first months.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">SS: In the council school.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">EA: For six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">SS: We were... A bit ashamed, but I don't know, we kept together as a group, because we had quite a..</span> <span id="s466">.</span> <span id="s467">backing in the group somehow.</span> <span id="s468">And we felt safe there somehow.</span> <span id="s469">But, I don't think there was time.</span> <span id="s470">The English take time to get to know anyway, quite apart from...any refugees...or anything like that.</span> <span id="s471">I mean, generally speaking the English get time to, you have to take time to get to know them.</span> <span id="s472">And that goes for many non-Jews too.</span> <span id="s473">So I don't think one needs to say that was discrimination necessarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">EA: So, what you're saying is it may have been, on your part, that you perhaps did not accept them as more perhaps than they wouldn't have accepted you?</span> <span id="s475">Would that be true?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">SS: I think it was lack of the language to some extent, that we didn't know enough English the first few months, and we felt a bit hampered as a child, to make friends somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">EA: And the English children were not encouraged to make, take care...</span></p> <p><span id="s478">SS: Not all together, but I can't really say much about that because I don't think I felt it so important at the time.</span> <span id="s479">I think at that, those six months, were in one way a very good atmosphere at the home.</span> <span id="s480">And we were very dependent on our, on the people who looked after us.</span> <span id="s481">We had a..</span> <span id="s482">.</span> <span id="s483">newcomer who...contributed a lot to our education and Jewish education, a young rabbi who escaped Poland, and, I think, which the Schlesingers also got him out.</span> <span id="s484">Erwin Zienit, Z-I-E-N-I-T.</span> <span id="s485">And he is now in Poughkeepsie, I think, the rabbi.</span> <span id="s486">Does that mean anything...</span></p> <p><span id="s487">EA: In Poughkeepsie, New York.</span> <span id="s488">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">SS: Now he just recently married a young couple, the daughter of one of...us, of the twelve.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">EA: Really!</span> <span id="s491">Oh, that's beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">SS: So, but I haven't seen him since he left for the States...with his wife.</span> <span id="s493">And his wife was one of the people looking after...no, she was a, I think in the Schlesingers' house at that time.</span> <span id="s494">But we, that is by the way.</span> <span id="s495">But to just recap on social contacts with English children in the Heintz school I went to, the boarding school, I went to afterward, of course, we made friends with all our fellow...pupils there.</span> <span id="s496">I mean there were many, many difficulties, and many...different I think, a lot of heartaches, but not as far as...making friends with other children.</span> <span id="s497">That was, so we felt more...assimilated, and then we made more friends, with one or two, not with everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">EA: Right, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">EA: But, do you think possibly the beginning was so hard because of the language?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s502">I think that was the determining factor perhaps.</span> <span id="s503">But the time, there wasn't enough time.</span> <span id="s504">I mean, we were mainly in the hostel.</span> <span id="s505">We only went to the...school maybe for three hours a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">EA: Oh, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">SS: Just for the morning hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">EA: Your sister and you were, became closer, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">SS: Maybe right in the beginning, but many years later we...didn't have a lot in common.</span> <span id="s510">I think now we are very close to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">EA: That's interesting.</span> <span id="s512">Tell me about the coming of, how the preparation for evacuation...</span></p> <p><span id="s513">SS: Well, that came again as a shock.</span> <span id="s514">There was, but the hostel was being dissembled and...broken down.</span> <span id="s515">And we were all, the twelve of us, dispersed in different places.</span> <span id="s516">There were one or two parents of the children who managed to get out of Germany, and they took their own children.</span> <span id="s517">And then we didn't see them for years and, or years, years on end.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">EA: You did not lose touch with them even then...</span></p> <p><span id="s519">SS: Well, we did...</span></p> <p><span id="s520">EA: Even though...</span></p> <p><span id="s521">SS: I think we lost touch to some extent.</span> <span id="s522">No one exactly knew where the others were, but five of us got, were settled in one village.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">EA: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s524">SS: Five of us, five girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">EA: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">SS: That was Cuffley, Middlesex, close to Potters Bar in Hertfordshire.</span> <span id="s527">And there we were for the first time with English Christian people.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">EA: As evacuees this time...</span></p> <p><span id="s529">SS: As evacuees.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">EA: Not as refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">SS: As evacuees, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">EA: You went with that elementary school?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">SS: With the elementary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">EA: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">EA: Yeah.</span> <span id="s537">So you changed your status.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s539">But we felt, there we felt very much as refugees, and not evacuees.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">EA: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">SS: Well, this was a village, and I think Jews had not been seen there, ever, really.</span> <span id="s542">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s543">EA: In your class—excuse my interjecting—with your class from Highgate, were there any Jewish English children?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">SS: I don't remember that there were.</span> <span id="s545">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">EA: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">SS: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s548">I don't remember anything about the other children at all.</span> <span id="s549">I mean nothing, no contact or anything.</span> <span id="s550">But in...London it didn't matter, because we were as a family all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">EA: Correct.</span> <span id="s552">Correct.</span> <span id="s553">I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">SS: And we also had Jewish education.</span> <span id="s555">We had...a very strong background.</span> <span id="s556">And then we were...that all sort of dissolved, and we...were all up in the air again, as one would say.</span> <span id="s557">And there my sister and I got landed with one young couple, who was certainly not prepared to take, prepared to receive refugees.</span> <span id="s558">And they thought they were getting London evacuees.</span> <span id="s559">So the first few days were very strained.</span> <span id="s560">And my sister was completely shocked.</span> <span id="s561">In fact, she didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s562">She didn't speak for practically a month.</span> <span id="s563">So I had to make all the, to talk for her and to explain, and the first thing that we explained to this young couple—they'd only been married a year—that we were, we came from Germany...but we were Jewish, and we had to escape from Germany.</span> <span id="s564">And I think at that time they really didn't really understand.</span> <span id="s565">But gradually they did, and it was while we were staying with them that my...father died, and my mother nebuch, still wrote to us about it.</span> <span id="s566">And they were very, very understanding.</span> <span id="s567">And they are Mr. and Mrs. Albert Kelly, K-E-L-L-...</span></p> <p><span id="s568">EA: Y.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">SS: Y, who are now in their early 80's, late 70's, early 80's, and I can only...say that within the five months we stayed with them—it was approximately another five or six months until we went to boarding school—they treated us as if we were their own children, although we came from a different world all together, with different beliefs.</span> <span id="s570">They even made us say the Hebrew...Barachot [blessings] at meals so that we shouldn't forget it.</span> <span id="s571">And we have warmest memories of our stay with them.</span> <span id="s572">She was strict, but she was loving.</span> <span id="s573">And they had no children of their own at the time.</span> <span id="s574">And we had our first knowledge of English Christmas and so on.</span> <span id="s575">And they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s576">EA: There were only two of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">SS: Those, the two of us stayed with them, and we are in contact, very close contact with them up to today.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">EA: Oh that's...</span></p> <p><span id="s579">SS: And with the next generation too, with their children and their children...</span></p> <p><span id="s580">EA: Oh, they did have children later.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">SS: They had two girls, and they have approximately seven grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">EA: Oh, how wonderful.</span> <span id="s583">What a wonderful, I think we're coming to the end of the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">SS: Yes, I'm coming to the end of the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">EA: That's a good place to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s587">EA: So you stayed with the Kellys in ...</span></p> <p><span id="s588">SS: Until January, 1940.</span> <span id="s589">And then we had to, then it was decided by the Schlesingers and the Jewish Refugee Committee that we, becau-, so that we could get a better education, that we would go to boarding school in Cornwall.</span> <span id="s590">Not only my sister and myself, but also four of the others.</span> <span id="s591">In other words, there were, I think, five of us girls who went to Kingsley Boarding School in Cornwall, which originated from London, where it was a day and boarding school, run by English Protestants.</span> <span id="s592">And it went up to the higher sch-, higher...</span></p> <p><span id="s593">EA: School.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">SS: What do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">EA: Yeah, sixth grade...</span></p> <p><span id="s596">SS: High school.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">EA: Upper six.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">SS: No, yes, something like that.</span> <span id="s599">It was after, up to matriculation and you could take your higher... School certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">EA: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">SS: And go to a university.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">EA: But it was a non-Jewish boarding school?</span> <span id="s603">That's interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">SS: A non-Jewish boarding school.</span> <span id="s605">I think they felt, it was more decided by the Schlesingers maybe, but I don't know all the ins and outs of it.</span> <span id="s606">I, it had a good...academic reputation.</span> <span id="s607">And I think it was felt that we would be far away from the bombing.</span> <span id="s608">So that we got there...</span></p> <p><span id="s609">EA: Oh, so it was part of, because you were still in Potter's Bar in London, that it was also a safety factor.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">SS: Yes, but I think the factor was mainly educational, because they felt that the council school in Cuffley wouldn't get us very far.</span> <span id="s611">I think that was the idea and I believe the Schlesingers contributed quite a lot to the, oh, they never talked about it, but we, they, we do know that they contributed, paid...the school, some of the school fees.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">EA: Really?</span> <span id="s613">It was not the Committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">SS: No.</span> <span id="s615">The Committee may have...that I don't know.</span> <span id="s616">But I know the Schlesingers paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">EA: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">SS: And I believe that we got it at a slightly reduced rate.</span> <span id="s619">And we were never...allowed to forget that by our [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s620">EA: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s622">Anyway, as I say, this were, because the school came from Hempstead, a lot of English Jewish children were in this school.</span> <span id="s623">But the school as such was...run by the Church of England staff, and attendance at church on Sundays and, in other words, it wasn't, it was an English Christian school.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">EA: This was the first time that you'd met English Jews, then, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">SS: Yes, but very few of them were, I mean I didn't, some of them were not very friendly.</span> <span id="s626">But I think I made more friends with the ones who were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s627">And...but as I say, we were all not in the same class, the five of us.</span> <span id="s628">I think that one, my sister, of course, was three classes below me.</span> <span id="s629">And, well, we felt very much like fish out of water, to begin with.</span> <span id="s630">And the very first...Sunday we were there I was approached by one older girl to say, "Steffi...are you coming to church now?"</span> <span id="s631">Then I said, "No, I don't go to church."</span> <span id="s632">"Why don't you go to church?"</span> <span id="s633">"Because I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s634">I don't go to church."</span> <span id="s635">So she said, "Oh, what does that matter?</span> <span id="s636">Look at this one.</span> <span id="s637">Look at that one.</span> <span id="s638">They are also Jewish.</span> <span id="s639">They are all coming to church."</span> <span id="s640">Well, I resisted it for about a week or two, and then I noticed really that quite a few were all coming to church.</span> <span id="s641">So I went to church with all the others, and instead of kneeling I sat on the...chair.</span> <span id="s642">And when they sang about Father and Son and the Holy Ghost, I did not sing.</span> <span id="s643">And that's how my attendance at church continued.</span> <span id="s644">If it had stopped at that, no harm would have been done.</span> <span id="s645">Now comes the comical part of it, although at that time it wasn't comical at all.</span> <span id="s646">Pressure was being put upon all of us, unrepentant Jews, become, to become good little Christians.</span> <span id="s647">The pressure was put on by our head mistress, Vivian S. Sheppard, who, no longer alive, who had a missionary zeal to convert us all...in some way.</span> <span id="s648">And when it didn't work, unfortunately she became very sadistic.</span> <span id="s649">I was never in any, she was also the math teacher at the school, and I was hopeless at math.</span> <span id="s650">I would have been hopeless anyway, but because of her...terrorizing ways I became even more hopeless in math.</span> <span id="s651">And, unfortunately, she was a very unbalanced individual.</span> <span id="s652">And although she may have been very good with small children, but with the older ones she was compl-, I think she upset our equilibrium completely.</span> <span id="s653">And this goes for non-Jewish children, too.</span> <span id="s654">I hate to say it, but there was lesbianism in the school among some of the older girls, and the some of the mistresses.</span> <span id="s655">Not all.</span> <span id="s656">Some mistresses were very normal and very down to earth.</span> <span id="s657">And, from them I learned very well.</span> <span id="s658">I mean I..</span> <span id="s659">.</span> <span id="s660">enjoyed history, literature, all the humanistic subjects, and did quite well in them.</span> <span id="s661">And, well, we didn't, as for Vera Behr, I was in close contact with her all the time.</span> <span id="s662">We were in the same class.</span> <span id="s663">That was...I'm talking now from the first...from the hostel.</span> <span id="s664">Ilse Solomon was in another class.</span> <span id="s665">[tape off then on] Marian Memlok, we were, saw each other from time to time.</span> <span id="s666">There were also older Jewish girls, refugees, in the sixth form at the time, who, unfortunately, had to go, were sent off to the Isle of Man and had, they couldn't complete their education.</span> <span id="s667">And this made quite an impression on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">EA: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s669">Cornwall was, they were categorized as C?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">SS: A protected area.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">EA: Aliens?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">SS: A protected area that was, Cornwall.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">EA: Oh, oh.</span> <span id="s674">I see.</span> <span id="s675">Because being under the coast line.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s677">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s678">EA: And they were over 15 probably?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">SS: Over 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">EA: Oh, 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">SS: Over 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">EA: So they were adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">SS: So they were adults.</span> <span id="s684">They had to leave school early, and so on.</span> <span id="s685">And well, all this atmosphere, then we noticed that the school was helping itself to some of our...belongings...and the beddings and things like that.</span> <span id="s686">And we couldn't do anything about it.</span> <span id="s687">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s688">EA: You were considered Germans, rather than Jews, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">SS: Refugee...</span></p> <p><span id="s690">EA: Certainly the older children were, because they were sent to the Isle of Man.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">EA: How about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">SS: Us?</span> <span id="s694">Within the school I think we were considered refugees.</span> <span id="s695">Refugees.</span> <span id="s696">From our fellow pupils maybe not.</span> <span id="s697">Maybe they...didn't [?]</span> <span id="s698">.</span> <span id="s699">But I hate to say it, there was one, there were one or two girls, although they...also escaped became very...antisemitic somehow.</span> <span id="s700">So we got, you got, unfortunately anti- prejudice and antisemitism from...some born Jews who wanted to forget they were Jews.</span> <span id="s701">You got that.</span> <span id="s702">But some of my dearest friends I made at the school, and I have them until today, one or two of them.</span> <span id="s703">And well, then who...saved the situation as far, of the conversion, the threat of conversion was...Mrs. Dorothy Waley Cohen Singer, or Singer Waley Cohen.</span> <span id="s704">If she is alive today she must be in her nineties.</span> <span id="s705">But I, she was the wife of Charles Singer, a scientist and a contemporary of Huxley, of the younger Huxley.</span> <span id="s706">And, she looked for children, Jewish children, in schools, in the vicinity...of Cornwall as such, who were, had no home to go to.</span> <span id="s707">She tackled our head mistress, and what was said between those four walls, I..</span> <span id="s708">.</span> <span id="s709">think...walls must have shattered.</span> <span id="s710">And the result of it—and I think she made mincemeat of her—the result of it being that all the Jewish children, all the refugees, anyone who wants, all of us who were, remained Jews, were invited for the High Holidays to her home.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">EA: How about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">SS: And there it was an ultra-liberal atmosphere.</span> <span id="s713">We were there for Pesach sometimes, for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, but let's put it this way, Yom Kippur we were presented with a cup of cocoa in the morning, at our bedside.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">EA: Oh, you slept there.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">SS: With, yes, we slept there.</span> <span id="s716">And we had readings from the Bible in English, and we sat around the fireside and we had, we ate with the family.</span> <span id="s717">And with, there were about ten or twenty of us from different schools in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s718">And when it came to Yom Kippur and we were presented with the cup of cocoa, we said, "But it's Yom Kippur, we don't...eat."</span> <span id="s719">That much we did remember.</span> <span id="s720">"Ah, you can start your fast after...breakfast."</span> <span id="s721">But, I can only be thankful for her because she started correspondence classes with a liberal Jewish synagogue in London, for all of us.</span> <span id="s722">And whatever I know slightly about Sephardic Jews and the Inquisition and all that, it stems from that time.</span> <span id="s723">And, that stopped conversion as far as the head mistress was concerned, except she succeeded with several, and they are lost until today.</span> <span id="s724">And, especially the very young ones who were far away from home, I mean this far away, not only German Jews, but I mean English Jews who, it was very far from London.</span> <span id="s725">And some of the parents didn't...put themselves out.</span> <span id="s726">And they thought, and they were being told it would be easier for them in the long run, so they agreed to the conversion, not knowing that they put their children into...a terrible...psychological tensions later on, if I could put it that way.</span> <span id="s727">And unfortunately she succeeded with one of us twelve.</span> <span id="s728">And I don't want to mention any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">EA: O.K. So, how do you explain it, '41 you were 14, a very young girl, that you had the strength and the perseverance, how do you account for that, in retrospect.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">SS: '41 I wasn't 14.</span> <span id="s731">'41 I was, I was 12 in 1940, 13 in 19-...</span></p> <p><span id="s732">EA: So it was 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">SS: 13, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">EA: All right.</span> <span id="s735">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">EA: Still very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">SS: What strength and perseverance?</span> <span id="s739">To...</span></p> <p><span id="s740">EA: To counteract the approaches that were made to you and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">SS: I can only put it down to this.</span> <span id="s742">For the...atmosphere...of Jewish observance we had in our home, although my mother was, as I say, from a very assimilated background and only learned about tradition from my father, but we, all the time we kept Freitag Abend, Friday evening.</span> <span id="s743">We kept the, we, even before we left Germany, we fasted half a day, I believe, and my father, we knew my father went to...well, while he was well he went to synagogue every Saturday.</span> <span id="s744">And he...fasted on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s745">And, he instructed us into the...elements, the basis.</span> <span id="s746">But not in a dogmatic way at all.</span> <span id="s747">It was the background of our...home.</span> <span id="s748">My mother...cooperated and she lit the candles on the Friday.</span> <span id="s749">And I'm sure that all through her, until she married, she never knew anything about it.</span> <span id="s750">And, we went to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s751">And so I learned a little, little Hebrew, which I forgot afterwards.</span> <span id="s752">But the trauma of...the immigration, of leaving home, and...the fitting in into the, first into the... High gate background into the Schlesinger group where we also had Jewish observance and songs and Chalutzim songs, and we...had a strong identification, a very strong ident-, Jewish identification.</span> <span id="s753">This helped me to battle the, what was happening in the boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">EA: How, right now—we are sitting in Israel—how do you feel this Nazi era has affected your whole life?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">SS: [pause] A loss of youth.</span> <span id="s756">I think we didn't have a real youth.</span> <span id="s757">I had a childhood.</span> <span id="s758">And while the years were not so serious, well until the...big threat came, a very, very happy and harmonious childhood.</span> <span id="s759">And then a whirlwind of events and shocks, from time to time.</span> <span id="s760">How it affected me is that maybe I..</span> <span id="s761">.</span> <span id="s762">haven't, especially the period in the boarding school, inhibited me very much.</span> <span id="s763">But this may have been also...education in a boarding school.</span> <span id="s764">Because...I think English, at that time, that sort of education, had an inhibiting factor, the fact that it was made only women and no men.</span> <span id="s765">And also, but then I had no, we, in the holidays we had no home to come home to.</span> <span id="s766">We were always sent to different places and it was, we felt it very bad, very much on the holidays, the school holidays.</span> <span id="s767">And then, when the war finished—well, I left school while the war hadn't finished yet, in 1944—I was, I had various ideas which I wanted to do, but, of course, at that time I was still an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s768">I was an enemy alien until the war finished.</span> <span id="s769">So I had to give up my camera and to report to the police and to the Ministry of...Works whenever I changed my address, and whenever I changed my work.</span> <span id="s770">And so, there wasn't really freedom to choose your occupation.</span> <span id="s771">But this isn't exactly relevant.</span> <span id="s772">How, there is a shadow over our lives.</span> <span id="s773">And, if I can, let's say how it affected us is that during the war and ten years afterwards, there was hate of everything German, a hate of meeting Germans of any kind, a mistrust.</span> <span id="s774">How do you say it, [?]</span> <span id="s775">, a determination not to visit Germany, never to see, never to see the place again where I was born, no hankering back.</span> <span id="s776">I knew what I was.</span> <span id="s777">I knew that we had a new country in England.</span> <span id="s778">We were British but not English, accepted on the whole, with good friends and good, a satisfying occupation.</span> <span id="s779">But, maybe not completely, completely acclimatized, and always in a sort of...vacuum in a way.</span> <span id="s780">And, or religious, I would say this, how it affected me that in the latter part of the war in the beginning, and straight after wards when I was growing up between the ages of 16 and 18, I lost every belief I ever had, every religious belief I ever had, especially when the news of the camps came out and the search for the families, for our mother and who, and others who went, whether they were still alive or not.</span> <span id="s781">And going to Bloomsbury House to look at the lists every day of the survivors, to see whether someone was alive or not.</span> <span id="s782">At that time I believed in nothing and no God, no synagogue, nothing.</span> <span id="s783">I turned very left-wing.</span> <span id="s784">I felt somehow that the only people who had fought the Nazis were the Communists and Socialists in Europe.</span> <span id="s785">And I became a young Communist.</span> <span id="s786">Not card holding, but...let's say sympathizing and even going to meetings.</span> <span id="s787">And, this held me to some time, to some extent, for some time, until...I did watch political developments and then suddenly there...it snowballed again because I, when...Tito was called a fascist reptile, I somehow came to my senses slowly but surely.</span> <span id="s788">But, let me put it this way, that I, it took me many, many years until I could...accept Jewish religion as such, or that I could go into a synagogue.</span> <span id="s789">And often I..</span> <span id="s790">.</span> <span id="s791">would go into a synagogue, and it wouldn't affect me spiritually at all.</span> <span id="s792">And I think that as far as meeting Germans, it took me a long, long time.</span> <span id="s793">I started speaking German quite soon with my relations who survived in Holland.</span> <span id="s794">My mother's youngest brother and his wife, who also went and escaped by a miracle and through their own courage, and my aunt in Berlin, my mother's sister, who also had extraordinary experiences and survived with her husband.</span> <span id="s795">Here I might just comment that there was an anti-Nazi German who helped them with papers.</span> <span id="s796">He was a Roman Catholic in the police.</span> <span id="s797">But...[tape off then on] and Nazism affected me, as I say, in a nutshell, loss of childhood, loss of parents, loss of inner security for many, many years, loss...it took a long time for me to get Selbst bewusstsein [self-confidence].</span></p> <p><span id="s798">EA: Accreditations.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">SS: Self-confidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">EA: Confidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">SS: Self-confidence, professionally and from day to day, maybe it affected that I didn't marry for, that I was...in the initial years, straight after the boarding school, but I think here, the boarding school must be blamed more than the refugee status.</span> <span id="s802">Being in the boarding school for so long, that I straight after leaving it was afraid to get into...company and join clubs, and had an inhibition as far as that's concerned.</span> <span id="s803">And so it wasn't, I was very shy.</span> <span id="s804">I was very shy.</span> <span id="s805">But eventually I'd go out sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">EA: Your sister was in the same boarding school, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">SS: My sister was in the same boarding school, three classes below me.</span> <span id="s808">Her integration was much better than mine.</span> <span id="s809">She became very English, very secure in the boarding school itself, and her trauma and her difficulties as far as identity came much later, came much later.</span> <span id="s810">I never had any...qualms about identity.</span> <span id="s811">I always knew, I had a very strong...Jewish identity, not religiously but, and so I never, I..</span> <span id="s812">.</span> <span id="s813">didn't suffer from that point of view.</span> <span id="s814">But...hers was, she was very, she thought she was completely English.</span> <span id="s815">She had forgotten her, a lot from home, because she was younger.</span> <span id="s816">And so, because many years later she had to face the sudden fact that my mother, what happened to her.</span> <span id="s817">And, because we shielded her from quite a lot.</span> <span id="s818">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s819">EA: Because of her youth.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s821">And, that, afterwards she had, many years later she realized she wasn’t completely English, and that she...had to learn what she really was, to some extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">EA: What is she?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">SS: Now she is British, with a German Jewish background.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">EA: She lives in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">SS: Ah, my sister lives in England.</span> <span id="s826">She stayed in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">EA: Did she marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">SS: No.</span> <span id="s829">She didn't marry, and she's working as a health visitor in...London.</span> <span id="s830">And although she has many Jewish friends and she has some non-Jewish friends, and she's very...much respected and very conscientious in her work, and a very, very generous person, I mean, that she, how can I say it...</span></p> <p><span id="s831">EA: Gives of herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">SS: Gives a lot of herself, yes.</span> <span id="s833">She gives a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">EA: Did she come and visit you here at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">SS: She often comes to visit us, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">EA: Did she consider maybe...</span></p> <p><span id="s837">SS: Never considered coming here, and quite honestly lately I really haven't encouraged her.</span> <span id="s838">Maybe in the early years we did, because I mean the acclim-, integration into Israel is also not so easy.</span> <span id="s839">And she is, and has remained, even so more English, and is happy in her own environment.</span> <span id="s840">And I don't think she would be happy here.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">EA: What makes you happy here?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">SS: I'm not always happy here.</span> <span id="s843">I'm not, I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s844">EA: Where is home, Steffi?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">SS: Home is here now.</span> <span id="s846">Home is here.</span> <span id="s847">I have my husband.</span> <span id="s848">I have my daughter.</span> <span id="s849">And, I know where I belong.</span> <span id="s850">I disagree, and, let's, very much, we, politically what is happening here.</span> <span id="s851">I, let's say, am, how can I put it, it's, many of us are very discouraged, very... Many Israelis are trying to fight the present situation, and we have to guard very much against, and I hate to say it, bigotry and extremism—I don't like to use other words—in this country.</span> <span id="s852">And, I..</span> <span id="s853">.</span> <span id="s854">think, the most terrifying thing, which I have watched within the last few years is that history repeats itself.</span> <span id="s855">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s856">EA: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">SS: And, history repeats itself and...the...element of...prejudice and hate for another...kind of person, I mean, of another nationality or race, can also pop up from somewhere.</span> <span id="s858">I, this is not really, it doesn't really refer to that, but let's put it this way...</span></p> <p><span id="s859">EA: Could it happen in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">SS: Not to that extent, but certain things could happen in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">EA: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">SS: Freedom of expression and I..</span> <span id="s863">.</span> <span id="s864">hate to say it, maybe a police state.</span> <span id="s865">But I hate to say it, and I hope we don't get to that state.</span> <span id="s866">But many instances are very frightening.</span> <span id="s867">I'll add to this that the whole, that the...that we are also not in an easy position, and that because of the Six Day War we were put into a position we didn't seek.</span> <span id="s868">And that the country and the borders are very, very, very small.</span> <span id="s869">But even so, we have...to consider that this is not only our...country, like the whole Middle East.</span> <span id="s870">And I mean...well, that accounts bad, white that out, I didn't mean the whole Middle East!</span> <span id="s871">But, that, it's that Israel contains and always has contained a large Arab population, and especially from up north.</span> <span id="s872">And we have to...live with each other, and we can't lord it over the others.</span> <span id="s873">We can't...we have to...stop the Occupation, and come to an agreement, to...treat each other like...a Ben Adam, like a Mensch.</span> <span id="s874">And I, it's difficult for me to talk about this, but I..</span> <span id="s875">.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">EA: But for you personally, Steffi, this is where you wanted to be?</span> <span id="s877">You had an option?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s879">This is where I wanted to be, and I wouldn't leave it here, leave this country.</span> <span id="s880">I..</span> <span id="s881">.</span> <span id="s882">have a daughter born in this country.</span> <span id="s883">I feel I have molded in here to some extent.</span> <span id="s884">I think...Israel is a place where everyone can fit in, to some extent.</span> <span id="s885">I mean, it is a, that is the good part, that is the good thing about it, that every Jew, of whatever persuasion or whatever, right-wing or left-wing or every, from every corner of the earth, and from, let's say, every kind of belief and way of life, will find his niche in this country.</span> <span id="s886">And so I don't regret for...one moment that I came.</span> <span id="s887">And I never will.</span> <span id="s888">And I have found an outlet here from, in many ways, which I hadn't found in England, which I wasn't able to...find.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">EA: That's wonderful to hear.</span> <span id="s890">So, nothing is perfect but you...really feel at home in Israel, and that you've...found your niche, which is great.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s892">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">EA: Now I have one more question.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">EA: Do you have the patience?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">SS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">EA: We're doing oral histories, and the purpose of this, as you know, is to document the history of the children who came, unaccompanied, from Germany to England.</span> <span id="s898">As you know, Gratz College has an Archive of the Holocaust and Holocaust Survivors.</span> <span id="s899">Is there any message that you feel you would like to be documented, other than your personal history and so on, and what we've just talked about?</span> <span id="s900">How can that become an educational tool possibly?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">SS: You mean just a sentence or two or...</span></p> <p><span id="s902">EA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">SS: Something?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">EA: Any guidelines, other than having it lie in the dusty archives...</span></p> <p><span id="s905">SS: Yes, I understand what you mean.</span> <span id="s906">Well, maybe I can...only mention what I have tried to...teach my daughter and what I think is very important for...the future generations of youth to understand, not only Jewish, but non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s907">I mean, I presume you have some...non-Jews coming to your college.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">EA: I hope so, because there are a number of people that still don't believe that there was such a thing as a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s909">And you know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">EA: And that's why a personal history like yours I hope will document—and many other stories...of the children—will document that...</span></p> <p><span id="s912">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">EA: These are real, live people who went and survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">SS: Let me put it this way first, that I feel it should never be forgotten what some, so many of our brothers and sisters, went through, so much more.</span> <span id="s915">And those who were not able to escape to England or the United States, to free countries, before the war.</span> <span id="s916">And they had to, they were, they...had to suffer the Germans on the soil and...were either imprisoned or incarcerated, and somehow by miracle remained alive.</span> <span id="s917">So, I feel that is the primary...part we must remember, to study how...Jews in occupied countries remained alive, rebuilt their lives, and some of them had all their whole family butchered.</span> <span id="s918">As far as our group is concerned, the children who came with the Children's Transport, we suffered much less.</span> <span id="s919">We suffered emotionally, because we...left our homes and we...often didn't see our parents again.</span> <span id="s920">They were killed, some were.</span> <span id="s921">And so, we had...that trauma.</span> <span id="s922">Now for the future generations, I think the main thing is to...not to forget, to study, to make these different histories, to see, to try to learn from them.</span> <span id="s923">And most of all, I think it can teach the man in the street how to behave with his fellow man, to respect...his belief, his origin, whether he is rich or poor, or whether he is...academically trained, or let's say a simple man who runs...a shop, or cleans the windows.</span> <span id="s924">I think we all have to guard against a superiority complex.</span> <span id="s925">Some people have luck, Some people have less luck.</span> <span id="s926">And so it's more a respect for your next door neighbor.</span> <span id="s927">I think, if you learn that through all these histories and, or if you have, and through day to day life, and are willing to give and...a willingness to help and to listen and to help...help where you're needed.</span> <span id="s928">Then maybe we can all make a better world.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">EA: Oh, Steffi, how well put.</span> <span id="s930">Thank you very, very much indeed.</span> <span id="s931">It really was a pleasure, and I thank you for the time and for your contribution.</span></p></body></html>
