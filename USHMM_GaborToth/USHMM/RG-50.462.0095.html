go into this.</span> <span id="s302">Heh, naturally a lot of, a lot of, a lot of shooting we hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">BZ: [Unclear.]</span></p> <p><span id="s304">MR: Anyway, this was on the end of the columns.</span> <span id="s305">I don't know how long the column was, because it was 12,000.</span> <span id="s306">By the end of the columns, you know, there was a group of Ges--S.S., traveling on trucks and finishing off.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">BZ: They weren't walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">MR: No.</span> <span id="s309">But, it's an important episode happened to me in this march.</span> <span id="s310">I was walking with a, in the whole march, starting from Ausch--from Buna, with a close friend of mine, which he kn--I knew him from before the war.</span> <span id="s311">And I was working with him in this camp in Suchawola, and then in Majdanek I was together with him.</span> <span id="s312">And, we was together in Buna.</span> <span id="s313">In this march, it's worth mentioning.</span> <span id="s314">One of the guards gave me his bag, his shoulder bag, to carry, because it was too heavy for him.</span> <span id="s315">He never saw the bag back.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">BZ: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s317">MR: I grabbed it.</span> <span id="s318">After this long a march we landed in, oh, what is it called?</span> <span id="s319">Gleiwitz.</span> <span id="s320">Gleiwitz is a distance from Buna...</span></p> <p><span id="s321">BZ: Excuse me, was this a Nazi guard or like a Kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">MR: A Nazi guard!</span></p> <p><span id="s323">BZ: It was a Nazi guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">MR: Oh sure!</span> <span id="s325">Going on the side, walking, in a back of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">BZ: What did that bag contain?</span> <span id="s327">It had food in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">MR: All kinds of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">BZ: [chuckles] Oh, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">MR: I'll come to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">BZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">MR: So finally when we landed after two days and nights of marching, this...</span></p> <p><span id="s333">GR: [Unclear.]</span> <span id="s334">.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">MR: What I am talking.</span> <span id="s336">It's important.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">GR: Yes, everything is...</span></p> <p><span id="s338">MR: Go take a walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">GR: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s340">MR: Take a walk!</span></p> <p><span id="s341">GR: [Unclear.]</span></p> <p><span id="s342">MR: Anyway, when we landed in Gleiwitz, and they put us in barracks to stay over night and the following day we have to be loaded on trains, and go to Germany.</span> <span id="s343">Me and my friends, we unpacked this...</span></p> <p><span id="s344">BZ: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s345">MR: This Rucksack, and I found a treasure over there.</span> <span id="s346">It was Schnapps.</span> <span id="s347">It was kuchen [cake].</span> <span id="s348">It was salami.</span> <span id="s349">It was bread.</span> <span id="s350">And we did got a ball!</span></p> <p><span id="s351">BZ: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s352">MR: At night, late in the night, we hear walking in, around, and calling for this Rucksack.</span> <span id="s353">I never walk up to tell him something, and he never saw it.</span> <span id="s354">From Gleiwitz, when they loaded us on the trains, it was open carriages.</span> <span id="s355">It was January, it was cold, snowing.</span> <span id="s356">The only food was the snow from the sky.</span> <span id="s357">One time they stopped the train, and they start throwing loaves of bread.</span> <span id="s358">Whoever was healthy and could stood up and catch, he did it.</span> <span id="s359">And some of this bread hit people that they died.</span> <span id="s360">In the faces.</span> <span id="s361">It was one early morning, about six o'clock.</span> <span id="s362">We was travelling in Czechoslovakia with this train.</span> <span id="s363">And the people was going, walking to work.</span> <span id="s364">It was an underpassage, or an overpass, a bridge.</span> <span id="s365">And the people start, and this train was standing.</span> <span id="s366">There wasn't a green light to get in in the station or pass in the station.</span> <span id="s367">And these people, I don't know how they know, they start throwing down their breakfasts, and their lunches, everything on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">BZ: My God.</span> <span id="s369">Before this, these were Czech people.</span> <span id="s370">Before this, were there people other than Czechs that threw you bread on the trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">MR: No we hadn't, no, this was the Germans.</span> <span id="s372">In certain stations...</span></p> <p><span id="s373">BZ: The German people were throwing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">MR: No, they brought in trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">BZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">MR: And they throw bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">BZ: Oh, they were supposed to feed you.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">MR: But we was trav-...</span></p> <p><span id="s379">BZ: It wasn't out of charity.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">MR: We was travelling ten days.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">BZ: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">MR: Imagine.</span> <span id="s383">So a few, two or three times they throw bread on it.</span> <span id="s384">Some of them got it, some of them not, but we shared.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">BZ: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">MR: If it, on one of these wagons it come, let's say 20 breads, we shared.</span> <span id="s387">Now, when, finally when we arrived in, what is it, I forgot, Heinkel Werke, Oranienburg?</span> <span id="s388">Eh, Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s389">This was a place where it was actually manufactured the German Luftwaffe, the Wulf?</span> <span id="s390">The Messerschmitt.</span> <span id="s391">I was assigned to work in a brick factory.</span> <span id="s392">Every morning they took us about 30 kilometers.</span> <span id="s393">And over there I was carrying on my shoulders 20 bricks, straight from the oven, out to a place where we stacked up these bricks.</span> <span id="s394">And going around and around the same thing, all day long.</span> <span id="s395">One day that was about 11 o’clock.</span> <span id="s396">I heard calling my number.</span> <span id="s397">And I says to a guy walking behind me, I said, "Now that's the end.</span> <span id="s398">Where did he come to my number?</span> <span id="s399">How did he get my number, and what do they want it?</span> <span id="s400">And don't say nothing that's me."</span> <span id="s401">This was going on until noon.</span> <span id="s402">Lunch time.</span> <span id="s403">They put up the, this food, you know, and we all approach to take it.</span> <span id="s404">And I took my portion and I sit down, turning my back to this guy--he's walking around and looking for numbers.</span> <span id="s405">And I turned around.</span> <span id="s406">And finally they approached me and yelling the number.</span> <span id="s407">I saw I can't go on any longer.</span> <span id="s408">I says, "That's me."</span> <span id="s409">So one guy approached me from the Gestapo naturally.</span> <span id="s410">And he says, "Why don't you respond when we are calling?"</span> <span id="s411">I says, "I didn't pay any attention of anybody.</span> <span id="s412">I have my work to do, and I am doing my work properly."</span> <span id="s413">I says, "I was going."</span> <span id="s414">"Didn't you hear?"</span> <span id="s415">I says, "No.</span> <span id="s416">I haven't heard be cause my head is not what somebody's talking."</span> <span id="s417">Finally they took me, and they was talking to me very gently.</span> <span id="s418">I didn't know what happened here.</span> <span id="s419">And they asked the supervisor from this brick factory, "Is here a shower facilities?"</span> <span id="s420">He say, "Yes."</span> <span id="s421">They took me in this shower facilities, and they showered me, and they shaved me, and they brought in perfect clothes.</span> <span id="s422">It was really a miracle, the way I looked and what they made of me.</span> <span id="s423">And I didn't know what's going on.</span> <span id="s424">And finally they gave me some food, other food.</span> <span id="s425">Not this.</span> <span id="s426">And they took me in a limousine.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">BZ: Limousine?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">MR: Gestapo on both sides, S.S., naturally, on both sides.</span> <span id="s429">And there was a truck with about 20 behind this limousine.</span> <span id="s430">Sitting over there in the limousine I asked, "Gentlemen, I really don't understand.</span> <span id="s431">I don't understand too much at all.</span> <span id="s432">But what's going on?"</span> <span id="s433">He says, "The Kommandant sent for you."</span> <span id="s434">I says, "Does he knows me?</span> <span id="s435">Do I know him?"</span> <span id="s436">And he told me his name, and he, they told me, that's one of my friends works in the office over there.</span> <span id="s437">"The Kommandant asked him if in this transport it come any tailors.</span> <span id="s438">And he says, 'Yes, as a matter of fact there's one guy here.</span> <span id="s439">He was sleeping in an upper bed with me in Auschwitz.'</span> <span id="s440">And he gave them your name.</span> <span id="s441">And the Kommandant sent for you."</span> <span id="s442">I come in over there and he greeted me very friendly.</span> <span id="s443">He was a murderer.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s445">MR: This Kommandant was well-known to everybody that he didn't eat a breakfast before he killed a few of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s446">It was not just Jewish prisoners.</span> <span id="s447">It was Poles.</span> <span id="s448">It was Russians.</span> <span id="s449">It was Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s450">It was a lot of prisoners in this camp, in this Heinkel--so-called Heinkel Werke we was working.</span> <span id="s451">He gave me the orders, what I..</span> <span id="s452">.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">BZ: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s454">That name you just said, that Haynkel, is that the kind of job it was that, what you just said?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">MR: The Heinkel Werke?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">BZ: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">MR: Heinkel Werke is a airplane manufacturer.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">BZ: Oh, could you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">MR: It is a manufacturer of airplanes.</span> <span id="s460">Heinkel Werke.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">BZ: Heinkel Werke.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">MR: Well known to everybody in the world.</span> <span id="s463">The Messerschmitt and the Wulfes.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">BZ: Oh yeah that I, yes, that I got.</span> <span id="s465">So where, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s466">MR: The Focke-Wulfes and the Messerschmitte.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">BZ: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">MR: This is the place they were manufactured over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">BZ: It was called Heinkel Werke.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">MR: Heinkel Werke.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">BZ: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">MR: And my or--the camp was called Sachsenhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">BZ: Oh, that was Sachsenhausen!</span></p> <p><span id="s474">MR: Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s475">Our camp, Oranienburg, by the Berlin, this is a division of Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s476">From us to Sachsenhausen, that was 22 kilometers.</span> <span id="s477">But this Oranienburg, so-called, is affiliated.</span> <span id="s478">Everything was brought from over there, for the.</span> <span id="s479">use of the camp.</span> <span id="s480">He set me up in the tailor shop, this Major Heydrich, and he gave me orders.</span> <span id="s481">I didn't have the right to sew on one button to anybody without his permission.</span> <span id="s482">The same day he brought me in several uniforms, already cut, and I says, "What happened to these uniforms?</span> <span id="s483">Why didn't the tailor finish them?"</span> <span id="s484">He told me that the tailor is old and he can't do it anymore.</span> <span id="s485">So he brought me in about three uniforms, with all the trimmings.</span> <span id="s486">Everything was there, just to have them fitted, and maded to his selves.</span> <span id="s487">I start working, and I told him, "That's a lot of work, and I need some help."</span> <span id="s488">He says, "Find tailors and arrange them here.</span> <span id="s489">I'll leave it to you."</span> <span id="s490">And I did it.</span> <span id="s491">I did arrange some of them.</span> <span id="s492">And we did the work properly.</span> <span id="s493">I didn't finish with one, he's up with more and more.</span> <span id="s494">And if this was not enough, he start bringing me in his wife, with fabrics, and patterns, and designs, to make coats for his wife, for his relatives.</span> <span id="s495">I did as much as I could.</span> <span id="s496">He was fair with me.</span> <span id="s497">As much as a murderer he was, but to push me in a package of cigarettes that nobody can see it, he did it.</span> <span id="s498">The food was terrific.</span> <span id="s499">He furnished me with S.S. food.</span> <span id="s500">Whatever the Gestapo, the S.S. eat it, that was sent to me.</span> <span id="s501">We was only four tailors, and a Kapo, from the clothing warehouse.</span> <span id="s502">It was five.</span> <span id="s503">And he sent twenty liters of rice with goulash, or noodles with goulash, good for the same what a Gestapo was eating.</span> <span id="s504">Now, we eat what we could, and what we wanted, and the rest, I was giving away.</span> <span id="s505">Sometimes I have to steal this, because the guys didn't let.</span> <span id="s506">"I'll have for later."</span> <span id="s507">And I said, "No, we got ours."</span> <span id="s508">And I did got old friends from Auschwitz, and I really did want to see them a little bit, you know, on more skin on them.</span> <span id="s509">And I gave them away.</span> <span id="s510">Now, this was not enough.</span> <span id="s511">A Kapo went sick, and I took over the entire clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">BZ: You were in charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">MR: And I was in charge of everything.</span> <span id="s514">Then he...</span></p> <p><span id="s515">BZ: What was the Kapo?</span> <span id="s516">A Pole?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">MR: A Kapo is a, no, it was a German, a polit-...</span></p> <p><span id="s518">BZ: It was a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">MR: Yeah, a political prisoner, a nice, beautiful man.</span> <span id="s520">But he did got tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s521">Because he was in prisons before.</span> <span id="s522">He was a Communist.</span> <span id="s523">But really a good man.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">BZ: He wasn't cruel at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">MR: He was really good.</span> <span id="s526">He did got an open heart to talk with us, and to explain us everything.</span> <span id="s527">Now when I took over command, over this warehouse, where it was every thing, then it started.</span> <span id="s528">I wouldn't be ashamed to tell you that I was a thief.</span> <span id="s529">The windows from the warehouse was, you know, locked up.</span> <span id="s530">What, what, how...</span></p> <p><span id="s531">BZ: Barricaded?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">MR: Barricaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">BZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">MR: With iron bars.</span> <span id="s535">But I did got my guys, all from Auschwitz, and I gave them signals, and they knew when they come to the window, they got a pair of shoes, they got a pair of boots, they got a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s536">I dressed them up like going to a wedding!</span></p> <p><span id="s537">BZ: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s538">MR: After a little while I saw it's getting short everything.</span> <span id="s539">So I play dumb when he comes in for inspection.</span> <span id="s540">I says, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s541">Emil left it this way and--"Finally, I did got a hunger for better food.</span> <span id="s542">So, I start getting acquainted with these German civilians, supervisors from the shop here and there.</span> <span id="s543">And I asked them for butter.</span> <span id="s544">I asked them for salami.</span> <span id="s545">And I asked them for, for vodka.</span> <span id="s546">I did need it for Emil, for this Kapo.</span> <span id="s547">And they demanded something from me.</span> <span id="s548">They demanded machine needles, which they couldn't get it nowhere.</span> <span id="s549">So there was, that was in the millions over there.</span> <span id="s550">It wasn't theirs, it was ours.</span> <span id="s551">So, I start stealing needles.</span> <span id="s552">I give away the needles.</span> <span id="s553">One guy asked me for a machine.</span> <span id="s554">I stole I had from a machine and give it to him.</span> <span id="s555">He brought me live fish.</span> <span id="s556">And I gave it to Emil, to the Kapo.</span> <span id="s557">Now, cigarettes, I accumulated so many cigarettes that I was feeding all the guys, whoever comes to the window, a package of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s558">It was fun.</span> <span id="s559">I could say it was fun, until I reached a point that I got to say, April 6th.</span> <span id="s560">That was a, an air alarm.</span> <span id="s561">I closed the shop, and I ran to a shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">BZ: An air, oh, an air alarm.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">MR: Air alarm.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">BZ: That was in 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">MR: 1945, April 12th.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">BZ: April 12th.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">MR: Correction.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">BZ: [Unclear.]</span></p> <p><span id="s569">MR: April 8th, correction.</span> <span id="s570">And on this alarm, there was no, only one way, the nearest shelter, underground shelter.</span> <span id="s571">And I closed the door, not on, not with a lock on, not with a key, but to let, I was responsible to get all of them out.</span> <span id="s572">Emil wasn't anymore over there.</span> <span id="s573">So, I got all of them, the helpers out, and we ran to this underground shelter.</span> <span id="s574">And on my way to the shelter I got a bullet.</span> <span id="s575">The bullet was a, it's, it was from an American airplane, from a Spitfire.</span> <span id="s576">It was from maybe an F-16 or a maybe F-15 at this time.</span> <span id="s577">And the bullet was poisoned.</span> <span id="s578">But, the bullet went in and out, missing I don't know a hundredth of a millimeter maybe from the bone.</span> <span id="s579">After...</span></p> <p><span id="s580">BZ: Where did it go?</span> <span id="s581">What part of you, the bullet?</span> <span id="s582">In your leg?</span> <span id="s583">In your thigh?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">MR: On my right leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">BZ: On my.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">MR: On the upper thigh.</span> <span id="s587">When the alarm was over, this Commander asked for wounded or dead.</span> <span id="s588">They gave him the number.</span> <span id="s589">They didn't know me.</span> <span id="s590">So they gave him the number.</span> <span id="s591">And he in a desperate voice, "This is the of tailor!"</span> <span id="s592">And he asked him, "Where is he?"</span> <span id="s593">And he told him that I am in the so-called hospital.</span> <span id="s594">He ran over there and he saw me, you know.</span> <span id="s595">He called together a, the doctors.</span> <span id="s596">There was one Polish doctor, one French, and one German.</span> <span id="s597">And he says to do everything is possible.</span> <span id="s598">The German doctor said they have to amputate.</span> <span id="s599">And as far I remember, I was not under any influence of...</span></p> <p><span id="s600">BZ: Drugs or...</span></p> <p><span id="s601">MR: Of drugs or anything, and he says, "If you cut off his leg, I'll cut off your head!"</span> <span id="s602">Now, there was no antibiotics.</span> <span id="s603">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s604">So they cut it open, and they cleaned it out.</span> <span id="s605">And he was standing behind me, holding my head.</span> <span id="s606">And he says, "I'll show you how to do tailoring!"</span> <span id="s607">- you know, when they was sewing up my wound.</span> <span id="s608">Finally, this, I was left in the hospital.</span> <span id="s609">Little by little I start feeling better, but one of a sudden they start evacuating the camp.</span> <span id="s610">And I was living in the hospital.</span> <span id="s611">At the same time they start evacuating the hospital, to Sachsenhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">BZ: Gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">MR: To the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s614">One of the guys which he was going with the trucks around and around, says to me, "Max, watch out.</span> <span id="s615">Hide, wherever you can."</span> <span id="s616">I says, "Where am I gonna hide?</span> <span id="s617">Look at my condition with the leg.</span> <span id="s618">I can't ."</span> <span id="s619">He says, "I'll get you crutches."</span> <span id="s620">And he got me crutches.</span> <span id="s621">And the whole hospital personnel was evacuated.</span> <span id="s622">There was nobody there.</span> <span id="s623">He says, "We are taking the worst ones, but tomorrow could be your day too."</span> <span id="s624">So during the night, what I did, is I tore a few sheets and make bandages.</span> <span id="s625">And with this, I climbed up in the early morning.</span> <span id="s626">I climbed up.</span> <span id="s627">He showed me.</span> <span id="s628">This guy knew.</span> <span id="s629">He showed me a way how to get up on the attic, in this barrack.</span> <span id="s630">And I got up over there in the attic.</span> <span id="s631">And over there I was hiding for two days.</span> <span id="s632">There was nobody in the camp, and it was quiet, so I got down.</span> <span id="s633">When I got down, I saw there's quite a few left.</span> <span id="s634">Not only me that was left, because they didn't got a time to evacuate, and they ran away.</span> <span id="s635">And in the afternoon, a entire column of, I don't know what kind of sort of weapon, it was Army, Navy, or whatever it was, or it was, it was not any S.S.</span> <span id="s636">An army moving back, -- camp in this camp for over night.</span> <span id="s637">It was, and later it was a mixture.</span> <span id="s638">Because I saw S.S., too, between them.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">BZ: This was in Sachsenhausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">MR: In Sach--in Oranienburg, by Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">BZ: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">MR: And after not sleeping all night, just listening what's going on.</span> <span id="s643">It's going.</span> <span id="s644">It's going.</span> <span id="s645">What it was going on, but, I wasn't anymore on the attic.</span> <span id="s646">I was on a bed.</span> <span id="s647">I hear them talking.</span> <span id="s648">That was in a little kind of room.</span> <span id="s649">There was about eight of them, S.S., that's one is telling the other one--and I was close to this place--he says to him, "We have to run because the Russian are came close.</span> <span id="s650">Let's run away."</span> <span id="s651">And, it didn't take too long, and all of them was dressed and on their motorcycles and on Jeeps and cars, and they start running away.</span> <span id="s652">And this larger column, Army, right after them.</span> <span id="s653">It was 7 o’clock, 7:30, there was nobody, no there, except the civilian defense.</span> <span id="s654">And a really Civilian Defense, I didn't know it, I find it out later, they are about 20 or 30 healthy guys did run away when it was the evacuation, and they did hide in the underground shelters, and in the woods.</span> <span id="s655">Because the entire factory, the entire industry, was in the woods.</span> <span id="s656">They did hide.</span> <span id="s657">And then, all of a sudden, when it start getting quiet, they come out, and there was Russians, Ukrainians, Poles, and a pretty good Jewish guys too.</span> <span id="s658">And with us getting organized.</span> <span id="s659">Now, the main question was water, water for the people, here in the hospital.</span> <span id="s660">We selected a committee, and we start organizing.</span> <span id="s661">Now, we found what is, by the main.</span> <span id="s662">kitchen, we found a barrel on wheels.</span> <span id="s663">Now, they want to go out from the gate for water, the civil guar--the Civil Defense doesn't let them.</span> <span id="s664">So they went the larger column, they cut their hats off, and they took the rifles from them, you know, put on rifles, and went for water.</span> <span id="s665">And we, they brought water and they start helping whatever they could.</span> <span id="s666">They brought a field kitchen to the hospital, and they was over there, naturally the committee established this, rice for the people, you know, the, with the, what do you call it, diarrhea.</span> <span id="s667">Rice, and tea.</span> <span id="s668">Just a half a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s669">It was pretty good organized, and we waited about two days.</span> <span id="s670">And, the Russians approached the camp.</span> <span id="s671">And then they set up a temporary camp from so-called, the KGB, you know.</span> <span id="s672">And start asking questions and this and this.</span> <span id="s673">I was interviewed, too.</span> <span id="s674">I told them what it was and what I saw, and that's all.</span> <span id="s675">And I told them that I need help, because I have a wounded leg.</span> <span id="s676">They gave me some chocolate.</span> <span id="s677">They gave me some candy.</span> <span id="s678">And they brought a doctor.</span> <span id="s679">The doctor says, "It's pretty good, but you're not ready for the road.</span> <span id="s680">You have to stay here."</span> <span id="s681">So I stayed for a few days, and then they look me up again.</span> <span id="s682">They gave us pretty good food.</span> <span id="s683">Besides this, we didn't need the food there.</span> <span id="s684">We brought all the food from the main kitchen, from the main, you know, reserves.</span> <span id="s685">But they did keep it for the S.S. and for the camp.</span> <span id="s686">They brought it here, bread enough, butter enough, sugar, everything.</span> <span id="s687">And finally we did organize a march for home, for east.</span> <span id="s688">I went with them, naturally on crutches.</span> <span id="s689">They took by a farmer some horses, the big ones, and they loaded me on the wagon, and we was travelling.</span> <span id="s690">We traveled to a certain point.</span> <span id="s691">Nights we did stay and stay over night in farmers' houses, in German houses which they ran away, you know, from the on-coming Russians.</span> <span id="s692">Finally I reached the border, no, we reached our, yes, we reached the border,

ask for you here.</span> <span id="s697">Should you survive, you come here and ask."</span> <span id="s698">And I was going in this direction.</span> <span id="s699">I arrived over there.</span> <span id="s700">The distance from the train, when I landed over there, to this farmer's house, was a kilometer and a half.</span> <span id="s701">It's exactly one mile.</span> <span id="s702">It took me three hours, on the crutches, and I reached the house.</span> <span id="s703">Naturally the people...</span></p> <p><span id="s704">BZ: Were the people at home?</span> <span id="s705">At

"I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s709">We are so poor.</span> <span id="s710">We don't have nothing to give away."</span> <span id="s711">I call her, I didn't call her by the name right away.</span> <span

the laundry.</span> <span id="s760">They warmed the water and they washed me.</span> <span id="s761">They put me to bed, and they called a doctor.</span> <span id="s762">He saw the condition.</span> <span id="s763">The doctor recognized me right away, because he knows us before the war.</span> <span id="s764">And he says, "You have infected.</span> <span id="s765">You need attention."</span> <span id="s766">I says, "Doctor, I don't have any money.</span> <span id="s767">When I'll get on my feet, I'll reward you."</span> <span id="s768">He says, "I don't want anything."</span> <span id="s769">And he treated me, and after a few days, I was on my feet.</span> <span id="s770">When the infection start, you know, disappearing, I walked out on crutches and look around and see people.</span> <span id="s771">One morning I walked out.</span> <span id="s772">This wasn't in the morning.</span> <span id="s773">It was about ten, eleven o'clock.</span> <span id="s774">I was really, completely out of order.</span> <span id="s775">I couldn't eat nothing.</span> <span id="s776">This woman didn't have enough to buy a pound of bread.</span> <span id="s777">She went to the bakery and brought the rolls for me, and I couldn't eat them.</span> <span id="s778">Finally when I reached a day that I ate a half a roll, and I took two sip of milk, because I was 98 pounds, she was running around and telling every neighbor that I ate.</span> <span id="s779">And one...</span></p> <p><span id="s780">BZ: And the other Poles knew that they were taking care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">MR: Yes, all the neighbors around, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">GR: Yeah, and they killed a lot of Jews [unclear] over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">BZ: And

id="s794">GR: Not they, only these...</span></p> <p><span id="s795">BZ: They were decent.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">MR: Anyway, I walked out one day and I'm greeting this neighbor, their neighbors, you know.</span> <span id="s797">But they know me, because I grew up here.</span> <span id="s798">"Hello!</span> <span id="s799">Hello!"</span> <span id="s800">And finally I saw a Jeep arriving.</span> <span id="s801">And I approached this Jeep, and I saw a girl which we was in the same camp with her in Suchowola.</span> <span id="s802">And my wife met her in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">GR: We was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">MR: They was march, and she asked me, "Is Goldie home?"</span> <span id="s805">I says, "What are you talking?</span> <span id="s806">Is Goldie alive?"</span> <span id="s807">She says, "I walked with her two weeks ago!</span> <span id="s808">In this and this place!"</span></p> <p><span id="s809">GR: We walked to another [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s810">MR: And she says, "I lost her!"</span> <span id="s811">I says, "No, I don't know nothing about her.</span> <span id="s812">You were the first, you're telling me!"</span> <span id="s813">She says, "Don't stay here!"</span> <span id="s814">I says, "What happened?"</span> <span id="s815">And she told me a story that a, how many people it was killed here in a house a few weeks ago.</span> <span id="s816">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s817">Nobody told me.</span> <span id="s818">These people where I was staying, they didn't want to tell me, to scare me.</span> <span id="s819">But, this guy, the owner, he was on guard 24 hours of the day when I was over there, listening, if something--it doesn't come for me.</span> <span id="s820">And they was after me one time.</span> <span id="s821">And he told them, "What do you want from him?"</span> <span id="s822">That's what he told them, "What do you want from him?</span> <span id="s823">He is wounded.</span> <span id="s824">He is sick.</span> <span id="s825">He will not live here.</span> <span id="s826">What do you want from him?"</span> <span id="s827">So finally they let him, it was, a matter of fact, a cousin of theirs was active in this AK so-called.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">BZ: Oh, yeah, the AK.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">MR: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">BZ:

<p><span id="s834">BZ: They were always killing Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">MR: And he was talking about getting me.</span> <span id="s836">And I remember him being a customer of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">BZ: Is that right.</span> <span id="s838">But he still...</span></p> <p><span id="s839">MR: But, what are you gonna do?</span> <span id="s840">That's the way it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">BZ: But you were a Jew and that's what they were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">MR: So he...</span></p> <p><span id="s843">BZ: They were hunting Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">MR: He told them to bug off.</span> <span id="s845">And, the morning when I talked to this girl, she says, "Whatever you got, take it and let's go.</span> <span id="s846">Come!"</span> <span id="s847">And I took it.</span> <span id="s848">She told me the story and I took it.</span> <span id="s849">I don’t know what is there when I arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">GR: And he didn't know if she's alive for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">MR: So, finally, when I went over there to this town, it was 26 kilometers, and, or maybe 40 kilometers.</span> <span id="s852">And I later took a walk, with the crutches, and we met this woman, what my wife told you in her story.</span> <span id="s853">And I asked her, “How is she dressed?”</span> <span id="s854">And then I back up.</span> <span id="s855">I says, "I am asking you how she is dressed, how I know what she has got on now?</span> <span id="s856">I only know when she left me, what she has got on."</span> <span id="s857">But, what are you gonna do?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">GR: [Unclear.]</span></p> <p><span id="s859">MR: I can't walk.</span> <span id="s860">So there was standing a guy over there, a so-called policeman, a Jewish policeman, and I says, "Yidel, help me."</span> <span id="s861">He says, "What?</span> <span id="s862">You want help?"</span> <span id="s863">He took one of, with a horse and buggy that was standing, you know, for a, getting rides here and there.</span> <span id="s864">Like here is taxis.</span> <span id="s865">Taxi drivers.</span> <span

says, "Go on."</span> <span id="s870">And we left for the station.</span> <span id="s871">And when I come to the station, he run in fast.</span> <span id="s872">Now, he didn't know my wife, but another one, what my wife told you, this guy Moishe, he grew up together.</span> <span id="s873">He--they knew each other like [pause; recorder noise] (It's going.)</span> <span id="s874">And, he jumped in and he met my wife.</span> <span id="s875">And he told her that I am, that I am here.</span> <span id="s876">She says, "Where is he?"</span> <span id="s877">And, finally, finally, I made it to the stairs, and I walked in.</span> <span id="s878">And this was one end of the beginning, from freedom.</span> <span id="s879">We settled later, we lived for quite a while in...</span></p> <p><span id="s880">GR: Six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">MR: My wife's hometown.</span> <span id="s882">We lived for a little while.</span> <span id="s883">Some of them come back from Russia,
