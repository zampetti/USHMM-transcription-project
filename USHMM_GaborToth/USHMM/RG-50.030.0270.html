1994</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: I just want you to begin by stating your name as it was during the war, your date of birth and the town you were born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s13">My name was Rozia, like Rose Luft, that was my maiden name, and I was born in Zamuch (ph), the first of July 1918, and I don't know what else do you want to know?</span> <span id="s14">I had one brother and two sisters.</span> <span id="s15">We had a pretty good life because my father was a builder, and we had people working for us.</span> <span id="s16">We had a maid in the house, and we lived very comfortable.</span> <span id="s17">Before the war, in 1937, 1938, a friend of my brother's came from Warsaw and he saw me, and he said who is that cute little girl.</span> <span id="s18">So my brother said that is my sister, and he took us out for a little dinner and he fell in love with me.</span> <span id="s19">So, I get married to him and be married and then the war broke out, so he was in the army, in the military, and he was hurt and he was in a hospital.</span> <span id="s20">So my father sent a guy who worked for my father, he sent to Warsaw and he brought him as a soldier wounded in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">They covered his face.</span> <span id="s22">It was a Gentile who brought him, because the Germans were already in our town, so they covered his face not to look like a Jew, not to see that he is Jewish.</span> <span id="s23">Even the Germans carried him from one train to another.</span> <span id="s24">So, that's the time he came to our town and in 1940, I got married, in the war time.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: You met and you planned to get married.</span> <span id="s26">He was wounded and then you got married afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yes, we were just like engaged.</span> <span id="s28">He sent me a ring from Warsaw, but I wasn't married to him, and we got married in 1940.</span> <span id="s29">I wasn't crazy about marrying, but he was hurt and he said he was going to go to the Germans to be killed because if I'm not going to marry him, he doesn't want to live.</span> <span id="s30">So, my mother said you're going to die anyway, all of us, so why don't you marry him.</span> <span id="s31">So, I did.</span> <span id="s32">I was pregnant in 1941, I got pregnant in 1941, I had a baby and her name was Maugacia (ph), in English it's Margaret, and she died when she was 7 1/2 months old because she had diarrhea and we didn't have any doctors, and we couldn't go to doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: This was in Zamuch?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I would think in Zamuch, yes.</span> <span id="s35">And I had two sisters in the same town.</span> <span id="s36">In Europe family lived in one town only.</span> <span id="s37">We didn't move around.</span> <span id="s38">We didn't leave the nest like.</span> <span id="s39">It's all the family, uncles and aunts and everybody lived in the same town.</span> <span id="s40">So, then my sister married, I was the middle one.</span> <span id="s41">I had an older sister married already.</span> <span id="s42">She was I don't know how old.</span> <span id="s43">She was 24 when she died, but she married when she was 15 years old.</span> <span id="s44">By 16, she had a baby.</span> <span id="s45">She had a boy, and that boy was during the war, and she looked-- my sister didn't look like a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s46">She looked like a Gentile so the Gentile boys used to say "Saki, why do you need a Jew for.</span> <span id="s47">Throw the Jew away, like she doesn't belong to him.</span> <span id="s48">But she was married, happily married to that guy, and they had that boy.</span> <span id="s49">Then the younger sister, the youngest married a doctor, a young doctor.</span> <span id="s50">She was about that time 20.</span> <span id="s51">She was born in 1921, and he was about seven years older, 27 at that time.</span> <span id="s52">He was a pediatrician.</span> <span id="s53">They lived together, and then the Germans used to come in to give us all kinds of orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s55">I need you to stop a second.</span> <span id="s56">I think you were talking about your younger sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s58">She was married to that doctor.</span> <span id="s59">My youngest sisters --- there were three sisters and I was the middle one.</span> <span id="s60">She married his name was , and they were very happy together, and when the Germans started coming into our houses and taking everything away, you know like here the carpets we have on the floor, but the real what do you call it, not Chinese, the carpets that come from the East, we had on the walls at that time.</span> <span id="s61">They were hanging on the walls.</span> <span id="s62">So, they told them to take down the carpet from the wall, and he saw that they are very rough to us and they were pushing him and hitting him and they decided to take their lives.</span> <span id="s63">So, they went into their -- because they lived one apartment, one home near the other and they went into their room and they told the maids to go into our house and stay with my mother until they're going to wake up.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">They're going to sleep.</span> <span id="s65">So, she came in and she was sitting an hour or two and she said they're still sleeping.</span> <span id="s66">So, my mother told me to go in and see what they're doing and I saw them like that both of them.</span> <span id="s67">He was really dead and she was all right, but she didn't know that he died.</span> <span id="s68">They took their lives.</span> <span id="s69">He gave her a shot.</span> <span id="s70">I don't know what the stuff was and himself and then he told her when she wakes up before him and he's going to be dead already so she give herself another shot, and he put it away in a place in the oven.</span> <span id="s71">We didn't have like heating, but big huge ovens so she said it's there because when the doctors came and the whole town was by our house and when the doctors came, his friends, and they asked where is the rest of it, and she told them while she was still in coma like, but she told them and they took it out and they started giving her shots and she came to life and she lived about three months later, but she didn't go to the funeral.</span> <span id="s72">And she was asking where's and my mother said that he is in the hospital, but it was really the funeral, and they buried him.</span> <span id="s73">I was sitting with my sister because my mother said you watch her, and I was very shocked because I saw that first.</span> <span id="s74">After that, three months later my sister went to the Germans and she said she wants to go to her husband, to die.</span> <span id="s75">So, they said, you're to pretty to go to death, and she said, I want to go, and they took her away.</span> <span id="s76">That's the last we saw her.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: She just presented herself to the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes, she said she wanted to go with the transport.</span> <span id="s79">She wants to go to be killed because she knew that they took you, it's the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s81">Did your family have a lot of information about what was happening so that your brother-in-law made this decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Nobody, we knew that Hitler wrote and the Germans used to tell us it's nothing now.</span> <span id="s83">You're going to see what's waiting for you.</span> <span id="s84">So, we knew that something is going on, but they didn't tell us what they're going to.</span> <span id="s85">They used to say to everybody that they're sending us to work, to the Russian front or to camps, but never they're going to kill us.</span> <span id="s86">So, my sister after three months she saw a boy who worked for my father and she said you tell my family that I'm going to see , to be with because she found out that he is dead.</span> <span id="s87">She didn't want to live.</span> <span id="s88">She was in a very bad shape, depression, and she finally she went there.</span> <span id="s89">So, my mother was heartbroken, but she didn't -- we didn't want to believe that they killed right away, so my mother was sending us, where did they send the transport and if she can send packages, and they said of course.</span> <span id="s90">So, my mother was sending packages in the unknown and she had long been dead.</span> <span id="s91">Who knows, we don't know how she got killed and so that was less one.</span> <span id="s92">Then they were moving us place to place, and they took us out from our homes and they put us in like not Ghettos yet, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s93">They just made our community smaller and smaller and they put us in a Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Let me just go back a minute.</span> <span id="s95">When the war began in Poland, what are your first memories?</span> <span id="s96">How soon did the Germans come into your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Right in the beginning.</span> <span id="s98">They marched in and we didn't even know what happened.</span> <span id="s99">They marched in about two weeks later, because at that time I forgot to tell you, my mother sent me for vacation.</span> <span id="s100">She said go to Warsaw to your aunt's.</span> <span id="s101">She wants you to have a vacation.</span> <span id="s102">So, I went to Warsaw, and the war, they started about 5:00 in the morning they were calling in Warsaw, the war, the war, 5:00 in the morning, the papers.</span> <span id="s103">A war with Germany, a war with Germany, and we didn't really know what it means.</span> <span id="s104">I said I'm going home.</span> <span id="s105">I want to be with my parents.</span> <span id="s106">My aunt, that was my father's sister, said no they're going to come to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s107">It's going to take a long time.</span> <span id="s108">You're better off to be in Warsaw than to go home, and I said, no I want to go home.</span> <span id="s109">So, she put me in a train that I was with the German soldiers in a train in the beginning because Polish soldiers were going one way and German soldiers were going the other way.</span> <span id="s110">It was a horror.</span> <span id="s111">We didn't even know what's going on because I was never in a war and how did I know how a war is going to look.</span> <span id="s112">Finally I came home and my sister was not far, in the middle of the town living, my older sister with her husband and that child, and she had a maid, her name was Stasha and I went to the window and I started screaming Stasha, Stasha, early in the morning about 5:00, 6:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s113">So, she opened the big gate, because it was a big building with gates, and so she opened the gate and she said quiet, everybody is asleep, but my sister heard and she said what are you doing here and I said, "It's a war."</span> <span id="s114">In our town they didn't know yet that it's a war, but in no time did soldiers start marching in.</span> <span id="s115">And it was a time that they were -- the Germans were grabbing older people.</span> <span id="s116">They were shooting from the street young people, and cripples and anybody they can find, you know.</span> <span id="s117">Like bearded Jews, you know with beards and with the Jewish you know, those curls by the ears, and so they were telling him to wash the floors, to lick the floor with the tongue or they said, I don't have anything to wash the floor with, so they said wash it with your shirt.</span> <span id="s118">So, anyway, it was a terrible thing, but we never knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s119">Then they told us we have to move together, together in a different place, but we for a little while we stayed in the same place, and my sister had a maid and she was part of the gate, standing and the Germans used to come and they asked if there were any Jews, and she couldn't speak German so she said, "No, Jews," so they left.</span> <span id="s120">But we were in the window watching what's going on in the streets, and we saw all our neighbors a lot of them came out of the houses and they told them to make a big ditch and everybody was working hard to make the ditch and they laid around, they told them to stay around the ditches, to stand up, and that's what I saw.</span> <span id="s121">A very nice, I don't remember her name, a lady with a little girl, she was about five years old.</span> <span id="s122">She was holding the baby with her and they told them to stay with the Germans with the backs and they were shooting from the back in the heads or whatever and they were falling into the graves, into the ditch.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Was this right in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Right in the beginning.</span> <span id="s125">They were falling and she was holding on to that little baby and she was killed and the baby, and after a while in full blocks and lots and lots of people.</span> <span id="s126">I don't remember how many it was at that time, but a lot of people fell into that grave, and that little baby came out after about five or ten minutes, from under the mother because they shoot her in the back of the head, so the little baby was she was holding on her so she wasn't hurt, and she came out from under the mother's body and she was begging them on the knees please don't kill me.</span> <span id="s127">I want to live, and they killed her just straight on her -- and she died.</span> <span id="s128">This we all saw and my nephew said you see what they're doing.</span> <span id="s129">At that time he was about five years old.</span> <span id="s130">He said, "I don't want to be killed like this."</span> <span id="s131">And so, it was over and we cried and we said this is going to be our end.</span> <span id="s132">At that time, I worked already for the Germans, the SS, the German engineers, and I used to be Ruzia, but they called me Pauline.</span> <span id="s133">They gave me the name Pauline that was easier for them.</span> <span id="s134">Sometimes they called me Rozamunda or you know all kinds of names, but I worked for the Germans and my mother used to take my sister's children and we used to work; all of us, and my child and she used to babysit my mother, for the children.</span> <span id="s135">My mother at that time was about 45 or something like this.</span> <span id="s136">I don't know what year my mother was born, and she was watching the children and we were working.</span> <span id="s137">One time I said I want to go home because they're killing people there, and the SS men said no you're not going because you'll only get killed.</span> <span id="s138">You stay here.</span> <span id="s139">He was a very nice SS man and he wasn't in the military.</span> <span id="s140">He was a civilian SS, and my mother gave me the baby and said here you run away with the baby.</span> <span id="s141">He said take the baby, and I'm going to bring you milk for the baby, and he helped me and he was standing over me and he was crying and he said, "I have children, too, and I don't know what's going to happen when the war ends with my children."</span> <span id="s142">They were afraid for themselves, too.</span> <span id="s143">So, this passed by and they started moving us again, to a Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: I'm just a little confused.</span> <span id="s145">When the Germans came in, you were sent to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s147">We had to have camp cards, like a passport, that we are working and we are registered to work, because if you're not registered, you didn't get bread.</span> <span id="s148">So, you had to be registered, and we used to go all out to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Was this in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: That was all in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Were most of the young women going and doing this kind of work?</span> <span id="s152">A: All of them, old and young.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: What was the actual work?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Anything.</span> <span id="s155">One worked and cleaned houses.</span> <span id="s156">I worked as a helper there, you know.</span> <span id="s157">They asked me if I know how to make manicure and I said, I don't know.</span> <span id="s158">He said try, and I made for the SS men's manicure and I was afraid that if I'm going to hurt them, they're going to kill me, but they were nice SS people, really.</span> <span id="s159">They weren't the military.</span> <span id="s160">They were private.</span> <span id="s161">They were like engineers, but they belonged to the party, but they didn't know the cruelty yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: But your work was really very intimate.</span> <span id="s163">It wasn't working in a factory.</span> <span id="s164">It was this one to one contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: In the beginning in our town, they used to make us work in getting used that all of us have to work if you want food.</span> <span id="s166">They didn't give us much.</span> <span id="s167">The Russians were very small.</span> <span id="s168">They gave us bread and the bread tastes like raw, because they didn't bake them like they were supposed to be, but we had something.</span> <span id="s169">Then, we worked there until about -- they made , that was in 1941.</span> <span id="s170">My daughter died by the time, and they came and they took my daughter in something away.</span> <span id="s171">I didn't even know where she was buried or what they did with her.</span> <span id="s172">Nobody knew what happened to the dead people.</span> <span id="s173">They used to come every morning and collect the dead from the Ghetto and take them.</span> <span id="s174">We didn't know where they took them.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Okay, now you're mentioning a Ghetto.</span> <span id="s176">When was the Ghetto formed?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: The Ghetto was formed from almost the beginning.</span> <span id="s178">It wasn't like a real in Warsaw Ghetto because that was the beginnings.</span> <span id="s179">They were just putting us together to have us in one place you see, not in the whole town, to be everywhere that they couldn't find us.</span> <span id="s180">So, they kept us.</span> <span id="s181">It was togetherness like.</span> <span id="s182">They kept us in one place and they knew where to look for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Were the conditions bad in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Very.</span> <span id="s185">You know, like you have a house and they put you in two rooms, a whole family.</span> <span id="s186">My mother with my father and all three of my sisters, the beginning, and my brother.</span> <span id="s187">We were in one room later.</span> <span id="s188">So, it was terrible, but you're still -- we were allowed to take our clothes, not much, but a little, but not the furniture.</span> <span id="s189">Nothing like this.</span> <span id="s190">It's just personal things they let us take and you know, little by little they take away our freedom and everything.</span> <span id="s191">We couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s192">The Ghetto was from this place to this place.</span> <span id="s193">We couldn't go to the other side of the Ghetto by ourselves.</span> <span id="s194">We had to have a German or a dressed in a German uniform, but they were .</span> <span id="s195">They spoke Polish but they were from some place in the border of Germany and Poland, so they spoke both languages.</span> <span id="s196">They had to bring us to work.</span> <span id="s197">We couldn't go by ourselves.</span> <span id="s198">We met one nice and his name was Philip.</span> <span id="s199">I don't know the last name.</span> <span id="s200">He used to help us.</span> <span id="s201">He used to put when they say he used to come and say they are going to make a raid today, you know, like they're going to kill a lot of people.</span> <span id="s202">They are going to raid the Ghetto, and so he said let me take you all go into the ditches, you know where the potatoes are high.</span> <span id="s203">So, he put us in the ditches and he said I'm going to watch and I'm going to see where they are and I'm going to tell you when to come out.</span> <span id="s204">So, the Germans were very smart and very clever, and they used to go around and looking for people like this.</span> <span id="s205">They knew that everybody is trying to stay alive.</span> <span id="s206">So, he watched them, and he used to show us quietly don't get up.</span> <span id="s207">Just stay there, and he was like a means he was the watcher, a watch guard for them, but he helped us.</span> <span id="s208">He helped us a lot in the beginning.</span> <span id="s209">They had a little more freedom to do that, the , and the Germans.</span> <span id="s210">They weren't so bad.</span> <span id="s211">But, they were bad enough because we weren't used to a life like this.</span> <span id="s212">But, you know from the worst they were the better ones.</span> <span id="s213">So, they moved us again, and I moved out from my mother to a different place.</span> <span id="s214">They gave me a little room in a building, in the same building my aunt lived downstairs with my cousin and her husband and child and another guy, another family lived next door and they made an .</span> <span id="s215">Do you know what that is?</span> <span id="s216">They told us to go to the market place and they were cleaning up the place, so we all went to the marketplace, but the contribution of people, so many they can put into the trains, that they had enough.</span> <span id="s217">They did the amount of people, it was over, so they sent some people back.</span> <span id="s218">Then when we came back home, it was the middle of the night and we couldn't go because they were shooting everybody on the streets, whoever they saw.</span> <span id="s219">So, we went into a building that we didn't even know who lived there, and we heard somebody crying and it was an old lady, maybe 100 years old in the bed crying that she doesn't have food, and that she doesn't know where her family is and we told her to be quiet because they are going to shoot us all.</span> <span id="s220">I was with my little baby at that time, yet still, and I was breast feeding her and I didn't have anything in my breast how to feed her.</span> <span id="s221">We kept the baby quiet and my cousin was with me with her boy.</span> <span id="s222">He was six years old and my cousin's husband.</span> <span id="s223">Then the middle of the night, it was too dark, maybe 4 o'clock in the morning, we were going back quietly and we saw blood all over the streets.</span> <span id="s224">It was like a war field with people who I knew were on the streets all over, and we saw a German on a horse.</span> <span id="s225">He was Gestapo or SS officer, a very high rank officer and he said "What happened?"</span> <span id="s226">It was quiet already, just, you know, once in a while we heard a shot someplace.</span> <span id="s227">So, he asked us what happened here and we said, "We don't know.</span> <span id="s228">They killed us all."</span> <span id="s229">And he said, "Tell your people -- I never knew who he was -- "Tell your people that I am ashamed of our race."</span> <span id="s230">And he was a high rank German.</span> <span id="s231">He told us tell the people so we went home and we said so what can you say.</span> <span id="s232">We went back home so we had to lock the gate and my cousin went to the next door neighbor for the gate -- locking the gate, it was a big like a piece of iron, you know to put an iron on the gate.</span> <span id="s233">In the meantime, he went in there and he called us all and he said, "Come in, come in, you're going to see something."</span> <span id="s234">Fourteen people were shot through the head.</span> <span id="s235">All of them.</span> <span id="s236">My two aunts.</span> <span id="s237">One aunt was standing.</span> <span id="s238">She was looking something in the drawer and she opened the drawer and she was with her head looking into the drawer and she was shot, I suppose in the back of her head and the drawer was full of her blood.</span> <span id="s239">One of my aunts was sitting on the floor in the corner, with her tongue out, shot to death.</span> <span id="s240">That was my cousin's mother.</span> <span id="s241">My mother's brother's wife, and so it was a full house of dead people, fourteen people.</span> <span id="s242">All of a sudden I hear somebody calling my name, and one girl was moaning because they shot her in an eye.</span> <span id="s243">They said she's too pretty to shoot her so they just shoot her eye out, which she died a while later, but the woman who came out from under the bed, they were all standing or sitting or just so the woman was my neighbor and she came out from under the bed dripping in blood, and she said, I run the first under the bed and they couldn't see me.</span> <span id="s244">They just shot the next person who was after me.</span> <span id="s245">I said, "Come out" my cousin said, "Come out.</span> <span id="s246">You're going to be with us."</span> <span id="s247">She said, "No, I'm afraid they're going to kill me."</span> <span id="s248">And she went back under the bed.</span> <span id="s249">Finally, you know, we persuade her to come out and we said go and wash yourself.</span> <span id="s250">Look how you look.</span> <span id="s251">She was soaking in blood.</span> <span id="s252">So, that was then my mother knew what was someplace else and she sent the maid and she said to Anera (ph), she said go and see what's with my daughter.</span> <span id="s253">She came to the window and it was I had a candle on because we were afraid to put the lights on and so she said she came back to my mother and she said I think in Ruzia's apartment there's a little candle so she must be there.</span> <span id="s254">So, my father came with a blanket and he came for me and when he saw me he fainted because I looked like -- he couldn't recognize me because we went through hell all night.</span> <span id="s255">It was not a night, it was a hell.</span> <span id="s256">What we saw, and that's always in my mind.</span> <span id="s257">I never told my children anything about those things, and my father took me home to my mother.</span> <span id="s258">He took me home and my mother said you're not going anyplace.</span> <span id="s259">You're staying with us until they move us further.</span> <span id="s260">That was the place for you to stay with us.</span> <span id="s261">So, then I said no I'm going to go home tomorrow.</span> <span id="s262">Soon after my baby died, because I didn't give her milk.</span> <span id="s263">I gave her water.</span> <span id="s264">I didn't have anything to give her, and so we --</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Was there constantly terror in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Constantly, constantly, night and day you hear shooting and screaming and running.</span> <span id="s267">It was not a day or not a minute without fear, without that horror, not fear, horror.</span> <span id="s268">It was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: You saw this when you went to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: All the time, all the time.</span> <span id="s271">Then you know, after that you're still a few months in that Ghetto, and I used to go to work, and I had nice friends, and I had a teacher who and his name was Mr. Khun (ph), and you come to me, and I'm going to feed you and I'm going to give you something to wear, you know things you need.</span> <span id="s272">I want to help.</span> <span id="s273">So, I used to go there and they used to prepare for me a package of food of something to bring home, and but you know the Polish people most of them it was a lot of nice people who saved a lot of people who are trying to save, and they saved a lot.</span> <span id="s274">But it was many for a pound of sugar, they sold your soul.</span> <span id="s275">So, they worked for the Germans, and one time I said to that Philip, he used to come and he used to take me to visit my friends.</span> <span id="s276">Like I used to have a friend, my brother's friend, and she used to tell me how about coming to dinner and I said -- she's a , you have full Germans, and she said, I'm going to tell her you're my sister and nobody is going to know so that was the truth.</span> <span id="s277">But in the meantime, we were making Gentile papers for ourselves to live through the war if we decided to run away before it's too late.</span> <span id="s278">So, we were working on the papers.</span> <span id="s279">It cost a lot of money too make Gentile papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Who was helping you with us?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: It was a lot of Polish people who did those things, who put the German stamps, like it looked real and everything.</span> <span id="s282">They gave me a name, Bernice Slabovuchko, that I should live on this name, and my brother and my father put money down for camp cards like passports like Gentiles and they put money down and they waited.</span> <span id="s283">They said it's going to take and they gave them pictures and everythings, it's going to take a little while and you're going to get your papers.</span> <span id="s284">So, and I had papers from a church and I had those papers but you're going to work every day and all of a sudden one morning they came in and they said it's everything , they didn't let us go to work and it's , you know they clean out and we all have to go out of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: That was by the end of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: You were still living in ?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yes, but then I came back and it was '41, because they took the whole town together and we marched, children, old and young, whatever was left, we marched to a little town .</span> <span id="s289">I was never there in my life and we marched 21 kilometers with my sister at that time had a boy and he was eight years already and the little girl was two years old.</span> <span id="s290">She had a girl.</span> <span id="s291">So, when they told us to march, so we had a woman who washed our clothes for us and so she said send Sanrush (ph) to me and he said "No Mommy, I will not go.</span> <span id="s292">I'm going with you."</span> <span id="s293">And he said, "I don't want to be shot like all the children on the street, because when you're not going to be here she's going to throw me out and we're going to wind up dead on the street."</span> <span id="s294">So, he went and he walked 21 kilometers, an eight year old boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Was your family with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yes, my mother, my father, my brother, my one sister, because one was already gone.</span> <span id="s297">So, we walked and I helped carry my sister's little girl.</span> <span id="s298">And he was walking, my nephew, alone by himself and he was so proud you see I am walking by myself, all by myself.</span> <span id="s299">And he walked the whole 21 kilometers.</span> <span id="s300">They brought us to a little town.</span> <span id="s301">It was a dirty little town with -- it wasn't even a town.</span> <span id="s302">It was a village like and there was no place to go and no place to live.</span> <span id="s303">We found a room someplace.</span> <span id="s304">We went in with a family.</span> <span id="s305">I don't know who that was.</span> <span id="s306">In the same day, a German, an SS man, but I worked for him, he was -- I worked in an logger, that means a camp and we were going there for there for the day and working and coming home and you know.</span> <span id="s307">So, I worked all the time for him.</span> <span id="s308">So, he came and he used to call me Pauline, not Rose.</span> <span id="s309">So, he came to the town and he was standing on a truck and he said where is Pauline.</span> <span id="s310">He called for me, and my brother came into the house and he said I think Walter -- his name Walter Robert, my brother says, I think he's looking for you because he called your name.</span> <span id="s311">And I said, "I don't want to go."</span> <span id="s312">And I want to go all together.</span> <span id="s313">We're going to go all together all of us.</span> <span id="s314">So, my mother said, "No, you go," and she put on I don't know whose coat, my brother's coat on me.</span> <span id="s315">It was cold already.</span> <span id="s316">I don't know what month it was, it was like fall.</span> <span id="s317">She put that coat and she said you're going to keep warm.</span> <span id="s318">You go back.</span> <span id="s319">Maybe by you're going back to work for Robert, you can save us, and we're going to start hiding ourselves in here by the time maybe you can help us.</span> <span id="s320">So, I didn't want to go and I cried.</span> <span id="s321">I said, "Mother, I don't want to go."</span> <span id="s322">He said, "you go."</span> <span id="s323">My brother took me there and he said, "You go with Robert," and he was standing on the truck and the other side of the cane, he always had a cane to hit somebody, so he pulled my neck to him and he said, "You come here," and he took me on the truck and he said, "You're going back, because they needed 75 people back to our town to clean up the town.</span> <span id="s324">My brother and my father and my mother and my sister and the children stayed in that little town.</span> <span id="s325">So, my brother started going for those cards, for the passport.</span> <span id="s326">So, the Pollack who made that passport saw that the Germans are you know the bosses and he said -- and my brother paid him 3,000 slotas, that means like $3,000, and that time it was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s327">So, he said, you better get out of here.</span> <span id="s328">I don't have papers for you and I'm not going to make them.</span> <span id="s329">I have the money and you go out, and if you're not going to get out, I'm going to call the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">So, my brother ran away.</span> <span id="s331">He ran away and he came down, and by that time, my mother and sister and children were hidden in a hole underground.</span> <span id="s332">They found them there, I don't know, because I wasn't there anymore, because they took me back to my town.</span> <span id="s333">They found them there and where their remains are if they were cremated or they were shot, if they were shot whatever happened to them, I don't know, but my father in the morning he used to like to go to the forest.</span> <span id="s334">So, my father went to the forest, and he said I'm going to be back.</span> <span id="s335">So, he was walking around in the forest and after a while he came out.</span> <span id="s336">He didn't know that that they are killing all the people.</span> <span id="s337">They are taking them away and screaming and everything.</span> <span id="s338">He came out and a few Germans on horses they were , because they spoke to him in Polish and they said to him, you SOB, run back because they are going to kill you with all the Jews around, and my father was a Jew, and my father had no choice.</span> <span id="s339">He ran back to the forest, and walking in the forest he was walking and crying and he met somebody was in the forest, a girl.</span> <span id="s340">She came to my father and said she's a Gentile and she said please don't kill me please don't kill me, so my father said don't worry, what's your name and she said Tricia.</span> <span id="s341">I'm from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s342">He said I'm not going to kill you.</span> <span id="s343">I am not to kill you, I'm in the same boat like you are, and I'm going to save you as much as I can.</span> <span id="s344">He did.</span> <span id="s345">He said I'm a Jew like you are and we're going to hide out together, and when he came out nobody was around anymore.</span> <span id="s346">All of them are gone and I by the time I was in in our town in the camp, working and my father was one of the workers, a Pollack, came to the gate and said he wants to see me and I run to gate and I said what happened.</span> <span id="s347">He said, your mother was killed.</span> <span id="s348">Your sister was killed and the children were killed -- no, he said your father is alive and your brother is alive and I said where are the others why don't you tell me.</span> <span id="s349">They are all killed, I didn't want to tell you this.</span> <span id="s350">I said I am going there anyway to bring my brother and my father.</span> <span id="s351">I went in a wagon hidden with straw and I hid in the straw and they brought me because they had to go and see I don't know what the Germans were looking there for and I said I'm going, and they hid me there.</span> <span id="s352">I went and my father and brother and my brother- in-law were there.</span> <span id="s353">So, I brought them back.</span> <span id="s354">I don't know how, but I brought my brother- in-law and father back and my brother said I am going to wait maybe still he is going to give me the papers and he waited.</span> <span id="s355">A few days later my brother came to the gate and he fainted by the gate where I worked but nobody could take anybody in.</span> <span id="s356">It was not allowed.</span> <span id="s357">So, I don't know how but I took him in quietly and I hid him there.</span> <span id="s358">So, her mother, Bessie's mother was someplace around too, and by the gates and she couldn't go in --</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: This was a friend of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yes, her mother, and I took them in there because that SS guy, I went to him and I said "Please take him in, please."</span> <span id="s361">And he said, "I can't, I can't.</span> <span id="s362">I'm not allowed.</span> <span id="s363">They're going to kill me too."</span> <span id="s364">I said, please and he said okay, hide them in the toilet and I'm going to do something about it.</span> <span id="s365">And he did.</span> <span id="s366">So, I got my father and my brother already there and her mother and another girl from our town.</span> <span id="s367">She was sitting hidden in the toilet for two weeks, and whoever came in I said, please don't throw her out.</span> <span id="s368">Let her sit there.</span> <span id="s369">She was so scared and she was shaking and I took him and then my brother went to work to clean up the clothes by the clothes they worked.</span> <span id="s370">By the cemetery they made a big barracks and they put all the clothes from all the town and they had to sort out the good ones and the bad ones and put them in bundles and they were sending them to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Tape # 2</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: So my brother came and he didn't have the papers.</span> <span id="s374">They told him that they are going to announce him to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s375">So, he walked out.</span> <span id="s376">He came to our town and he was working in the city.</span> <span id="s377">He went to work and he met a friend of his.</span> <span id="s378">I think he was in the Army with him together, my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: In the Polish Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: In the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s381">So, because my brother was the oldest brother in the family and so he was born in 1910 so he was not a child and so he was after the Army and he met the guy and he said to my brother why are you miserable what's wrong what happened to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Are you hurt?</span> <span id="s383">Are you hungry?</span> <span id="s384">And he said no, I can't get my gentile papers because they took away my money and my father's paper is Kochonoski, and I want -- no and my father doesn't have the papers really, and I want him to be my father and I am his son and we Polish officers are going to run away.</span> <span id="s385">And he says, okay, take my camp card.</span> <span id="s386">He took off his picture and he gave it to my brother.</span> <span id="s387">He said, "I am going to report that in three months that I lost it.</span> <span id="s388">By that time you make yourself other papers."</span> <span id="s389">So, he gave him the papers that he is Kochonoski, and he made my father his father and they left.</span> <span id="s390">They went to Lemberg, to as Gentiles.</span> <span id="s391">I took my father the night before when they had to leave.</span> <span id="s392">I took him to his friend, and I said Mr. Bishak to my brother's friend, keep my father here one night because they are leaving tomorrow.</span> <span id="s393">And he said, "I can't, because my wife is anti-semitic and she's going to give him out.</span> <span id="s394">I can't do that.</span> <span id="s395">I would love to, and I'm afraid of her."</span> <span id="s396">But I was wearing a Moses on my neck and he said, "Child, give me that Moses and I'm going to keep it for you, if you're going to live, I'm going to give it back."</span> <span id="s397">I still have it.</span> <span id="s398">"I'm going to give it back to you, and I'm going to put a new cross and Maria," and I said fine.</span> <span id="s399">So, I gave him that Moses and I had to take my father away from there.</span> <span id="s400">I kept him.</span> <span id="s401">I took him to another place, to a lady, Nanina (ph) and I said you keep him and she said I will and she kept him overnight.</span> <span id="s402">In the morning they left to Lemberg, and they said you don't come until we're going to send for you, no matter what.</span> <span id="s403">You shouldn't move from here and I said fine.</span> <span id="s404">So, they left.</span> <span id="s405">I was already in the camp in it was , no Jews.</span> <span id="s406">We were just cleaning up the place, we were cleaning up.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: How many were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Oh, it started with about 75 and it wind up over 1,000.</span> <span id="s409">Q: Women and men?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Men and women, yes.</span> <span id="s411">So, Bessie's mother was there with her brother and a cousin and we got very friendly there.</span> <span id="s412">She was a very lovely girl, always smiling and it was a pleasure to be with her in her company and I really fell in love with her like a friend.</span> <span id="s413">I said I'm going to help you with this and whatever because I worked in the kitchen there in the camp.</span> <span id="s414">I was peeling potatoes, a potato peeler.</span> <span id="s415">Then I got sick of Typhus there and that Robert who took me back he told a soldier that he should bring me every day water there and keep me -- I was in a little coop like, and you have to keep give her water and make a little fire to keep her warm and she is going to be okay.</span> <span id="s416">We didn't have any medication nothing and so I got I was crazy.</span> <span id="s417">It went into your head.</span> <span id="s418">After I came out of the sickness I was nuts.</span> <span id="s419">I didn't want to do anything in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s420">I didn't want to peel potatoes and he came in, that Robert, with and he said if you're not going to do what I -- not because he was mad at me, but he wanted me to wake up.</span> <span id="s421">He said, I'm going to beat the hell out of you but you have to work if you want to live.</span> <span id="s422">And I was so scared of him that I started doing it.</span> <span id="s423">So, then I got better with nothing.</span> <span id="s424">We didn't have even an aspirin, nothing, just water.</span> <span id="s425">When you're young, you get through a lot.</span> <span id="s426">So, I make the story short and the camp and one night it was late in '41 I had a dream there that my mother I want to run away.</span> <span id="s427">No, I had a dream that my mother is by the door and I said, "Mother, what kind of mother are you.</span> <span id="s428">I want to run away and you're keeping me here."</span> <span id="s429">And she said, "Over my dead body."</span> <span id="s430">I'm never going to forget that dream.</span> <span id="s431">It was real, I saw her there on the floor and she said you're not going to run away because over my dead body because they're going to shoot you outside and all of sudden we hear screams outside "Arouse, Arouse" that was about 4 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s432">Arouse, so the Germans the Gestapo came, we worked for the SS but then the Gestapo came at 4 o'clock in the morning, and the Gestapo were over the SS, so they said all out and they start you know putting us in lines and the outside people start running and they were all shot outside.</span> <span id="s433">My mother told not to run, and they took us away.</span> <span id="s434">But, before that, there was a guy an engineer with a wife, I told you they even brought me from Germany presents, a raincoat and a rain hat, and a parasol and they said they are going to adopt me and send me to Germany, but it was so sudden that the SS didn't know what the Gestapo was cooking for us and they came to the gate and they were standing in the gate and he saw me going out of the gate and he started crying and he said just like this.</span> <span id="s435">He showed that he couldn't do anything, and they took us on big trucks and we didn't know where we were going.</span> <span id="s436">They shoot a lot of people in the camp there before we left because they were starting to run and they shoot a lady that I knew by my door and her brain was by the door.</span> <span id="s437">Nothing you can do about it.</span> <span id="s438">You saw the brain, you saw that person, pieces, but we had to march out.</span> <span id="s439">They put us in the trucks and they filled up, I don't know how many people in one truck, the rest they took to the Rotunda, you know, it was a Rotunda and they shot them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">What they felt they're not good to work anymore, so they shot and us they took and they were going, driving us and we didn't know where.</span> <span id="s441">Are we going to , going to to be killed or --.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Had you heard about these places already?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: We didn't hear about them, we knew in the camp, we knew it exists.</span> <span id="s444">We knew it goes around or they said we went by already , that means they are not taking us there.</span> <span id="s445">They are taking us someplace else.</span> <span id="s446">We thought to jump, the trucks, but we really -- one said let's jump, let's go, and one said no don't, they're going to kill us.</span> <span id="s447">So, we were in God's hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Did you think you were going to work somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No, we knew they are going to kill us.</span> <span id="s450">We are going to death, because we weren't dressed.</span> <span id="s451">I was in my nightgown.</span> <span id="s452">We weren't even dressed, with a coat on top.</span> <span id="s453">We didn't know really where we were going, but when we passed those death places we knew that they are -- it's death camps, just ovens, not even camps, just straight to the crematory.</span> <span id="s454">So, we went by it and we said, no we're going someplace else.</span> <span id="s455">So, you know, we lived with hope that maybe we're going to live.</span> <span id="s456">They brought us into Maidanek.</span> <span id="s457">After a long, long drive they brought us into Maidanek, and they told us to undress and to take a shower.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">They put us into cold showers and they took away everything.</span> <span id="s459">They gave us old junk to put on us, and they took away all our jewelry but you see before we left we were smarter, we put all the jewelry in the toilet.</span> <span id="s460">We had packs.</span> <span id="s461">We were sitting on it so we put everything there.</span> <span id="s462">We said let's not give anything to them.</span> <span id="s463">But I forgot that I had long hair and I forgot that I had my earrings with my monogram in my ears and my hair covered it, so it went through, but everything went and we were naked.</span> <span id="s464">The men, they took separate and they undressed the men naked and they left them only the strap in the hands and they told them to hold the strap in their hands and they let German Shepherds after them.</span> <span id="s465">And you know, when you have something in the hand and the German Shepherds went wild and they were biting out pieces of meat of the people.</span> <span id="s466">This was the beginning of Maidanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: You were watching all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: We were watching.</span> <span id="s469">The women were separate, but the men were running.</span> <span id="s470">We were naked, we didn't have straps.</span> <span id="s471">Men had pants with straps so they had the straps and the German Shepherds tore them apart.</span> <span id="s472">So, we went into the camp.</span> <span id="s473">They took us in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: When you arrived did you see prisoners already there?</span> <span id="s475">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: What did they look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: They looked like prisoners with an L on the back, the striped clothes with on the back.</span> <span id="s478">that means concentration camp.</span> <span id="s479">That was a concentration camp, Maidanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Do you remember what month you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: I don't remember months, just like I remember barely in the beginning I did remember.</span> <span id="s482">Q: This was the beginning of '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: No, yes, we went in '42 to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s484">Q: So, this was before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Before that, we were about eight months in that camp.</span> <span id="s486">Q: In Maidanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: In Maidanek, about six months maybe.</span> <span id="s488">I don't remember exactly but so we went into that Maidanek and they took us in.</span> <span id="s489">They dressed us in clothes and they took us in.</span> <span id="s490">We marched in.</span> <span id="s491">The women separate.</span> <span id="s492">The men separate.</span> <span id="s493">I don't know how many blocks it was, about five all together I guess and we had about one block that were men and the men had the rest.</span> <span id="s494">They had kitchens in the men's place but not by us.</span> <span id="s495">By us we only did work and when we came from work they used to put us -- we worked like not melioration, we put grass in the -- the men were bringing us the water.</span> <span id="s496">They were the horses and the wagons, and they pulled the wagons with water and they gave us buckets of water and we watered the grass there.</span> <span id="s497">That was the job in Maidanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: How long did you water the grass?</span> <span id="s499">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s500">That was my job.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: You were beautifying the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yes, beautifying the camp, and that's what you know my husband was there too.</span> <span id="s503">He paid his bread -- he worked someplace else, that he wants once to go to the women's camp to see me and I took off my earrings and I put them in a piece of my undershirt and I had them in my shoes because the shoes didn't take away.</span> <span id="s504">I just cut off my heals and I was walking like backwards but I had them in my shoes and when he came I took him out and when he was giving me the water I just gave him those earrings and he didn't know what it is and I gave him my bread because men need more bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: How did you know your husband was there?</span> <span id="s506">You hadn't seen him in a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: No, but I was working there and I saw him coming because he told somebody that he's going to be that day through -- like a messenger like you know one word comes to another that he's going to try to see me that day.</span> <span id="s508">So, he didn't nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: That's sort of miraculous that you found each other again there?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Yes, but only for a day, only for a minute really.</span> <span id="s511">I gave him those earrings and he put them away because and then we worked and we went in the evenings we went to the camp.</span> <span id="s512">Saturday and Sunday they used to put us -- the camp was with high electric wires and in between was so much place, very little about maybe how many inches I don't know ten, twenty inches, I don't know, between the wires.</span> <span id="s513">They used to let us in between the wires and sit there and we couldn't move because if you move one way it's electric and you move the other so you were sitting there one by one around the wires.</span> <span id="s514">This was our past time or we used to they used to give us a job to bring stones from one corner to another, the same stone.</span> <span id="s515">We bring it to one corner of the camp and bring it back, go back and forth like you see ants working, you know.</span> <span id="s516">They're going back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Why were you doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: For nothing, just because they wanted to occupy us.</span> <span id="s519">We shouldn't be free.</span> <span id="s520">We shouldn't have free time.</span> <span id="s521">I don't know in Polish we say , that means, sesame work.</span> <span id="s522">It didn't take you any place and we didn't do anything, so we used to work that time like this and then we went out when the food was ready.</span> <span id="s523">So, from the men's camp they came in with the food on wagons to bring us the food.</span> <span id="s524">The men cooked for the whole camp, so one my neighbor saw me there standing and waiting for the food and he looked at me and he said "Are you hungry?"</span> <span id="s525">And I said, I didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s526">I was afraid to say something but I just nod my head yes.</span> <span id="s527">So, he threw down on the floor a few green peas without the greens peas, just the shell and I picked it up.</span> <span id="s528">So, somebody saw it and they took me into the camp and they gave me 25 on my back.</span> <span id="s529">They took off my clothes and I was in the whole block, the whole block is like the barrack was watching.</span> <span id="s530">They were beating me.</span> <span id="s531">I felt maybe three times and the rest I didn't feel anymore.</span> <span id="s532">So, they gave me 25 on my bare back.</span> <span id="s533">I was -- there was nothing you could do about it.</span> <span id="s534">I had open wounds and the girls, her mother tried to wrote they tried to soothe me and said "Don't worry."</span> <span id="s535">They dressed me slowly and they took me out to work and my girls about I don't know a few of them ten girls, fifteen girls they were all around me and they were really taking care of me to bring me back, because they thought I was going to die.</span> <span id="s536">So, that was in Maidanek.</span> <span id="s537">After that it was so bad that whoever wanted to run away they -- a girl wanted to run away, we didn't who she was, and they found her.</span> <span id="s538">They brought her back and they put us all in an , a counting and they put us all in the middle of the camp, and they put her to be hanged.</span> <span id="s539">They hanged her and they let her hang on a windy day, very windy, and she was dinging three days and three nights and we were afraid to look at it.</span> <span id="s540">You know, to show us that that's what's going to happen to us if someone even tried to run away.</span> <span id="s541">So nobody tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: No other examples of --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Nobody was.</span> <span id="s544">We couldn't.</span> <span id="s545">At that time we didn't have our numbers because the numbers they gave us in Birkenau, in Auschwitz they gave numbers, but in any other camps we didn't have any numbers.</span> <span id="s546">Nobody did.</span> <span id="s547">So, we just they told us thousand times a day that if you're going to run away, that's what's waiting for us.</span> <span id="s548">So, we were afraid.</span> <span id="s549">We were there for about I don't know and we whisper went around that they were going to transfer us someplace else.</span> <span id="s550">We don't know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: I want to talk a little more about Maidanek before you move on.</span> <span id="s552">One thing I read was that in the beginning, maybe you were there a little later, they didn't even have water.</span> <span id="s553">It was hard for people --?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: It was nothing.</span> <span id="s555">No where was water.</span> <span id="s556">They let us in.</span> <span id="s557">They gave us ten minutes, not only in Maidanek, in Auschwitz too, they give us five minutes each to go into to wash, and it was cold water.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No, sometimes when you went in.</span> <span id="s560">We didn't have toilets we went out not even an outhouse, under there someplace where ever we found a place.</span> <span id="s561">We didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s562">We didn't have a paper so you know what I used to do to take pieces of my underwear and I used that until my underwear was to here but because we had to give them back one to get a new one.</span> <span id="s563">So, this was to left to give it back to get a new one.</span> <span id="s564">So, you see we didn't have any paper.</span> <span id="s565">We didn't have any water.</span> <span id="s566">We had very little food.</span> <span id="s567">We had just barely to live through the day, a little soup which was terrible from cabbage, rotten cabbage and collarabi.</span> <span id="s568">It was the worst thing you ever ate in your life, but when you're hungry you try to swallow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: What did you eat it in?</span> <span id="s570">A: We ate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Did you have your own dish?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yes, they gave us dishes and we used to put the dish in here, under and it looked like this and this was our dish to wash ourselves.</span> <span id="s573">I washed my face in it.</span> <span id="s574">Sometimes, I don't know how to say, I went number one in that thing and we ate soup in it and the soup it wasn't too much.</span> <span id="s575">It was just like a cup of soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Were you able to rinse it?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: With the coffee they gave us in the morning, not coffee.</span> <span id="s578">They were leaves, like burned leaves, they made brown water, so with this we washed the faces and we washed the dish and that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: How crowded was your block?</span> <span id="s580">Were you sharing a bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s582">It was like ten in a bed, eight in a bed, one foot.</span> <span id="s583">You know, we were sleeping like sixes, six and nine just like this and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Did you have a straw mattress?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: It was supposed to be a straw mattress but it was almost nothing in it.</span> <span id="s586">And it was bedbugs, a lot of bedbugs, a lot of lice, very much a lot of lice and a lot of fleas.</span> <span id="s587">Everything you can think about was there and it was on us.</span> <span id="s588">They ate us alive.</span> <span id="s589">so instead of drinking that coffee I washed my body with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Did you ever get sick and go to the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: No, if you went to the hospital, you never come out.</span> <span id="s592">This is it.</span> <span id="s593">Even if you were sick -- we had girls who had typhus and you were dragging them to work, not to go there because and then I'm going to come back to that Tricia.</span> <span id="s594">She died, who my father found and brought into the camp and then she'd wind up with me and all of the camps too.</span> <span id="s595">So, all of a sudden we heard a rumor that they are going to whoever wants to go for a transport can go for a transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: I still want to ask a question.</span> <span id="s597">One thing I think may be unusual, in Maidanek there were a number of children weren't there?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes, they were all killed or they, when they brought them to Auschwitz they separated them and they went straight to the oven to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: What were they doing in Maidanek, were they working?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: The kids, nothing.</span> <span id="s601">They were playing around.</span> <span id="s602">Kids, you know, but they weren't doing anything.</span> <span id="s603">It wasn't kids, little tiny like tiny kids, it was like nine years old.</span> <span id="s604">They told one little nine year old in Maidanek to hang his father and he did.</span> <span id="s605">So, this is what -- they brainwashed you.</span> <span id="s606">They made you they didn't call us person like you know in German is mensch, they called the dog mensch and us they hound, hound is a dog.</span> <span id="s607">So, they didn't call us by name.</span> <span id="s608">They called us by hound and their dogs were mensch, people, and we were the dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: The people's behavior did they adapt?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: No, people's behavior was like animals.</span> <span id="s611">When they saw food, they grabbed food from somebody else.</span> <span id="s612">They would kill you for a little soup.</span> <span id="s613">It was unbelievable how people in our how you say it in those circumstances how they behaved.</span> <span id="s614">Some, when you had a little bit of education, intelligence you knew better you behaved a little different, but some were very, very poor and common people brought in.</span> <span id="s615">They didn't know better.</span> <span id="s616">They were fighting for their life.</span> <span id="s617">They would kill for a little just soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: How did you respond to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: I was never aggressive.</span> <span id="s620">I am not a big eater, and thanks to that I was never hungry, really, really hungry to go for somebody's food or to whatever I got sometimes I was trading my little soup for a little piece of bread with a little margarine and the margarine was like a little tiny square and very thin, but it gave me a little energy.</span> <span id="s621">So, this I was never aggressive, never.</span> <span id="s622">I had later on in Birkenau friends who were aggressive and they were going to the garbage and they brought food and they wake me up and they said you have a soup from peels from the potatoes or whatever it was in the garbage but that was later on.</span> <span id="s623">In the beginning, I was quiet and satisfied with whatever I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Were you surprised by the other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Very, they used to put the heads in those big pots of what they brought the food and liquid the tanks there and I said what kind of animals are they because they made us animals.</span> <span id="s626">They made from people unbelievably animals.</span> <span id="s627">I think not everybody had a mind to control themselves and they broke you down and you couldn't control.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: One more question about Maidanek, the guards, the kopos, your block elders, who were they, what were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: They were all mean.</span> <span id="s630">You were afraid to talk.</span> <span id="s631">You were afraid to say anything.</span> <span id="s632">You weren't afraid of them like of the dogs because they didn't do anything to you, they just let the dogs go.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Were they Germans or were they Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Germans, Germans and many, many Poles too.</span> <span id="s635">They made themselves that they were , you know.</span> <span id="s636">That means that they have mixed blood, half of this and half of that.</span> <span id="s637">The worst people of all were the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s638">They were in black uniforms and the Lithuanians were worse than any Pole or any German.</span> <span id="s639">They were the most daring people alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: This was in Maidanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: That was before Maidanek in everywhere they were -- we were afraid of the black uniforms, because we knew that they are Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s642">They were they wanted to be better for the Fuhrer than the Germans.</span> <span id="s643">They were terrible people.</span> <span id="s644">They hated the Jews a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">They hated our guts.</span> <span id="s646">We were afraid more of them than anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: You were starting to say that there were either selections or you heard there were going to be transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: At the same time, were there a lot of new transports coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: I didn't know about it, must be, but maybe when we left they brought new people.</span> <span id="s651">They had to replace, not very roomy places, but at least to squeeze us in.</span> <span id="s652">I used to like to sleep by the end of that piece of wood, the bed like because nobody breathed on me.</span> <span id="s653">I'd rather breathe on the wall so I rather had the box from the wall come out on me than the breathing from other people, so they didn't need much place, but I didn't see any transports.</span> <span id="s654">Then when we heard that it's going to be transports so my husband sent me word from the men's camp that he is going to register for a transport, I should do it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: It was your choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Yes, you could register or you could be killed.</span> <span id="s657">They gave you the choice to leave the place and go to a worse one, but we didn't know if it was worse.</span> <span id="s658">We thought it was better.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: I'm sorry to do this, but I want to back track just once more.</span> <span id="s660">Were there any gassings or burnings done at Maidanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: No.</span> <span id="s662">They used to be they're gassing I think at the beginning where they just took you to work and they gas you there because we knew and we saw those gassing chambers but not people.</span> <span id="s663">They didn't gas them anymore.</span> <span id="s664">So, then we had the right to go for a transport.</span> <span id="s665">They knew that we not going to a resort place.</span> <span id="s666">They knew they were sending us to worse places and this is the way the Germans did their work and that to be to make you very little in not thinking.</span> <span id="s667">You know but they gave you like a little authority.</span> <span id="s668">You can register, but they did what they wanted to do.</span> <span id="s669">So, we registered and they took us away and we didn't know where, and so did my husband.</span> <span id="s670">They took him to Mauthausen and they took me to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Do you remember approximately when this is?</span> <span id="s672">A: Oh, I don't know, 1942, someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: It was like fall, it was fall.</span> <span id="s675">I know it was cold but so they took us out.</span> <span id="s676">They marched us out of Maidanek and they took us to -- we marched to the train and that wasn't people train they were animal trains or coal trains or whatever and they put me in a coal train.</span> <span id="s677">I was black when I came out of there.</span> <span id="s678">I looked like a black person.</span> <span id="s679">In Polish negroes they didn't say they said black people are coming.</span> <span id="s680">The black people are coming because we came out we were black from the coal and this is later.</span> <span id="s681">I just go back, they put us in those and they gave us a little bread and they didn't give us water, they gave us a little margarine and a little cheese.</span> <span id="s682">We were in the train about four days without water.</span> <span id="s683">We begged them for water.</span> <span id="s684">They didn't want to give us.</span> <span id="s685">Many of us died.</span> <span id="s686">They were jumping over the dead people to the window to scream out for water, please water.</span> <span id="s687">Nothing was more important than water.</span> <span id="s688">They didn't give us any.</span> <span id="s689">So, we used to make number one and we used to drink it.</span> <span id="s690">What could you do.</span> <span id="s691">Maybe people don't -- I don't know how many you interview don't tell those things, but this is the truth.</span> <span id="s692">So, we had some water, it was salty, but water.</span> <span id="s693">So, we came into they took us four days for a ride.</span> <span id="s694">I don't know if I was lucky or not because after the war I even say, why am I alive and the rest perished.</span> <span id="s695">I don't know if I'm lucky.</span> <span id="s696">I should go with all of them, but maybe it was my luck.</span> <span id="s697">I don't know.</span> <span id="s698">Thank God I have three children and I would have them if I wouldn't be here.</span> <span id="s699">So, they took us there and they brought us in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s700">It was very dark, very dark when they brought us in.</span> <span id="s701">They stopped the train and they took us out and that was already in Berchanau.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: How many went with you?</span> <span id="s703">A: A lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: A thousand?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: More than that, more than that.</span> <span id="s706">Maybe two or three thousand people.</span> <span id="s707">Germans were in a line lined up, the Gestapo with dogs by the train and like they saw me they said go this way.</span> <span id="s708">They saw an old person this way.</span> <span id="s709">This way, this way, children left and right.</span> <span id="s710">Left and right, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s711">Who knew what means left and we went where they told us to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: This was a different system than at Maidanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: It was different.</span> <span id="s714">In Maidanek they took everybody who came from everyplace.</span> <span id="s715">This was the segregation because in Auschwitz or in Birkenau they want you to still be healthy and able to work, and they had there later when I went to work, I saw them, but they had there all working people who had still a lot of energy in them.</span> <span id="s716">Energy at least and the old and the children they put separate.</span> <span id="s717">It was screaming and pulling.</span> <span id="s718">The parents pulled the children to them and they pulled them out of them, the Germans.</span> <span id="s719">And they were hitting the people and they were hitting the children and they were taking out the children and beating and killing those children if you're not going to get into here that's what's going to happen to your child.</span> <span id="s720">It was the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s721">It was awful.</span> <span id="s722">It was screaming.</span> <span id="s723">I can still hear the hollerings, the screamings, the cryings.</span> <span id="s724">It was an old couple he was in a uniform with his wife.</span> <span id="s725">He was holding her hand and they pulled them apart.</span> <span id="s726">That he is a man.</span> <span id="s727">He has to go to the men and she should go with the women.</span> <span id="s728">Because they didn't gas you with men and women together.</span> <span id="s729">Women separate and men separate who has to go, and children whatever.</span> <span id="s730">So, they pulled them apart and got the screaming.</span> <span id="s731">They took our children from our camp didn't come with toys because they didn't have the toys, but from the freedom they came with toys and they took away the toys.</span> <span id="s732">They keep them, the kids and you saw the kids walking to the ovens in and the parents and all of a sudden you hear screaming.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: There were people coming from other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: From other places too, of course.</span> <span id="s735">But they separate everything and they let us in to the -- took us into the camp and it was still very dark when they took us into the working camps.</span> <span id="s736">They took us in and in the front was an orchestra playing, orchestra real people playing music to the march and they said left and right, left and right and left, left, left.</span> <span id="s737">They were singing to us, and we had to march to their singing.</span> <span id="s738">We marched in and we came in there and they looked at that part of the train of us and they saw negroes, they said black people.</span> <span id="s739">Because we only had the eyes showing the faces because you touched from the coal the faces all the time.</span> <span id="s740">We didn't know how we looked.</span> <span id="s741">We came in and they put us under showers, cold showers.</span> <span id="s742">They took us in and they said now you go into showers.</span> <span id="s743">The other one went into the gas chambers they told them the showers too, but we went to give us clothes.</span> <span id="s744">They took all our clothes away.</span> <span id="s745">They shaved our heads.</span> <span id="s746">They shaved us all over and they gave us clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: What were you thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: We didn't recognize each other.</span> <span id="s749">When we came out and we said that's you, that's you, that's Tricia and that's Rose?</span> <span id="s750">We didn't recognize each other.</span> <span id="s751">That wasn't the worst part.</span> <span id="s752">They gave us pieces of material to cover the head because it was cold and it was very, very cold at that time.</span> <span id="s753">They let us in to the shower, cold water and all of a sudden they put hot water, like hot and cold, hot and cold.</span> <span id="s754">It was screaming terrible because here they bend us and here they give us cold water, cold, freeze us.</span> <span id="s755">They gave us barracks to go into.</span> <span id="s756">They gave me the 21st block.</span> <span id="s757">Then he came into the blocks and I came with her mother.</span> <span id="s758">We were in one block.</span> <span id="s759">We keep each other together.</span> <span id="s760">We hold.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: I need you to explain something.</span> <span id="s762">When somebody looks at this tape many years from now, they're not going to know who her mother is.</span> <span id="s763">They didn't know who her is.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: That's what I want to say.</span> <span id="s765">I and we hold hands with Hannah at that time I didn't know her name but she was and I held hands with Tricia that my father found, and other girls and we said we're going to stay together.</span> <span id="s766">We hold each other together.</span> <span id="s767">Don't let us part, but we couldn't help.</span> <span id="s768">It so happened that we went to the same barrack, so we were all together and we became I and and many others, she was now and we were holding hands.</span> <span id="s769">Before we went there to the blocks.</span> <span id="s770">They took us into tattoo us.</span> <span id="s771">So, we went in for tattoos.</span> <span id="s772">We were already clean so they tattoo us.</span> <span id="s773">So, they took just a pen and ink and they stretched our skin and they put the pen in one place and they scratch like a four, they scratch that piece and they put another dot and they scratch it farther and the scratch was the whole time was scratching.</span> <span id="s774">Then they put a -- this is a half of a little Jewish star so some had tattoos, some had the tattoos here, some had here a little higher, some had that here, the pants.</span> <span id="s775">So, this is what and that was my number.</span> <span id="s776">They stretch our skin.</span> <span id="s777">They put the pen just pen and ink, they made a hole and they scratched it under the skin until they have to make the four the other corner and they pulled it this way.</span> <span id="s778">That's the way you see they scratched inside and you'll see in each beginning and in each corner a dot because from there on they went farther.</span> <span id="s779">That was the number.</span> <span id="s780">Some had bigger numbers.</span> <span id="s781">This was the pen.</span> <span id="s782">They knew that this transport came at that and that time, like in '42, they came in.</span> <span id="s783">So, they know when we came in.</span> <span id="s784">Others had different places too.</span> <span id="s785">Then the gave us numbers the same numbers to put on the clothes.</span> <span id="s786">So we had the numbers here, we had the number here we had the number some on the back, some you know the men had it in the back but we had them only here and here because if you're going to run away this is an easy target.</span> <span id="s787">You can find the person right away.</span> <span id="s788">So, that's what they did and they gave us blocks so if you went into the blocks we were all numbered and we all dressed in striped clothes and we went and they gave us underwear.</span> <span id="s789">I don't know what kind and who had it before and they gave us wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s790">Huge ones, on my foot I was a five and they gave me a man's big shoe so we were just walking in them and put some junk in it, like whatever we found to fill it out.</span> <span id="s791">Those were wooden shoes, wooden bottoms and material like junky material tops.</span> <span id="s792">That was our shoes and that's why the dress.</span> <span id="s793">When we saw each other how we looked and how we dressed we laughed and we cried and we didn't know what -- we really didn't know how to behave.</span> <span id="s794">We laughed like I was you know bald so I didn't see me but I saw her, the other person.</span> <span id="s795">So, we were all bald.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: One thing that I am sort of curious about is how the physical conditions at Auschwitz compared to what you experienced at Maidanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Different, much, much different.</span> <span id="s800">Hannah she was a very clean lady.</span> <span id="s801">She loved cleanliness and so am I and we were afraid that we were going to get like everybody else.</span> <span id="s802">They had malaria.</span> <span id="s803">They had typhus.</span> <span id="s804">They had and that everything together and besides everything from the dirt we had sores from the body.</span> <span id="s805">If somebody didn't wash, they just died from that.</span> <span id="s806">They went to the gas chambers with those sores, but Hannah, , used to wake me up in the middle of the night and she said you know what, I found a place that's called they wash clothes and water is dripping a little in the middle of the night we went out with her because we weren't allowed, but we sneaked out.</span> <span id="s807">I'm always forgetting I always say barrack and we always sneaked out and we cleansed ourselves.</span> <span id="s808">Thanks to her she gave me the courage she said come on, come on let's go because you like to be clean and so do</span></p> <p><span id="s809">I. So, we washed ourselves with that little drop of water, we shared it.</span> <span id="s810">So, that was very important.</span> <span id="s811">It was a terrible, they gave us five minutes to go to the bathroom, and we were sitting around and you know, number one, it wasn't a bathroom, it was a room with holes and you could sit there for five minutes and they opened the water in the morning for five minutes you have to get to the water and wash your face and drink a little water and go to work.</span> <span id="s812">They start counting us going out to work we had to be all together.</span> <span id="s813">They count us.</span> <span id="s814">They separate us who is going where to what work to what shop and we had to march out by the music, no matter what.</span> <span id="s815">The music was waiting for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Who was playing the music?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: People from-- they were in concentration camp and they asked them if they know how to play and they gave them instruments and they told them to play.</span> <span id="s818">They cry and play because what else can you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: What were the actual physical conditions like?</span> <span id="s820">How did they differ from Maidanek?</span> <span id="s821">Was it more comfortable, less comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Less, less, it was worse.</span> <span id="s823">First of all they made selections every few weeks.</span> <span id="s824">They looked at you naked.</span> <span id="s825">You had to go through naked with your clothes on your arm and they looked you through like cattle and looked at your teeth, exactly like cows like cattle, they're buying cows to work.</span> <span id="s826">So, they looked us through from the front and from the back and they went around us like you know looking all over you.</span> <span id="s827">This was selections, called selections, and they selected if you were still good to work they send you straight ahead and if not they took you out on the side.</span> <span id="s828">So, you knew that this was the end.</span> <span id="s829">So one time in a selection like this, I had a friend from my town and her name was .</span> <span id="s830">I forgot her name and last night I was thinking and I said you know, I think I know the name, it's , and she was heavy, and I was a skinny girl and she was very, very heavy and she lost a lot of weight and she said but I'm still heavier than you.</span> <span id="s831">You are bones.</span> <span id="s832">You see sometimes on television those thin boned people.</span> <span id="s833">We call them , a is a piece of gold, nothing else, just bones or a musselman.</span> <span id="s834">A musselman is completely to nothing.</span> <span id="s835">He couldn't walk any more.</span> <span id="s836">That was a musselman, and that she said to me I was going before her and she was behind me and she said, you know let's change places because when they look at you they are going to take you to the gas chamber and I have here on my arm a wound and she said put the clothes because we should keep the clothes in our right hand, not the left and she said change it and you cover this because even with a little thing like this they took you to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s837">So, and she said I'm going to walk before you and you after.</span> <span id="s838">They're going to look at me not you they're not going to see you.</span> <span id="s839">She was right.</span> <span id="s840">A fat person when you lose weight your skin hangs, and she went through and they took her aside and they took down her number and I went through.</span> <span id="s841">She went to the gas chamber, but she was working with us for two weeks.</span> <span id="s842">They took down her number and every day they're going to call me now, they're going to call me today, and I said why did you do that for me?</span> <span id="s843">You could live and I could go, and she no, I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s844">You're going to stay here and she gave me her piece of bread and she said you take care of yourself.</span> <span id="s845">So, anyway, after two weeks they called her name and she went to the gas chamber and I went through like they didn't see me, like she said.</span> <span id="s846">And I always have her on my conscious that maybe she was saving me that maybe she went instead of me.</span> <span id="s847">I don't know.</span> <span id="s848">I have that on my conscious many, many years.</span> <span id="s849">So, I come out of there and she was calming me down, don't worry.</span> <span id="s850">I want to go, I want you to live and I wanted to go I have nothing to live for.</span> <span id="s851">Maybe you'll find your father and your brother.</span> <span id="s852">Maybe you're still going to have anybody to live for.</span> <span id="s853">So, she kissed me goodbye and she gave me the bread and she went.</span> <span id="s854">They used make a , they used to take all our clothes and put it, in the winter time, and like a big huge I don't know, it was like a swimming pool with water, and they put something in it to kill the lice and all the insects.</span> <span id="s855">So, they gave you back those clothes and you had to go to work, so you put them on wet until you walk out to work it as frozen on you, but this was our life.</span> <span id="s856">You asked me how different it was.</span> <span id="s857">It was completely different.</span> <span id="s858">Then when we came into the camp, you smelled the flesh.</span> <span id="s859">You smelled burning.</span> <span id="s860">You walked out, you saw on the other side camps like each had a name.</span> <span id="s861">We had Loger A, Loger B, Loger C.</span> <span id="s862">In one there were all gypsies.</span> <span id="s863">In the other one were children or Gentiles, not only Jews and then the third one was anybody who was a little crippled had you know a hunch back or something.</span> <span id="s864">That's a cripple.</span> <span id="s865">So every time he came back from work another one was gone.</span> <span id="s866">No more children, no more playing, no more singing and they didn't like homosexuals and they killed them all too.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: So, they would liquidate a block at a time?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Yes, all of a sudden you would see it's missing.</span> <span id="s869">It's not there any more.</span> <span id="s870">Then we saw the fire going.</span> <span id="s871">I lived closed to a crematorium.</span> <span id="s872">The smell was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s873">The screams were terrible.</span> <span id="s874">You heard them screaming going in, not because they were afraid.</span> <span id="s875">They didn't tell them they were going to death.</span> <span id="s876">They just told them that they were going to go for a shower and they were going to come out.</span> <span id="s877">But still, when they went in, one pushed the other the mother wants to go with the child, it was terrible screams.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: How did you learn what that was, the smoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: We knew who was burning.</span> <span id="s880">You know when fresh transports came from freedom -- not really freedom, they were better off wherever they were like at Bergen-Belsen or in other camps than Auschwitz, so they had a little flesh on them, so when the flesh was burning you saw only smoke.</span> <span id="s881">You didn't see a fire, you know.</span> <span id="s882">The flames you didn't see, only smoke.</span> <span id="s883">When we were burning, like those musselmens, like what they didn't like, you saw flames.</span> <span id="s884">So, we knew that those are the freedom people and those are our people.</span> <span id="s885">We knew who was who, burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: How did you first learn what was going on in there at all, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: The minute they brought you in and they send you to work and you saw before people were coming in to work it was just a crematorium.</span> <span id="s888">Or they brought them in not a crematorium made to burn but they were killing them there because we were finding spoons on the floor, bones, heads, we saw heads with hair to work.</span> <span id="s889">We saw because I don't think they buried them very deep and they were buried -- you know we could see.</span> <span id="s890">We were walking on bones and hair, on heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Do you think these were things that didn't get burned properly?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: No, they didn't have the oven finished yet, so they just killed them and they just covered them with I think a very, they were not covered much and we found like spoons and forks and things like this.</span> <span id="s893">We were lucky we found those.</span> <span id="s894">We had something to eat with because we ate with the fingers.</span> <span id="s895">It was not civilization.</span> <span id="s896">It was, I think in the old ages, they had a better civilization that we had.</span> <span id="s897">Germans looked us over naked like pieces of meat.</span> <span id="s898">We didn't have our period time because they put something in your food that we weren't women.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: How do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Because I worked later in the kitchen and we were putting in -- it was very bitter what we put in.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: I don't remember the name of it.</span> <span id="s903">It was like a powder and you put that powder into the soup and we at that so a woman wasn't a woman and a man wasn't a man either, I suppose.</span> <span id="s904">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: They didn't tell you what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: You just saw the results?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s909">We didn't have periods.</span> <span id="s910">We were young because how you know how we never being there we didn't think about if we're going to live.</span> <span id="s911">We didn't know we were going to live through it.</span> <span id="s912">If we would live through it if we're going to be able to have children, to bear children.</span> <span id="s913">Never never in life because we didn't even have -- I was married already.</span> <span id="s914">I had a child already.</span> <span id="s915">There, is I said I have a child and I had a husband and they used to say I was nuts because I looked like a little girl.</span> <span id="s916">We were bones, no breasts, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">They took away our dignity.</span> <span id="s918">They took away everything you have in life, and we didn't care.</span> <span id="s919">We just didn't want to suffer, but we didn't care, but we did suffer because they saw we used to go to work every morning.</span> <span id="s920">At first you used to work in the outside commander.</span> <span id="s921">So, we used to go out in the fields.</span> <span id="s922">In the fields we found a row of potatoes.</span> <span id="s923">It was a jewel.</span> <span id="s924">In the outside commander we were in the fields.</span> <span id="s925">When we found a row of potatoes we ate it like it is.</span> <span id="s926">No water, no nothing, with the dirt and everything, so and it was so good that I used to say if I'm going to live ever.</span> <span id="s927">If I'm going to live, after a dinner if I'm going to have enough dinner that's going to be my desert.</span> <span id="s928">It was so delicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: What kind of work were you doing in the outside commando?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: In the outside commando I don't know what this is called in America.</span> <span id="s931">We called it .</span> <span id="s932">If you took that in your hand, your body burned.</span> <span id="s933">That's a reed, like a burning reed and from this they made soups in the kitchen, so we used to pick those.</span> <span id="s934">A whole day with our hands.</span> <span id="s935">We felt that our hands were so swollen after a day, and we brought that into the kitchen to cook the soups from it.</span> <span id="s936">Sometimes we went into the swamps, because it was swampy.</span> <span id="s937">Auschwitz was swampy and we went into the water to the knees or higher and we were pulling those reeds from there and we are putting those reeds they gave us to fill after the day after we picked them, they gave us pieces of like socks and we put them for a mattress.</span> <span id="s938">That's supposed to be our mattress, but those reeds are very sharp on the ends and they cut our hands.</span> <span id="s939">That didn't matter.</span> <span id="s940">We were bleeding.</span> <span id="s941">We were swollen, but that was our job and we wanted to live, or you couldn't kill yourself.</span> <span id="s942">You didn't have any sources to kill yourself.</span> <span id="s943">How, people were running to the electric wires or shot when you were running.</span> <span id="s944">So, and I think we were chicken.</span> <span id="s945">We didn't have the guts to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: There was a lot of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s948">Lots of it because you didn't have the guts.</span> <span id="s949">You wanted to die but you didn't know how and so this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: You must have also wanted to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Must be.</span> <span id="s952">I remember why I wanted to live, because I knew that my father and brother are free and maybe some day we are going to meet.</span> <span id="s953">And I knew that I have a lot of uncles in America.</span> <span id="s954">I never knew my uncles even my father didn't remember them and they were living in Cleveland Ohio and they were in American and I thought maybe the American Army will come and they are going to bombard the place and some are going to get killed so it doesn't matter but at least somebody is going to get saved, you know be saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">That's what we did in the beginning.</span> <span id="s956">Then they were selecting people all the time in the morning where to go and they selected me to .</span> <span id="s957">Did you hear about and they selected me and Hannah and the same to work and that was heaven.</span> <span id="s958">We were you know inside closed in.</span> <span id="s959">We were segregating clothes, which ones were good, which were bad or finding gold and diamonds and had to put them in boxes because they were watching you like hawks.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: These were items from the new transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: From all the transports.</span> <span id="s962">Everybody who came in.</span> <span id="s963">We found, first of all we had to check all the seams in the dresses if there are not diamonds there.</span> <span id="s964">They were watching you what you're doing.</span> <span id="s965">We had to throw the diamonds in there.</span> <span id="s966">We had everything put bundles made big, big bundles and put them together and put them up you know in bunches and right away people came in and took them to a train and they were transported, the good ones, to Germany.</span> <span id="s967">And the bad one we had to cut and tear into pieces.</span> <span id="s968">So, that's what we did in .</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: How did you get chosen for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Just because they were going through the lines and they were choosing faces.</span> <span id="s971">I think they liked me.</span> <span id="s972">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s974">Was it a strange feeling going through the clothes of all these people like yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Very.</span> <span id="s976">We knew, you know we found in Jewish clothes big crosses, bibles, catholic bibles because they were already, I think they changed their religion and they thought they were going to be saved.</span> <span id="s977">But Hitler found the generation of Jews and some came there and an old lady came in and said I am not Jewish why am I here.</span> <span id="s978">She said my grandparents were Jewish.</span> <span id="s979">I said, that's why you're here because the Germans were the most stupid Jews in the world.</span> <span id="s980">They didn't believe.</span> <span id="s981">They said we're going to win.</span> <span id="s982">That's our Germany.</span> <span id="s983">Hitler's going to vanish.</span> <span id="s984">You see, they didn't believe.</span> <span id="s985">They believe our Germany and they really believed in them that they are not going to kill them because they are Germans.</span> <span id="s986">So, we used to when walking to work in Birkenau we're going every morning to Auschwitz, four kilometers to Auschwitz to , and they told us to sing, what we were singing, but I can't sing so I'm going to just talk and it's like , you know what that means.</span> <span id="s987">The shoes and the stockings are torn and the dresses are , that means they are in pieces and , that means through the underwear when you whistles the wind.</span> <span id="s988">So they said it German .</span> <span id="s989">That was our song going out to work and it has to be left, left, left, left.</span> <span id="s990">This has to be everyday.</span> <span id="s991">And sometimes when they were mean, they told us to take off the shoes in the middle of the winter and walk out barefoot to work.</span> <span id="s992">That was meanness and we had to pile up the shoes by the gate.</span> <span id="s993">But the music was playing and we were walking.</span> <span id="s994">If we had sick friends we were holding them up and we were walking out with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Did any of the other prisoners resent you for being in this or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: No.</span> <span id="s997">Then I worked in another place.</span> <span id="s998">We were building buildings.</span> <span id="s999">We were making railroads.</span> <span id="s1000">We were holding those heavy -- and girls didn't have the strength to hold them and one would let go and the other fell on the feet.</span> <span id="s1001">It was unbearable and we had to do it.</span> <span id="s1002">If not, if you let it go, you got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: You saw people getting killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Of course, beat up, killed and they'd drag him into the camp, dragging by the feet.</span> <span id="s1005">It was just awful but I worked building a building and when we had the 15 minutes to get our soup there was a German old man there, a very old man.</span> <span id="s1006">At that time when I was young he was in his sixties, maybe it was an old man, but he was like a manager by the buildings and he couldn't talk to anybody, but I think he liked me and everyday he brought me a sandwich in the morning with an egg in it.</span> <span id="s1007">And he put it on a window and he just showed me with his eyes where to take it and I took that and we shared it with the girls, with Hannah and and with another girl from my town and you know I shared with them a bite.</span> <span id="s1008">Each one got a bite from me and that man brought that sandwich every day in the morning until I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s1009">But that's what we were doing and that was our work and our job and coming in they used to you know give us a little water and a little piece of bread and a little piece of salami some time some day and a little margarine.</span> <span id="s1010">I used to have sores on my body and I was afraid that I was going to get worse so I used to sell the margarine for a little -- we had a market between each other -- and I bought some ointment to put on my body.</span> <span id="s1011">And we used to make pee -- excuse me I had to say it and wash our body.</span> <span id="s1012">The salt, they didn't like the salt, the bugs, and we put it on the body.</span> <span id="s1013">I did it every night.</span> <span id="s1014">I put it on the body and many of us do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1015">That, to be insane, you didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s1016">We had such a small brain at that time.</span> <span id="s1017">We were only thinking how we were going to make it through the day.</span> <span id="s1018">One time we went to work in the hills and I found a wild duck in the field and I took that wild duck.</span> <span id="s1019">I didn't care.</span> <span id="s1020">I put it -- I was wearing a man's jacket like and I put it under -- and it was alive and I was holding with the other hand I was holding the beak of the duck and I brought the duck into the camp, to Auschwitz and I sold it for a bread, a , like she was the maid of the barrack.</span> <span id="s1021">She bought it from me because they had more bread and more food and she was Czechoslovakian and she bought it from me and I think they cooked the soup from it or I don't know what they did from it because they had the facilities to do it.</span> <span id="s1022">I had a jar of jam and a bread for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Did you keep this in your bunk?</span> <span id="s1024">A: No, I shared it with the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: You ate it right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s1027">We shared it and we had a terrific dinner.</span> <span id="s1028">We shared that because she brought it in so I didn't have to sneak it in, so it was in already so I said let's have it and we sat in the back and we all ate it and we had a ball.</span> <span id="s1029">That was one episode I could bring something in.</span> <span id="s1030">I couldn't believe and everybody said "How did you do it?"</span> <span id="s1031">I said you see, hunger is more than life.</span> <span id="s1032">I kept his beak closed so that he shouldn't make noise and I had full of his feces in me, but I didn't care because I had bread.</span> <span id="s1033">That's what happened one time to me and I couldn't believe.</span> <span id="s1034">Then I had another girlfriend who lives now in she lives now in Israel and she was in care of the feces.</span> <span id="s1035">You know what we did the whole night, you couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s1036">It was closed, you couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s1037">So, she was better off than anybody else so on the holidays like today you come and wish each other a happy new year and so the girls Hannah and other girls said go to Sarah, maybe she's going to give you something to eat because I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1038">The people who could organize.</span> <span id="s1039">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1040">I wasn't the pushy type or I couldn't do it so they said look you don't eat so go to Sarah and she will give you something.</span> <span id="s1041">You will see.</span> <span id="s1042">She is from your town, you took her into the camp and she will help you for sure.</span> <span id="s1043">I went to her and I said Sarah I came to wish you a happy new year and she was sitting by a , big plates from iron, red ones, they were red and the Greeks called them , and she ate in that , full of it and she had cream of wheat and sugar and I don't know what.</span> <span id="s1044">She didn't even offer me a little bit.</span> <span id="s1045">So, I was sitting there talking to her and I left and I came and I cried and they said did you get something and I said she didn't give me anything.</span> <span id="s1046">So, they hated her, but to her I come later in the last episode because she knew that she doesn't deserve anything.</span> <span id="s1047">Anyway, she was very mean.</span> <span id="s1048">She was very selfish.</span> <span id="s1049">She was from the one that she was going to live, be the only one alive.</span> <span id="s1050">So, she didn't share with anybody anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: You brought up something interesting, that this was Rosh Hashana.</span> <span id="s1052">Were you aware of Jewish holidays in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: The Hungarian people they knew exactly when it was a holiday.</span> <span id="s1054">And we were with the Hungarians and they used to pray quietly.</span> <span id="s1055">They used to say come to my bed we're going to pray.</span> <span id="s1056">I didn't know how to pray.</span> <span id="s1057">I didn't read and write Hebrew or Jewish so they were praying but to pray to God you can pray in any language in any place.</span> <span id="s1058">If he is in a synagogue or not church he is in every place we are, he's even here if he's there.</span> <span id="s1059">So, we prayed to God and it doesn't matter where we are.</span> <span id="s1060">That was our praying.</span> <span id="s1061">We prayed quietly and we cried and we kissed each other and we wished each other a happy new year.</span> <span id="s1062">We didn't have a calendar.</span> <span id="s1063">We did not know which day it is.</span> <span id="s1064">We knew when passover is, we knew everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: In some way you acknowledged all these holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: You see, I was never religious, but there I prayed with everybody else.</span> <span id="s1067">I thought maybe that is going to help me.</span> <span id="s1068">You reach out to anybody especially to God.</span> <span id="s1069">I believe in God, but I am not a fanatic.</span> <span id="s1070">I believe in something higher than we are, better than we are of our savior, but I am not like today, I am not going to a synagogue because I don't know how to pray, but I pray at home.</span> <span id="s1071">I put on a tape of and I have it at home by myself.</span> <span id="s1072">I cry a little and I pray to God because he's there.</span> <span id="s1073">If not for him, maybe I wouldn't be here.</span> <span id="s1074">My father after the war used to say where was he when we needed him the most, and I said he couldn't take care of all of us.</span> <span id="s1075">So, that was Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Were the guards horrible?</span> <span id="s1077">Were the block elders Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Not the , was Jewish, but the elders they were Germans.</span> <span id="s1079">They were Germans and let me tell you that's very important one episode in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1080">One day we were coming back from work and was standing in the middle of the like a place, a big one, and they made pole to hang somebody and everybody came in and he said halt so everybody had to stand around.</span> <span id="s1081">We didn't know what this was for, but we knew something is going to happen, something bad will happen.</span> <span id="s1082">So, we were standing all around and they brought in a girl.</span> <span id="s1083">She was Czechoslovakian and her name was Molly and she was working in the underground but she was working in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1084">She was a , do you know what a is?</span> <span id="s1085">She was like a message girl and they were sending her in from the front from the camp inside a messenger girl so she knew everything but in the meantime, she was working in the underground with another Polish guy and the men's camp and he was not Jewish, he was a Pollack and his name was , and they were working together.</span> <span id="s1086">They had German uniforms.</span> <span id="s1087">She had the right to go here and there, so she put on a German uniform and he a German uniform and they want out of Germans and they were reporting to the underground what's going on inside.</span> <span id="s1088">So, that went on for a few years.</span> <span id="s1089">Somebody, always somebody will tell on you.</span> <span id="s1090">So, they denounced them and they caught her and they let her go out in a German uniform and they caught her outside.</span> <span id="s1091">They wanted to see where she was going but she felt something wrong and she didn't go the places where she was supposed to go and they caught her in the men's because we weren't together with men.</span> <span id="s1092">They were like -- we were on the east side, they were on the west side.</span> <span id="s1093">We just met them when they came to fix something in our camp or something so we weren't allowed to talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s1094">So, she, they caught her and they brought her in and they were supposed to hang her for everybody to see what's going to happen to those people who are working against the Germans.</span> <span id="s1095">So, he was standing there and he was so happy to see that she's going to be hanged soon and her hands were tied in the back and somebody, we don't know who, we were all standing around.</span> <span id="s1096">The whole B, I was in Lager B and the whole B Lager was standing in that appel, and we were supposed to witness what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s1097">In the meantime somebody gave her a razor to cut her and she had her hands tied and she cut her wrist with a razor, both of them and when she started, the blood started running and she was starting to faint so they looked what happened and she was fainting, so they stopped the hanging and they took her they brought a cart like and they put her there and she was instead she was cremated.</span> <span id="s1098">She said long live Poland, long live the freedom, long live the world without Hitler.</span> <span id="s1099">She wasn't afraid any more.</span> <span id="s1100">And they took her away.</span> <span id="s1101">That's what we witnessed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Were there other acts of resistance that you noticed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: There was one but they decided that did you hear about commander.</span> <span id="s1104">The men in the commander decided to run away and tell everybody to run after them and they cut them and they shot them, they were shooting at them and they were pulling them in.</span> <span id="s1105">They let us watch them like by the feet.</span> <span id="s1106">was running and they brought them back to the camp.</span> <span id="s1107">But they were running.</span> <span id="s1108">A lot of people were running and a lot of people there were dead.</span> <span id="s1109">About that time about 200 people died, maybe.</span> <span id="s1110">I don't know the exact number, but a lot of people and we saw that.</span> <span id="s1111">Because they said today you're going to run, word of mouth, mouth to mouth, we knew what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s1112">If I was chicken I wouldn't run, but somebody didn't.</span> <span id="s1113">They said that's our chance where to run.</span> <span id="s1114">They were all over.</span> <span id="s1115">So, they tried.</span> <span id="s1116">They burned them all.</span> <span id="s1117">They beat them up first and then they burned them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Did you ever have any reason to be in the hospital there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: No.</span> <span id="s1120">That was to let me tell about Tricia.</span> <span id="s1121">I'm going to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1122">That Tricia who my father saved she was very lazy and she said I'm going to go to the , that's the hospital.</span> <span id="s1123">The Germans called it .</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: In Auschwitz or Maidanek?</span> <span id="s1125">A: Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: It was called a .</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1128">I'm going to go there and I'm going to live better than you and I'm going to have more food, and I'm going to tell them that I'm sick.</span> <span id="s1129">So, she went there.</span> <span id="s1130">She was there a long time.</span> <span id="s1131">I used to go to her and I used to say get out of here.</span> <span id="s1132">They're going to take the whole .</span> <span id="s1133">They're going to burn you.</span> <span id="s1134">They are going to kill you here and she said no, no I have it good I am like a nurse and like this and some people came into the camp pregnant.</span> <span id="s1135">They wanted you to be pregnant.</span> <span id="s1136">They used to take out the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">They killed the mother and they made the children they were guinea pigs.</span> <span id="s1138">So, she was helping there and one day Tricia was killed.</span> <span id="s1139">They took her out.</span> <span id="s1140">I was never there.</span> <span id="s1141">I said I will never go there because when you say you're sick, you're certain 99 percent you wind up in the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: I was wondering if anyone you knew had any first hand information about some of the experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: I wasn't there and I can't give you any information.</span> <span id="s1144">I know they were taking out the open stomach the mother or they let her have the baby and she suffered and then they killed her and they brought her to the gas chambers and on the kids they were the guinea pigs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Were you aware of any sexual abuse while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Not I.</span> <span id="s1147">They say, now I learn a lot from other people, but that wasn't in our camp.</span> <span id="s1148">Not, I didn't experience things like this.</span> <span id="s1149">I knew that the Germans talking to us was a .</span> <span id="s1150">How could they do something like this.</span> <span id="s1151">I know it was because other people lived that through.</span> <span id="s1152">They were in whore houses.</span> <span id="s1153">I didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s1154">I knew it was a .</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Because of the unusual circumstances, do you think any of the women in your block had sexual relationships with each other.</span> <span id="s1156">Was that anything you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: I didn't see.</span> <span id="s1158">I saw lesbians.</span> <span id="s1159">I hear lesbians doing it and we didn't know what lesbian is.</span> <span id="s1160">I said, what are they doing there?</span> <span id="s1161">So, they said, don't you know?</span> <span id="s1162">They make love, and I said, what love?</span> <span id="s1163">I don't know a woman with a woman and they said they are lesbians.</span> <span id="s1164">So, because there were a lot of Germans too.</span> <span id="s1165">But they were Czechoslovakian and they lived on top of me and I hear them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: In the same bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Yes, in the same bunk.</span> <span id="s1168">So, but I didn't have any experience.</span> <span id="s1169">I didn't see.</span> <span id="s1170">I knew that they did some.</span> <span id="s1171">I don't know how, but I knew what I knew I had two girls, two Marishas, from Warsaw and I know that they were prostitutes and they were doing things with the Germans there, too, but I didn't see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: How long were you in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1173">A: About two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Next we went with the transport to .</span> <span id="s1176">Q: How did this selection come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: They asked you, you want to go someplace else, so you have to sign in.</span> <span id="s1178">So, I said yes.</span> <span id="s1179">I want a change.</span> <span id="s1180">It's terrible.</span> <span id="s1181">It can't be worse.</span> <span id="s1182">So, we went they took us and so they said so you're going to go on a transport.</span> <span id="s1183">We waited about two weeks or so and we went for a transport and they took us to .</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Were your friends with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Yes, all of us, like Hannah and the others, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1186">Some went to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1187">One said I'm going I can't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s1188">So, whoever was alive went with me because we kept together all Hannah and others you know.</span> <span id="s1189">Hannah was with me close to the end of her life, so that's why she is the closest to me and I talk about her because she was like my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: How big was the transport, Rose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1192">It was a few blocks.</span> <span id="s1193">They filled up a few blocks and they kept us naked for about three or four weeks.</span> <span id="s1194">I don't even know how long they kept us there because people used to come to our windows from there and they used to see in one girl came, who she was my brother's friend and she looked at me and she thought I am my other sister, , and she said are you , and I said who are you and she said it's Sophie Biaz.</span> <span id="s1195">She was Polish.</span> <span id="s1196">She wasn't Jewish, she was catholic and she was a guinea pig there because she was taken from our town.</span> <span id="s1197">We didn't know where she vanished to the Gestapo and she was working with her husband in the underground.</span> <span id="s1198">So, she came to the window and she saw me and she started crying like a baby.</span> <span id="s1199">She brought me a piece of bread into the window and she said do you know what happened to me?</span> <span id="s1200">She was very tall and very she had very gorgeous legs, she said you know what I don't have my cartlidges by my bones and I can only walk five or ten minutes most and my feet, I don't have any feeling in my legs so she was a guinea pig there.</span> <span id="s1201">She helped me there a little and they kept us there and they fed us there naked and we were on the beds doing nothing and just you know kidding around and not knowing even what's going to bring tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1202">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s1203">Are we going to stay here, nobody knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: You didn't have any clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s1206">They took our clothes because they didn't want to watch us all the time to walk around to get mingled with others.</span> <span id="s1207">We were locked in and no clothes so that's okay.</span> <span id="s1208">We had a blanket you know like one blanket of eight and that's okay.</span> <span id="s1209">We had a little something to cover ourselves and we were walking around naked.</span> <span id="s1210">So, it didn't bother us because we were all women and we didn't have anything to hide.</span> <span id="s1211">We didn't have anything period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: When you're traveling from one camp to another, are there peasants, are there people that you pass that see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: We didn't have windows.</span> <span id="s1216">They knew -- the Pollacks or wherever we went through knew that there were people in them.</span> <span id="s1217">Because some through a little hole put a hand out, screamed out, but nobody saw.</span> <span id="s1218">We didn't see anybody.</span> <span id="s1219">We had to see somebody through a little hole.</span> <span id="s1220">But nobody come close to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: So you're in were you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: No, we didn't work there.</span> <span id="s1223">We were just waiting for a transport to a place where to go.</span> <span id="s1224">So, the front was coming closer and closer and they had transport people closer to Germany.</span> <span id="s1225">So, that's why we wind up 120 miles from Germany, from Berlin.</span> <span id="s1226">That was we didn't know about who knew so all of a sudden they come in.</span> <span id="s1227">They opened our blocks and they said you're going to a transport.</span> <span id="s1228">Now, they gave us the clothes, the bundles and they told us to dress and we're going.</span> <span id="s1229">We marched out from there.</span> <span id="s1230">Again, we went in to train.</span> <span id="s1231">Everything was a train.</span> <span id="s1232">Not people train, but car trains.</span> <span id="s1233">So, they put us there.</span> <span id="s1234">They gave us a little bread and there we go.</span> <span id="s1235">They gave us a piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: How long was the train ride do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: To I don't know.</span> <span id="s1238">From Maidanek to Auschwitz it was four days.</span> <span id="s1239">A long time, a long, long time.</span> <span id="s1240">Here it wasn't short, maybe two days.</span> <span id="s1241">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s1242">But when we came there and they opened the gates for us and we were the first ones, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s1243">It was quiet.</span> <span id="s1244">We said, "My God we came to heaven.</span> <span id="s1245">Now we are in heaven."</span> <span id="s1246">So, that was about a thousand of us, maybe a little more, the first transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: When do you think this was, maybe the end of '44?</span> <span id="s1248">Was it getting that late?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: Yes that was the end of '44 because I was there until about April 25 or something the middle of April and then they took us out.</span> <span id="s1250">The Germans were still around because we were an exchange for soldiers.</span> <span id="s1251">So, when we came in there we were so happy.</span> <span id="s1252">We are in a new place and we know each other and a girl knew that I made manicure for the Germans so she asked the , a German woman, a very, very SS woman, a terrible person, and she asked the girls who knows how to make her manicure and she said I know how to make her and she knows how to make manicure and she said okay, I need only her.</span> <span id="s1253">So, she took me after a few days we were there.</span> <span id="s1254">And she said you're going to work in the kitchen and you're going to be at my disposition any time I need you.</span> <span id="s1255">And I said, fine.</span> <span id="s1256">So what else can you do.</span> <span id="s1257">She had a boyfriend there, a Gestapo man, and she wanted to look nice, good to him and be you know combed nice and she said to the other girl, okay, you can comb my hair but I'm going to take her.</span> <span id="s1258">And she didn't like it and she said do you know how to comb my hair and I was scared to death.</span> <span id="s1259">If I'm going to do wrong, she's going to kill me.</span> <span id="s1260">And I said, how, just wet waves, like waves, and I said I'm going to try, maybe I don't know but I can try.</span> <span id="s1261">And she said try it.</span> <span id="s1262">She gave me a comb and I made it nice with a fingers, I made the waves.</span> <span id="s1263">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s1264">Fear teaches you everything.</span> <span id="s1265">From fear you know everything.</span> <span id="s1266">There's not a thing that you don't know.</span> <span id="s1267">So, I start making her hair and she said I'm going to show my boyfriend my hair.</span> <span id="s1268">She's going to show if he likes it and he said it's wunderbar, it's wunderbar so that's all, so I became her private beautician and manicurist, but she said to me you are going to work in the kitchen, that means we didn't peel potatoes, we were only that was a machine that it was like scraping the potatoes with the dirt and everything.</span> <span id="s1269">In the beginning I didn't work in the kitchen so my girlfriend Hannah, no another girlfriend used to make pancakes, no potato pancakes threw them in a little oven there and with the sand and the dirt and everything just like baking them and we were supposed to swallow them because you couldn't chew them.</span> <span id="s1270">It was in the teeth, it was an awful feeling so we were swallowing them to fill the stomach.</span> <span id="s1271">So, she cooked a little soup and she brought me up to eat a little soup, but when I was in the kitchen so Hannah wasn't there yet.</span> <span id="s1272">They took from -- no Hannah was there.</span> <span id="s1273">We all were there.</span> <span id="s1274">Going out to Sweden she wasn't there.</span> <span id="s1275">So, then other girls start coming into from Auschwitz, from wherever they took them, because Auschwitz was in Poland and the Russians came very close to there so they had to evacuate very fast.</span> <span id="s1276">So the evacuation came very fast and they brought them in bunches to .</span> <span id="s1277">So, Hannah came with the next transport with me and other girls and that Sarah Goldberg what I tell you she was there too, and I worked already in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1278">After a while she prepared me she didn't want me to be by the potatoes.</span> <span id="s1279">She wanted me to be a cook to have nice hands to hold her hands and I said I couldn't believe it I was in a kitchen and I saw food.</span> <span id="s1280">And so when the transport a few weeks later a new transport came and I came out of the kitchen with a white, I was wearing a white uniform in the kitchen because that kitchen cooked for the Germans too.</span> <span id="s1281">So they picked me in the day time they took me in the dining room where the Germans ate to be a waitress.</span> <span id="s1282">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s1283">So, I had to wear a white uniform.</span> <span id="s1284">So, I came out when a new transport came in and I looked who was there and I saw who is from our girls who is from the camp and said Ruzia it's me and so I said it's good to see you and we hugged and I said who is with you and she said Sarah is with me and others.</span> <span id="s1285">They are all with me and another Rushka is with me an I said okay.</span> <span id="s1286">That Sarah thought I was a nurse so she didn't even come close to me, but when she hears that I'm in the kitchen and they said what are you doing here, what are you doing here, I said I am in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1287">I am working as a cook.</span> <span id="s1288">So she wants to be my friend but I had ten girls.</span> <span id="s1289">We are together.</span> <span id="s1290">We came all together and I said to Hannah, Bessie's mother, I said you are going to be the supervisor of the food.</span> <span id="s1291">You're going to feed all ten girls that left after that terrible, terrible what happened to us and you know terrible deal that happened to us and we are alive and I will help you.</span> <span id="s1292">So, she said fine.</span> <span id="s1293">I said put them together, tell me how many are there and I somehow I was going to steal the food from the kitchen and I am going to feed you.</span> <span id="s1294">In the meantime I was transferred to block one, because there whoever worked for the Germans had to be clean and that was the first block was for the clean people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">And there I found a woman and a little boy.</span> <span id="s1296">He was nine years old.</span> <span id="s1297">She was a doctor and the husband was a doctor, but the husband was killed already.</span> <span id="s1298">And that boy's name was , and he was with the parents with the mother because they were doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Where were they from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: They were from Lemberg, but they were in that camp when they put me in that barrack, in that you know, barrack, they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: They were Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: They were Jews from Poland from and that boy, I felt that I found my nephew and I adopted that boy and I said I'm going to help him with anything I can.</span> <span id="s1303">That boy was so skinny so I said all right I will bring you sugar whatever I can and for him it was a special deal.</span> <span id="s1304">The others used to come with buckets under the windows in the middle of the night and I used to give the food out until they found out.</span> <span id="s1305">But before they found out I used to give it through the back.</span> <span id="s1306">But for him I used to bring the food in my panties.</span> <span id="s1307">You know, the panties have something to hold you here, I don't know what it was, it wasn't a band like to tie so I put there from the Germans I stole like cream of wheat cooked, warm and a little sugar and a little margarine and I used to a piece of salami and I used to bring for .</span> <span id="s1308">His mother had a sweater and she taught him how to needle -- how to crochet and he crochet for me from his mother's sweater a pair of gloves not to be cold because it was winter time and when I came in he was sick that time.</span> <span id="s1309">Something was wrong with him and he said I have something for you from the back, and he gave me mittens, you know.</span> <span id="s1310">I lost them, I don't have them and that name never, never went out of my mind.</span> <span id="s1311">I remember exactly his name after 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s1312">So, I don't know what happened, but I helped them and the girls.</span> <span id="s1313">I used to tell them to come to the back window because you see we had was built for only a thousand what is it's like you cut them and put them in the war time in jail, prisoners.</span> <span id="s1314">It was made for 1,000 French prisoners and they brought in 5,000 so the kitchen was going 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s1315">We cooked the whole night and the first dinner was 9:00 in the morning for food and then it was 12:00 and then it was about 3:00, 4:00 in the afternoon and then you slept a little.</span> <span id="s1316">You know when I cooked in the morning or in the night, I slept in the daytime a little.</span> <span id="s1317">So, it was three shifts to cook the food and so when I worked nights, I used to say you come over and I'll give you through the window I'm going to give you a bucket of food and you saw Hannah, , she sent every time another girl under the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: You had a fair amount of freedom of movement there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Movement you had but you had to go, you worked there but I didn't but the other girls they made they worked out underground and they had factories hidden in the woods like and they were making ammunition and the girls went out to work ammunition.</span> <span id="s1320">But you see it was 24 hours who was in the daytime they could sleep, inside you could walk around but when you had to go out to work you worked by the ammunition.</span> <span id="s1321">I was never there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Were the general conditions better than Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Much better, but it was very small.</span> <span id="s1324">It was very crowded.</span> <span id="s1325">It was people were beaten to death.</span> <span id="s1326">You know, it wasn't honey.</span> <span id="s1327">It wasn't a resort, it was a camp, but that was the best one from all of them, so because it was really in Germany, so the German ladies, the SS women who worked in the kitchens and they worked with us.</span> <span id="s1328">They were our superiors and some were very bitchy, very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Weren't you afraid of being caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Oh yes, but it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s1331">You see, it really didn't, I was afraid and I was not afraid because to save a life it was worth it.</span> <span id="s1332">To save ten lives it was more worth it.</span> <span id="s1333">So, I used to in the day time when I didn't cook I had to be occupied so they had permissions from the who I made the hair every day I put up her hair and sometimes every second day a manicure.</span> <span id="s1334">I was scared to death but I did it.</span> <span id="s1335">Then I got so much that I know now how to make them.</span> <span id="s1336">I was so good to make those waves with my fingers with a little water, that's all, and she dried them in the sun.</span> <span id="s1337">I had permission to go that she get permission to the other German SS women who watched us, the watch dogs that I can go sometimes to them if they need me.</span> <span id="s1338">So, she had a list of ten or something that she's going to send me there today or tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1339">And I had one to tell me wash the floors and to make the hair and to wash her toilet and that's okay.</span> <span id="s1340">That was fine enough.</span> <span id="s1341">One I had she was a very mean , very mean, but somehow she liked me and when I came she said don't do anything.</span> <span id="s1342">I don't need you for nothing.</span> <span id="s1343">Just come down and lie down near me and tell me your story or tell me how you came here and we talked and she told me her story how she became a German and she was young and she had a baby and she told me her story.</span> <span id="s1344">Then I had another one she used to tell me let's go shopping.</span> <span id="s1345">And she took me shopping with her.</span> <span id="s1346">She took me in her jeep and I should carry her bags.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: You went into a town shopping?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: A little town, but the little town, but the butcher knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1349">He said you there, out.</span> <span id="s1350">So he wouldn't let me in, and she said okay you stay outside.</span> <span id="s1351">I come out and then we go back, and she used to sit and talk to me and she used to give me something to eat.</span> <span id="s1352">She always prepared something good for me.</span> <span id="s1353">Then in the kitchen worked one, because you see those German women, those SS women they weren't really trained by the SS.</span> <span id="s1354">They were short of people, of women, so they took them out from the factories.</span> <span id="s1355">They were factory women.</span> <span id="s1356">They gave them a little.</span> <span id="s1357">They taught them a little what has to be done, a course how to get through it and they put them in a uniform and they put them into those camps like, little camps.</span> <span id="s1358">So, in the kitchen was an angel and we called her angel.</span> <span id="s1359">When I wanted to take something out for that boy I said , and she said she didn't want to see it.</span> <span id="s1360">She didn't want to know about it.</span> <span id="s1361">So, I took out things.</span> <span id="s1362">One time I took out a salami, big like my hand, I don't know how.</span> <span id="s1363">It was bigger than my hand, and I put in a big salami like this in my arm until here and I smuggled that salami out and they were the happiest people in the world.</span> <span id="s1364">I smuggled out a whole salami and if they would catch me there they told me don't do that.</span> <span id="s1365">If they're going to catch you they're going to kill you in the place, but I did it.</span> <span id="s1366">But you see the winter time was very bad because when they came through the back window for the food they saw foot prints in the snow that every night somebody is there.</span> <span id="s1367">The snow falls in the day time, at night you have more foot prints.</span> <span id="s1368">Then they found something out that something's going out and they were watching.</span> <span id="s1369">Who is going to the back, but you know somebody nice told the girls that somebody knows that somebody is going to pick up the food at night.</span> <span id="s1370">It was -- they found foot steps by the door, so we had to change all the whole plan.</span> <span id="s1371">We changed it and I said okay from now on don't go there just come to the front and whenever I'm going to see that nobody is looking I'm going to give you fast and you just run, and that's the way they were picking up the food, through the front.</span> <span id="s1372">We didn't care, they would shoot us all because they would find out who is eating this food, but we didn't care.</span> <span id="s1373">In the meantime, they really had a ball.</span> <span id="s1374">They ate.</span> <span id="s1375">This was going on for quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: I assume in the kitchen, the food you served the Germans was very different than the food you got?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: Of course we couldn't have it.</span> <span id="s1378">We just helped, but you know sometimes you just got like a little doggie bag, bug they knew how many steaks they have.</span> <span id="s1379">They knew exactly what they have.</span> <span id="s1380">To us they used to bring the killed horses from the front and the horse meat was smelly and terrible and we cooked the soups from it.</span> <span id="s1381">We put meat, but we had meat.</span> <span id="s1382">Can you imagine what we had, we had meat and if somebody found a little piece, like a little square of meat they said I have meat in my soup but we the only thing that we could do, you know the bones they cooked over and over and over because the bone has the marrow inside so we had to cut the bones and cook the soup so we took out the marrow and we put them in a casserole underneath.</span> <span id="s1383">We took the potatoes what has to go to the soup, we stole potatoes and we put that in a casserole and we put that in the oven where it was burning and we made ourselves a delicious dish.</span> <span id="s1384">We put that dish in the toilet and every time somebody else went in to have a little and that was very fat and that filled you up right away because it really was fat, the marrow was so fat but that was delicious.</span> <span id="s1385">I wouldn't eat it now, but at that time it was delicious.</span> <span id="s1386">This and then sometimes when they took me to waitress and most of the days I used to finish when my cooking.</span> <span id="s1387">You should have seen what was cooking, just lousy food.</span> <span id="s1388">Everything was just the leaves of the cabbage was the leaves what the Germans didn't eat.</span> <span id="s1389">They were rotten.</span> <span id="s1390">Everything was rotten that came into our soup, but it was okay.</span> <span id="s1391">It was soup.</span> <span id="s1392">You know what, we used to put the margarine, they were like in bricks.</span> <span id="s1393">I think each brick was two pounds or one pound and they used to count in each huge like for the military they had to go in ten bricks of margarine so we used to pick them in.</span> <span id="s1394">That's a terrible thing to say, we used to put that in and they made the mark, you know, it's fat around, and we used to take out the margarine to feed the girls.</span> <span id="s1395">Everybody had somebody, so we used to take it out.</span> <span id="s1396">We used to eat good there in the kitchen, but some we left, but a few we took out, but the mark was they come, they count, that was ten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: How long were you in ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: In I was there about nine months.</span> <span id="s1399">Q: You were there that long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Yes, and then from one day the German came into the kitchen because I helped the Germans that was just poor Germans they didn't have enough food that time either and they weren't bad.</span> <span id="s1401">They were good to us.</span> <span id="s1402">They used to bring us the news of the day, where the Germans are and where the Russians are and I think the war is ending is because they weren't real soldiers either.</span> <span id="s1403">They took them out from factories.</span> <span id="s1404">They used to give us the news for the day, where they are and they said, you know what, I think they are making an exchange of prisoners of war for you and I think you are going to leave soon here and the woman the in the kitchen she said are you going to let them kill me.</span> <span id="s1405">I said no not you.</span> <span id="s1406">You are our angel but she knew I wasn't waiting until then and she was really nice not to kill and she said I know the Germans I know we are all going to get killed.</span> <span id="s1407">One day when they were talking about it soon somebody I think American are coming to save you to give you freedom.</span> <span id="s1408">The Red Cross because made a deal to the Germans that they are going to get one of us for a 100 of German soldiers and prisoners.</span> <span id="s1409">So, they made a deal and they took blocks of us but when the Americans come in to us and we were really afraid.</span> <span id="s1410">We were afraid of everybody.</span> <span id="s1411">They said, don't worry.</span> <span id="s1412">We are American.</span> <span id="s1413">We came to free you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Is this the soldiers or the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: They were in uniforms.</span> <span id="s1416">They were in the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1417">The trucks were Red Cross trucks, but they were in uniforms and they said you have they couldn't talk to everybody but when they took us out they made the arrangements in the office and everything and they said ten barracks are going out of here.</span> <span id="s1418">So, they put us in and the rest on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">, was on the other side crying and she said I just missed by one block and she left there and I went out with another Rose and another few girls and we went out and the Americans said now you can scream you can throw stones on them, you are outside the wall and you are in our trucks and they gave us , packages with chocolate.</span> <span id="s1420">Can you imagine with chocolate, with all kinds of goodies and they said now we are going to take you to the freedom.</span> <span id="s1421">We take you to Denmark.</span> <span id="s1422">So, we were happy.</span> <span id="s1423">Can you imagine we cried we left our friends and then the Russian came in there and they were raping the girls and I don't know what.</span> <span id="s1424">My Hannah wasn't raped but they were doing all things like you wouldn't believe that they came to free you and they are such ugly people, those Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: So, this was the end of April '45 that you went to Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Yes, and that was in the middle because I think I was two weeks or more in Sweden, the 8th of May was the end of war, but I was already out of there.</span> <span id="s1427">That was something in April.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: You went to Denmark or Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Denmark first.</span> <span id="s1430">But going to Denmark that's not so easy.</span> <span id="s1431">In the Red Cross on the top of the trucks they had written big Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1432">When the airplanes fly around you they know it's a Red Cross truck but they knew who is there and they went so close to our trucks and they with machine guns they were just shooting all around us and on us and they killed one truck 40 people completely.</span> <span id="s1433">There were 40 in a truck and then Americans before they saw they were on top of us they stopped the trucks and said run into the ditches.</span> <span id="s1434">You run wherever you can and we started running.</span> <span id="s1435">So, we went in, it was someplace a house like a farmer's house, a farmer lived there and we run into the house and they threw us out and they say now that the Germans didn't know what's happening.</span> <span id="s1436">And they said you and they didn't let us in.</span> <span id="s1437">So, we had to hide in the ditches, and the American soldiers were so good to us.</span> <span id="s1438">They put they hands under our feet to put us up.</span> <span id="s1439">They knew what horrible life we had.</span> <span id="s1440">They and we didn't understand English, but they were showing us you know that you're free, you're free, but he said you're still not free, and they said to go to the ditches and to run and to hide.</span> <span id="s1441">They, it's going to get a little darker.</span> <span id="s1442">They are going to take us through the woods into Denmark and we were walking a whole night because they couldn't see anything so they couldn't shoot us.</span> <span id="s1443">And we were walking, a lot of us, into Denmark.</span> <span id="s1444">When we came to Denmark, the people in Denmark were so nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Did you have to cross water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Not to Denmark, to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1447">It's a lot of Germans living in Denmark too.</span> <span id="s1448">They are not all Danish.</span> <span id="s1449">They are a lot Germans.</span> <span id="s1450">So, the first thing when they took us in they start preparing us and they used to say please don't talk about the Germans.</span> <span id="s1451">We have a lot of spies in here and you are not still free, remember.</span> <span id="s1452">They warned us and they gave us food and they said don't eat too much because it's not good for you.</span> <span id="s1453">You should eat slowly and not too much because you're going to get sick.</span> <span id="s1454">So, we were in Denmark about three weeks.</span> <span id="s1455">Then the Denmark people, it was a rainy day when we were leaving to Sweden and they were standing with bouquet of flowers and they were hugging us and they were wishing us the best and we didn't understand them but the German they spoke to us and they hugged us and they kissed us and they wished us luck and the best and not to eat too much and nothing to be careful.</span> <span id="s1456">And they gave us bouquets of flowers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Where were you living in Denmark, in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: We were living not in a camp, it was like you know maybe barracks like before but they put us all up in a circle in some houses just like shacks and they kept us there and they gave us very good food.</span> <span id="s1459">They put us all together by tables and they fed us and they watched us not to eat too much.</span> <span id="s1460">They said no, no don't eat too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Was this with the help of the Swedish and Danish Red Cross too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: Yes, this was with the Red Cross, the Danish and Swedish.</span> <span id="s1463">The whole of Red Cross because the Americans were watching us there, too.</span> <span id="s1464">They were with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: So then you went to Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: No, they took us in trains and they brought us to we had to go through the water by boat.</span> <span id="s1467">They brought us to the boats and we now in the boat we were free.</span> <span id="s1468">We could talk because in Denmark still they were warning us please we want you not to talk about it and we want you to live through it.</span> <span id="s1469">We don't want you to be killed in here.</span> <span id="s1470">Then, in the boat about 24 hours we had to go across the water and so we came to to Sweden, and there they were beautiful white clean not mattresses, but like with straw, those things, with beautiful white sheets that we didn't see for so many years.</span> <span id="s1471">Then, it was written something in , it was too much to eat I supposes it's for and , and I said we came again to Germans they are talking about and that's forbidden.</span> <span id="s1472">But we read it in German and it's .</span> <span id="s1473">So they gave us really the red carpet and they took us to a beautiful, beautiful department store and they dressed us from A-Z, from the bottom to the top, everything new, even a girdle, bras, everything and a coat, a beautiful brown coat I had and boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Were you living in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: No, they took us to a .</span> <span id="s1476">They took us in different places.</span> <span id="s1477">Some went to different cities.</span> <span id="s1478">They took me and another girls to , and they put us in the quarantine.</span> <span id="s1479">For about three months we had to be there because people used to get sick and a lot of them died, a lot.</span> <span id="s1480">So, we used to be in a quarantine and every Sunday people from the city learned about it and they came to we were in with big fences but people went through the fences and they talk and they ask us questions and they speak very well English and German, so one couple came to the and they saw me and they said we were surrounded around three ways with water.</span> <span id="s1481">It was a lake, and you could swim but naked.</span> <span id="s1482">The boys find out that these girls are swimming naked so they came to see us naked there and so a couple came, a young couple, she was in the forties maybe forty and she looked and she said would you like to be free and go out from the quarantine, and I said of course I would.</span> <span id="s1483">So, she said I can make you a passport and you can get out.</span> <span id="s1484">I am going to be your foster mother and we can adopt you so she did.</span> <span id="s1485">They did.</span> <span id="s1486">First of all I have still a picture in that bathing suit.</span> <span id="s1487">She brought me a bathing suit the next Sunday they came.</span> <span id="s1488">She brought me a bathing suit and she told me you don't have to show anybody what you have.</span> <span id="s1489">You're going to be in a bathing suit.</span> <span id="s1490">And they made a room for me and they took me to their place.</span> <span id="s1491">He was an engineer and she was working in an office and they adopted me until I found -- I wrote letters to Europe and I found that my father and brother are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: What about your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: My husband, too.</span> <span id="s1494">He came later, but I found them alive through I wrote letters I remember my friend's addresses and I wrote to one guy who went with me to school and he said to me that day that I got your letter was the happiest day of my
