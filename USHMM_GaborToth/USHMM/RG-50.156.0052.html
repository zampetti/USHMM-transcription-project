id="s164">What could we do?</span> <span id="s165">Nothing.</span> <span id="s166">And right in the beginning, when they come in, they start to take every Jew 20 hours work -- each -- a week.</span> <span id="s167">The young people could go.</span> <span id="s168">Like I, I went for my father, I went for my grandfather, so I could work 60 hours.</span> <span id="s169">For me it wasn’t so

rules or orders?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Just when we went to ghetto.</span> <span id="s208">You couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s209">You just need to be in ghetto.</span> <span

<p><span id="s246">Q: Were you transported to a labor camp or a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: In the beginning we went to a labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Poznan -- not far from Poznan.</span> <span id="s250">The name from the camp was Golda.</span> <span id="s251">From Golda to Kedj.</span> <span id="s252">From

id="s256">Q: Can you describe the transporting?</span> <span id="s257">How was it done?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: The beginning was we moved from one camp to the other, it was not far, so we went by foot.</span> <span id="s259">And if no, it’s transportation by “ transfer-outers.”</span> <span id="s260">To Auschwitz, we went by the “ Eisenbann” -- railroad.</span> <span id="s261">When we come to Auschwitz, they segregated us.</span> <span id="s262">They say we can work, separate.</span> <span id="s263">And other one, the older men separate.</span> <span id="s264">So I was just in Auschwitz not long, just maybe a week, four or five days.</span> <span id="s265">Second was Schweintochlowitz, another concentration camp.</span> <span id="s266">Later I was in Buna, to January, ’45.</span> <span id="s267">January, ’45 we went from Buna to Gliwice, and from Gliwice to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s268">And from Buchenwald I went for a transport, maybe this took us one month, and end of March we come back to Buchenwald, by foot.</span> <span id="s269">And April the 7th, 1945, I went out from Buchenwald and we marched until May the 4th, four weeks until the Americans liberate us.</span> <span id="s270">When we went out from Buchenwald, we were 2,000 “haftlinge” -- prisoners.</span> <span id="s271">When we came to the liberation place, we was 158!</span> <span id="s272">This was all that we was,.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: When you first went to Auschwitz, do you recall the approximate day and time and year of the arrival?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Not exactly the day.</span> <span id="s275">Maybe 1943, already.</span> <span id="s276">Maybe by the number they know exactly, because the most come at this time to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Do you remember the time of the year?</span> <span id="s278">The month?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: I can’t.</span> <span id="s280">It’s already forty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: And how long were you in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: In Auschwitz I was a week.</span> <span id="s283">I went right away to Schweintochlowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Who were the people who accompanied you at your arrival?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: S.S. Also people from the Sondercommando too.</span> <span id="s286">They worked on this place.</span> <span id="s287">They made clean.</span> <span id="s288">They wore guns when we went out.</span> <span id="s289">They took away our baggage (laughs) what we got still.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Were you with family members when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: No.</span> <span id="s292">Myself.</span> <span id="s293">To Auschwitz I came by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: You knew none of the people with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: When we came to Auschwitz, maybe was 200 from our town -- that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: You mentioned your tattoo.</span> <span id="s297">Could you explain how you were processed or registered in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: When we come to Auschwitz, the first day they take us for a shower.</span> <span id="s299">Next day we stay on the right, and they give us numbers.</span> <span id="s300">We went to the barracks for a day, and we was waiting for transportation.</span> <span id="s301">That’s all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Which camp were you longest at?</span> <span id="s303">Was it Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Schweintochlowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: This was in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Were most of the camps similar, physically, or did they vary?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Auschwitz I couldn’t see too much, because I just was a couple of days.</span> <span id="s309">When I come to Schweintochlowitz, this was a factory from ammunition.</span> <span id="s310">But I didn’t work in the factory.</span> <span id="s311">I learned before the war carpenter, so I helped to put together wood houses for the heftlinge in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: And how long were you at that particular camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: A year, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Can you describe the size of the camp, the buildings, how many people were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Just maybe a thousand people.</span> <span id="s316">This was a big camp.</span> <span id="s317">We build, build and build.</span> <span id="s318">Bigger and bigger and bigger.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: What were the buildings like?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: From wood.</span> <span id="s321">You put them together.</span> <span id="s322">They brought ready to put them just together.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: What were the living conditions like?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Wasn’t too bad, the living conditions in the camps, because they keep clean.</span> <span id="s325">Because this was Germans too, what they come in connection with us, and they want to keep us clean.</span> <span id="s326">So, we got every day to wash and we had to take a shower.</span> <span id="s327">And everyone looked, kept clean.</span> <span id="s328">Wasn’t enough food!</span> <span id="s329">Bread in the morning and a soup.</span> <span id="s330">Just to come through the day.</span></p> <p><span

already.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: How about the physical treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Sometimes you get hit if you couldn’t work, if you was slow in work.</span> <span id="s366">I got hit plenty times.</span> <span id="s367">Once, I remember.</span> <span id="s368">My father, the left hand he didn’t get.</span> <span id="s369">Just one hand, the right.</span> <span id="s370">So, when I work in camp, I work with one hand, I say something.</span> <span id="s371">So the foreman asked me -- he was a German -- “ What, your father, with one hand he did it?”</span> <span id="s372">I said, “ Yes, my father with one hand.”</span> <span id="s373">So he was thinking I was making a fool from him.</span> <span id="s374">In the evening -- we live in the same barrack -- so I told a friend to tell them, this is true, what I have told him.</span> <span id="s375">He didn’t give in.</span> <span id="s376">He hit me.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Any other stories that you remember like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: When you was in the camp, if you could, you stay up in the night.</span> <span id="s379">We went out from the windows.</span> <span id="s380">Stealing what we can -- to have food!</span> <span id="s381">Sometimes they catch you.</span> <span id="s382">If you are lucky, he didn’t do anything to you.</span> <span id="s383">And if you wasn’t too lucky, he hit you.</span> <span id="s384">( Laughs,)</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: How often did you steal?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: I was hungry!</span> <span

prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No.</span> <span id="s391">In one camp, was Soviet prisoners, too, but I didn’t have nothing to do with them.</span> <span id="s392">I didn’t speak to them -- nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Did you have any contact with relatives or friends at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: No.</span> <span id="s395">when I come from Schweintochlowitz to Buna, this was already late in the evening.</span> <span id="s396">I supposed to stay there overnight, and in the morning, they supposed to transfer me to another camp.</span> <span id="s397">So mein friend was there in this camp -- he is living today in Milwaukee -- he recognized me, and he said, “ You know your brother is here,’ the brother which is living now in Columbus, Ohio.</span> <span id="s398">So I told him, “ Go fast and tell him that I am here and I want to see him, because tomorrow I go away from here.”</span> <span id="s399">So the brother came and I see him the same evening.</span> <span id="s400">We came together to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s401">Later, in the same camp was still two cousins of mine, too, maybe four months, five months.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Did you witness, or were you aware of the systematic killings or fatalities?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: When you was there, you see that they hang people in Buna.</span> <span id="s404">They hanged them because they catched them, they run away -- something.</span> <span id="s405">One time, five or six.</span> <span id="s406">We were forced to stay and see.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: How did they force you?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Every day they made an “appell” in the morning and in the evening.</span> <span id="s409">They count you, if everyone is here.</span> <span id="s410">If somebody run away or everyone not come home from work.</span> <span id="s411">They know exactly the amount from each barrack, how many, or from each commander.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Were any of the people you lived with in the barracks killed that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: What about anything involving the gas chambers at all.</span> <span id="s415">Did they have them at the particular camps you were at?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: In Auschwitz was the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s417">I didn’t see, because I was there three days, four days, but I hear!</span> <span id="s418">These people what they took away in the side, they took to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s419">And later what I see was in Buna when I come, the doctors checked us.</span> <span id="s420">They see if you can still work, they keep you.</span> <span id="s421">If no, they mark you down and you go to the chamber.</span> <span id="s422">And later, when we come to Buchenwald, was there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Did you know any of the people that went to the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: My younger brother, he come from Auschwitz, from friends, some from home.</span> <span id="s425">Some was older people and some sick people.</span> <span id="s426">They took him right away to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s427">(Pause.)</span> <span id="s428">I think my father and my grandfather went through the chamber, too.</span> <span id="s429">They took him from camp, from Poznan to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s430">That’s what I hear.</span> <span id="s431">I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s432">That’s what they said.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Who told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: So you never knew exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: I know they took him to the camp.</span> <span id="s437">But it didn’t took too long, they took him away from the camp.</span> <span id="s438">Something else was with the people from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s439">The people from the ghetto, like my mother and the sister, they took them into Chelmno.</span> <span id="s440">This was a place where they made a big bunker and they put them all in there.</span> <span id="s441">That’s what the gentile people write us when we still was in the working camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Was there a means of communicating throughout the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Not for me, this wasn’t.</span> <span id="s444">When I was in Buchenwald, I hear this was our “big” men there, like from French -- I forget the names, “big people -- they communicate, because Buchenwald, they got ammunition there underground.</span> <span id="s445">They got a big underground at Buchenwald</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Were you aware at all of the on-going war effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No.</span> <span id="s448">Nothing at all.</span> <span id="s449">In camp, no paper, no radio.</span> <span id="s450">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: What were the names of the major German personnel at the camps, such as commander and officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: I don’t remember the names.</span> <span id="s453">By face I can recognize them!</span> <span id="s454">After the war I recognized them, they recognized me, but I don’t know the names.</span> <span id="s455">We see each other in Munich after the war.</span> <span id="s456">Or in Israel later.</span> <span id="s457">I see them They see me.</span> <span id="s458">We know each other, but not by name.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: What thoughts did you give to your survival at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: You just waiting ‘til the war will get over.</span> <span id="s461">You want just to live and that’s all.</span> <span id="s462">We know already in the camp there’s nobody at home.</span> <span id="s463">After the war I didn’t went back to my hometown, because I know I didn’t have nothing to look there.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Did you ever have doubts if you would survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: When I was in camp, I never think about it, if I could survive.</span> <span id="s466">You just went on day-day, day-day.</span> <span id="s467">The last month, “March,” they said.</span> <span id="s468">So we went, 2,000 haftlinge.</span> <span id="s469">We come to the end, 158!</span> <span id="s470">One more day, nobody would be!</span> <span id="s471">They didn’t get more time to kill us.</span> <span id="s472">They just took every day some from the end -- in the woods -- and they killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: They shot them?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: They shot them!</span> <span id="s475">That’s what we see, yeah.</span> <span id="s476">They shot ‘em.</span> <span id="s477">Every day!</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: People you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: I knew by number, the most, because you didn’t get a name, you got a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: If you were transferred to other camps, could you describe them and the circumstances which led to your transfer/</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: From 1945, in January, the Russians already was close.</span> <span id="s482">They stay a long time before Falshaft.</span> <span id="s483">They didn’t went in.</span> <span id="s484">So they got time to transport us.</span> <span id="s485">We went from Auschwitz to Gliwice.</span> <span id="s486">Took us, I think, a day.</span> <span id="s487">And there we was a couple of days.</span> <span id="s488">They took us by train to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Was it the same type of situation each time?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No.</span> <span id="s491">Sometimes by foot, sometimes by train.</span> <span id="s492">If you got a far, far to go, like we went from Gliwice to Buchenwald, it was by train.</span> <span id="s493">We went through Czechoslovakia this time, I think.</span> <span id="s494">And people, they went in the morning to work.</span> <span id="s495">They throw the packages, what we eat, all day, two rolls, they throw on our wagons.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Do you remember the train rides?</span> <span id="s497">What were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Oh, very bad.</span> <span id="s499">Open trains.</span> <span id="s500">In the winter, in snow, and this was open trains the most.</span> <span id="s501">I never went in closed trains, because in the closed trains was no good.</span> <span id="s502">In winter was snow, was cold, but still was better, in open trains.</span> <span id="s503">One close to the other, we sit so close.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: How long were you in the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Sometimes this took, I think, four days, five days.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: And you were in the open train all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: All the time, Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Did you have blankets to cover yourselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Just blankets.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Did people get sick and ill?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s512">Old cars -- musty.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: What were the other camps like that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Every camp was bad.</span> <span id="s515">But each camp was different camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: How long were you in the last camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Buchenwald was the last camp, but I wasn’t too long there, because when I came to Buchenwald the first time, I was there maybe a month and I went to a different camp.</span> <span id="s518">My brother went to another camp and I went to another camp.</span> <span id="s519">After a month was already time for transportation again, so we came back to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s520">And from Buchenwald we went, April the 7th till May the 4th.</span> <span id="s521">We went to Bad Reichenhall, to the Alps, on the Germany-Austria border.</span> <span id="s522">For four weeks just running and running, because we could hear the bombardment from the Americans, so we just run with the Germans away so they could not catch us.</span> <span id="s523">When we come in, in the wood, we didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s524">We was thinking, “ This is the last day, and we go in there, and they kill us all.”</span> <span id="s525">But when we come in, this was a camp from just womans -- in the same camp.</span> <span id="s526">And this was twenty-four hours, maybe, before the Americans come in.</span> <span id="s527">They put us in empty barracks, everyone gets on his head a baseball stick.</span> <span id="s528">And we didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s529">The Germans run away.</span> <span id="s530">We didn’t know that we didn’t have nobody outside around us!</span> <span id="s531">If we’d know, couldn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s532">Everyone was sick anyway.</span> <span id="s533">But after twenty-four hours -- in the night -- come in American soldiers.</span> <span id="s534">They told us that we’re free.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: So when were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: May the 4th, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Can you describe what happened on that day?</span> <span id="s538">Do you remember the day well?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: This day, when we went, I remember like now.</span> <span id="s540">We were already only 158 haftlinge.</span> <span id="s541">A gentile woman, we ask her just, “ What time is?’</span> <span id="s542">And she told us, “ In five minute.”</span> <span id="s543">We didn’t know what the “five minute” means.</span> <span id="s544">And in the five minute, we see.</span> <span id="s545">We go in woods there.</span> <span id="s546">And we were thinking, “ This is the end!”</span> <span id="s547">But this was a camp.</span> <span id="s548">And this was the last day what they come in the night, and tell us American soldiers is coming.</span> <span id="s549">One was a Jew.</span> <span id="s550">And this happened!</span> <span id="s551">One Jew come with the soldiers.</span> <span id="s552">He was a Polish Jew with American passport!</span> <span id="s553">And he wasn’t in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s554">American citizen!</span> <span id="s555">And when he come in, this comrade, what I lived together in transport, was his cousin!</span> <span id="s556">(Laughs.)</span> <span id="s557">But right away, they went away.</span> <span id="s558">Maybe this took an hour, two -- the soldier, with a jeep -- and they come right back with a lot of food.</span> <span id="s559">And the people start to eat.</span> <span id="s560">And they get sick.</span> <span id="s561">This was very bad, because they didn’t eat so long, was a lot sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Why did they get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: From the food.</span> <span id="s564">Was too fat, maybe.</span> <span id="s565">You ate from cans food, and package food, and if you didn’t eat three, four years, you start to eat because you’re hungry, it’s no good.</span> <span id="s566">I remember I still was in good shape.</span> <span id="s567">Because when we come in the morning, they ask who can go down and make clean a little bed because everyone was sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: They took good care of us.</span> <span id="s570">Come doctors and they took away from us everything what somebody got.</span> <span id="s571">After a week, I got typhus.</span> <span id="s572">Doctors, they gave us good health.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: What condition were you in?</span> <span id="s574">You had lost a lot of weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Who is talking about weight!</span> <span id="s576">Everyone lost weight1 (Laughs.)</span> <span id="s577">This is not the problem.</span> <span id="s578">This you overcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: What did you do after you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: For the first four weeks I was sick!</span> <span id="s581">A big thing.</span> <span id="s582">But later I started to look if somebody -- my brother -- is alive, because I see in the same year, in the beginning, we came together to Buchenwald from Buna, but I didn’t know where he is, if he is alive or not.</span> <span id="s583">When I recuperated a little, I went to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s584">I stopped in every city and in every town in Germany and look, ask, but I couldn’t find nothing!</span> <span id="s585">And I come back home to the same camp, to Bad Reichenhall.</span> <span id="s586">In the car was maybe three or four people.</span> <span id="s587">And they ask me where I go.</span> <span id="s588">And went by car.</span> <span id="s589">Was Jewish people in this car.</span> <span id="s590">They come in this camp.</span> <span id="s591">So I asking somebody if he know -- He asked my name.</span> <span id="s592">“ Sure,” he said, I know a Schwartz -- Avraham Schwartz.</span> <span id="s593">He is living there, not far from this town.”</span> <span id="s594">And he gave me the address for my brother.</span> <span id="s595">My brother didn’t know, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s596">But I was already tired, so my friend said, ‘ you know what?</span> <span id="s597">I go.”</span> <span id="s598">Because he know him, too -- from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s599">And he went and he told my brother that I am alive, so the brother came to visit me in the camp.</span> <span id="s600">So we was together -- after.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Did you stay together?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s603">We stayed not far.</span> <span

<p><span id="s612">Q: How did you get to the United States, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Because of my brother and my wife’s brother living here, too.</span> <span id="s614">But now, all my children, they’re back in Israel.</span> <span id="s615">Our children there, and so my place is there again, to go back.</span> <span id="s616">I don’t have nobody here.</span> <span id="s617">I have

a Jew!</span> <span id="s722">And that’s what I said every time and I’m saying this same today!</span> <span id="s723">I am proud what is Israel for me today, and this was my dream!</span> <span id="s724">Before the war!</span> <span id="s725">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s726">After the war, nobody could send me no place, just to Israel.</span> <span id="s727">And that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s728">Now I come back, but you can see all mine kids, they back there.</span> <span id="s729">I have two daughters, married, with children.</span> <span id="s730">And my son is

<span id="s734">This is what you have, that’s all.</span> <span id="s735">That’s your investment.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: What type of work do you do now, Max?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: I am working a shipping clerk for Northern Cap.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: How long have you been doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Twenty years since 1962.</span> <span

id="s748">A: Not special, after so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Do people ask you about your experiences from time to time?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s751">In Germany, there we were in a town just two Jewish.</span> <span id="s752">They asked some times.</span> <span id="s753">I thought that some maybe know and some didn’t know.</span> <span id="s754">What could you do?</span> <span id="s755">Nobody can give me back my parents.</span> <span id="s756">(Long pause.)</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Has it been hard for you to talk about this experience with me today?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: No.</span> <span id="s759">It’s good, sometimes, to talk over what it was, because I never was interviewed.</span> <span id="s760">You never can give out from you just what I went through.</span> <span id="s761">You went through so many things, that you want everything to write, it’s not enough paper and not enough, everything what you went through, day-by-day.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Have you tried to write it at any point, or thought you might?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: No.</span> <span id="s764">I was talking with a friend, he writes a book.</span> <span id="s765">I find a lot from my town in the papers sometime.</span> <span id="s766">Every week you have in the Jewish paper somebody.</span> <span id="s767">I think, well, this will be, maybe, a little more, because the younger generation, they forget this anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: That’s why we’re doing this project, so they won’t forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s770">I know.</span> <span id="s771">We put a mezuzah from our town in Tel Aviv, in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s772">And we have one in Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s773">You making every year a Yiskor.</span> <span id="s774">What can you do more?</span> <span id="s775">The kids -- some maybe still remember a little bit, but not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: They ask you from time to time?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s778">They listen.</span> <span id="s779">They don’t need to ask.</span> <span id="s780">They read now, by themselves.</span> <span id="s781">When you are small, maybe you ask.</span> <span id="s782">But now they have their kids, they have their problems.</span> <span id="s783">(Laughs) Let’s say another generation, but the generation later, we’ll be history.</span> <span id="s784">We’ll be what we are writing now.</span> <span id="s785">Maybe a hundred years around come the children and read this, if this is true or not, like me, sometime talking about, “Could this be true.</span> <span id="s786">Could be this.’</span> <span id="s787">We see Masada, other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Have you read any accounts by people you knew or people that had similar experiences at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Well, I talked with one, he is living Canada, and he told me he is finishing a book.</span> <span id="s790">He send me the books.</span> <span id="s791">He remember every little piece from our town, so he is writing everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Has he interviewed you, too?</span> <span id="s793">Has he talked to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Sometime he asks me just if I remember this and this.</span> <span id="s795">How good his memory is, but everyone forgot so many years.</span> <span id="s796">You can’t remember everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Does it bring back a lot of memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: They’d like to know if you have anything you might want to share for the purpose of the research or exhibition -- such as photos or mementoes, or anything at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: From there, no.</span> <span id="s801">Nothing left.</span></p> <p><span
