Interviews: December 9, 1980</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Q: I am Charles Berry.</span> <span id="s4">This is Tuesday night, December 9, 1980.</span> <span id="s5">I am in the home of Mr. Abraham Stine for the first of a series of interviews Now.</span> <span id="s6">Abe, as I indicated to you when I talked to you last week, this first interview is really sort of background material.</span> <span id="s7">Let me say first that I normally take notes during an interview, especially on foreign words and places, names and so forth.</span> <span id="s8">Sometimes I am operating the tape recorder and sometimes I am taking notes, but I am always listening to what you are saying.</span> <span id="s9">Let us start with very basic information.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">You told me last week that you were born in 1917.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Let us say 1920, because 1920 is set down in all the places.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s13">You don’t want?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: No, because it is not legal.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: You told me that you were born in 1917, in the village of Zabkowice [spelled and repeated by Abel].</span> <span id="s16">Could you describe that village for me?</span> <span id="s17">For example, was it a mixed village of Jews and gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Was it predominately Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: No!</span> <span id="s21">There were 70 Jewish families in the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Was it an agricultural village?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes, agricultural.</span> <span id="s24">Most of the villages in Poland are agricultural villages.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: The reason why I asked that is that it is down in southern Poland near Katowice.</span> <span id="s26">That is a very heavily industrialized area.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: We had small factories in this village.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: What kind of factories?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Glass tube factories and one which dealt with stones.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Quarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Where they make monuments?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Monuments?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: No, regular stones.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Like building stones?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Was there coal mining in the region?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: No.</span> <span id="s38">Coal mining was about seven or eight miles from our village.</span> <span id="s39">They used to have the Dumrobads for the coal mines.</span> <span id="s40">In our village they had stone mines.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Did very many people who lived in this village commute into Katowice or other surrounding towns to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yes, they had to commute to other towns, but only by train or by horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Did they do that for work?</span> <span id="s44">Did they work in these towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: No, not too many.</span> <span id="s46">Most of them worked right in Zabkowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: So the rest of the population then was predominately Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yes, 99 percent!</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And there were 70 Jewish families?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Do you know much about your family background?</span> <span id="s51">When did your family come to this village?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: My family had been there for at least a couple of generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Do you know where they came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: No, I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: When you were a child, growing up in the village, how large was your family?</span> <span id="s56">Did your grandparents live with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes, my mother’s parents, they used to live about seven or eight km [kilometers] from us, in Belsinger, when I was born.</span> <span id="s58">They went to Israel (then Palestine) in 1936.</span> <span id="s59">Those were my mother’s parents.</span> <span id="s60">They did that because my mother had a sister in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: What did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: My father was a butcher.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: He didn’t buy cattle?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: He went out, about 10 or 15 miles around, buying cattle.</span> <span id="s65">He had a small butcher shop, like they have here.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: So I suppose he was rather well known in that immediate region?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Let me stay on the same subject of your family.</span> <span id="s69">Were you the first born or…</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: I was first born in my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: You were the oldest child?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: I was the oldest son.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Then you had how many siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: I had seven sisters and brothers, three brothers and four sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: So there were eight children as a total in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: When was the last one born?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: My sister was born in 1938, that is 1937 or 38.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: So that is quite a spread then from 1917 to 1937.</span> <span id="s80">That is eight children over a period of 21 years.</span> <span id="s81">What was your mother’s maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Sarah.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Her last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: It was Stine, the same spelling.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q; Were your parents distant cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: It was somewhat further than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Now what did your grandfather do?</span> <span id="s88">What did your mother’s father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: My mother’s father was a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s90">I don’t remember what my father’s father did.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Was he dead before you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: You said that your mother had several sisters or brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: She had about eight sisters and brothers, but they lived seven or eight miles outside the village.</span> <span id="s95">Only one of the sisters survived in Palestine.</span> <span id="s96">My father had I think nine sisters and brothers and nobody survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Did they live in the immediate region too?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: No, only one sister and one brother used to live in the same village.</span> <span id="s99">The rest of them were spread over about 10 or 15 miles.</span> <span id="s100">Not one of them survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: That indicates that there really was a large family, with lots of aunts and uncles and cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yes, hundreds.</span> <span id="s103">In the same village where we used to live there was one uncle who had eleven children.</span> <span id="s104">Five of these children went to Palestine before the war.</span> <span id="s105">They survived!</span> <span id="s106">The rest of them are gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Let me pursue this line of thought about going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s108">I knew that that was rather common amongst many German Jews in the 1920’s and in the 1930’s.</span> <span id="s109">I really didn’t realize that a lot of Polish Jews went.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yes there were a lot of them.</span> <span id="s111">[Chaim Weizman, the first President of Israel, was born in Russia in 1874, David Ben Gurion and Menachem Begin were born in Poland, Golda Meir was born in Russia].</span> <span id="s112">Maybe you heard of a man whose name was Jabotinsky.</span> <span id="s113">[Vladimir Jabotinsky, 1880-1940, was born in Russia.</span> <span id="s114">He was a writer and orator.</span> <span id="s115">He worked for Jewish self-defense and the revival of Hebrew].</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Jabotinsky was a very famous Zionist [that is the movement amongst modern Jews to revive a Jewish homeland in Palestine either for religious or nationalistic purposes].</span> <span id="s118">He foresaw this in the early 1930’s.</span> <span id="s119">He begged people not to continue living in Poland.</span> <span id="s120">Part of the people didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s121">First of all, many people didn’t believe that this would happen.</span> <span id="s122">He told people, “Just get out!”</span> <span id="s123">Not everybody, however, had the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Do you remember if there was much serious talk in your immediate family, your parents, your brothers and sisters, about going?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Only later, in late 1938 and 1939.</span> <span id="s126">Oh yes, they were talking about it because people saw the handwriting in the sky.</span> <span id="s127">You had to believe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Was there much, in this village, interaction between the non-Jews and Jewish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Always!</span> <span id="s130">Always!</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: In other words, the 70 Jewish families did not live in a cluster.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s133">They were spread all over.</span> <span id="s134">However, they did not like Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: There was a lot of anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: At every move you made.</span> <span id="s137">On Christmas Day, we had lots of snow, we cleaned the streets off.</span> <span id="s138">They used to take small stones and put them in the snow and torment you since it was believed that Jesus was killed by the Jews.</span> <span id="s139">Believe it or not, that was in Poland before 1939.</span> <span id="s140">When I came back to Poland, in 1945, after I was liberated, I was in the hospital for three months.</span> <span id="s141">I then went back to Poland to see if I had anyone left.</span> <span id="s142">First thing that happened, someone asked, “Are you still alive?”</span> <span id="s143">That shocked me as if a bomb had been dropped on me.</span> <span id="s144">I cannot, today, forget it.</span> <span id="s145">I said, “The heck with you, I don’t want you!”</span> <span id="s146">I was born there, I was raised there.</span> <span id="s147">I had all my family there and everything, and then I came back after going through so much and he asked me, “Are you still alive?”</span> <span id="s148">My wife has told me about twenty times to go back to Poland just to visit.</span> <span id="s149">I have said, “No, no!”</span> <span id="s150">I hate what these Polacks [a derogatory term for Polish people] did to the Jews!</span> <span id="s151">We could survive, that is a lot of us could have survived in hiding places but they betrayed us for a bottle of whiskey.</span> <span id="s152">They gave us up.</span> <span id="s153">In different countries that was not done like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Was there any exception to this in your village?</span> <span id="s155">Were there some righteous Christians?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: What I am asking you is, were you aware of any gentiles who were friendly to Jews, who did not practice anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I wouldn’t know because during the war I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s159">I cannot say.</span> <span id="s160">Before the war, yes, I used to have some friends.</span> <span id="s161">All the people, the older generation, were quiet.</span> <span id="s162">How long that lasted, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s163">As long as Pilsudski [1867-1935, Polish Field Marshal and statesman, President 1918 to Dec.1922, Prime Minister 1926-1928 and 1930, power behind the Polish government at all times between the restoration of Poland until his death] was alive anyway.</span> <span id="s164">Did you hear about Pilsudski?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Oh yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: It was very quiet as long as he was alive.</span> <span id="s167">After Pilsudski passed away, Smigly-Rydz [Marshall Edward Smigly-Ridz, Josef Beck, and a group of Pilsudski’s colonels retained absolute power until WWII started on Sept 1, 1939].</span> <span id="s168">However, when Smigly-Rydz came to power, it was out in the open.</span> <span id="s169">Nobody hid it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: What kind of education did you receive in this village?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I received little education because I had to help my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Was it a city public school?</span> <span id="s173">Was it a synagogue school?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s175">A Yeshiva at the synagogue, with teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: In other words, was it operated by the state?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: So in essence you were segregated from the gentile population.</span> <span id="s179">They went to a state run school whereas you went to the Yeshiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: No, I went to a state-run school also.</span> <span id="s181">I entered the state-run public school also.</span> <span id="s182">However, I went to separate Talmudic school [this appears to be meaning the same as Yeshiva, which in the U.S. is reserved to mean University level studies, generally for the rabbinate].</span> <span id="s183">The Yeshiva was completely separate from public school.</span> <span id="s184">Actually, I did not go to Yeshiva, I went to Talmud school.</span> <span id="s185">[The Talmud is the entire body of Jewish civil and canonical law].</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Did you go to Talmud school at the same time you went to public school?</span> <span id="s187">That is, part of the day to public school and part of the day to Talmud school?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: No, after public school, I went to Talmud school.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Now, how long were you in public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Were you aware of a great deal of anti-Semitism while you were in public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s193">Always!</span> <span id="s194">Always they called us, “You Jews!”</span> <span id="s195">in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: You heard that from teachers also?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: The teachers did not exactly say that, but always they treated us differently.</span> <span id="s198">The teachers in Poland were bureaucrats.</span> <span id="s199">A teacher was a big person who got respect.</span> <span id="s200">When you saw a teacher you had to take your hat off and say, “Hello, Mr. or Mrs. …”, not like we do here.</span> <span id="s201">When the teacher came into the classroom, everybody had to get up.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Were there lots of fights in this school because you were a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Not in the class, after school.</span> <span id="s204">We had about 10 minutes for what you call a recess.</span> <span id="s205">Outside of school there was a lot of fighting, yes!</span> <span id="s206">There was that fighting with the snow.</span> <span id="s207">The teacher didn’t want to know since he was not involved, even when we complained to him about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: There was no way to complain to the civilian authorities about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: No.</span> <span id="s210">If you went to the police to complain, they said, “He didn’t kill you!</span> <span id="s211">What do you want?”</span> <span id="s212">That was the reaction of the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Was this the general pattern of education for your other brothers and sisters?</span> <span id="s214">Meaning that they only had about five or six years and then dropped out to start to work in the family business, or in other businesses?</span> <span id="s215">[That question seems to ignore that the youngest siblings were not yet in school when the Germans invaded].</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s217">That is what I would say.</span> <span id="s218">Not in the family business, because we didn’t have a big business.</span> <span id="s219">We did do outside work.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: So, how old were you then when you left school to go to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: About 13 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Then you became a butcher?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Before I became a butcher, I did everything just to make a dollar.</span> <span id="s224">Later, when I was older, I learned to be a butcher.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Did you work along with your father in his shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: What you are describing to me implies that your family was not very well off.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: No, they were poor.</span> <span id="s229">They had a large number of children and mouths to feed.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Did your mother and father have any formal education?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s232">I know that my father could read.</span> <span id="s233">He had more Jewish education and he had more Polish education also.</span> <span id="s234">He used to speak perfect Polish, perfect, better than I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: You told me about speaking languages.</span> <span id="s236">I suppose that Yiddish was the language in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: In the home we spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s238">In the big cities, a big percentage of the Jewish people didn’t know Polish, however in all the villages you spoke perfect Polish.</span> <span id="s239">You wrote and spoke Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Now, there was a large German population in this area also?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: No, not in our area, higher up in Katowice, about 53 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Around Opeln and Gliwice and Bytom?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yes, over there, yes.</span> <span id="s244">I know that.</span> <span id="s245">I used to work there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: There also was a language which was spoken in that area that was sort of a mixture of Polish and German.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes, yes, Polish and German [that was in Upper Silesia, a province which was returned to German rule in 1936, but which, historically, was a part of Germany for a long time].</span> <span id="s248">However that dialect did not exist in our area.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: So you didn’t know that dialect?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Did you learn any other languages?</span> <span id="s252">Did you learn German in this region?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: I learned some German.</span> <span id="s254">I understood some German because I was a prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: No, I mean in this period of the twenties and the thirties.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: In the dealings which you had with the farmers, buying cattle, what was the language?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: It was Polish and Yiddish.</span> <span id="s259">These were my languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Now, what about the religious practices of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: My family was very religious.</span> <span id="s262">I had to go every Saturday to synagogue.</span> <span id="s263">If I wouldn’t go I would be punished at home.</span> <span id="s264">I had to go every Saturday.</span> <span id="s265">That is Friday night and Saturday and on all the Holy Days.</span> <span id="s266">We didn’t know what it was not to go to synagogue for such a day as Shevout [also spelled Shabuot or Feast of Weeks.</span> <span id="s267">That is the festival which celebrates the day when the 10 commandments were revealed on Mount Sinai.</span> <span id="s268">It is called Feast of Weeks because it occurs seven weeks, i.e., a week of weeks, after the first day of Passover].</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Were you kosher [observing the dietary laws] in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Oh, yes, 100 percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Your father was a kosher butcher?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Oh yes, we didn’t know any other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Were you and your brothers Bar Mitzvahed ?</span> <span id="s274">That is when the Jewish male starts to be counted as a cognizant member of the congregation, usually at the age of 13].</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s276">It was not a big thing like here, we just went to services.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: In the Talmud school, would you mind describing the Talmud school?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: I went to Talmud school only in the evenings, just to learn to read and to write [Hebrew].</span> <span id="s279">We read the prayer book.</span> <span id="s280">I did not get too much education in Talmud school.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: What kind of teachers did you have in Talmud school?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: All the rabbis taught, and special teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Was there a local congregation?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: In the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes, it was only a local congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Otherwise said, the Talmud teachers didn’t travel around?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Oh no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: They lived in the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yes, or someplace in the outskirts.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: How many students were in the Talmud school, roughly?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: I would say about 25 or 30, at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Were they approximately the same age as you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Oh, no, different ages.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Looking back over these long years, do you remember your family and your family life with a great deal of fondness?</span> <span id="s296">Was it a closely integrated family with a lot of love?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: A fully integrated family.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Or was it the kind of family where everyone was going off in a different direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Oh no, a fully integrated family.</span> <span id="s300">Most of the people in Europe had integrated families.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Was your mother a strong figure?</span> <span id="s302">Who dominated in the family, the mother or the father?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: The father had always the decisive opinion, only the father.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Was your father involved in any sort of business association like a small chamber of commerce?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Did he play any kind of leadership role amongst the business people?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: No, because my parents were not rich, they were poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q; How political was your family?</span> <span id="s309">Did you talk about politics at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s311">I was a Zionist [this is a collective name for several associations who favored a return of Jews to Palestine.</span> <span id="s312">Zionist organizations exist today to support the state of Israel].</span> <span id="s313">However, my parents were not Zionists.</span> <span id="s314">They did not believe in politics at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Did you find that there was any sort of tension or friction between you and your parents due to the Zionism?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s317">They tolerated it.</span> <span id="s318">They knew that I belonged to the organization and I went out of my way not to offend.</span> <span id="s319">That is all.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: When did you first take on the ideas of Zionism?</span> <span id="s321">When did you first become aware of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: The Zionist organization [in Abe’s area] started in 1935 or 1936, when the leaders such as Jabotinsky and others came in.</span> <span id="s323">[Actually, worldwide Zionist organizations had been set up by the newspaperman Theodore Herzl when the virulent anti-Jewish movement centered upon the show trial of French army Captain Alfred Dreyfus took place in the 1890s].</span> <span id="s324">Actually Jabotinsky was a good friend of Menachem Begin, they used to belong to the same organization when both lived in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Is Begin from your region also?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: No.</span> <span id="s327">we had heard about him before the war, but he was also from Poland, we had heard about him before the war because of his Zionism.</span> <span id="s328">He belonged to the same party as Jabotinsky, but he was more aggressive.</span> <span id="s329">He said, “We have to take guns in our hands!”</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: This region of Silesia -- is that right, that you lived in a region of Silesia -- that is the area from which you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: From Upper Silesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yes, from Upper Silesia.</span> <span id="s334">They called it Dumbroskia.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Was your area around Katowice at one time a part of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Katowice was, but Zabkowice was not.</span> <span id="s337">[prior to the end of WWI there was no Poland at all.</span> <span id="s338">During the nineteenth century, Poland had been repeatedly divided between Austria, Russia and Germany.</span> <span id="s339">The three areas had a common point near Krakow].</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So the border had been right there, in your area.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes, within 50 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Would you say that Polish culture predominated in your area?</span> <span id="s343">Or was it German culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: It was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Despite the proximity of the border you were still very much under Polish influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes, very much under Polish influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Now, how widely had you traveled let us say by 1935; by the time you were 18 or 19 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: At my age, not too many people in our area traveled like I used to!</span> <span id="s349">I used to buy in different cities for different small businesses, to buy merchandise from other stores.</span> <span id="s350">Most of the people didn’t travel that much.</span> <span id="s351">I used to know the area all around our village for about 25 to 30 km [i.e., 15 to 20 miles].</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Did you travel outside this immediate Silesian region?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Had you gone to Warsaw, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A; No.</span> <span id="s356">I went to Katowice and I went to Lodz and I went to Bytom and Beuliz and I went to Gliwice.</span> <span id="s357">I used to go to Auschwitz before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: What about outside of Poland?</span> <span id="s359">Had you been anywhere else To Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: No, no place outside Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Could you describe your synagogue for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: It was a small synagogue.</span> <span id="s363">The synagogue was, maybe half the size of this house.</span> <span id="s364">In the same village we had two synagogues for 70 Jewish families.</span> <span id="s365">One was “ultra-orthodox” and the other one was an “orthodox” one.</span> <span id="s366">In the ultra-orthodox, people used to sit in the synagogue day and night, for the Holy Days.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Which did your family belong to?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: To the orthodox one.</span> <span id="s369">In the ultra-orthodox synagogue, people used to come in the evening and stay all night and pray.</span> <span id="s370">You don’t see that in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: What about the rabbis?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: We didn’t have rabbis.</span> <span id="s373">In the village where I used to live we didn’t have a rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Would a rabbi come from somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: No, we didn’t need any because all the orthodox Jews, they know how to conduct prayer (that is what you learn to do when you are Bar Mitzvah).</span> <span id="s376">With a “minyan” [i.e., where there are at least 10 Jewish men present], you can conduct a service.</span> <span id="s377">First of all, we didn’t have enough money to pay a rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Who were the leaders in the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: We had leaders!</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Who?</span> <span id="s381">For example, were they businessmen or were they farmers?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: No, no, they were businessmen.</span> <span id="s383">We had some very rich people in town.</span> <span id="s384">They also had poor people.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Now, what sort of position did they hold in the Jewish community and in the synagogue?</span> <span id="s386">Would you characterize them as President of the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: We had a committee, a small organization.</span> <span id="s388">The rich people put the money in this organization, without interest, so that loans could be made to small users of money, people who didn’t have the money.</span> <span id="s389">These people could take out a loan without interest, but they had to have two signatures on it.</span> <span id="s390">On the Holy Days they gave to the poor people food.</span> <span id="s391">They took partners with them from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s392">There were some people who got the help directly from the synagogues.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Now, may I jump ahead and talk about that organization in your town, that Jewish organization in your town, in the hierarchy, say in the period from Sept. 1939 until the spring of 1940, when there was the round-up.</span> <span id="s394">Who assumed leadership amongst the Jewish community in that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: The same people who had led the congregation and who had the knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: That is what I was wondering about.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yes, they were the same people.</span> <span id="s398">When the Germans came in, they chose their own people.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: So I assume then that the synagogues were then truly the focal point of your community.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: That is right, the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Also of your family life.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yes, the synagogue.</span> <span id="s403">Everything was centered there.</span> <span id="s404">Everything was in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s405">The young people, the younger generation, between themselves arranged for a dance for Saturday night.</span> <span id="s406">However, the other people didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s407">As far as they were concerned everything was at the synagogue.</span> <span id="s408">Where we here have the Jewish Center, they had the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Did you resent that?</span> <span id="s410">Did you come to resent that?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s412">I was brought up this way!</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: In other words, you accepted it.</span> <span id="s414">To you it seemed the normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Yes, it seemed the normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: You never recall questioning it.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: As a matter of fact, believe it or not, I am missing it when I go to the synagogue here.</span> <span id="s418">I have a son who is 32 years old, who is on the Board of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s419">I was brought out this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: So this activism has transferred itself to the present time.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: I used to work much more in the organizations ay nights than I am doing now.</span> <span id="s422">I used to go out to raise money by selling Israel Bonds [bonds which the State of Israel sold in the U.S. to raise money to do non-military permanent improvements such as housing project for new immigrants.</span> <span id="s423">The rates of return were comparable to those of U.S. defense Bonds], work for the Zionist organization, work for the JNF [the Jewish National Fund].</span> <span id="s424">Do you know what the JNF is?</span> <span id="s425">I used to go out to raise money.</span> <span id="s426">[The JNF was set up to solicit funds as donations to purchase lands in Palestine first and then later in Israel and to reforest the land].</span> <span id="s427">However, several years ago I got disgusted.</span> <span id="s428">I went to some people’s houses and asked for some money for Israel, and a guy told me, a good friend of mine, told me, “You know I cannot give money everyplace.”</span> <span id="s429">I said, “Do you know why you cannot give money everyplace?</span> <span id="s430">Because you are not giving it anyplace.”</span> <span id="s431">He didn’t know what to answer to that.</span> <span id="s432">I got disgusted and I said, “I won’t go out and raise more money!”</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: We have been talking very generally about your childhood and your teenage years; do you recall any specific incidents which stick out in your mind?</span> <span id="s434">Any particular holiday?</span> <span id="s435">Holy Day?</span> <span id="s436">Any particular event at school?</span> <span id="s437">Any particular teacher in the Talmud school?</span> <span id="s438">We all come into our adult lives with specific memories.</span> <span id="s439">Were your memories generally happy?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: No, I wasn’t happy, because I didn’t have much money.</span> <span id="s441">I couldn’t afford to have my teeth taken care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: so it was somehow tainted by the poverty.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s444">You know, when I was twenty, that was life.</span> <span id="s445">That was the start of my adult life.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: After you reached your teenage years, say around the age of 16, were you still largely associating with Jews within the community?</span> <span id="s447">Had you developed any contact at all with gentiles of the same age?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s449">My only friends were Jews.</span> <span id="s450">There was no contact at all with gentiles.</span> <span id="s451">You see, we lived in a circle with Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: You know what lies behind that question?</span> <span id="s453">You often hear the phrase, “Children can be very cruel” and “Children don’t understand.”</span> <span id="s454">However, you expect that when you begin to approach maturity, such as 15, 16, 17, you lose a lot of that.</span> <span id="s455">You begin to understand, you become a little more tolerant then.</span> <span id="s456">You didn’t find the gentiles more receptive?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s458">We couldn’t.</span> <span id="s459">We didn’t associate at all with them.</span> <span id="s460">You knew that they could put a knife into you behind your back, and that if they could they would.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Would you say that a lot of that anti-Semitism came out of the Catholic Church, there in Zabkowice?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yes, it was taught in the Catholic Church.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: That the priest was an anti-Semite?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yes, it was centered in the Catholic Church.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: He preached anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s467">99 percent of the people were Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Do you remember 1933, when Hitler came to power in Germany?</span> <span id="s469">You were 16 years old.</span> <span id="s470">Were you aware of those things happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yes, the paper came out with it.</span> <span id="s472">That is when really anti-Semitism got started, when Hitler came to power in 1933, 34.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: In other words, the Poles there, in Silesia, felt that they had sort of been given a stamp of approval in their anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s474">It all broke out into the open?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yes, that is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: So, life became miserable?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Yes, miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: This continued through the thirties?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: It continues until today.</span> <span id="s480">The later it got, the worse it got!</span> <span id="s481">It got worse when it got closer to the war.</span> <span id="s482">They knew that Hitler was coming in.</span> <span id="s483">They knew it because we had a German whose name was Moshitsky [that’s at least what it sounds like], he was Minister of Defense [at that time, generally speaking, there was no single Minister of Defense, but a Minister of the Army and one of the Navy, with the Army at least in continental Europe, being more powerful], I believe.</span> <span id="s484">No, it was actually Beck [that was the name of one of the colonels in the Junta which governed Poland at the time]; he was a real German.</span> <span id="s485">He took all the other things apart when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Did he do that so that the Poles couldn’t defend themselves?</span> <span id="s487">As the war approached, let us say at the time of the Munich agreement of 1938, with the Sudetenland question in Czechoslovakia, did you and your family become really concerned [at the time when the British-Franco caved in at Munich and handed the Sudetenland to Germany in Sept, 1938, they accepted Hitler’s solemn pledge that this was the last of his demands for land] that something imminent was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: No, no!</span> <span id="s489">The people didn’t believe that at all.</span> <span id="s490">You see, all the people had gone through WWI with the Germans [the people of that region were undoubtedly serving in different armies, either the Russian, the Austro-Russian, or the German].</span> <span id="s491">They were a different generation.</span> <span id="s492">They didn’t believe that war would happen again.</span> <span id="s493">They said that it’s not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Do you suppose that in your region down there, just north of Czechoslovakia [that country had been carved out of the Austrian, and also some German and Russian, territory at the Treaty of Versailles] in Silesia, that perhaps that one of the reasons that this attitude prevailed amongst the Jews was that part of Silesia was in a protectorate under the League of Nations?</span> <span id="s495">[That protectorate ended in 1936].</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: No, that didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: That it, maybe, gave people a false sense of security?</span> <span id="s498">[The sense of security was derived from the alliance between Poland and France and England, the two “major” military powers in Europe].</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: No.</span> <span id="s500">Our sense of security came only from the fact that people didn’t believe it would be bad because they said that during WWI, a lot of Germans helped them [against the virulent anti-Semitism of the Poles which had expressed itself in pogroms].</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Zabkowice was not in that protectorate?</span> <span id="s502">[Zabkowice was in Poland and the Protectorate was in Germany].</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: It was in the League of Nations protectorate?</span> <span id="s505">Between WWI and 1937?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: No, no, no!</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: However, just west of you, it was in the protectorate?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yes, Katowice was.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Now Katowice was occupied on Sept. 5, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No, Katowice was occupied on Sept. 1, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s512">So, the day of the invasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yes, the day of the invasion they entered Katowice, and Zabkowice too.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: On Sept.1st?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s516">On Sept. 1st.</span> <span id="s517">You see Katowice contained a large percentage of Germans.</span> <span id="s518">They let them in, with open arms.</span> <span id="s519">There wasn’t any fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Had you considered joining the Polish Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: No!</span> <span id="s522">You see, the Polish Army took only really strong people.</span> <span id="s523">They didn’t take everybody.</span> <span id="s524">I was rejected from the Polish Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Did you have a physical?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: I had a sickness, I don’t remember what kind of sickness, and I was rejected.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Were you not a healthy child?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Do you recall Sept. 1, 1939?</span> <span id="s530">Could you describe what happened?</span> <span id="s531">This will be the last question which I will ask you for the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Never mind that!</span> <span id="s533">I got time.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Well the tape is about to run out.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: They [the Germans] came in on Sept. 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s536">The first thing they did was to take all the Jews out to the street.</span> <span id="s537">We had a railroad station in the village.</span> <span id="s538">They took all the Jews to the railroad station to clean the toilets.</span> <span id="s539">[Then comes a sentence about something else which was done, but it is not intelligible].</span> <span id="s540">They did that the first day they came in just to show their power and that they meant business.</span> <span id="s541">They did that right the first day.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: How did they get the Jews out to the streets?</span> <span id="s543">Did they knock or pound on doors?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: They just announced it.</span> <span id="s545">They came with a loud speaker.</span> <span id="s546">First thing was that they came to the committee and said that the committee should bring all the Jewish people out who are able to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: So you went out?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: All your family went out?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: No, not the little children who could not work.</span> <span id="s551">They came in and said that they need 250 people.</span> <span id="s552">Later they formed their own committee.</span> <span id="s553">Then they didn’t go anyplace else when they needed people; they just went to their committee.</span> <span id="s554">They held the President of the committee to be personally responsible.</span> <span id="s555">So he had to deliver the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: So that committee was organized just immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Right away!</span> <span id="s558">Right away!</span> <span id="s559">They knew who the leaders were; they knew because all villages had a committee of leaders.</span> <span id="s560">They used them.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Do you remember being frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Everybody was frightened because they came in really like storm troopers.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Was there a lot of rough handling?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yes, right on the first day because they wanted to show their power and to scare everybody.</span> <span id="s565">They did that everyplace to scare everybody.</span> <span id="s566">They shot some people right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: The first day?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Right away in order to scare people.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Whom did they choose to shoot?</span> <span id="s570">Not the leaders?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s572">Nobody special.</span> <span id="s573">Not then.</span> <span id="s574">Later they took the leaders but I was gone.</span> <span id="s575">I left right way.</span> <span id="s576">After I received mail from my parents I understood that they always took the leaders.</span> <span id="s577">I was no longer home.</span> <span id="s578">I was in camp by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q; When were you picked up to go to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: In 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: What I am talking about is that period from September of 1939 on into 1940, before you went to the camp.</span> <span id="s582">There were about six or seven months when you lived in Zabkowice before you were picked up to go to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Then I lived about a normal life.</span> <span id="s584">Day by day they changed everything.</span> <span id="s585">People got used to changes every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: This is what I want to start talking to you about then next Thursday.</span> <span id="s587">Then I want to cover that period from Sept. 1939 to the time when you were shipped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: This is Thursday, April 28, 1981.</span> <span id="s589">I am in the home of Mr. Abraham Stine for the second of a series of interviews.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">B: Abe, last time I talked with you, some four months ago, and so far we have only had this one interview, what we had done, in a sense, was to survey the background up to Sept. 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s591">You had been describing to me your family, and the village of Zabkowice, your occupation, your education, that type of information.</span> <span id="s592">Right at the end of the interview we had gotten to the outbreak of WWII, that is with the invasion of the Germans and the occupation of Zabkowice and Katowice on Sept. 1.</span> <span id="s593">You had said that, right from the very beginning, the Germans asserted their anti-Semitism and their authority on the very first day of their occupation.</span> <span id="s594">They had forced the Jews to come out into the street and to clean the railway terminal.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: We had the anti-Semitism before the Germans came in, everywhere in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: The Germans just actuated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: What I would really like to deal with, as I indicated to you in the letter which I wrote, is that period from Sept. of 1939 down to the spring of 1940, when you were picked up in a round-up and shipped to your first labor camp.</span> <span id="s599">This is the process by which the Germans took over the village of Zabkowice.</span> <span id="s600">Could you recall, for example, how large an occupation force there was in your village.</span> <span id="s601">How many German troops or Gestapo [this stands for Geheime Staats Polizei, meaning Secret State Police] were there in the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: I would say one dozen or fifteen altogether.</span> <span id="s603">They, right away, got the former Polish police to work together with them.</span> <span id="s604">I understand that later on they gave the Polish police their guns and everything, but at first they took these guns etc., away.</span> <span id="s605">All the time, however, they worked together with the Polish police.</span> <span id="s606">This police helped them when they needed something.</span> <span id="s607">They organized right away a Jewish Committee.</span> <span id="s608">When they needed somebody to work, to clean up or something else, they called the Jewish Committee and this committee was responsible.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Do you remember how large that Jewish Committee was?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: There were altogether 70 Jewish families in our village, there were maybe five or six people on the committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Do you remember who the committee members were?</span> <span id="s612">At least at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: I remember one man.</span> <span id="s614">His name was Siegreich.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: What did that man do?</span> <span id="s616">What occupation had he had?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: They used to own a stone quarry.</span> <span id="s618">That was the biggest stone quarry in the area of about 30 or 40 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: So he was apparently quite wealthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Yes, the whole town knew about the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: I would assume that, even before then, before the Germans came in, he would have played a leadership role.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yes, he was in a leadership role on the Jewish Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: What kind of man was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: He was a very nice man before the war.</span> <span id="s625">Now, what happened later on?</span> <span id="s626">People change in a time like this!</span> <span id="s627">You don’t recognize your own brother.</span> <span id="s628">You don’t recognize your own father in a time like this.</span> <span id="s629">The circumstances exert force on you.</span> <span id="s630">I saw that happen in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s631">There are unbelievable stories about what was done with people.</span> <span id="s632">They diminished people so that they became inhuman!</span> <span id="s633">You would be surprised how people could be so inhuman.</span> <span id="s634">We saw it!</span> <span id="s635">I saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Are you saying that this man Siegreich, became very authoritarian and domineering?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: I didn’t really know because I was only a youngster at the time.</span> <span id="s638">You see, I left right at the beginning, in 1940.</span> <span id="s639">What happened later is something else.</span> <span id="s640">My parents stayed there until 1942.</span> <span id="s641">By 1942 all the Jews were together, in one place.</span> <span id="s642">They took all of them to the concentration camp of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s643">In 1942, after it was all done, I got a letter from my parents through the camp authorities saying, “They are taking us away.</span> <span id="s644">We don’t know where to.</span> <span id="s645">I doubt that we will be able to write to you.”</span> <span id="s646">This was the last letter which I received.</span> <span id="s647">Afterwards, I found out that everybody went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s648">They liquidated the committee and everybody.</span> <span id="s649">Everything was liquidated.</span> <span id="s650">There is nobody left from our village.</span> <span id="s651">I have been to different countries and nobody!</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: You have never run into anyone from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: No, nobody!</span> <span id="s654">Because whoever was able to work they took them right away to a concentration camp, and they disposed of the rest of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: They took them to an extermination camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: During this period, right after the invasion, how frequently were you called on to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Oh, every day!</span> <span id="s659">Every day they worked they called on me, whether it was to clean the toilets or whatever.</span> <span id="s660">At the beginning it was to clean the toilets on the railroad.</span> <span id="s661">You know in small towns like in our village, 75% of Jewish men had beards.</span> <span id="s662">[ Orthodox Jews refrain from shaving because of some passage either found in the Talmud or read into it against using a razor.</span> <span id="s663">The orthodox Jews who do not want a beard are supposed to pluck the hair out].</span> <span id="s664">They cut the beards right off.</span> <span id="s665">For some of them they cut them off, for some of them they ripped them out.</span> <span id="s666">That was right at the beginning.</span> <span id="s667">They showed their power right away.</span> <span id="s668">They wanted that the people would be afraid.</span> <span id="s669">Just like that!</span> <span id="s670">Believe me, this was a big influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Oh, I am sure!</span> <span id="s672">When you were called out on these work jobs, were you supervised by German guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: By Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Who were apparently just as mean as Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Some of them were meaner.</span> <span id="s676">Because the Polish authorities, after Pilsudski had died, from day to day the anti-Semitism raced along.</span> <span id="s677">You could see signs out in the streets: “Death to the Jews!”</span> <span id="s678">The government didn’t do anything against it.</span> <span id="s679">You know, in Poland about 10% of the population was Jewish.</span> <span id="s680">That means that there were three and a half million Jewish people and 35 million Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Looking back, can you say now that there was a gradual intensification of the terror?</span> <span id="s682">In other words, did it start bad and grow worse after Sept. 1939?</span> <span id="s683">Or did it start out suddenly and gradually gather momentum/</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s685">They came in and right away showed their toughness, but later, if I am not mistaken, let it a little bit down.</span> <span id="s686">Later they started to get tough with everything.</span> <span id="s687">They took away the Jewish stores and the people couldn’t walk anyplace at night.</span> <span id="s688">There was a curfew.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: You are talking about the Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yes, the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s691">The people had to wear the Mogen David [the six pointed star of David] on armbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: You didn’t have to wear the Star of David on your chest?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: No, wait!</span> <span id="s694">We really started with the white band.</span> <span id="s695">Right in 1939, we started with the white band.</span> <span id="s696">Later they replaced that with a band with the star on it, the Star of David.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Did the Germans force you to move within the village of Zabkowice?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: No, not when I was living there.</span> <span id="s699">Not yet.</span> <span id="s700">They started that later.</span> <span id="s701">You se, we had no ghetto, because you see we didn’t have too many Jews, only 70 families.</span> <span id="s702">They did this in the big cities, in 1940, 41, so I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: There wasn’t any movement of Jews from other surrounding smaller communities?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Not to our village.</span> <span id="s705">In the cities, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q; Later on?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A; Yes, from out village to the big cities; but not to our village because our village was too small.</span> <span id="s708">They took the people from our village and from all the different small communities to the big cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Was your father allowed to continue as a butcher?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: No, I don’t believe so, but again, I left early.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: I mean in 1939 and early 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: No.</span> <span id="s713">I don’t know, because at this time they started to give out rations.</span> <span id="s714">Everything was rationed.</span> <span id="s715">Everything including meat, was on coupons.</span> <span id="s716">You no longer could have your own business.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: But how did you live?</span> <span id="s718">In that period from 1939 on?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: On rations, they gave us coupons.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: How did you have the money to buy if you could no longer be in business and earn an income?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: In the community people had money.</span> <span id="s722">They had gold, they had a business!</span> <span id="s723">They had savings!</span> <span id="s724">Little by little they liquidated this.</span> <span id="s725">They sold things to the Polish people.</span> <span id="s726">Some people had gold, some people had dollars, some people had diamonds or clothes.</span> <span id="s727">Everything which was of value they sold it out for food.</span> <span id="s728">Food was the mot important thing.</span> <span id="s729">Nothing else counted, just the food.</span> <span id="s730">Food is the most precious thing you can own.</span> <span id="s731">Food and water!</span> <span id="s732">Water is in first place, in second place is the food.</span> <span id="s733">You cannot survive without water.</span> <span id="s734">People who don’t understand this, they don’t know.</span> <span id="s735">You can survive for a week or two on water, but you must have water.</span> <span id="s736">I saw people survive on water.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: I have heard of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: I saw it and I was transported from Gross-Rosen to Buchenwald [two concentration camps.</span> <span id="s739">Buchenwald id directly west of Gross-Rosen] in trains.</span> <span id="s740">We had no food.</span> <span id="s741">Water is the most important thing.</span> <span id="s742">You can take a little snow.</span> <span id="s743">Believe me: thirst is one of the worst things.</span> <span id="s744">People kill people for water; just plain like that, for a piece of bread and a little bit of water.</span> <span id="s745">People are ready to kill for it.</span> <span id="s746">I saw it with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s747">This is not a story.</span> <span id="s748">I saw it with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s749">You don’t have that on the tape!</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Yes, I hope that this is on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: I hope not!</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: No, this is fine.</span> <span id="s753">I mean that fifty years from now when this is really past history, children ought to hear this!</span> <span id="s754">People ought to know!</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: People ought to know that these conditions existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yes, this is war and war stinks.</span> <span id="s758">Without water people just cannot survive.</span> <span id="s759">It just doesn’t matter what kind of liquid it is; human beings need to have liquid.</span> <span id="s760">Without liquid you cannot survive!</span> <span id="s761">Now we had good opportunity, right in this country, 1973-74, and I am still mad at it today.</span> <span id="s762">Why did we give the Russians the food without getting anything back?</span> <span id="s763">This time we had an opportunity to lay down conditions, such as, “You want food, we want to get back something from you!”</span> <span id="s764">That is, because food is a precious thing.</span> <span id="s765">You can have as much ammunition as you want, but without food you cannot go, with all your ammunition.</span> <span id="s766">You can exist without ammunition but you cannot exist without food.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: What great general was it, was it Napoleon, who said that an army travels on its stomach?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: You have to have food, food.</span> <span id="s769">However, even more important than food is liquid.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Were the synagogues allowed to remain open?</span> <span id="s771">In 1939 and early 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s773">Early in 1940, yes, but no later.</span> <span id="s774">They were not allowed to get 10 men together to make a minyan.</span> <span id="s775">Do you know what a minyan is?</span> <span id="s776">[That is the group of 10 people who have been Bar Mitzvahed who are required in Orthodox Judaism to recite certain prayers].</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: An assemblage of 10 people was no longer allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Was anyone leaving, in this period after Sept. of 1939?</span> <span id="s780">To go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: No.</span> <span id="s782">You couldn’t go to Israel [or rather Palestine as it remained until 1948.</span> <span id="s783">Actually Palestine was British territory, therefore they were fighting the Germans].</span> <span id="s784">It was impossible to go there legally.</span> <span id="s785">Some people, a handful of people from our village, left to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s786">[Russia and Germany were allies at the time].</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Did you consider that?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: No, I was too young, first, and then, secondly, I was the oldest child at home.</span> <span id="s789">You know that in Europe, a family looks out for each other, they are not selfish, as you are here.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Do you recall that there were frequent family discussions about what to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A; No, we did not discuss it, because all families, especially our family, my close family, we didn’t have the money and the places to go.</span> <span id="s792">That is just like it was.</span> <span id="s793">Most of the people who went away, they had money.</span> <span id="s794">You know that you have to have something to survive with in a foreign land.</span> <span id="s795">No, we didn’t go anyplace.</span> <span id="s796">There was no discussion in our house.</span> <span id="s797">There really wasn’t much time.</span> <span id="s798">There were only a few months, a really short time, before I went away to camp.</span> <span id="s799">Later on I got letters from my parents, and in a letter, you couldn’t say too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: It was in May of 1940 when you went to the first camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Yes, I believe that it was May 1940.</span> <span id="s802">[The so-called phony war in Europe ended with the Germans invading Denmark and Norway on April 9, 1940 and Holland and Belgium on May 10, 1940].</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Were you in the first group from your village to go to a camp?</span> <span id="s804">Had there been earlier groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Yes, I was really in the first group.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Of your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: No, in the group there were people from our village and from other villages.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: From the entire region?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s810">I believe that I went with two other guys from our village</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Was this selection in any way voluntary?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: No way!</span> <span id="s813">No way!</span> <span id="s814">No choice!</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: I am asking this because in some areas, so the story would go, that the Germans would say, “We want a working detail!</span> <span id="s816">Who will volunteer?”</span> <span id="s817">Then people thought that maybe the conditions would be better if they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: No way!</span> <span id="s819">I never heard any such thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: In other words, you were ordered to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: I was forced, not ordered.</span> <span id="s822">They called the committee up and told them that the committee should furnish them with so and so many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: They set a quota?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Yes, a quota from the committee.</span> <span id="s825">At the beginning, I was working on an Autobahn.</span> <span id="s826">Do you know what an Autobahn is?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: An intercity highway.</span> <span id="s829">Until 1942 I was working on highways.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: The first camp you went to was Niederkild.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Yes, Niederkild.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: That was in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yes, in Germany.</span> <span id="s834">I was the whole time in Germany from the first day.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: That is not a camp which is well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: That is a small camp.</span> <span id="s837">It really was not a concentration camp, they used to say that it was an Arbeitslager (a “Work Camp”).</span> <span id="s838">Concentration camps really started in 1942, [some concentration camps such as Dachau, near Munich, and Oranienburg, near Berlin, were started in 1932 or 1933.</span> <span id="s839">Concentration camps were started in Poland, Holland, and France, insofar as the transcriber could ascertain, as soon as 1940.</span> <span id="s840">Buchenwald was operating before 1939, and, and Auschwitz was in operation, although not yet used as a death camp, by 1940], actually at the end of 1942.</span> <span id="s841">That is when they really called them concentration camps.</span> <span id="s842">[Actually, such concentration camps were in use during previous wars, notably the Boer War in South Africa and Natal].</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Does it take its name, Niederkild, from the town where it was located?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Yes, from a small town which wasn’t far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Where was that in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: That was not far from Breslau [today called Wroclaw].</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: So that was still in that region, Silesia, from where you came.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s849">This was deeper in [i.e., considerably farther west than Katowice] Germany.</span> <span id="s850">[That was the part of Silesia which had remained German after WWI].</span> <span id="s851">This was really in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Maybe 150 miles [that distance seems exaggerated, probably closer to 150 km].</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Something like this.</span> <span id="s854">My region was really at the German border, before WWII.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Were all of the prisoners or workers in that camp Jews, or were there others?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Only Jews, only Jews1</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: How many would you say were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: About 300.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: So it was rather small?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s861">Yes, it was a small camp.</span> <span id="s862">We only worked on the Autobahn.</span> <span id="s863">We built the Autobahn.</span> <span id="s864">That was Hitler’s pride.</span> <span id="s865">This was a good Autobahn.</span> <span id="s866">[Autobahns were built under Hitler’s orders for strategic purposes so that truck convoys could move from location to location readily.</span> <span id="s867">Thus they were pushed east right up to the border with Russia, after the dismemberment of Poland].</span> <span id="s868">It compares today to the Interstate system in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: What were things like at Niederkild?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: It was like a typical concentration camp, only worse because we had to work harder.</span> <span id="s871">We worked like slaves.</span> <span id="s872">We pushed the compactors.</span> <span id="s873">They went behind us and if we didn’t work hard enough to suit them we were whipped.</span> <span id="s874">The Arbeitslagers were worse than concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Would you mind going into some details about the routine?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: What time did you get up?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: We got up at 5:30 a.m.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: What did you have for breakfast?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Coffee.</span> <span id="s881">[Coffee, in Germany, was made with other things than coffee beans, which had been unavailable by then; it was “Ersatz coffee” all over Germany and its possessions].</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: That’s it?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Early in the morning we had only coffee, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Was that ersatz coffee or the real thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Ersatz coffee, and we also got a little bit of soup.</span> <span id="s886">That was in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Cabbage soup?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Any kind of soup, a little of it.</span> <span id="s889">This was Arbeitsfutter [food for work]!</span> <span id="s890">Then we went out to work at 6:30.</span> <span id="s891">We started to work at 7 a.m.</span> <span id="s892">We then worked 7 a.m. to 12 noon.</span> <span id="s893">Then it was lunch time, at least it was lunch time for the Germans, because we got nothing.</span> <span id="s894">Some people could divide a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s895">I saw it -- some people had the will power and they had a small amount of bread at the lunch hour.</span> <span id="s896">95% of the people, when they got back to Niederkild and got dinner, ate it right away.</span> <span id="s897">That was the way it was for years and years.</span> <span id="s898">We lived on one meal, because it was very hard to divide the bread.</span> <span id="s899">Those who did had two or three meals, but the majority of the people did the work -- and we worked twelve hours a day, six days a week -- with only one meal a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: So you had no lunch?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s902">We had lunch time but no food!</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: No food?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: No food.</span> <span id="s905">No food at all.</span> <span id="s906">Nothing!</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Then you would quit work about 7 p.m.?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: We quit work at seven and we got to camp by 7:30.</span> <span id="s909">They gave us the supper.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: What was that supper?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: A piece of bread and some soup and, sometimes, I think two or three times a week, we had a small piece of butter.</span> <span id="s912">On Sundays we received a small piece of sausage, maybe that was Saturdays.</span> <span id="s913">I am not sure.</span> <span id="s914">I found it.</span> <span id="s915">We worked six days a week.</span> <span id="s916">Some people took a bath on Saturdays, some people didn’t take any bath because the bathing conditions were very bad.</span> <span id="s917">You had to stay in line to take a bath.</span> <span id="s918">Actually, it was not a bath but a shower.</span> <span id="s919">This was the routine.</span> <span id="s920">Sunday mornings we didn’t have to go to work, we had inspection in the camp.</span> <span id="s921">They looked you over to see if you had shaved, whether you had washed, they looked at the beds.</span> <span id="s922">You had to clean and clean.</span> <span id="s923">In the afternoon they took us out into the camp and just to find something for us to do, believe it or not, they had a pile of sand, so they took the pile from one pile to another and then back again to the first pile.</span> <span id="s924">That was just so that we would do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: There were no balls to pitch, no recreation of any kind?</span> <span id="s926">[This type of activity would be available in U.S. camps].</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: No, that kind of thing didn’t exist in any camp, in mo concentration camp.</span> <span id="s928">This did not exist!</span> <span id="s929">[After all, the inmates of such camps, whether Jewish, Polish or other, were not humans by the definitions used by Hitler and his people].</span> <span id="s930">There were no books to read.</span> <span id="s931">This did not exist!</span> <span id="s932">There was no newspaper to read.</span> <span id="s933">This did not exist!</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: How many Germans were guarding you, would you estimate?</span> <span id="s935">In that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: I would say, maybe two percent of the population.</span> <span id="s937">There were 300 of us, maybe there were 30 people guarding us [that would make it ten percent].</span> <span id="s938">They didn’t need anymore because nobody would escape, people were afraid.</span> <span id="s939">We had no guns, we had nothing.</span> <span id="s940">[They were also on such a starvation diet that they literally lacked the strength needed to escape; also, they were in Germany].</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Were you behind barbed wire?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yes, always!</span> <span id="s943">The whole time, we were behind barbed wire.</span> <span id="s944">You couldn’t go anyplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Was it electrified?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Not in that camp.</span> <span id="s947">Not in the small camps.</span> <span id="s948">That came later, in the actual concentration camps.</span> <span id="s949">Again, you couldn’t escape because you had a special uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Grey stripes?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s952">You couldn’t go anyplace.</span> <span id="s953">They took all your civilian clothes away.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Did you just have the one internment uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Yes, always the one uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Never a change of clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: No, never a change of clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Would people wash their clothes on Sundays?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Yes, you had to because you couldn’t do it any other time.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Were there the roll calls in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Roll calls in the mornings, at noon, and in the evening.</span> <span id="s962">This took place every day, roll calls when you went to work and they counted the people and when you came back from work.</span> <span id="s963">Before we went into the barracks, after we finished work, there was a roll call right away at the worksite.</span> <span id="s964">When we came back to camp we had another roll call.</span> <span id="s965">This was every single day.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Were these ever prolonged, as a means of torture, to keep you standing there hour after hour?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: I don’t know what the meaning was of the roll calls.</span> <span id="s968">The Germans, that is the Kapos, counted the people.</span> <span id="s969">Do you know what the Kapos were?</span> <span id="s970">They were the foremen.</span> <span id="s971">They counted the people all the time; if you didn’t have the people, the numbers wouldn’t be there.</span> <span id="s972">People stayed behind; people tried to escape.</span> <span id="s973">If some escaped, we had to wait until they found them.</span> <span id="s974">That happened many, many times.</span> <span id="s975">People just went and got killed, because they couldn’t escape.</span> <span id="s976">It was in Germany!</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Who were the Kapos?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: They were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s979">They were tough.</span> <span id="s980">They were tough because they had enough food and they did not work.</span> <span id="s981">They always got double ration of food and they could have more if they wanted it.</span> <span id="s982">In Buchenwald, where I was later, I was liberated while I was in Buchenwald, we had what the Germans called prisoners, we had people from all nations, including from the U.S.</span> <span id="s983">Now there, the Kapos were Germans, because there were German people also in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s984">There were English and American and different Kapos from all the nations.</span> <span id="s985">A small percentage of the Jews were Kapos in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: But in the Arbeitslager, there were only Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Only Jewish people and Jewish Kapos!</span> <span id="s988">No German was allowed inside the camp.</span> <span id="s989">No Germans, only the Kapos.</span> <span id="s990">There were Blockoberst.</span> <span id="s991">Do you know that the Blockoberst were responsible for the blocks, that means the building?</span> <span id="s992">The Kapos were Jewish, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Was any Kapo from your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: How about from your region?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: No, that means from our region, yes!</span> <span id="s997">There were some Kapos from my region.</span> <span id="s998">At one time it really happened that one Kapo gave one guy a good beating.</span> <span id="s999">Later he came in and apologized.</span> <span id="s1000">That happened one time.</span> <span id="s1001">Believe it or not, he took his own life later.</span> <span id="s1002">This is the one time I remember!</span> <span id="s1003">He was a tailor and he took his own life.</span> <span id="s1004">He came in and apologized and a couple or three days later he took his own life.</span> <span id="s1005">You had to be tough to be a Kapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Would you say that the Kapos in Niederkild were of the criminal element?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Because that did happen sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Yes, sometimes, but most of the time, they just selected a tough looking guy, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1010">There were a good percentage of them who were criminals, yes; however, that is not what they were looking for.</span> <span id="s1011">Of course, once selected, the Kapos became automatically tough people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: You already indicated that the sort of standard camp organization which prevailed in these smaller camps, the Kapos, the Blockoberst,</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Yes, the Block is like a big building, and the Blockoberst was responsible for everyone in the building, for everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Were the buildings crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Oh yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: For example, inside the building where you slept?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Yes, they were crowded, and Buchenwald was the most crowded.</span> <span id="s1018">In Buchenwald, we had a place, like this place here, where 15 to 18 people lived.</span> <span id="s1019">For example, you couldn’t turn if the other fellow didn’t turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: However, in Niederkild, how was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: In Niederkild, we were less crowded, but again there was one bed behind another one and one bed on top of another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: They were tiered bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Yes, that is it, tiered bunks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Was there one person per bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yes, one person per bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Or more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1028">In the tiered beds there was one person per bed.</span> <span id="s1029">In bigger concentration camps it was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Did you have a blanket in Niederkild?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Yes, we had a blanket because it was cold.</span> <span id="s1032">You had to have a blanket.</span> <span id="s1033">We had one blanket.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Did you get a coat in the wintertime; again I am talking about Niederkild?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1036">Again, a coat with the stripes.</span> <span id="s1037">You know, the prisoner stripes!</span> <span id="s1038">We also got wooden shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Of the five camps where you were, in that long, long period, would you say that Niederkild was one of the better ones, or worst ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Conditions for work were worse, conditions inside the camp were much better than elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1041">One of the worst camps where I was, was Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s1042">This was one of those which they call in German “Vernischtungskamp” [i.e., “Extermination camp”].</span> <span id="s1043">Do you know what “Vernischtung” is?</span> <span id="s1044">It is, as they say, “death camp.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Well, we will talk about Gross-Rosen later on.</span> <span id="s1046">I would like to keep them distinguished.</span> <span id="s1047">I would like for us to talk about one at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: We had hard work at Niederkild; however, inside, compared to other camps, was already much better.</span> <span id="s1049">At least we had much more space inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: As bad as they were, the living conditions were somewhat better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A; Yes, we had more space.</span> <span id="s1052">However work was much harder.</span> <span id="s1053">This was the hardest work which we had to do, was on the Autobahn.</span> <span id="s1054">This was the beginning, it was very hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: What did that work consist of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: It was mainly on the Autobahn, to build it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q; To grade it?</span> <span id="s1058">To bring the stones?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Yes, to grade it and to bring the stones.</span> <span id="s1060">To bring the highway up to grade.</span> <span id="s1061">We went miles and miles every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Did you have any machinery at all?</span> <span id="s1063">Was it all done by hand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: No.</span> <span id="s1065">The only thing we had was a cement mixer.</span> <span id="s1066">Other than that, everything was done by hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Were the overseers of the work detail constantly harassing you/</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s1069">Constantly!</span> <span id="s1070">That included that by our own Kapos!</span> <span id="s1071">That was particularly intense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: But outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: Yes, outside.</span> <span id="s1074">You had to go in the line.</span> <span id="s1075">You couldn’t go where it was easier to walk, you had to remain in line.</span> <span id="s1076">Everybody had to be together.</span> <span id="s1077">They looked that you would be in the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: How was punishment measured out?</span> <span id="s1079">What kind of punishment would there be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: In Niederkild, the punishment wasn’t so bad as it was in other camps.</span> <span id="s1081">However, the Germans had always some clubs and would always beat you.</span> <span id="s1082">However, inside the camp it was not so much as it was in other camps.</span> <span id="s1083">There was not so much harassment inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: As far as you knew there never were any executions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: No, not in Niederkild.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: How long were you at Niederkild?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: From May 1940 to August 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: That was about two years and three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Yes, then I went to Markstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: How far from Niederkild was Markstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1092">I would say a couple of hundred miles for sure.</span> <span id="s1093">[200 miles seems to be excessive for the distances in Europe, when the airline distances from Berlin to Warsaw is 320 miles and all the camps where Abe was were within Germany, but that is not crucial].</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: How did you get from Niederkild to Markstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A; By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: In cattle cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1098">Those were the trains they had.</span> <span id="s1099">We didn’t know any others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Did you have any choice when you went from Niederkild to Markstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: It was not a matter of choice.</span> <span id="s1102">They liquidated Niederkild, that is all.</span> <span id="s1103">Then I went to Markstadt, they liquidated Niederkild because they no longer needed it.</span> <span id="s1104">The Autobahn was finished.</span> <span id="s1105">In Markstadt, we started to work for Krupp [the big German steel and weapons consortium] and Spaer.</span> <span id="s1106">They made ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Did everyone from Niederkild go to Markstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Everybody.</span> <span id="s1109">They liquidated Niederkild and they went to Markstadt because they needed ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Were your three friends from your village who went with you still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1112">They went to Markstadt when I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: How big was Markstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: It contained about 6,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: That was considerably larger!</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Yes, much, much larger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: About twenty times larger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: That was a big, big place.</span> <span id="s1119">You see, Markstadt, they already had people from different cities.</span> <span id="s1120">They had only Jews in the camp.</span> <span id="s1121">No Germans came into the camp.</span> <span id="s1122">There were only Jewish Kapos, Jewish Blockoberst, and Jewish [another level of supervision but the transcriber could not understand it].</span> <span id="s1123">The supervision was all by Jews.</span> <span id="s1124">These Jewish supervisors were mean.</span> <span id="s1125">I am sorry to have to tell you, but they were mean.</span> <span id="s1126">In Markstadt I was working.</span> <span id="s1127">Luckily I started to work nights.</span> <span id="s1128">What was so lucky about working nighttime?</span> <span id="s1129">It was because at night you could go out in the fields and steal some potatoes.</span> <span id="s1130">These few potatoes meant the whole life.</span> <span id="s1131">Now if a German would catch you at it, you would get a bullet right in your back!</span> <span id="s1132">Just like that.</span> <span id="s1133">During the day, even before I started to work nights, on my way home I picked a little bit of grass.</span> <span id="s1134">I put the grass in the soup and ate it.</span> <span id="s1135">One time people got killed when they picked the grass to take it with them.</span> <span id="s1136">Before we came into the camp, everybody had to take everything out of their pockets and everybody was searched.</span> <span id="s1137">Anyway, people still managed to hide things.</span> <span id="s1138">If they caught somebody already inside the camp he could get 50 or 100 lashes on his back.</span> <span id="s1139">They searched everybody.</span> <span id="s1140">If I am not mistaken, I believe that in the beginning of ’43 they needed some people to work the nightshift.</span> <span id="s1141">The operations were taking place 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s1142">So I started to work nightshift.</span> <span id="s1143">This helped me to survive!</span> <span id="s1144">I went out in the fields and stole potatoes.</span> <span id="s1145">What did we do with the potatoes?</span> <span id="s1146">We cooked them.</span> <span id="s1147">That was the key for survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: Was the Krupp ammunition factory located within the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Nothing was in the camp!</span> <span id="s1150">We had to go out to work every day, about seven or eight miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Yes, walking.</span> <span id="s1153">It didn’t matter whether it was rain or snow, we had to go.</span> <span id="s1154">They knew that we couldn’t work outside, but we still had to go out to work.</span> <span id="s1155">It didn’t matter whether the weather was rainy or snowy, we had to get up at 5 a.m. for the dayshift.</span> <span id="s1156">About 5:45 a.m., they counted us and then we left the camp.</span> <span id="s1157">We arrived at the plant at 8 a.m.</span> <span id="s1158">It took us one and a half hours just to walk.</span> <span id="s1159">It was the same thing with the food.</span> <span id="s1160">They fed you once every twelve hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: What did you manufacture?</span> <span id="s1162">Was it gunpowder?</span> <span id="s1163">Was it bullets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Over there, they built everything.</span> <span id="s1165">They built tanks.</span> <span id="s1166">I was working with cement, we were building the factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Oh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: I was employed building the factories where they produced the ammunition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: But you never worked on any actual armament?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: No!</span> <span id="s1171">No, I was always on the building of buildings.</span> <span id="s1172">We built one factory after the other.</span> <span id="s1173">Even in 1944, they still built factories.</span> <span id="s1174">Now I want to talk about these Kapos.</span> <span id="s1175">In Buchenwald [maybe this should read Markstadt?</span> <span id="s1176">See below], this happened to one Kapo that I knew realty from before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Was he from your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: No, he was from about 12 miles away from my village, from Benchen.</span> <span id="s1179">He found under one guy’s bed a little bit of dirt .</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: How could you avoid dirt in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: I am not talking about Buchenwald but about Markstadt!</span> <span id="s1182">We didn’t go anyplace.</span> <span id="s1183">That was back when I was working nighttime.</span> <span id="s1184">We came back from work and we had to clean every day behind the beds and in the rooms and everything.</span> <span id="s1185">So the Kapo found a little bit of dirt.</span> <span id="s1186">So he took this guy -- and this guy knew this Kapo from home, by first name -- and beat him so much that this guy passed out.</span> <span id="s1187">So the Kapo urinated on the guy’s face.</span> <span id="s1188">This was a guy whom he knew from home!</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1190">Do you know if that Kapo…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: No, they killed him.</span> <span id="s1192">After the war he got killed.</span> <span id="s1193">They found that Kapo and they killed him.</span> <span id="s1194">The people from the camp who survived did it.</span> <span id="s1195">I even remember the name!</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Who was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: His name was Morris Martinburger.</span> <span id="s1198">I remember the name!</span> <span id="s1199">He was from Benchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Did he ever attack you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: No.</span> <span id="s1202">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1203">He beat several guys so badly that it was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Was he a big man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: He was a big man.</span> <span id="s1206">He was a tough guy!</span> <span id="s1207">He wasn’t tough before the war.</span> <span id="s1208">I know because I knew him before the war.</span> <span id="s1209">He was a Kapo in camp.</span> <span id="s1210">He was not a Kapo outside -- before the war.</span> <span id="s1211">This was the leader.</span> <span id="s1212">They selected big people.</span> <span id="s1213">The Kapos got enough food and everything which they wanted, everything from the German people -- even from the German girls.</span> <span id="s1214">[That is probably only hearsay, because relations with Jews, specifically carnal relations with Jews for non-Jews were capital offences for Aryans].</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Now, were conditions within the camp of Markstadt more crowded than they had been in Niederkild?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: More!</span> <span id="s1217">Much more!</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: How many persons were assigned to a bed, for instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Two people to a bed.</span> <span id="s1220">It was much better than Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1221">The worst camp was Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1222">From Markstadt we went to Funfteichen [transcriber is not positive about this, but the name, which means “five pounds,” makes more sense than the “Finfthlen” which CB jotted down in his notes].</span> <span id="s1223">You see, they still called Markstadt an Arbeitslager.</span> <span id="s1224">I was there until 1944.</span> <span id="s1225">In 1944, they changed from Arbeitslager to Concentration Camp.</span> <span id="s1226">At that time we went to different concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1227">The first concentration camp was Funfteichen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: I just want to get the chronology here on my notes, so that I won’t forget it.</span> <span id="s1229">Please give it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: May of 1940 to August of 1942 was in Niederkild.</span> <span id="s1231">August of 1942 to the end of 1943, let us say December of 1943, I was in Markstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Beginning 1944, let us say January 1944, for about one year to December of 1944, I was in Funfteichen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">December of 1944 I went to Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s1234">I was there for four weeks, so until January 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">January 1945 to April 11, 1945, at 11 a.m. I was in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">[Some further story was inserted here which is being repeated below so that the chronology of events can stand out by itself.</span> <span id="s1237">From the list submitted by CB with the tape, not only Finfthlen was corrected, but also the name of the “Grosse-Rosen” camp which could be checked against a printed list available to the transcriber].</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: How long did you stay in Funfteichen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: About one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Let us say December of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: December of ’44 we went to Gross-Rosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: About four weeks.</span> <span id="s1244">I don’t know whether three or four weeks.</span> <span id="s1245">Over there, it was just starvation.</span> <span id="s1246">If you went to take a bath, they beat you and pushed you back.</span> <span id="s1247">Over there, you got a little bit of food only in the night, at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m.</span> <span id="s1248">There people ate people.</span> <span id="s1249">Human beings eat human beings.</span> <span id="s1250">I saw it with my own eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: You were liberated in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: In May or April?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: No, April 11, 1945, at 11 o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: That is engraved in your memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s1257">Believe it or not, I remember who my doctor was after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1258">I even remember who the chaplain was</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: This is Charles Berry and I am in the home of Mr. Abraham Stine for the third of a series of interviews about his experiences in five camps during WWII and his liberation.</span> <span id="s1260">It is January 28, 1982.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Abe, there are a few points which I would like to cover about Niederkild, which as I listened to the previous tapes I realized that I hadn’t asked you questions about, as I should have done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">One question was about the contact with the outside, while you were in Niederkild.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: There was no contact!</span> <span id="s1264">The only contact which I got was once a month a letter from my parents.</span> <span id="s1265">I could receive one letter.</span> <span id="s1266">That correspondence could only be from my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Was the letter censored?</span> <span id="s1268">Could you tell whether it had been opened, or sentences dropped out or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: I really don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Was it a postcard or was it sealed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: It was a letter.</span> <span id="s1272">Once a month!</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Could you write to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Also one letter a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Was that a postcard or a letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: A letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Where did you get postage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: They gave us the stamps to mail a letter.</span> <span id="s1279">One letter a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Did you have to buy the postage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Also I didn’t ask you anything about the health conditions at Niederkild.</span> <span id="s1283">First was there any widespread sickness such as an epidemic of dysentery or typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: No.</span> <span id="s1285">People who died there did because of overwork or hunger.</span> <span id="s1286">That was because we received food one time a day.</span> <span id="s1287">Some people kept food but I ate my food all at one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Did they have an infirmary or a clinic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: There was a first aid man.</span> <span id="s1290">He would give you a bandage, or something, if you cut yourself.</span> <span id="s1291">We had no clinic, no hospital at all.</span> <span id="s1292">The reason for that was that first of all, it was a small camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Well, on the whole, would you say that the health of the inmates of the camp was pretty good?</span> <span id="s1294">Was there any severe sickness there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: No, no, because people just came in.</span> <span id="s1296">For us, it was the first camp, they maintained their health from home.</span> <span id="s1297">I didn’t catch any sickness there myself.</span> <span id="s1298">But then when we went from Niederkild to Markstadt, that was a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Well, were you aware of what happened if anyone needed surgery?</span> <span id="s1300">Such things as an abscessed tooth or such, maybe appendicitis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: I don’t remember what happened.</span> <span id="s1302">At least I don’t remember in Niederkild, but in Markstadt something happened and I remember it.</span> <span id="s1303">We had a doctor over there, a Jewish doctor, who was always in the camp.</span> <span id="s1304">He couldn’t do much to help.</span> <span id="s1305">If someone was really sick, he just had to die and that was it, he didn’t take him anyplace.</span> <span id="s1306">If someone was very sick he had to suffer until he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Do you remember the name of the commander or commandant of the camp at Niederkild?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: No, I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Was he brutal or sadistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: All of them were.</span> <span id="s1311">It just didn’t exist that they weren’t.</span> <span id="s1312">Later on I found another camp where one guy was a Blockoberst who was not sadistic.</span> <span id="s1313">He couldn’t survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Now, there is a term which is frequently used to apply to the camps, at least to the concentration camps, I don’t know about the Arbeitslager -- are you familiar with the term “Canada” or “Kanader,” meaning the place where all the luggage was put, where all the valuables were taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: We didn’t have anything like that, not there or in the following camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Things had already been taken away from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: That was so, because if they took it in one camp you didn’t have anything to be taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: You are not familiar with that term, in so far as it applies to Buchenwald either?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Oh, Buchenwald!</span> <span id="s1320">They had something, but nothing from us.</span> <span id="s1321">I know because I was in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1322">You see, I had nothing left with me.</span> <span id="s1323">My things had already been lost between camps.</span> <span id="s1324">There was such a thing for the newcomers who came to Buchenwald, yes!</span> <span id="s1325">They used to call it a Entlausungslager.</span> <span id="s1326">Do you know what Lausung is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Yes, that had something to do with your clothes to be laundered?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: No, Entlausung (i.e., removing lice)!</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Oh no1</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Entlausung is as if you went through a shower and they put some different things on your body, everything like that because most of the people had lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: That was delousing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: That was a delousing parlor.</span> <span id="s1333">That is what we had.</span> <span id="s1334">We had to wait for a couple or three days before we went into the showers, because in Buchenwald, you see it was 1945 when we arrived in Buchenwald and all camps had their prisoners transferred to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1335">You know, all the Russian and American camps.</span> <span id="s1336">They transferred all the people from one camp to another one.</span> <span id="s1337">However we had nothing left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Well this word I am thinking about is spelled like the country, Canada.</span> <span id="s1339">I don’t know how you pronounce it and I don’t know where it came from.</span> <span id="s1340">However the work detail which worked in this, I don’t know what you call it, Canada, or whatever…</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: Maybe Canadat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1343">The work detail was always looked upon as the best work detail because you worked at sorting out clothes, shoes and such.</span> <span id="s1344">You could at times find something for yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: I wouldn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: There is also another term, and I tried to think of it all the way over here, the term which a lot of camp inmates used to describe someone who had given up.</span> <span id="s1347">Who had kind of surrendered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Oh yes, people did sink to that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: There was a term.</span> <span id="s1350">It was not Zombie, but it is something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Yes, the people who had given up all hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: They stopped eating and just somehow disintegrated.</span> <span id="s1353">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: You see, in Niederkild and Markstadt, we didn’t have electrified fences because they still were Arbeitslager, but later on in Funfteichen and Buchenwald the people just ran into the electric wire.</span> <span id="s1355">Oh yes, a lot of people did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: To commit suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Yes, because they gave up and they felt that they had nothing to go on for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Well, there was a word which was used to describe that kind of attitude.</span> <span id="s1359">Personally, I cannot think of it.</span> <span id="s1360">What I was interested in was that word which was applied.</span> <span id="s1361">Did you see that process taking place already at Niederkild?</span> <span id="s1362">Were you aware of people who had just given up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1364">Not in Niederkild.</span> <span id="s1365">That was because then we still did believe, everyone did believe.</span> <span id="s1366">First of all, we all still had families at home, parents and such [and they got one letter a month].</span> <span id="s1367">That was still just the beginning.</span> <span id="s1368">The crematoriums began to appear in 1942.</span> <span id="s1369">Then they took all the Jews from the small cities to Auschwitz or to Treblinka [both of these extermination camps were located in what had been Poland proper, not Germany] into the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s1370">Up to then we had hope!</span> <span id="s1371">We thought that we would work here for one year, or two years, then we get freed and we go home.</span> <span id="s1372">After this I received a letter, we all received letters, and we knew that people were being deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Now, at Markstadt, conditions were so much worse that you did see people give up there.</span> <span id="s1374">Were there executions there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: Not really executions, but people were beaten to death.</span> <span id="s1376">Executions were when they hanged somebody.</span> <span id="s1377">In Markstadt we never had any actual hangings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Did you see people being beaten to death in Markstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Yes, this is what I told you about!</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: However, that was within the barracks.</span> <span id="s1381">That was more or less a private thing between the Kapo and this prisoner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: That happened on the job also.</span> <span id="s1383">People were being beaten to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Did you ever see anything like that in the Appell [the place where the roll call was being taken], such as to make an example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Yes; if someone came in a minute late, or if he didn’t stand straight, they beat him.</span> <span id="s1386">Maybe they gave him 25 lashes.</span> <span id="s1387">Often 25 lashes meant death.</span> <span id="s1388">People couldn’t survive that because they really beat him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Were you ever punished like that?</span> <span id="s1390">I mean at Markstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: No!</span> <span id="s1392">I tried always to avoid this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: To stay anonymous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: I had no other choice.</span> <span id="s1395">I thought that I could never survive a beating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Was it easy to stay anonymous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: It was very hard.</span> <span id="s1398">I was just plain lucky in Markstadt, later when they made the two shifts.</span> <span id="s1399">One shift worked days, the other worked nights.</span> <span id="s1400">I was already almost ready to collapse when they divided the work and I started to go on the night shift.</span> <span id="s1401">When we were done with night shift we went into the fields and dug up some potatoes.</span> <span id="s1402">We stole those potatoes.</span> <span id="s1403">We cooked them on the fire since we made a fire at night.</span> <span id="s1404">So we had potatoes to bring back to the barracks, and we had something to eat.</span> <span id="s1405">I worked one year at night shift.</span> <span id="s1406">If they had caught me I would have gotten shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Was that what you were doing pretty widespread?</span> <span id="s1408">Were a lot of people providing for themselves by stealing potatoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Oh yes, the entire night shift.</span> <span id="s1410">All the people who worked with me did that.</span> <span id="s1411">We had to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: I believe that you told me before that you were constructing buildings for an ammunition factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1414">A factory which belonged to Krupp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: How did you have the opportunity to get out in the field?</span> <span id="s1416">The field where the potatoes were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: You see, where we built the buildings was right in the field, right behind the potato fields.</span> <span id="s1418">When we finished one building we started another building.</span> <span id="s1419">Everything was part of Krupp.</span> <span id="s1420">Everything was built up for war manufacturing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: You may think that I am asking silly questions, but were you able to get the potatoes every night/</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: No!</span> <span id="s1423">No!</span> <span id="s1424">No!</span> <span id="s1425">However we got them, and we hid them right on the job for the next day, if we couldn’t take them with us.</span> <span id="s1426">However, people stole one from the other.</span> <span id="s1427">The only thing we could get like that were potatoes.</span> <span id="s1428">A potato was gold, it was better than gold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: I remember earlier when you talked about how important food and water was, in order to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: When I was working on the day shift, and we went back to the barracks from work, people dug out grass.</span> <span id="s1431">They took grass with them to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1432">They put the grass in the soup.</span> <span id="s1433">If a guard caught you at this, he shot you right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Did you ever do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: No!</span> <span id="s1436">[Earlier he had said that he had].</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Did you ever see anyone get caught stealing potatoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Every night people were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: They were shot right on the spot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Yes, right on the spot!</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: These work details at Markstadt, I realize that it would vary from job to job, would they be 200 people under one German guard, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1443">We had about 25 or 30 people under one German guard.</span> <span id="s1444">At night time, it was easy, because at nighttime they took naps and we watched them.</span> <span id="s1445">One guard watched another guard.</span> <span id="s1446">In the daytime we couldn’t go away.</span> <span id="s1447">At nighttime they took naps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: So a favored detail to get in was the night detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: It was surprising that no one got killed while doing the work.</span> <span id="s1450">People just died from lack of food.</span> <span id="s1451">Nobody died from hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: You were at Markstadt for about a year and four months, August of 1942 to December 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: Yes, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: That brings up a point; being cut off from newspapers and radio, how were you able to keep up with the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: The radio didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s1456">We only heard things through people who came in to work from the outside.</span> <span id="s1457">People came from Poland to work.</span> <span id="s1458">They were not in concentration camps like we were.</span> <span id="s1459">We met them on the job.</span> <span id="s1460">We got news from these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: I wasn’t really asking about news.</span> <span id="s1462">I meant just a matter of keeping time.</span> <span id="s1463">How did you know from one day to the next?</span> <span id="s1464">I mean every day was like the next.</span> <span id="s1465">How did you know whether it was November 23 or November 24?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A; We knew because every hour was like a month, every hour was like a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Did you keep any sort of calendar?</span> <span id="s1468">Did you construct a calendar on the wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: We didn’t exist for such things.</span> <span id="s1470">We didn’t know about such things!</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: I find that really intriguing.</span> <span id="s1472">When every day begins to be the same and total misery, how can you tell, how do you know when one month was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: We knew it.</span> <span id="s1474">When the Jewish Holy Days came around, we got the most punishment.</span> <span id="s1475">That is what we got in the camps on the High Holy Days.</span> <span id="s1476">They picked special times such as the High Holy Days [that would be Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and possibly also Passover] to give us real punishment.</span> <span id="s1477">We didn’t know what was behind these punishments, but this was always the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: That brings up another question which I had intended to ask, in terms of Niederkild and Markstadt.</span> <span id="s1479">Were there any religious observances?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: No, not at all!</span> <span id="s1481">I only remember one man who was with me in Markstadt.</span> <span id="s1482">He was not eating anything which had been cooked at all -- he only ate a piece of bread [this appears to be so as not to eat anything other than Kosher foods] and a potato.</span> <span id="s1483">Everything else which he received he traded with other people.</span> <span id="s1484">Another man wouldn’t touch a piece of bread, only potatoes [which potatoes could not possibly be anything except Kosher, by definition of unearthing them and then cooking them over fire without any fat or other addition].</span> <span id="s1485">That was only one person out of all the prisoners who did that.</span> <span id="s1486">He ate only potatoes, no bread, and he certainly wouldn’t touch meat.</span> <span id="s1487">Finally he died anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: However, at night, after the doors to the barracks were closed, there were no prayer groups that you were aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: No.</span> <span id="s1490">It may be hard to believe in prayer, after all there were mainly people who had lost the comfort which they had.</span> <span id="s1491">After we received the severe punishment for the Holidays, I myself, and I am talking about myself, and my parents used to be really orthodox Jew, I lost everything of my religion.</span> <span id="s1492">I no longer believed in God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: You are saying that that was pretty widespread?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: Yes, it was pretty widespread!</span> <span id="s1495">Pretty widespread.</span> <span id="s1496">We didn’t believe because we saw what happened to all people, what kind of punishment we got on the High Holy Days.</span> <span id="s1497">What was all that?</span> <span id="s1498">Why did we receive that?</span> <span id="s1499">As to how I got back to the religion, I don’t know; I am really not a religious person as much as I am a traditionalist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: That is another story and I will get to that after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1501">That is an important line of questions which I would like to pursue.</span> <span id="s1502">What about rabbis?</span> <span id="s1503">Were there any rabbis in the work group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A; No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: I don’t mean men serving as rabbis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: No, just this one person who was like a rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: The one who would only eat potatoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Yes, he was really orthodox.</span> <span id="s1509">He performed services every morning and every evening by himself.</span> <span id="s1510">He was the only person I remember who prayed each morning and each evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: You said that when you went to Niederkild there were three other young men from your hometown with you and that they were also transferred to Markstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: In Markstadt they disappeared and I don’t know what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: You don’t know whether they were executed or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: No, because later we went away from Markstadt to another concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1515">After Markstadt I had no contact with any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Again, I am asking you a very broad question, which you can generalize from, was it a general rule that close friendships were formed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Everybody was touched [affected?]</span> <span id="s1518">, everybody would become involved for himself, we couldn’t have any friendships.</span> <span id="s1519">Everybody had to look out for himself in order to survive.</span> <span id="s1520">I am sorry to admit it, but that is how it was.</span> <span id="s1521">Everybody was touched.</span> <span id="s1522">Everybody tried to survive.</span> <span id="s1523">In order to survive, a little bit of food was needed.</span> <span id="s1524">People waited for someone to die to take away their shoes and his clothes and his piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1525">There were no friendships.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: OK, Abe, this sounds as if I am arguing with you, and I don’t mean to do that, but you are painting a rather dismal picture of human nature.</span> <span id="s1527">I can understand how it could be that way, the way you are describing.</span> <span id="s1528">I am not disputing your word, but are you saying that you never saw, never ever saw, in any of the camps, any act of humanitarianism, of someone giving up something to someone who was worse off?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: Nobody was better off!</span> <span id="s1530">I saw people in Markstadt who received packages from Poland, still, from their families.</span> <span id="s1531">When they received these packages, people were selfish and cut themselves off from others because they felt that it was their package.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: Just like gold?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: Just like diamonds rather than gold.</span> <span id="s1534">At that time, I did blame them for their attitudes, but today look; I survived and many of the others did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1536">I understand exactly what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: You became very, very selfish.</span> <span id="s1538">It is hard to be like this, but it had to be if you were to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Yes, the survival instinct was extremely strong amongst a large group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Yes, in order to survive you had to be very selfish!</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Was Markstadt a mixed camp, I mean by that were there both men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: In Markstadt we had I believe only 50 women working in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Were they Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Yes, Jewish.</span> <span id="s1545">Markstadt was only a Jewish camp!</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: You also said, I believe, that there were about six thousand people in Markstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: That is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Now, was Markstadt all closed down, all at once, like Niederkild?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Yes, closed down, all of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: And everyone, at the same time, were taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: From Markstadt people went to three different camps.</span> <span id="s1552">I went from Markstadt to Funfteichen [again the transcriber used the quasiphonetic spelling rather than that in CB’s notes].</span> <span id="s1553">We arrived in Funfteichen in 1943 [Abe had previously agreed with CB that he got to this camp in January 1944].</span> <span id="s1554">Funfteichen was already a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: When Markstadt was liquidated, what were the other two camps to which people went?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: I don’t remember the other two camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Could you say approximately how many people were sent from Markstadt to Funfteichen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: I think that they divided them equally, at least that is what I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: About two thousand to each?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q; Again by cattle car on the railway?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s1563">That was the only transportation, the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Well, I thought that if they were in the same area, there would be other ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1566">We marched from Funfteichen to Gross-Rosen [this would put it pretty much in the area of Upper Silesia, south of Breslau, today this city is Wroclaw, Poland], but not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: How big was Funfteichen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: It was a camp of about four thousand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: So it was a little bit smaller than Markstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: It was not a work camp at all?</span> <span id="s1572">There were no factories attached to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: Again, they manufactured war material.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: War manufacturing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: Yes, ammunition, tanks, and everything.</span> <span id="s1576">That was under Krupp and Spaer [transcriber is not certain about the spelling of the latter name, but believes that under Hitler there was an Alfred Spaer who was a minister of armament or such] about which we talked earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Now, was everyone at Funfteichen Jewish, or were they mixed with political prisoners and gypsies and such?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: At Funfteichen it was already different.</span> <span id="s1579">There were Czechs and Poles and Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: However, in Markstadt there were still Polish, was that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: At Markstadt there were only Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: But Polish Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: No, no!</span> <span id="s1584">But toward, I believe, the middle of 1943 we received transports from Romania, from Hungary, from France, and from Holland.</span> <span id="s1585">Those people had a hard time to survive.</span> <span id="s1586">So they came into the camps and two or three months later they had disappeared.</span> <span id="s1587">They had a hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: How do you account for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: OK, the Polish Jewish people were used to having a hard life before the war.</span> <span id="s1590">The other people, the French, the Hungarians, and the Romanians, they had led an easy life.</span> <span id="s1591">Because of that they had a harder time to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: That is interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: They disappeared during the night.</span> <span id="s1594">They didn’t know how to work.</span> <span id="s1595">They didn’t know how to take a shovel in their hands.</span> <span id="s1596">They couldn’t survive!</span> <span id="s1597">There were all different people; the Eastern people from what they used to call the Western people.</span> <span id="s1598">We in Poland were Eastern people.</span> <span id="s1599">The difference was like between day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: Now Funfteichen -- I have great difficulties pronouncing that -- was that a mixed camp?</span> <span id="s1601">Men, women and children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: No children!</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: Just men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: No, there were only men.</span> <span id="s1605">No, only men!</span> <span id="s1606">Now in Markstadt they had a few women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q; Not even women working in the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s1609">In Markstadt and Niederkild they had women working in the kitchen, but not in Funfteichen, nor in Gross-Rosen or Buchenwald either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Now was Funfteichen markedly worse than Markstadt or just a little bit worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: It was much worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: What made it worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: In camp, in the barracks, after the work on Sunday, when we had the day off they made us work within the camp and just made us do anything.</span> <span id="s1614">We had a big pile of stone or sand.</span> <span id="s1615">We had to take this from one place to another [this seemed to have also been the practice in Niederkild, as Abe told earlier] and once they were on the other place to put them back again.</span> <span id="s1616">They just wanted to keep us busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Was food in shorter supply than before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: The same food that we had had all along.</span> <span id="s1619">Like in Markstadt, they fed us once a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Was it more crowded in Funfteichen than it had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: No, I would say no.</span> <span id="s1622">It was about the same as it had been in Markstadt, but the difference was that in Markstadt every barracks had a Blockeldester [a so-called senior for the block].</span> <span id="s1623">Do you know what that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: I know what it is but I can’t translate it right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: You know what it is, it is like one person who is chief of the block or barracks.</span> <span id="s1626">He saw to it that there was enough food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: Were they all Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: They were people from all nations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Were they pretty brutal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: The Blockeldester?</span> <span id="s1631">Very much so.</span> <span id="s1632">But there was one Blockeldester, he was Jewish, but he was good.</span> <span id="s1633">He couldn’t survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: What happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: After three months they took his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: He was not mean enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: He was not mean.</span> <span id="s1638">He was a good man!</span> <span id="s1639">He was like a friend.</span> <span id="s1640">After three months, he went back to work like everybody.</span> <span id="s1641">You had to be brutal to fulfill that position.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: Were there executions at Funfteichen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1644">Some people tried to escape; they hung them.</span> <span id="s1645">Some people tried to steal something; they hung them.</span> <span id="s1646">They did that the first time.</span> <span id="s1647">They did not do that in Niederkild or Markstadt.</span> <span id="s1648">They did that right at the assembly and they let them hang for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s1649">Everybody had to go since they made an Appell [German word meaning roll-call].</span> <span id="s1650">So everybody had to be there and everybody had to watch how they hung them and they let them hang for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s1651">They were better off!</span> <span id="s1652">Beatings were nothing unusual, however hanging was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q; Did you ever get beaten in Funfteichen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: No!</span> <span id="s1655">I was never beaten anywhere!</span> <span id="s1656">If I had gotten beaten I wouldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s1657">People who received beatings could not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Were people shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: At Funfteichen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: No.</span> <span id="s1662">They only shot people on the outside, when we were at work, not inside the camp.</span> <span id="s1663">Nobody could come inside the camp.</span> <span id="s1664">That was true in Funfteichen and in Buchenwald; no German could come into the camp.</span> <span id="s1665">I don’t know why, whether they were afraid or something, they never came into the camp.</span> <span id="s1666">In Markstadt, they were allowed to go into the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Would you say that there were degrees of being sadistic?</span> <span id="s1668">For example, I have read accounts that in some camps like Auschwitz, where you had the German guards who, just for the pure fun of it, would walk down between the barracks and just shoot people right and left.</span> <span id="s1669">Did you encounter that kind of German sadism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: That was true outside, yes, because they could not come into the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: The Germans were not allowed inside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: No, they were not allowed to come inside the camp.</span> <span id="s1673">Either in Funfteichen or Gross-Rosen or Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1674">Outside they could do anything.</span> <span id="s1675">For example, they told you to pick up a cigarette butt and when you did, they kicked you right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Nothing like that ever happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: No.</span> <span id="s1678">But I can tell you again that whoever got a beating did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: At the roll calls, were there good positions to be in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A; No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Was it bad to be in the first row?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Were you more likely to get beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: No, not especially.</span> <span id="s1685">They went around all over.</span> <span id="s1686">You know, at roll calls we had to wait.</span> <span id="s1687">We had roll calls in the morning and we got a roll call when we got back from work.</span> <span id="s1688">On Sundays we had a roll call four times a day.</span> <span id="s1689">On Sundays we got the food at noon.</span> <span id="s1690">On Sunday we got a roll call in the morning, a roll call before we ate and one after we ate and one before night.</span> <span id="s1691">Then everybody had to be counted.</span> <span id="s1692">If someone was missing we had to stand until he was found.</span> <span id="s1693">If the person showed up five minutes later he got his punishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Was there any widespread epidemic of typhus or diphtheria or dysentery at Funfteichen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A; No, not that I recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: I know that people were not in good condition but still they had been weakened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: No dysentery, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: You said that there was a Jewish doctor in Funfteichen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: Yes, in Funfteichen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: He could help a little bit but not a whole lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: Yes, that is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: Did you do the same thing in Funfteichen as you had in Markstadt, that is, building factory buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: Yes, because Funfteichen was not too far away from Markstadt, however Markstadt was an Arbeitslager and Funfteichen was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1704">They constantly moved people from the Arbeitslager to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1705">In 1943 I know that an order came out that all [Jewish] people have to go in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: However, there was no crematorium in Funfteichen, at that time</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1708">No crematorium.</span> <span id="s1709">The first crematorium which I saw was in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Can you recall when you first learned about the crematorium?</span> <span id="s1711">What was happening in Auschwitz and Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s1712">Did you know about that before you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: No, no!</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: You had no news of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: No, we didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1716">Auschwitz was not until 1942.</span> <span id="s1717">They just built Auschwitz in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Do you remember when you were first aware of what the fate of many Jews was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: You see, when I received a letter from my parents in April 1942, but at that time we knew it already.</span> <span id="s1720">The letter said, “We are going away -- we don’t know where it is because we didn’t ask.”</span> <span id="s1721">At that time we got the information about Auschwitz and what Auschwitz meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: The gas ovens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: Yes, everything.</span> <span id="s1724">That was in 1942!</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Did you make any friendships at Funfteichen?</span> <span id="s1726">Have you kept up with any people that you were with at Funfteichen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: You mean after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: Yes, after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1730">I got in touch with a lot of people from Funfteichen, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: Do you still have contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: No.</span> <span id="s1733">Little by little that stopped.</span> <span id="s1734">Who knows where they are!</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Do you have any idea what brought about your move from Funfteichen to Gross-Rosen in December of 1944, or in January of 1945, whenever it occurred?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Yes, the Russian front came closer.</span> <span id="s1737">When the Russians came closer, they moved us closer west, closer to Germany.</span> <span id="s1738">[Actually it appears that all the camps Abe was in were in pre-WWII Germany].</span> <span id="s1739">That was the only reason.</span> <span id="s1740">[It appears that throughout that period, Germany was willing to use up some of its dwindling resources to hold onto the concentration camp inmates].</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: You were moving ever further into the heartland of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1743">In Gross-Rosen, we did not work!</span> <span id="s1744">We were only a couple of weeks there.</span> <span id="s1745">However, Gross-Rosen was one of the worst camps which I ever heard about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: You marched from Funfteichen to Gross-Rosen?</span> <span id="s1747">How long did it take you, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: About two or three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: What were the conditions along the march?</span> <span id="s1750">It was in the wintertime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Snow and everything.</span> <span id="s1752">It was bad.</span> <span id="s1753">Those who couldn’t make it got shot right in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: Were you ever sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: I was sick after the liberation but, no, I was never sick during my stay in the camps.</span> <span id="s1756">Because of this I was lucky to survive.</span> <span id="s1757">When I was sick, I was careful not to tell anybody.</span> <span id="s1758">You couldn’t survive if you got sick.</span> <span id="s1759">That’s it!</span> <span id="s1760">That is the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: Now at Gross-Rosen, that was just people locked up and starved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: Gross-Rosen was only a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1763">Only that!</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: How many people were in Gross-Rosen, do you have any idea how many people were at Gross-Rosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: No, because they came in from all over.</span> <span id="s1766">So I got to Gross-Rosen and from Gross-Rosen we went to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1767">Gross-Rosen was a transit camp.</span> <span id="s1768">You went to the washroom and they beat you when you wanted to take a bath.</span> <span id="s1769">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: You received no food, or just very little food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: We hardly had any food at all.</span> <span id="s1772">You got one tiny bit, and the next day you got hardly anything at all, because it was a transit camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: So the food was highly irregular?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: No, we performed no work and we got no regular food.</span> <span id="s1775">It was only a transit camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q; The food which you got, what was it?</span> <span id="s1777">mainly bread?</span> <span id="s1778">bread and soup?</span> <span id="s1779">or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: I believe that it was just soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: There was no work!</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: Yes, and no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: Were you still largely associated with Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Did you stay with a Polish group in Gross-Rosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: An international group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: An international group.</span> <span id="s1789">There were a lot of gypsies, a lot of gypsies!</span> <span id="s1790">At times the gypsies were worse off than Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: Were the gypsies in the same barracks as you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Yes, the same mix.</span> <span id="s1793">Yes, everything was mixed!</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: In that month you were at Gross-Rosen, does anything stand out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: We were there for two weeks!</span> <span id="s1796">People just died!</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: Largely from hunger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: From hunger!</span> <span id="s1799">From beatings!</span> <span id="s1800">They beat you day and night over there.</span> <span id="s1801">That is all which they had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: Then, from some time in January of 1945, you were sent to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: Yes, by train.</span> <span id="s1804">We went by train to Weimar.</span> <span id="s1805">[The atlas used by the transcriber shows two cities in Germany with the name of Weimar, one in East and one in West Germany.</span> <span id="s1806">Obviously this reference is to the Weimar located in East Germany or the GDR, i.e., relatively close to Buchenwald].</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: How long did it take, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: I think it was a three or four day trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: Was there any food on the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: No.</span> <span id="s1811">No food at all on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: How about water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: No, no water!</span> <span id="s1814">The water was precious.</span> <span id="s1815">Believe it or not, this was wintertime, so we ate snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: I believe that you told me that you saw people drinking urine in order to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1818">You see water is more precious than food!</span> <span id="s1819">You can survive without food for a long time, but not without water.</span> <span id="s1820">To be without water is the worst thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: The train, the cattle car which took you to Buchenwald, was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: We went out from Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s1823">I would say about seven or eight thousand people.</span> <span id="s1824">600 or 700 died right on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: Were the cattle cars packed full of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s1827">They were so full that you couldn’t sit [These cattle cars which had been used all over Europe in WWI and WWII were stamped to transport seven horses or 40 men each; when the U.S. Army used them they never put more than 32 men in each car.</span> <span id="s1828">As far as concentration camp inmates, a quantity of 70 or 80 was not considered excessive in each car].</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Before you went to Buchenwald, did you know anything about Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Did you know that it was a Death Camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: That there was a crematorium there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: No, we didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1835">There was no way in which anyone could know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: Can you close your eyes now and picture your arrival at Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: I don’t even have to close my eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: Can you describe it?</span> <span id="s1839">Was it at night or in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: We arrived in Buchenwald about 11 o’clock.</span> <span id="s1841">I was there for about four weeks.</span> <span id="s1842">It took us about three days to get in.</span> <span id="s1843">We had to wait three days to take a shower.</span> <span id="s1844">Before you took a shower you could not go in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1845">So three days we waited outside.</span> <span id="s1846">Then we got a shower because people came from all the camps to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1847">Some people went from Buchenwald to other places.</span> <span id="s1848">Finally we got a shower in another block.</span> <span id="s1849">The blocks were piled one right against another because they didn’t want to lose so much space.</span> <span id="s1850">There were no mattresses!</span> <span id="s1851">You slept on straw.</span> <span id="s1852">If you wanted to turn on your straw mattress the guy next to you had to turn.</span> <span id="s1853">There was no more space!</span> <span id="s1854">That was the case at night and during the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: When you got off that train in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: No, we went to Weimar!</span> <span id="s1857">We walked from Weimar.</span> <span id="s1858">That was not too far.</span> <span id="s1859">It was about six or seven miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: Were there Germans along the way watching you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: What sort of expressions did they have on their faces?</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: I tell you what expressions they had on their faces!</span> <span id="s1864">Don’t ask me!</span> <span id="s1865">After my liberation I went back to Weimar and you couldn’t find one German who knew about Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Nobody would admit anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: They knew nothing about Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1868">You could smell the crematoriums from Weimar, actually not only from Weimar but also from 25 miles away.</span> <span id="s1869">They said, “Wier haben da garnichts gewusst!”</span> <span id="s1870">which translates into, “We didn’t know a thing!”</span> <span id="s1871">We prisoners went to Weimar every day to go to work.</span> <span id="s1872">They didn’t know anything!</span> <span id="s1873">You couldn’t find one guilty German.</span> <span id="s1874">Do you know who the best Germans were?</span> <span id="s1875">The dead Germans were!</span> <span id="s1876">That was so because after they said that they knew nothing about Buchenwald I had no sympathy for them.</span> <span id="s1877">[After such repeated denials of the local population, the U.S. Army troops forced the German civilians to march the few miles from Weimar to see what was to be seen.</span> <span id="s1878">Similar “Excursions” took place from Munich to Dachau and elsewhere].</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: As you walked from Weimar to Buchenwald there were Germans along the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Did you see any expressions of sympathy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: When we walked from Weimar to Buchenwald that first time, people could hardly walk after that train ride.</span> <span id="s1883">One fellow took his coat off and he sat down.</span> <span id="s1884">He knew that he would be shot!</span> <span id="s1885">That is all, but nobody knew anything.</span> <span id="s1886">Maybe they were afraid, or they weren’t, but who knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: OK, but when you walked into that camp of Buchenwald, you know that we knew a lot about Auschwitz and I suppose that other people knew a lot about Buchenwald, but I haven’t read anything particular about Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1888">Was there a sign above the gate reading, “Arbeit macht frei” [translating into “Labor makes you free”].</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: First of all, Buchenwald was an international camp.</span> <span id="s1890">There were people from all nations there.</span> <span id="s1891">The first thing they did when we came to Buchenwald was that they asked, “Who is a Kapo?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: Meaning, who was a Kapo at the previous camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1894">You know who was a Kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: A criminal!</span> <span id="s1897">So when someone said that they had been a Kapo, they took them right away and they finished him right in Buchenwald!</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q:” They killed him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: Right away!</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: Because in Buchenwald the Kapos were inside Buchenwald, not outside.</span> <span id="s1902">No German could come inside Buchenwald!</span> <span id="s1903">They didn’t like Kapos!</span> <span id="s1904">They finished them.</span> <span id="s1905">They gave them a cold shower and finish them.</span> <span id="s1906">If somebody could deny it, they denied it, but whoever did not deny it and they knew that he was a Kapo, they finished him in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: I am going to have to stop here, Abe.</span> <span id="s1908">This tape is finished and I have kept you talking long enough.</span> <span id="s1909">I have a lot more questions to ask at the next session.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: This is Charles Berry.</span> <span id="s1912">It is February 11, 1982, and I am in the breakfast room in the home of Mr. Abraham Stine.</span> <span id="s1913">This is the fourth of a series of interviews with Mr. Stine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: I forgot to mention to you something about Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s1915">Gross-Rosen was a transit concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1916">People from all nations were there.</span> <span id="s1917">Sometimes we received a little bit of food at night and some days we did not receive any at all.</span> <span id="s1918">People suffered so much from hunger, they were starving to death, that they ate people.</span> <span id="s1919">People ate people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: Did you see that frequently or was this an isolated incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: This was not an isolated incident.</span> <span id="s1922">There were people from the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s1923">They just went to the meat and boiled the meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: They cooked it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1926">That was in Gross-Rosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: I assume that the people who were eaten were already dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: Yes, I mean yes, sure.</span> <span id="s1929">Many people died, you could see everyplace you would go piles of dead people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Did this have to be done in the middle of the night or did the authorities not care?</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: On the inside of the camp the only authorities were the Kapos, and of course people from camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: Did this happen in your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: No, outside!</span> <span id="s1934">We had no fire or anything like that in the barracks, no stoves, no heat, nothing.</span> <span id="s1935">Of course there were no beds, nothing, people lay down on the floors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: How do you attribute this only to the Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: Because we saw it.</span> <span id="s1938">We saw the people, we knew the people!</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: Were they Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: No.</span> <span id="s1941">All Jewish people had to wear the Magen David [the Star of David, i.e., the six-cornered star which Jews were required to wear on the outer garments -- breast, left sleeve, and back].</span> <span id="s1942">So we knew that they were not wearing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: Did anyone try to stop them from doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: No.</span> <span id="s1945">It wasn’t any more than stopping them from eating grass.</span> <span id="s1946">There was starvation over there.</span> <span id="s1947">Gross-Rosen was a starvation place; this was the worst concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1948">I heard that, it wasn’t of only which I saw.</span> <span id="s1949">I heard it from several people that this was the worst camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: You must have thought that truly you were in hell at that point!</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: I didn’t think nothing, because we really didn’t have the time to think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: We were concentrating on how to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: Look, Abe, if you didn’t want to work in Gross-Rosen, if it wasn’t a work camp, how did you pass the day?</span> <span id="s1955">Did they have some sort of routines that they put you through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: They sent you from the block, in this case the block was the barracks, to the washroom, from there back to the barracks, all day long.</span> <span id="s1957">We didn’t do anything because this was just a transit camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: You also said that what food there was came in highly irregular intervals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: There was no regulation.</span> <span id="s1960">Whoever was stronger got hold of whatever little food there was!</span> <span id="s1961">There was no regulation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Did you form any friendships at all at Gross-Rosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A; No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: Is there somebody at all whom you remember from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: No!</span> <span id="s1966">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1967">I don’t know how anybody should survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: Did you mainly stay with Polish Jews in Gross-Rosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Or was it all mixed together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: No, in the blocks, we were only together with Polish Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q; Now, on the last tape, you described your trip to Buchenwald, in the midst of winter, from Gross-Rosen, by train.</span> <span id="s1973">You said that it took two to three weeks, if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s1974">I may be wrong about that, but that is what I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: No, no, no!</span> <span id="s1976">From Gross-Rosen it took about one week to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: About a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: Yes, about a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: You had no food on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A; No.</span> <span id="s1981">When we got on the train we got what I believe to be one pound of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: You had to stand up the entire way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1984">We were packed tightly, one against the other.</span> <span id="s1985">There was no place to sit.</span> <span id="s1986">People just drank urine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: And melted snow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: Yes, melted snow, if we got it.</span> <span id="s1989">That was nothing unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: Did people die in the car you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A; I would say that about six percent or seven percent of the people died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: There wasn’t any place to lay them down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: No.</span> <span id="s1994">Who ever fell down was laying down with the dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">Q: Now, at Buchenwald, as I remember what you said, when the train pulled in there was -- no, it didn’t pull in there, it pulled into Weimar, and then you marched into Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1996">However, when you arrived at Buchenwald, there was no separation immediately to the crematoria or immediately to the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: No, there was no separation.</span> <span id="s1998">Some people went to the crematoria to die, that what you heard was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1999">[Auschwitz was by then far to the east, it was east of Gross-Rosen and they had traveled due west from Gross-Rosen to Buchenwald].</span> <span id="s2000">The separation was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2001">My wife was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2002">Separation also occurred in Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: So, everyone who was alive was marched to the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A; Yes, everybody, but first of all they had to go through the wash barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: The delousing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: Yes, the delousing!</span> <span id="s2007">For some people that took a day, for some people that took up to three days.</span> <span id="s2008">After this they had some young people, that means 13, 14, or 15 year old kids, in a special barrack.</span> <span id="s2009">That was Block 66!</span> <span id="s2010">That was the killer block.</span> <span id="s2011">The rest of them they divided between the other blocks, or barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: Why did they separate the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: This I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2014">I really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2015">I heard, after the liberation, that there was a block which they called Children Block, that was Block 66.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: Do you remember the number of the block you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: It was 49!</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Was that a mixture of everyone?</span> <span id="s2019">Every nationality?</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: No, only Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: Only Polish Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: I will tell you now why I remember, and I will never forget it in my life.</span> <span id="s2023">I remember that several days before Christmas, there were the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2024">I believe that I told you about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: They gave you packages?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: Yes, they gave us packages.</span> <span id="s2027">Directly delivered packages.</span> <span id="s2028">Everybody received a package for Christmas, but not the Jews.</span> <span id="s2029">Until today I will never give a penny to the Red Cross because that was not right.</span> <span id="s2030">The Red Cross was a foundation, a national foundation, and they are supposed to give to everybody, and if they can’t do that they shouldn’t give to anybody.</span> <span id="s2031">A piece of bread or a piece of butter meant death or life.</span> <span id="s2032">Here the people were receiving these packages and other people did not receive them.</span> <span id="s2033">That was not right and if they didn’t know about it, they should know it!</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: Now that is interesting!</span> <span id="s2035">I had never heard that before.</span> <span id="s2036">I mean that I had never heard that there was that kind of discrimination.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A; I am not the only one, but all the people who managed to survive will tell you about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: Did the Red Cross official come in and distribute the packages?</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: No!</span> <span id="s2040">They were not allowed inside the camp.</span> <span id="s2041">Only the prisoners were allowed inside, that was the order.</span> <span id="s2042">At the time when I was in Buchenwald, I didn’t know too much about the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2043">After the liberation, we found out that the Red Cross was an international organization and everybody is donating to the Red Cross, including the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2044">I did not like this.</span> <span id="s2045">That disturbs me very much to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: If you were mixed up with everyone, from every nationality, were there any gypsies in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A; Yes!</span> <span id="s2048">Actually, not too many gypsies, because they killed the gypsies faster than the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q; Were you ever associated with any gypsies in the five camps where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s2051">Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s2052">Most of that association took place in Gross-Rosen, next in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2053">There they were concentrated with Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2054">Other than they, there were only Jewish people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: Were there any political prisoners at Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: There were lots of Germans, a lot of Germans, also French, American, and English people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: Not Jewish?</span> <span id="s2058">Not English-Jewish, not American-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: No, no, no!</span> <span id="s2060">They were Jews and non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: How do you suppose that would be?</span> <span id="s2062">Did you know any Englishmen personally, or any Americans personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: No, we didn’t know any of them personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Were they in your barracks, by chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: I don’t really recall.</span> <span id="s2066">It was so long ago.</span> <span id="s2067">However, we knew that there were Germans because when the real Germans [contrasting with Jewish-Germans], when they were in the camps had jobs inside.</span> <span id="s2068">They worked in the kitchen, like blockobersters and that kind of thing, you know, politician type of job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: Another persecuted group about which you don’t read very much were the homosexuals.</span> <span id="s2070">Did you ever see any homosexuals?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: Yes, German homosexuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: In Buchenwald also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s2074">At least I heard they were.</span> <span id="s2075">I didn’t actually see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: Would you say that.</span> <span id="s2077">Other than the gypsies, there were any one particular group, besides the Jews, who might have received harsher treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: No, only the Jews and the gypsies!</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: Was there any work detail at Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s2080">Was it a work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: Yes, we went to Weimar every day to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: Yes, every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Marching?</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: Yes, marching!</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: How many miles would you say that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: Six miles!</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: So it was a 12 mile round trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: Morning and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: Yes, we went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Q: What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">A: Any kind of work.</span> <span id="s2094">Actually I personally did not go to Weimar.</span> <span id="s2095">I was working not too far away from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2096">They had a stone quarry.</span> <span id="s2097">I worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: That was hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: What was not hard work?</span> <span id="s2100">Everything was hard work!</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q” I thought that stone quarries were particularly hard work, particularly brutal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: No, everything was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: So, what were you doing?</span> <span id="s2104">Breaking stones up?</span> <span id="s2105">Cutting stones from the cliffs, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: I was helping to dig the stones, and loading them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: How big were the stones?</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: They were different sizes.</span> <span id="s2109">They were big enough so that someone had to help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: What do you suppose they did with these stones?</span> <span id="s2111">Were they using them for building?</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: Did you ever have to pull the carts on which the stones were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: No!</span> <span id="s2115">Everybody had a different job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: So you stayed on the same job?</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2118">I was doing the same job, that was digging and loading.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: Who was supervising, a German or a Kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: A Kapo!</span> <span id="s2121">Only Kapos, they provided the supervision.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: Did they have whips?</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A; In Buchenwald they didn’t.</span> <span id="s2124">There the punishment being administered in camp was not so severe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q; I didn’t know that!</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: That is right, the punishment being administered in Buchenwald was not so severe, because they had people there from all the nations.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q: What punishment was meted out was given by the Kapos, or by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A: Only by the Kapos.</span> <span id="s2129">No SS man [the SS or Schutzstaffel were the black uniformed elite guards which provided special security for high level party functionaries as well as supplying concentration camp guards and even several specially picked army units] could go into any camp [at least that was in the camps Abe knows about].</span> <span id="s2130">They had picked their people and they worked for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: About the Kapos in Buchenwald, were they any different from Kapos in other camps?</span> <span id="s2132">Did you find any more brutality or less brutality?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: Less brutality.</span> <span id="s2134">I don’t know for what reason, but definitely less brutality.</span> <span id="s2135">You see, it was international.</span> <span id="s2136">They had international Kapos.</span> <span id="s2137">International people.</span> <span id="s2138">That was a good possibility that it was getting towards the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: So you think that perhaps a mixture of people softened the brutality against the Jews at least somewhat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: Not against the Jews, against all the people!</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: Or maybe the approach of the end of the war may have had something to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: Maybe it was the approach of the end of the war, I think so, because they were afraid for their own skins.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: Now these are crucial months, January, February, and March of 1945, as far as the war is concerned.</span> <span id="s2144">The invasion of Germany had begun.</span> <span id="s2145">[Auschwitz is liberated by Russian army on Jan. 27, 1945.</span> <span id="s2146">Soviet army breaches the outer defenses of Berlin on Jan. 31.</span> <span id="s2147">American troops cross the Rhine River at Remagen on March 23, 1945.</span> <span id="s2148">Buchenwald was freed on April 12].</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: That was so on the Russian front.</span> <span id="s2150">They were coming close to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: Did you get war news?</span> <span id="s2152">Were you aware of movements on the outside of camp?</span> <span id="s2153">The battles?</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: No, nothing!</span> <span id="s2155">Only of what was happening in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2156">In Buchenwald, a week before the liberation, they issued an order that all Jews should come out, that they were going to transfer the Jews from Buchenwald to other camps.</span> <span id="s2157">I knew about it earlier.</span> <span id="s2158">We had already heard some rumors about it.</span> <span id="s2159">They took all the Jews outside the camp into the forest to dig a big hole, and they shot all the Jews who went out.</span> <span id="s2160">This was about three days before the liberation.</span> <span id="s2161">So I was laying in a pile of dead people when I was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">Q: Did you suspect that that would be the fate of the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">A: We suspected that they would kill all the Jews because they took out only the Jews.</span> <span id="s2164">They had asked all the Jewish people should go out.</span> <span id="s2165">They said that they would transfer the Jewish people into other camps!</span> <span id="s2166">So I was liberated in between a pile of dead people.</span> <span id="s2167">There were such piles in Buchenwald at the liberation, as you see here in junk dealers lots, big piles of dead people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: So there was a lot of starvation in Buchenwald also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: Yes, we were starving in Buchenwald!</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q; I asked that because a lot of the pictures which we have are pictures of walking skeletons, and most of these pictures come from Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s2172">I think that I still have some pictures.</span> <span id="s2173">Pictures of skeletons!</span> <span id="s2174">That was because we did not receive food regularly.</span> <span id="s2175">We were walking skeletons.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: Were these two piles of corpses that you crawled in between or was it a pile of corpses which you crawled under?</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: I was laying on top of corpses for three days before the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Do you know if other people did that also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2180">I wasn’t aware.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: What gave you the idea to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A; Because I had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s2183">I couldn’t walk!</span> <span id="s2184">I weighed 85 pounds when I was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q; Did that idea come to you all of a sudden or had you planned it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: The idea came because I had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s2187">I had nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s2188">I couldn’t go anyplace.</span> <span id="s2189">I thought that, “If I am going to die, I might as well die here.”</span> <span id="s2190">That was enough of an idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: You had no Idea that liberation would come so quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A; No, we didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s2193">You see, the 1st U.S. Division, I think, we were actually in territory between the 1st Division and the 3rd Division.</span> <span id="s2194">[At that time, the transcriber knows from personal experience, the advance of U.S. troops was so swift since everyone had been ordered to move ahead as opportunity presented itself, that units were constantly reassigned between armies as they moved from one administrative area to another.</span> <span id="s2195">This free assignment made was not believed to go to Divisional level, but it may have in some cases; however, because of where Buchenwald is located, it is believed that Abe was talking about the 1st and 3rd U.S. Armies rather than divisions].</span> <span id="s2196">About 24 hours before the liberation they put gas and oil next to us.</span> <span id="s2197">They were already putting tape on the doors in preparation of putting gas in the barracks, they were already putting tape on all windows also.</span> <span id="s2198">So they wanted to gas all the people.</span> <span id="s2199">The U.S. troops were about 20 or 40 miles from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2200">In Buchenwald they had underground radios.</span> <span id="s2201">So what happened is that the troops bypassed the cities and liberated Buchenwald three days before they had been expected, or at least a day before.</span> <span id="s2202">If they hadn’t done that, all the prisoners would have been killed by gas, that is what their plan had been, to put gas in all the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: Were there a lot of underground radios in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: I don’t know that, but I know that they had radios, because when the U.S. Army came in, they captured a lot of SS men still on the outside, behind the fence, getting the gas ready.</span> <span id="s2205">Our wish was, in all the concentration camps, that we should be able to be liberated and receive enough food and to kill the Germans.</span> <span id="s2206">Now we couldn’t do this because the Americans protected them and they let us out.</span> <span id="s2207">The food which they gave us!</span> <span id="s2208">More than half the people died from the food after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">Q: From overeating?</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: Yes, from overeating and from eating too fast.</span> <span id="s2211">Maybe not so much from overeating but eating too fast and too rich foods.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: Margarine and such things?</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: No, it was ham and everything like that.</span> <span id="s2214">Rice was cooked with pork and everything.</span> <span id="s2215">There was too much fat.</span> <span id="s2216">We couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s2217">I was by myself, after the liberation, in a hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: I want to ask you about liberation in some detail in just a minute.</span> <span id="s2219">However, I want to ask you a few questions for the period before liberation.</span> <span id="s2220">Did you ever, ever, have any contact with anyone who was planning escape or resisting/</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">Q: Or an uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">A: No, no!</span> <span id="s2224">You couldn’t escape anyplace.</span> <span id="s2225">We were in Germany.</span> <span id="s2226">Where could you escape to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: I realize that it would be difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: No, no!</span> <span id="s2229">I was not involved!</span> <span id="s2230">No one that I know of was!</span> <span id="s2231">[Escape would also not have been possible because of the absolute weakness of the prisoners].</span> <span id="s2232">No, no!</span> <span id="s2233">At no time!</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Were there any Russian prisoners of war in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: I am asking that because a lot of the research now reveals that many of these Russian prisoners of war planned escapes and uprisings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: But not in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">Q: Not in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">A: There were only two camps where I was with prisoners of other nations.</span> <span id="s2240">They were Gross-Rosen and Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: Was there a lot of epidemic at Buchenwald, such things as typhus and such?</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: I suffered from it after the liberation.</span> <span id="s2243">I believe that this may have been caused by the food.</span> <span id="s2244">I was in a hospital for three months after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: Please describe to me, in as much vivid detail as you can possibly recall, the day of liberation.</span> <span id="s2246">You were there, with those corpses.</span> <span id="s2247">What did you hear?</span> <span id="s2248">What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: At one time an announcement came over the loudspeaker that “Buchenwald is liberated.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: In what language was that?</span> <span id="s2251">Was it in German?</span> <span id="s2252">In a lot of languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: In Polish and French.</span> <span id="s2254">Yes, I believe that it was in Polish and Yiddish and German.</span> <span id="s2255">We also saw that the Americans took the SS with them.</span> <span id="s2256">That is all we saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: Now, when did you come out from the pile of corpses?</span> <span id="s2258">When you heard those announcements?</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: No, no!</span> <span id="s2260">I was still afraid then!</span> <span id="s2261">I still lay still the whole afternoon.</span> <span id="s2262">This was Tuesday morning, April 11, and I still laid there a whole day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: Did you come out that night?</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: Yes, I came out at night, when I saw that everything was quiet.</span> <span id="s2265">I saw already the American Army coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s2267">I am trying to put myself in the place of one of these U.S. soldiers coming into the camp and one of the prisoners, there really must have developed rather quickly some sort of organization to get people fed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: The first thing which happened is that the Red Cross came by.</span> <span id="s2269">That was the American Red Cross!</span> <span id="s2270">They had kitchens with food.</span> <span id="s2271">This food was poison to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: Yes, because you had been starved for so long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">A: The people had no knowledge how to look after us.</span> <span id="s2274">The American Army had no knowledge how to react, how to feed these people.</span> <span id="s2275">What we really needed was a piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: The first American whom you saw was passing through a line to get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: The first thing was the Americans coming with the kitchens and passing food out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">Q; Were there a number of doctors there?</span> <span id="s2279">American M.D.s?</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s2281">We really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2282">I remember that there was one German doctor.</span> <span id="s2283">He had also been in camp.</span> <span id="s2284">Later on he was working with the American Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2285">They had an ambulance (Abe is groping for the word, calling it a “hospital on a truck”).</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">Q: Did they organize the liberated inmates for questioning?</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: Did they want to talk to each of you individually?</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">A: No, I was taken to the hospital right away, one day or two days after liberation, because I was very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Q: With food poisoning or with typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: From the food!</span> <span id="s2292">I know that because I was laying there for several days without food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: Now the hospital you were taken to, was that one of these truck hospitals in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: They built a major hospital right away in the camp, I was there for three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: Right there in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">A: Right in Buchenwald, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">Q: Were you conscious all that time or were you in and out of consciousness?</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">A: I was conscious all the time.</span> <span id="s2299">I couldn’t walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: You said that you weighed 85 pounds then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: Yes, 85 pounds.</span> <span id="s2302">At that time I was 25 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: Did you go on a special diet to gradually regain your weight?</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: I mean, did they quickly realize that they had done wrong with the food?</span> <span id="s2306">[in the beginning, there had been no knowledgeable medical staff there, only soldiers who believed that if you saw hungry people, you fed them].</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: Oh yes, later on they gave us all different kinds of food.</span> <span id="s2308">The worst thing, I believe, was this pork with the rice, they certainly did give us enough!</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: Yes, that is very greasy food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: You know, people couldn’t fill up their stomachs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">Q: Now, in this three month period that you were in the hospital, did you also have typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">A: No, no, no!</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: That was even later?</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">A: No, this was after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: So you had typhus and the food problem, all at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">A: Yes, at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">Q: Did the Americans talk a lot to you?</span> <span id="s2318">Did they question you about your experiences?</span> <span id="s2319">Was there a team of investigators who were trying to trace families?</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: No, there just was a Jewish chaplain.</span> <span id="s2321">He came in.</span> <span id="s2322">He gave us food, special food because this was, by then, just before Passover [the Jewish major Holy Day celebrating the anniversary of the exodus from Egypt, under Moses when Jews eat unleavened bread, i.e., matzo, and other special foods].</span> <span id="s2323">He gave us matzo and other kosher foods.</span> <span id="s2324">He brought those into the hospital for us.</span> <span id="s2325">He didn’t ask many questions at all, really no questions at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">A: Sheckter, Captain Sheckter!</span> <span id="s2328">[this spelling is only approximate].</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: Have you ever had any contact with him since?</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2331">He was here the last time when we had a Speaker for Holocaust Day.</span> <span id="s2332">He spoke about the chaplain’s function.</span> <span id="s2333">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Q: Yes, I do remember!</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: Yes, he told about visiting people from Buchenwald and other camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: How rapidly after the liberation did you gain weight?</span> <span id="s2337">After three months, how much did you weigh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2339">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2340">Later, in August, after I had been discharged from the hospital, actually a month after my discharge from the hospital, I went to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: That quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: In these three months during which you were in the hospital, were you trying to make plans about what to do in your future?</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">A: I didn’t make any plans because I knew that I had nobody, no family.</span> <span id="s2345">We were living on a day- to- day basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">Q: Yes, that is what I am trying to get at, how things changed from day- to- day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">A: No, we still didn’t know nobody, we didn’t have any basis to make plans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">Q: So your mentality was to live on a day- to-day basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A: Yes, that’s it.</span> <span id="s2350">So first I went to Poland, as soon as I regained my health.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Q: Wait a minute!</span> <span id="s2352">What did you do in the four weeks after you left the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: I went to Weimar.</span> <span id="s2354">I was living in Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">Q: Who with?</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">A: With friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: In an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: Yes, in an apartment.</span> <span id="s2359">However, the American Army made an exchange with the Russian army.</span> <span id="s2360">You know that the American Army liberated Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2361">However, later they exchanged territory.</span> <span id="s2362">So the Russians took over!</span> <span id="s2363">At that time, I was already living in a private place.</span> <span id="s2364">About four weeks later we went back to Poland to look for relatives.</span> <span id="s2365">First I came to my home city Zabkowice, and I couldn’t find anybody.</span> <span id="s2366">That is where I met the fellow who asked me, “Are you still alive?”</span> <span id="s2367">he didn’t ask me where I had been, he could think of nothing else but to ask me that question!</span> <span id="s2368">That was asked by a friend whom I had left behind, in the place where I was born and raised.</span> <span id="s2369">After I heard this question, I took the train, on the same day, and went back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">Q: To Weimar?</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">A: No, to Germany.</span> <span id="s2372">To the American Sector.</span> <span id="s2373">Weimar, by then, was already in the Russian Zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">Q: When you went back to Zabkowice, you did see people whom you had known?</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s2376">Not Jewish people!</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: Not Jewish but gentile people.</span> <span id="s2378">They didn’t know you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: They didn’t want to have anything to do with me!</span> <span id="s2380">They claimed that they didn’t know me.</span> <span id="s2381">Some of them had been neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: On that one day, did you run into any other Jews who had come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: No.</span> <span id="s2384">You see, that was such a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">Q: Yes, there were 70 families?</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">A: Yes, there were 70 families.</span> <span id="s2387">On the day on which I was there, I walked into the house of my neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q; Did you feel any difference in the attitude or treatment of the Russians toward you, as a liberated prisoner, one who had suffered greatly, and of the Americans toward you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: They were hard in principle.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">Q: Well how, for instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">A: The first thing, the Americans gave us enough to eat.</span> <span id="s2392">We got nothing from the Russians.</span> <span id="s2393">I preferred going to the Americans.</span> <span id="s2394">After this, I was in Weimar, and they were rough.</span> <span id="s2395">Their roughness was like day and night as compared to the Americans.</span> <span id="s2396">For example, you couldn’t go everyplace you wanted to.</span> <span id="s2397">You had to get permission for everything.</span> <span id="s2398">I was with them for only four weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">Q: What contact did you have with Germans during those four weeks in Weimar?</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">A: Lots of it!</span> <span id="s2401">99 percent of my contacts were with Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: Did you talk to them a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: Yes, I talked to them, but nobody knew about Buchenwald1</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">A: Nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">Q; Nobody would admit it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s2408">They really made the statement, “Nobody knew!”</span> <span id="s2409">You could smell the crematoriums 25 miles away.</span> <span id="s2410">We went to work in Weimar, but they didn’t know that Buchenwald existed.</span> <span id="s2411">“Wier sind nicht schuldig,” i.e., we are not guilty; “Wier haben garnichts gewusst,” i.e., we didn’t know anything!</span> <span id="s2412">These were the expressions they used often.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: Were you angry at these Germans?</span> <span id="s2414">Were you full of resentment and still wanting to kill them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: You couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: I know that you personally couldn’t, but did you find yourself wanting to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: The answer is yes, very much so!</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: How could you feel otherwise?</span> <span id="s2419">Did that feeling stay with you for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2421">Still until today.</span> <span id="s2422">I will not go back to Germany, I will not go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s2423">I will not go back because of the hatred!</span> <span id="s2424">I won’t go to Poland because of the people.</span> <span id="s2425">I hate Poles!</span> <span id="s2426">The same applies to Germany.</span> <span id="s2427">Lots of Jewish people could survive in Poland and I know it because I went to Poland and I heard from many people who went to Poland that a lot of Jewish people were hiding during WWII, and couldn’t survive among the Polish people because they snitched on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">Q: That is right!</span> <span id="s2429">They turned them in, killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: Poland used to have a Jewish population of 10%, that means three and a half million out of a population of 35 million, before the war.</span> <span id="s2431">When I went back to Poland, there are very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: I think that the population is about six thousand today, that is Jews in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: Yes, today there are about five to six thousand.</span> <span id="s2434">That is all.</span> <span id="s2435">They are all older people.</span> <span id="s2436">And they still blame the Jews about what is happening in Poland today.</span> <span id="s2437">The Jews have no power, nothing at all to say, but they still blame the Jews!</span> <span id="s2438">This is how Poland was</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: It hasn’t changed1</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">A: It hasn’t changed and it will never change.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: They haven’t learned any lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">A: All of the punishment which they are getting today is not enough, at least not in my book.</span> <span id="s2443">I don’t know about you or the other people, but in my book, they deserve much more!</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: That day then, in Zabkowice, where you were treated so rudely, inhumanely by neighbors, was so bad that you couldn’t wait to get out so that you left right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: I waited the same day for a train to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: However, what options were open to you?</span> <span id="s2447">What made you decide to go to the American zone rather than to stay in Weimar where your friends were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: Because we heard that there wasn’t much, because America was very popular in the forties and even before.</span> <span id="s2449">After the liberation it was very popular.</span> <span id="s2450">America was known to be the best country, and in my book, it is still the best country in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: Where exactly did you go when you went to the American Zone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A; I was living in Regensburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: Now what took you there?</span> <span id="s2454">Why that and not some other town?</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: Because Regensburg was not too far from the Polish border, and from the border with Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2456">It was about 25 to 30 miles from the Russian-Polish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">Q: Did you fall in with a group of other people who became your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">A: I connected up with people who were in different concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">Q: However, you were not in what was called a displaced persons camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">A: No!</span> <span id="s2461">Where I was in Regensburg, that was not a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Q: You were living in an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">A: Yes, in an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">Q: With friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">A: Yes, with friends.</span> <span id="s2466">There was a DP (displaced persons) camp about 10 to 15 miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: Where did you get the money to pay the rent or to buy food?</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: I started to do business.</span> <span id="s2469">Black market selling [that was not legal]!</span> <span id="s2470">I did anything I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">Q: But to sell anything you had to start with some stock.</span> <span id="s2472">You had to start with something to sell.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: We started by getting a little bit of food [in the late spring of 1945 everything was scarce in Germany, particularly food] and we sold it.</span> <span id="s2474">It was like a trading place, and it went on from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">Q: Were most of these people doing the same thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">A: Yes, most of them were doing the same thing, because we had no resources to get money from anywhere.</span> <span id="s2477">It was just like small children.</span> <span id="s2478">We were just like small children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">Q: Now what intrigues me about this process is that your past had been totally erased.</span> <span id="s2480">When did you begin to plan for the future?</span> <span id="s2481">When did you begin to make some sort of plan, instead of just living from day to day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">A: I really wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s2483">We just took things from a day- to- day basis, as a matter of fact we still were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: However that changes somewhere along the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: No, maybe it changes, but slowly.</span> <span id="s2486">Sure, it had to be changing, but the beginning was on a day- to- day basis because for the years where we had been in these camps it brought us to it.</span> <span id="s2487">We just lived day by day.</span> <span id="s2488">When I was liberated, I was 25 years old and I had no place to go.</span> <span id="s2489">I was all alone.</span> <span id="s2490">My wife was 20 when she was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">Q: Where did you meet Judy?</span> <span id="s2492">[That obviously is Abe’s wife].</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: In Regensburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: In this period immediately after returning from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">A: A few months later.</span> <span id="s2496">She had nobody and I had nobody!</span> <span id="s2497">We wanted children.</span> <span id="s2498">We got married, and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">Q: What did you decide to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">A: We decided not to stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s2501">As soon as we had a door open to go away from Germany, we wanted to leave all that behind.</span> <span id="s2502">America was the first place where we could go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">Q: You never considered Palestine?</span> <span id="s2504">[Palestine was closed to legal immigration of Jews until the Jewish state of Israel was established in 1948].</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A: No, we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s2507">Do you remember discussing it or thinking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">A: I don’t remember, but it would have been a hardship again.</span> <span id="s2509">We felt that we had had plenty of hardship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q; Did any Zionists come through to try to recruit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">A: Yes, they tried.</span> <span id="s2512">It was like the religion which we had lost.</span> <span id="s2513">I used to be very religious as a boy, but we lost everything during the war because we saw what happened to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2514">We just remembered the tradition, the Jewish tradition, and not the religion, because we saw what happened.</span> <span id="s2515">In the atmosphere of the Holy Days I didn’t really believe in it, in the religion.</span> <span id="s2516">I thought that we didn’t have a God.</span> <span id="s2517">Believe that or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: Yes, I believe it.</span> <span id="s2519">I think that that is easy to feel after you have been through what you have been through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">A: We didn’t believe it!</span> <span id="s2521">And I had been raised orthodox in the religion [i.e., practicing all the laws and edicts].</span> <span id="s2522">In the war I lost everything, all belief.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">Q: When you and Judy were married, were you married by a rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A: Oh yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: In Regensburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A; Yes, in Regensburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q; How long did you stay there after you were married, before you came to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: We got married in 1946 and we came to the U.S. in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">Q: Oh, so you lived in Regensburg for four years?</span> <span id="s2530">You were not still living by dealing in the black market?</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s2532">In 1946, I got a license from the U.S. government to drive a taxi.</span> <span id="s2533">I bought my car and ran a taxi service for the U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s2534">I did that until 1950.</span> <span id="s2535">I sold the taxi before I left</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">Q: Well, that is a remarkable comeback, from 85 pounds on April 11, 1945, and a long period of illness, and not finding any family, and then, within five years, supporting a wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">A: And a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">Q: And a child.</span> <span id="s2539">Your son was born in Regensburg?</span> <span id="s2540">When was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">A: In 1947.</span> <span id="s2542">Then we came to America.</span> <span id="s2543">We came to Cincinnati.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">Q: Let me ask you a question about those four years in Regensburg.</span> <span id="s2545">Did you completely regain your health?</span> <span id="s2546">You were never sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: No, I completely regained my health!</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">Q: I am not going to put anything on this tape about coming to the U.S., because that is another entire story.</span> <span id="s2549">There is no use beginning on this now, since I have only got about five minutes left to talk to you on this tape.</span> <span id="s2550">So let us quit here and pick it up with coming to Cincinnati next time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">To the best knowledge of the transcriber, the follow-up interviews never took place, so the story of Abe Stine ends in Regensburg.</span></p></body></html>
