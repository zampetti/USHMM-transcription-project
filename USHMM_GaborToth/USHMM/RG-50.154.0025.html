1986</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Sarasota, Florida (Note: For inexplicable reasons, the first portion of this interview is not recorded on this tape.</span> <span id="s4">There was a considerable amount of time which elapsed between the interview and the transcription and so it was not possible to reconstruct what happened to the beginning material.</span> <span id="s5">In the normal course of an interview, there is an opening statement by the interviewer, in this case Elinor Borenstine, giving her name, the date and place of the interview and introducing the interviewee, in this case Mr. Manfred Simon.</span> <span id="s6">The material in this interview is extremely interesting and valuable.</span> <span id="s7">We apologize for the missing information, but certainly deem it worthy to be included in this project.)</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Anything like that that you belonged to?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: No, not at that age that I remember.</span> <span id="s10">It was schooling uh in the regular school system and schooling being taught in the Hebrew sense, also.</span> <span id="s11">Affiliation for myself at that age I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Okay, now uh in this high school.</span> <span id="s13">This was how many years?</span> <span id="s14">And you began at what age?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Well, we begin, we begin in school at the age of five and this was…I would say…and this was about three or four years schooling that I had when I left Frankfurt, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s17">Okay, uh, did you have a larger family; this was your immediate family.</span> <span id="s18">Did your mother and father have other family?</span> <span id="s19">Brothers, sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Oh, yes, yes, we had ah uncles and aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Oh, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: …and cousins and it was quite a sizeable family that I remember and well known in the circles and well known in the social department and so my father, I want to bring out if you ask me this question, there have to be ties because ah we went back I know that my father was born in Frankfurt, my grandfather was born in Frankfurt, so that some generations you go back to this town, so there must be ties uh certainly there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s24">Now when your mother first decided there was trouble and she wanted to leave, uh, where did she want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Well, my mother came from a small town which was called Memel and that was part of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s26">That was East Prussia, above Danzig.</span> <span id="s27">It was -- her parents lived there, still lived there.</span> <span id="s28">And the good part it was a summer resort, it’s the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s29">Even in good times, she took her children, during the summer months, to be at the seashore with the children.</span> <span id="s30">Now only it became a bit of a one --way trip, with no return.</span> <span id="s31">She took us there, the children.</span> <span id="s32">Same way as every year before -- we are going to the seashore and then we will see when the summer’s over.</span> <span id="s33">In the meantime, during the summer it became less tolerable for Jewish people to live in Germany.</span> <span id="s34">Pressures came on that we were not used to and my mother decided to enroll me into school.</span> <span id="s35">My sister I think was just about to begin the first year school and my father hesitated of coming, still.</span> <span id="s36">He did his business in Germany.</span> <span id="s37">I am not quite sure year if it was another full year, but for a little while, until it became intolerable and more or less were not open any more for him to travel freely, as we had, with a normal passport, with a normal visa, with purchasing a railroad ticket as you would in normal days…this has disappeared.</span> <span id="s38">So it became a little bit of a problem.</span> <span id="s39">My father had to liquidate, or rather leave things, and had to get over the closed borders, or illegal borders, or (words missing in original transcript) borders, into Belgium first.</span> <span id="s40">Then again it took months, with contacts, to work his way over borders into Holland.</span> <span id="s41">From Holland, where he had big business connections, it had to be worked out for months again to put him on a freighter that went to England and then to Memel, which was a port.</span> <span id="s42">He was a number of months on a ship.</span> <span id="s43">We had contact very little, but then we had radio contact via Holland.</span> <span id="s44">The ship came into the open sea, into Memel, could not come to the coast close enough because of my father, because he was illegally stowed away and the captain knew very well about it.</span> <span id="s45">It was worthwhile for the captain to expose himself and take that chance.</span> <span id="s46">It took 10 days to lie out on high sea, with the Lithuanian government being aware of the fact there was a ship, but for some reason requested night landing.</span> <span id="s47">And we succeeded during one night, with a small rowboat to get him off high sea and bring him into port.</span> <span id="s48">And this was the beginning of his joining us, illegal, no passport, stateless, something unknown in today, what it is to be a stateless human being.</span> <span id="s49">It means a person without any country.</span> <span id="s50">And that is bad, tough, and sometimes unbelievable what one has to go through to walk freely the street of whatever country, without having anybody speak for you.</span> <span id="s51">We were stateless people.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: You, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s54">The system in Europe was that whoever the head of the household was the head of the family and he had a passport of a country that automatically made the wife and children the same thing.</span> <span id="s55">And if he had no passport, that made the wife and the children the same thing.</span> <span id="s56">And that continues.</span> <span id="s57">It does not mean that if you become of a certain age that I can work away from home and say I have nothing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Surely.</span> <span id="s59">This was in the neighborhood of 1932, ’33?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: This was exactly -- we left in ’33 and it finished up, I would say, in 1934, in Memel.</span> <span id="s61">I went to school in Memel.</span> <span id="s62">I was barmitzvah in 1936.</span> <span id="s63">I remember vividly a tremendous big affair.</span> <span id="s64">Everything was fine and dandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And your father was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Oh, my father was there.</span> <span id="s67">My father was working.</span> <span id="s68">It was expensive to live because we were stateless immigrants and remained on that status I guess until the war began.</span> <span id="s69">It wasn’t as the system as we have here, that if you wait five years you apply for your citizenship and you become a citizen.</span> <span id="s70">Stateless means you remain until you die-- stateless.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Um, hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Over there.</span> <span id="s73">I went to normal public schools, I went to the finest high schools, which we call gymnasium.</span> <span id="s74">Gymnasium….</span> <span id="s75">to graduate from the gymnasium is a bit more of an education than we offer in this country, in the United States.</span> <span id="s76">A youngster graduating from gymnasium has an equivalent of a minimum of two to three years into college.</span> <span id="s77">(words missing in original transcript) he is well into his third year of college.</span> <span id="s78">That is normal school.</span> <span id="s79">In 1938, which was my senior year for school my parents decided to give me the finer of the finest education a parent can offer and send me into another foreign country, to Sweden, to complete the schooling that was needed and to finish up with some background of living in another country, of having other parents, and this was called an “Internat.”</span> <span id="s80">Internat means, actually I think it is, I will explain it as a dormitory type living and you eat and you study.</span> <span id="s81">I graduated that a year later, 1939, I believe.</span> <span id="s82">Yes, 1939.</span> <span id="s83">At that time the Baltic Sea has been mined already by the Germans.</span> <span id="s84">And to go back was not the safest way.</span> <span id="s85">We did not have the means of air transportation that we have today.</span> <span id="s86">Where everything is by plane.</span> <span id="s87">You pick it up and in a few hours you are at your destination.</span> <span id="s88">Primarily over water was by boat and over land was by train.</span> <span id="s89">At that time, when I graduated, my father was on a business trip back from Holland to Memel, to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s90">He stopped off in Stockholm and I met with my father there and my father said to me that he would like for me to remain here.</span> <span id="s91">And I was very homesick and I said “Under no circumstances will I remain here.”</span> <span id="s92">And he said, “Dangerous moving.”</span> <span id="s93">No, I forgot to mention something.</span> <span id="s94">During the time when I was in Sweden, during that year, Memel was overrun by Hitler troops.</span> <span id="s95">And while I was in school, my parents were forced to flee, once again, to Kovno, which was the capitol of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s96">I intimated that ( words missing in original transcription) coming earlier, but…so now having mentioned that during the final school years, Memel was occupied by Germany, we had to leave once again and now my return home was not to Memel, where I left from, but it was to Kovno.</span> <span id="s97">Kovno is not a port, it is not on the water, so we had to get first to Riga.</span> <span id="s98">Riga is the capitol of Latvia.</span> <span id="s99">Latvia is part of the Baltic States.</span> <span id="s100">The Baltic States where history for geographical reasons, three – Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.</span> <span id="s101">Latvia has a port which is called Riga.</span> <span id="s102">So one has to get there in order to pick up a train and get over the border into the next country.</span> <span id="s103">However, my father tried everything under the sun to convince me not to join them back home.</span> <span id="s104">And I decided I will go.</span> <span id="s105">Silently, quietly, but not too quietly he arranged for me to continue sleeping in the hotel, while he leaves early in the morning for the port.</span> <span id="s106">And arranged with local friends, Swedish friends, to take me and settle me there.</span> <span id="s107">Well, this didn’t work because I didn’t sleep during the night .</span> <span id="s108">I knew that this was coming and of course I was on the boat with him going back and we were praying all the time on the ship that the ship should not blow up due to hitting a mine, which we knew were laid, but nobody can see.</span> <span id="s109">We made port of Riga, which is -- I don’t know exactly any more, but if I am correct it was a two-day crossing.</span> <span id="s110">.</span> <span id="s111">And we had now the communication.</span> <span id="s112">These days it was not what it is today, that you knew every minute of television what was going on, whether you are up in the air or below the water, wherever.</span> <span id="s113">We had no knowledge what is going on in the world until we landed and the only thing we found out when we landed is that there is nobody at pier side to pick anybody up.</span> <span id="s114">So no families -- nobody until we knew problem.</span> <span id="s115">And coming into town we had problems crossing the border from Latvia into Lithuania, because we knew there is a war going on.</span> <span id="s116">The war was breaking out.</span> <span id="s117">That was in 1938 or maybe ’39, I don’t remember now the year when it was.</span> <span id="s118">It was ’37 when I came to Sweden, so it could be ’38 or ’39.</span> <span id="s119">But, as you know, in 1939, where Hitler went into Poland and that was in September 1st of 1939.</span> <span id="s120">So we were right in the battlefront.</span> <span id="s121">We came back home, succeeded in getting back to Kovno, back to the family, my mother, my sister, grandparents, back home.</span> <span id="s122">It was still a normal life.</span> <span id="s123">The war started in September 1st with Poland.</span> <span id="s124">He ran into Warsaw quite quickly.</span> <span id="s125">But it stopped here and there.</span> <span id="s126">I went…I took a job in Kovno in order to prepare myself to be permitted to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s127">During these years, in America, everything was a quota system.</span> <span id="s128">And so many people were allowed from this country and so many people were allowed from that country.</span> <span id="s129">And our quota, being a small country, was very small, A lot of people wanted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: What made you want to go to America?</span> <span id="s131">Did you have family over here?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No.</span> <span id="s133">We had, yes, we had cousins and aunts, but really not parents or grandparents.</span> <span id="s134">But this was the country to go to.</span> <span id="s135">There were two countries to go to.</span> <span id="s136">It was either England or it was America.</span> <span id="s137">This is what we knew -- two countries.</span> <span id="s138">Then, in order to come to America, a lot easier, if one had a profession.</span> <span id="s139">At that time that was needed here, what was told us, if I could get anything like baking or confectionary work and so on.</span> <span id="s140">So, fine.</span> <span id="s141">So you went to the finest coffee house and my parents, of course, constantly or daily or on weekends, having your coffee in coffee house or your tea, your “kaffe klatch” in these places and you knew well each owner.</span> <span id="s142">So it was arranged that, for a slight nominal fee, instead of paying me, that my parents paid them to give me the necessary education, so I can get a piece of paper that says I am a confectioner, that I can make pies and cakes with decorations on top, something which is not too well known here.</span> <span id="s143">Because here the decorations are terrible.</span> <span id="s144">I criticize to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Ha-ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: You buy a beautiful cake with roses on top, but if you go in your back yard and you look at what a rose looks like and you look what a cabbage head looks like, you will find out that these are cabbage heads and not roses.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: (laughter).</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: But you wouldn’t see any more (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s149">Ah, I took this up.</span> <span id="s150">In the meantime, I also went to night school, evening school, to Lithuanian high school where they taught English and also I took English as a foreign language.</span> <span id="s151">I felt now that I should learn to see to pick up a little bit more the street language, so I should be able a little bit to converse if I do get to America and on that bench in school I met my wife who also took that up.</span> <span id="s152">I had met her once before, but it was not significant.</span> <span id="s153">Now it became significant.</span> <span id="s154">And that was, at that time, it was now life continued with us normal until 1941.</span> <span id="s155">In 1941, in 1940 already, it became the battleground.</span> <span id="s156">That means the Germans marched into Kovno, the Russians came back and threw out the Germans.</span> <span id="s157">And this went on twice, back and forth.</span> <span id="s158">It was a battleground that means today you are a German, tomorrow you are a Russian.</span> <span id="s159">There’s two ways, both ways, that the Jews had to suffer.</span> <span id="s160">From the Germans we know that the Jew was suffering because he was born to the Jewish religion and this was his crime.</span> <span id="s161">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s162">The Russians did not show open anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s163">Also we do know that anti-Semitism exists.</span> <span id="s164">But the Russians went again for the rich people because the rich people are the ones who are anti-Communist.</span> <span id="s165">If you have money, you cannot be a Communist and if you are a Communist, you cannot have money.</span> <span id="s166">So it is not…it is needless to say that a lot of Jewish people have been very well–to-do.</span> <span id="s167">So these were automatically the enemies of the country the moment they marched in.</span> <span id="s168">My family was one of them.</span> <span id="s169">So my father hidden out in a basement of a butcher shop in the freezer, because that was thought to be more or less safe.</span> <span id="s170">Why, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s171">It was safe.</span> <span id="s172">I again, ah, thought that I could become a proletarian by putting on leather boots, leather coat, you know, as you would today like the motorcycle gang.</span> <span id="s173">You know, become a gang guy, gang-looking guy…</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: And I got away with it.</span> <span id="s176">You know, I marched down to the captain.</span> <span id="s177">After all, I haven’t done anything wrong.</span> <span id="s178">So I wasn’t bothered.</span> <span id="s179">That time the wave went away and, uh, normal life began as Russian citizens automatically.</span> <span id="s180">All of a sudden, we were Russian citizens and for a moment you were happy about it, because we didn’t have to be anymore stateless.</span> <span id="s181">That was personal.</span> <span id="s182">All of a sudden, automatically, you had a passport in your pocket.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Automatically you had a passport in your pocket, so at least you were somebody.</span> <span id="s185">Really nobody, but still it felt like somebody.</span> <span id="s186">Also, we take it for granted in this country, well, the passport is due to me.</span> <span id="s187">The passport is mine.</span> <span id="s188">Big deal, I got one.</span> <span id="s189">Sure I was born and raised here.</span> <span id="s190">Don’t take it for granted.</span> <span id="s191">Be proud that you have it.</span> <span id="s192">It’s a very important part of your life.</span> <span id="s193">You cannot live without a heart and you cannot live very much without a passport, if you want to get along.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: We don’t realize that.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: We don’t realize that and therefore I want -- I know it from experience, I know, I want to emphasize that don’t take it lightly.</span> <span id="s196">Have one, it costs only a few dollars.</span> <span id="s197">It’s yours for the asking.</span> <span id="s198">Ah, we lived under the Russians, of course.</span> <span id="s199">If you had a home or an apartment, as you used to, you know, so many bedrooms and comfort and maids and servants and what was normal life to us, all of a sudden disappeared.</span> <span id="s200">All of a sudden it came decrees that a family of four is allowed to live in so many square feet and I don’t know exactly how many square feet any more, but so many square feet as we were the four of ‘em was just about the size of one bedroom.</span> <span id="s201">So, if the apartment consisted of six, seven rooms, the other five rooms or six rooms were automatically occupied by other families.</span> <span id="s202">So you didn’t have to put an ad in the paper and say I got five rooms for rent.</span> <span id="s203">The five rooms were confiscated and overtaken immediately.</span> <span id="s204">So this was something that we didn’t like, but it still didn’t mean life and death.</span> <span id="s205">Ah, we continued living this abnormal life until, until June, no that was in 1940, ’41.</span> <span id="s206">At that time, the Germans came back again -- pushed the Russians out and now started the game over again.</span> <span id="s207">Now we became again the Jews who were not wanted.</span> <span id="s208">And, of course, the Germans prepared, ah, an area of Kovno for the ghetto to put in all the Jews.</span> <span id="s209">The ghetto was established in a suburb of Kovno which is called Slabotka.</span> <span id="s210">Slabotka is very well known in Jewish religious circles, worldly, because was a most famous Yeshiva, a school of higher learning, world renown.</span> <span id="s211">The orthodox people were studying and living in Slabotka.</span> <span id="s212">So this was convenient for the Germans to take over, since this was primarily Jewish, so all they had to do was put a wire fence around it and that’s it and whoever doesn’t live there, of course, they herded in.</span> <span id="s213">And one of ‘em was, of course our family.</span> <span id="s214">Now we did -- we had time.</span> <span id="s215">Yet there was a certain day when that was to be closed.</span> <span id="s216">We were already instructed to wear yellow stars indicating to the public that whoever wore a yellow star is a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Uh, Jews had to wear that, but they were still free to walk the streets.</span> <span id="s218">Of course you were free to walk the streets, but you were not safe from being molested or being hit by stones or nasty remarks, such as “Dirty Jews” and things of that sort.</span> <span id="s219">I, having been a German-born Jew, have the German language as a mother tongue, spoke the German with a dialect, having had blue eyes and my name being Manfred Zemon had no problem of walking the streets without the yellow star and I did so.</span> <span id="s220">Until one day, I remember some post office workers sitting on the stoop of the post office during lunch hour, and I happened to walk by, somebody made the remark, “This looks like a dirty Jew.”</span> <span id="s221">But I stood up, I stopped immediately, being insulted, and I walked up and let him have it, “How dare they calling me that name?”</span> <span id="s222">and continued on my way and I wasn’t further molested, until we had to enter the Kovno ghetto, which it was known, and that began in June 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: You were 18?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: I was 18 years old, barely – I was 17, 18 years old, yeh.</span> <span id="s225">In 1941, uh, the gates to the ghettos were closed and, of course, this was a completely new life, living, life style.</span> <span id="s226">We had organized by the Germans a Jewish government, as you would call it today, without --meaningless, actually.</span> <span id="s227">We had a head of the ghetto, an elder Jew, an elder Yehuda, who was called the president.</span> <span id="s228">I recall his name was Dr. Elkes, a medical man, a very fine man.</span> <span id="s229">And then there was a Judenrat, which is -- which is, I would say a governing body of that ghetto…</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: …as a representative…</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: …a representative for various departments, you know; little schooling for kids and a little security.</span> <span id="s232">Then we had a police force.</span> <span id="s233">The Jewish police force, of course, there were no clubs, there were no pistols, there were no rifles.</span> <span id="s234">There was a hat, a uniform hat, and an armband that indicated that he was a policeman -- beware.</span> <span id="s235">The power over the inhabitants…</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: …of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Of the ghetto, which was an irony in itself, you know.</span> <span id="s238">I mean what do you expect one Jew to beat the other one?</span> <span id="s239">But we were controlled by the German police, who walked and controlled the ghetto from the outside with dogs, with rifles, with pistols, with electricity.</span> <span id="s240">So we were nothing but walking targets.</span> <span id="s241">But we tried to live as normal a life as we could.</span> <span id="s242">The population was recruited to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: How many of them were you in this ghetto approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s245">I don’t want to give you a figure.</span> <span id="s246">Whatever figure I give you would be more than guessing.</span> <span id="s247">I should know, but I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: It’s all right, not important.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Uh, the work force consisted for, for domestic, where there was some little manufacturing done for the Germans.</span> <span id="s250">Primarily people were marched out every day from the ghetto into the cities, into factories.</span> <span id="s251">The factories were paying the Germans for the labor, not to us.</span> <span id="s252">Uh, they were moved out in groups which were called “Colona” and then there was a Colona Fuehrer, which is called the leader, the head of it, who was a Jew, and the moment you left that fence, that gate, of course you had German guards left and right, rifles that are ready to shoot.</span> <span id="s253">We were walking primarily in not the finest shoes, not the best walking shoes.</span> <span id="s254">I remember having walked in wooden shoes which were called “klumpus”.</span> <span id="s255">This is just a slang expression, I suppose.</span> <span id="s256">And so you know these wooden shoes, primarily the Dutch wear them.</span> <span id="s257">They weren’t as nicely decorated, but this is, in essence, what they wear and it isn’t easy to walk and and to live in these shoes, uh, if you’re not used to it.</span> <span id="s258">And we were not used to it.</span> <span id="s259">I personally worked in a work brigade building an airport.</span> <span id="s260">Slave labor, hard work and the minimum of food, minimum, uh, toilet facilities were very restricted.</span> <span id="s261">We did not know any more what a bathroom was, or toilet.</span> <span id="s262">But we did know, we learned to know what a latrine is.</span> <span id="s263">And this is actually what was available to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Did this work force include women also?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Everyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s268">The work force, the women, however, were primarily left in the ghettos and they did their work in the ghettos that had to be done in ghettos.</span> <span id="s269">And of course the ghettos was part of the city.</span> <span id="s270">It was a big area of land and houses, uh, so it took…women were doing also homework.</span> <span id="s271">But if you were not capable of being on a work force, uh, it was not, it didn’t speak we for you.</span> <span id="s272">Because actually, what do we need you for, because the German always said “We feed you.”</span> <span id="s273">Well the feeding, I must admit, uh, we have been, if we have been out in the city, we were trying individually to promote our survival and I remember the little while I had a whole business running.</span> <span id="s274">I came (laughter) -- it’s true -- I came every night and people came to me and I would take from them tablecloths, linen, uh, bed sheets and I would wrap this around my body and next day march out with the force to work and somehow over the time, we made contact with the farmers or whatever it was close to us and they would bring us bacons, butter, bread, and then we had the job to smuggle that stuff in.</span> <span id="s275">And this is not easy to smuggle in.</span> <span id="s276">It is the same way as when you come through Customs.</span> <span id="s277">The only thing is you’re here.</span> <span id="s278">They’re not very kind and nice, say what you please, open your bag up.</span> <span id="s279">There they go with the bayonet right through you, you see.</span> <span id="s280">And if they stuck you point blank and you had flour around your back and they were put in like a corset, well everything ran out there.</span> <span id="s281">And if it happened to be a mistake, so the blood came out instead of the flour.</span> <span id="s282">Not a big thing; normal at that time.</span> <span id="s283">The life in the ghetto was abnormal.</span> <span id="s284">We had immediately -- I would say six months after coming into the ghetto, we had the first pogrom, I would call it, if this is a word that is better known.</span> <span id="s285">In Russian it’s called an “ablava,’ which is a surprise…</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Raid?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Raid -- thank you.</span> <span id="s288">Uh, we were told that they need five hundred of the most intellectual people for special purposes, which is course, to benefit us.</span> <span id="s289">We would not have to work in the fields or building airports or in heat and cold and weather.</span> <span id="s290">We would have work that would go together with our education, with our brains.</span> <span id="s291">Now, of course, everybody would have loved to be considered the most intelligent one.</span> <span id="s292">Well, people assembled and I remember exactly where, but the location wouldn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s293">On a school yard, schoolhouses, in back of us and lined up like you would line up 500 soldiers for attention, standing at attention.</span> <span id="s294">And I was among them.</span> <span id="s295">And so was a young boy.</span> <span id="s296">Somehow, I think that our common senses, the common sense is something that we did have, something that we do not see today much at all anymore.</span> <span id="s297">Because nothing is being done today anymore that I can see, by common sense.</span> <span id="s298">But everything is being done today by seminars, tapes, my making actually recording machines out of us, to repeat what we have heard just now and we cannot deviate, because it wasn’t on the tape.</span> <span id="s299">So, therefore, our common sense doesn’t exist any more or has been taken from us.</span> <span id="s300">It’s killed.</span> <span id="s301">We were different.</span> <span id="s302">In those days, it was a matter of survival and it was a matter of not making mistakes.</span> <span id="s303">If you made a mistake, there was only one you could make and the second one you had no chance anymore.</span> <span id="s304">I stood in line and somehow, something told me this does not smell very good.</span> <span id="s305">I had nothing really to indicate to me that it was so.</span> <span id="s306">But I decided to fall out, to disappear, which wasn’t easy either anymore, because at that moment they were counting -- 1, 2.</span> <span id="s307">3 -- so I was one of the 500.</span> <span id="s308">And you cannot just fall out and then all of a sudden there’s 499, because you take a chance that they’ll wipe out the whole 499, if they don’t produce the 500, or if there’s more.</span> <span id="s309">I decided to get -- fall back, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">I went into a school building, or like a school barrack which was in back of me, straight in back of me, against the wall.</span> <span id="s311">There was an opening and I went into a locker and just put myself straight into the locker and stayed there for a little while and they marched ‘em out -- the 500.</span> <span id="s312">I stayed there for hours.</span> <span id="s313">Nobody was there anymore.</span> <span id="s314">I must admit that I was a bit shaky…</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: I guess…</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Didn’t know did I do right, didn’t know did I do wrong, didn’t know what’s all about it.</span> <span id="s317">But I could have made very easily a mistake and said, “Well, this is my chance and I threw it away.”</span> <span id="s318">It was not.</span> <span id="s319">The 500 have never been seen or heard of, not a one of ‘em.</span> <span id="s320">They went straight to the seventh fort, which is a fort – is a…</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: A fort as we know it?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Oh, all right; I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: It’s, it’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: An encampment, of soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yes it, that was where they were taken and they were shot, point blank.</span> <span id="s327">The reason for that was very simple.</span> <span id="s328">If you take away the highest intellect, then the body is worthless.</span> <span id="s329">And this was the purpose of the German.</span> <span id="s330">Cut ‘em off from their brains and the rest of the body we can move around.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Did you know that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s333">If you knew at the time, you wouldn’t have 500 people, you would have 200.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: No, no, I mean did you know directly after?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: We knew shortly thereafter what it was.</span> <span id="s336">Of course we were looking.</span> <span id="s337">We were very happy for the 500 that they had secured themselves, that the ghetto itself, the people, inhabitants, the family, were very happy whoever went and the others, of course were very disappointed that they were not part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Ah, after a little while the length of time, we found out the disaster that all of them have been killed, cold-blooded and, of course we were elated -- my family were elated that it worked out this way for me.</span> <span id="s339">At that time, already, as a young fellow, I got a feeling that, if God has spared me this time, I think I’ll make it for other times, too.</span> <span id="s340">He’ll be with me now.</span> <span id="s341">And I guess He was, because I’m here to tell the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Thereafter, work, hard labor, little food, little more food for people who were able to organize food.</span> <span id="s343">Some families had it better, some families had it worse.</span> <span id="s344">Uh, pogroms were always were something there.</span> <span id="s345">The next case were older people, where they brought us again into a big market place.</span> <span id="s346">And again, it was right and left.</span> <span id="s347">We didn’t know whether you were…whether the right was good or whether the left was the good or the bad.</span> <span id="s348">So it was really no reason for you to push yourself, I want to go here, I want to go there.</span> <span id="s349">Because you really didn’t know where you push.</span> <span id="s350">You only knew that after, whether it was right or was wrong.</span> <span id="s351">Whoever went the wrong way or was directed to the left which was the wrong way, that was the one who has never been seen anymore.</span> <span id="s352">They primarily were elderly people, sick people, crippled people.</span> <span id="s353">Uh, healthy, able bodied -- bodies, uh, were the ones which they still kept because the Germans made their living, their money, with slave labor.</span> <span id="s354">That’s what we were.</span> <span id="s355">We were slave labors paid by the individual contractor, builders, farmers, or whatever needed labor.</span> <span id="s356">It was paid to the government -- whatever the going price it was, not to us.</span> <span id="s357">So, some good came out of it.</span> <span id="s358">Besides that, we were very good for cannon powder, also.</span> <span id="s359">Uh, these people were always taken to the forts.</span> <span id="s360">Forts we had around the Kovno, some mountains around and that’s where these…I’m looking for the English word for the translation of…the actual translation of a fort.</span> <span id="s361">It doesn’t come to me because at this moment, I guess, my mind is thinking a little bit back again in the German language, which I never do.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: It will come to you in a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: I have to transfer now back into German and back into English.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s365">Where was your sister all this time?</span> <span id="s366">Was she doing the same thing you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Yeah, my sister was --we were together -- my father, my mother, my sister and I. Uh, I was dating at the time, my wife.</span> <span id="s368">I married my wife in 1944, in the same ghetto I’m speaking about, secretly Uh, we did have a rabbi.</span> <span id="s369">He chased us, I remember, seven times around the table.</span> <span id="s370">And I guess that this was all that was necessary.</span> <span id="s371">That’s about all I remember and of course, there was no presence of -- presence of parents and a few witnesses only, because everything was extremely secretive and it really didn’t mean that much because it’s just the opposite of what’s today.</span> <span id="s372">Today it’s free living where we can live together and nobody says anything without having a marriage vow.</span> <span id="s373">At that time, it was impossible to move together with a marriage vow.</span> <span id="s374">So it is just the other way around, because this would be against the likings of the Germans.</span> <span id="s375">Uh, the ghetto Kovno was…became part of the concentration camp Dachau in 1943, I believe.</span> <span id="s376">Nothing that has changed really, but we fell in under the jurisdiction of a concentration camp instead of being called a ghetto -- really, what the difference is?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: You were still living in houses though?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Oh, we were still living behind barbed wire.</span> <span id="s379">Yes, sure we were.</span> <span id="s380">Ah, but we were still…the difference was that we still had our own clothes to wear, you see.</span> <span id="s381">We were not in uniforms or…uh, so the world can see what we look like in striped clothing and etc., and other things, marked, numbered.</span> <span id="s382">Uh…we were still, uh…we still had our names.</span> <span id="s383">Our identification was still the name, not the serial number, as it became in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Uh, in 19--…in 1944, on March 28th, I happened to remember that day so well because this was the birthday of my father, alavasholem.</span> <span id="s385">My father was a very orthodox and a very pious Jew.</span> <span id="s386">My father has daily put his tefillim on.</span> <span id="s387">I think the English word for that is -- help me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Phylacteries.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Yes, I would have said, of course the wrong word and that’s why I asked you to help me out.</span> <span id="s390">I had something else in mind.</span> <span id="s391">But, I’ll tell you that later when the tape is off.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: (Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Had every morning his tallis on and did every single day, three times a day, did duties that he has known and the duties and that he has taught his children, myself.</span> <span id="s394">So, to me, he was the teacher, the father, holiness in itself.</span> <span id="s395">I have worked in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s396">First on the airport, then through some assistance, as we called protection --in Jewish, as we call it, “ protectia”.</span> <span id="s397">It was a very famous word and God bless the guy who had that protectia.</span> <span id="s398">He needed it; otherwise it was tough.</span> <span id="s399">I became a Jewish policeman.</span> <span id="s400">Not too well liked.</span> <span id="s401">Jewish, the name…to be a member of the Jewish police force -- it wasn’t very favorable to speak about it after the liberation, but I never was concerned to talk about it, because I knew I wasn’t involved with anything and I didn’t do anything for my benefit while I was hurting the other parties.</span> <span id="s402">So, I have gone with a high head immediately after liberation to this day.</span> <span id="s403">Never was afraid to mention that I was a policeman.</span> <span id="s404">Uh, most of the policeman have never mentioned that thereafter.</span> <span id="s405">I don’t blame them either.</span> <span id="s406">Because they weren’t too nice off.</span> <span id="s407">Uh, after that, being a policeman, my father-in-law… yes, at that time I was already married so my father-in-law was working for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s408">The Gestapo is the…the ones who do not know what it is today -- was the police -- the police force of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s409">I guess that is the way I would interpret it.</span> <span id="s410">Uh, he worked for them.</span> <span id="s411">They had about 10 Jews whom they picked up every day and brought back to the headquarters in the city and they had…uh…these 10 Jews were there to clean the cars, do butler service, maid service.</span> <span id="s412">They were their personal guides and, of course, they picked what they liked and they had a better position than the rest of us, because they were closer to a kitchen, you know.</span> <span id="s413">They…ah…maybe threw them a bone that was not eaten up.</span> <span id="s414">All the meat wasn’t eaten off.</span> <span id="s415">So, it was nicer and you were protected a bit from the elements, from weather.</span> <span id="s416">So, my father-in-law succeeded…no, yes…and one day he came back and he says, “On this and that date in the coming week there’s going to be another pogrom.”</span> <span id="s417">He knew it because he worked in the garage part and they had to paint up the glass --the windows of the buses.</span> <span id="s418">So we knew this is for us because the public should not be able to see what’s being hauled away.</span> <span id="s419">So, what he did is, he said, “I’ll take you all on this day with me to work.</span> <span id="s420">I have arranged it with this big shot and that big shot that I can bring you along.”</span> <span id="s421">So he got me.</span> <span id="s422">He had my wife, his family, my mother, my sister and we could not arrange to get my father on that bus.</span> <span id="s423">We couldn’t get him on the bus and we tried everything under the sun that was possible.</span> <span id="s424">But somehow it just didn’t work.</span> <span id="s425">Thinking of him all day long…didn’t know what was happening, didn’t know that there was anything happening.</span> <span id="s426">We knew.</span> <span id="s427">We saw it and when we came back at night into the ghetto from work, we have seen a total destruction.</span> <span id="s428">And, of course, what happened was exactly --they mowed them down with machine guns.</span> <span id="s429">They…uh…hauled them away to the forts again and there was no recourse of questioning, “What happened?</span> <span id="s430">Where did it happen?</span> <span id="s431">Where did they go?</span> <span id="s432">What did you do?</span> <span id="s433">Uh…or is there police force or is there court or is there a judge or…no such thing.”</span> <span id="s434">We were worse off than any animal because an animal has a protection yet.</span> <span id="s435">We had none so, of course, when we came back and I ran with my mother to the house we lived, from the bus, and there was no more Papa.</span> <span id="s436">My father, the pious man, the holy man, while standing towards the east, where he said the Shmona Essa -- we know this as a fact--with his tallis and his tefillim on, undisturbed, because you don’t move when you say the Shmona Essa.</span> <span id="s437">We didn’t live by the comfort that we are trying to have today in our Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s438">They have plucked the bullet straight into his head with praying to the God.</span> <span id="s439">That was the man -- the thing in our life --that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s440">At that time, Hitler gave a speech, that same day, and he ended the speech -- and I remember that -- with these words, “God is with us.’</span> <span id="s441">And when he said that, and I was a young man of 20 years of age, I took my belief…I wore tzitsis.</span> <span id="s442">For those who don’t know what it is, find out what it is.</span> <span id="s443">Uh…I took them off and never worn them since.</span> <span id="s444">I’m not any more orthodox, but I know what I’ve learned.</span> <span id="s445">I have also been, during my younger days, for a short time, a yeshiva bocher in a Telsa Yeshiva in Telsh, Lithuania.</span> <span id="s446">That is not in Ohio -- that is in Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">We have been now in the ghetto until -- I should remember the date in 1944, but it…</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: What, approximately a month after?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Yah…I don’t remember now -- it was sometime in ’44.</span> <span id="s450">Yet, you asked me questions… questions, but you have to remember this is 42 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: …and, I mean…the date…</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Well, about, about.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Don’t hold me, because I don’t want to put questions into anybody’s mind, that he was wrong with a month here.</span> <span id="s455">He said this month…So, I better not, because I don’t remember it actually and time may be of importance, the month, but since I don’t remember it exactly, I want to hold off.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: But if it is important, I can find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: It is not important.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: People are still alive who will remember that.</span> <span id="s460">Not many of them are as young as we, however.</span> <span id="s461">.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: You’re right, you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I am in contact, by the way, uh…I’ll tell you that later.</span> <span id="s464">The, uh…in 1944, the ghetto was to be liquidated and the Jews herded onto one place for transportation to the unknown.</span> <span id="s465">Could have been to the death camps, could have been to the forts, to oblivion.</span> <span id="s466">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s467">Didn’t know which way it was.</span> <span id="s468">We were all assembled and we were still many a thousands up there on this one big open field and the last memory that I have from that ghetto is where my uncle, a medical doctor, Dr. Jacob Burstein and his wife decided that it was not for them any more and right there and then he had one portion -- if that is the right expression of poison or capsule which would be sufficient for one person but it didn’t work on two.</span> <span id="s469">So, of course they were both going wild -- running around.</span> <span id="s470">There were plenty of doctors there who tried to…his colleagues…to tried to help subdue, calm, use whatever they had, didn’t succeed with them.</span> <span id="s471">He was going now wild being under the effect.</span> <span id="s472">Both of them were going in circles and the German put him very quick out of his miseries by shooting him in front of all of us.</span> <span id="s473">This is the last that I remember.</span> <span id="s474">His wife, however, allowed to be helped and she survived in camps and came back to the Baltic States, to Latvia, remarried and died a normal death.</span> <span id="s475">I have been in touch with her, have helped her, have sent packages.</span> <span id="s476">My mother helped her and, so, she lived a miserable life.</span> <span id="s477">She married a Communist officer.</span> <span id="s478">I don’t know how she fell into that and had children by him.</span> <span id="s479">We never seen her again but we knew when she died and she died a normal death.</span> <span id="s480">We came from there – women, lock, stock and barrel as you would call women, children and men, that’s lock, stock and barrel that’s what we owned.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: That’s it, nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Nothing else.</span> <span id="s483">Uh…in uh…um animal, animal…cows see uh, how do you transport cows in these wagons and trains ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Oh, oh, cattle trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Cattle trains, yes, simple word, thanks for helping me.</span> <span id="s486">Uh cattle trains, taking out until we came.</span> <span id="s487">Of course, food was non – existent.</span> <span id="s488">Bathrooms were non – existent.</span> <span id="s489">So we ate there.</span> <span id="s490">We slept there.</span> <span id="s491">We made there and all in the one enclosure – men, women, children.</span> <span id="s492">The worst thing that the Germans maybe have done or very bad part is that they succeeded immediately to take away our pride because we happen to be very proud people.</span> <span id="s493">And when you take away from us cleanliness and when you take away from us the identity, then it’s already somewhat a lot of us that have been killed in this way.</span> <span id="s494">So this was taken away and we came to a hm uh hm train stop in Germany that was called Stutthof, a city where the women have been unloaded and we didn’t know what this was, where this was, or what happened to them.</span> <span id="s495">They got off and the men continued.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Did that include your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: That included my wife.</span> <span id="s498">That included my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: And your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: And included my sister.</span> <span id="s501">It included my mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s502">That included all the female members of the family.</span> <span id="s503">At that moment, there was an aunt of my wife’s with a little cousin of hers who was some years younger.</span> <span id="s504">You have to remember when I say little that means, if I’m 20 years old, then I’m already an old man at the time you see so the kid is 15 years old.</span> <span id="s505">I’d say it’s a kid, too, looking back today.</span> <span id="s506">Uh and mother, the aunt of my wife, the mother of this cousin of this boy said to me “Manfred, whatever happens (his name was Lola).</span> <span id="s507">She says Lola is your child.</span> <span id="s508">You become a father now.</span> <span id="s509">I put him in your hands.”</span> <span id="s510">This was the greatest burden that I remember ever befell me, because, literally, I have never forgotten that and I have done what she told me and it was a terrible job for me because I could not return that boy to her alive.</span> <span id="s511">She was alive after the war.</span> <span id="s512">I could not face that woman, anymore.</span> <span id="s513">I did, I was -- she came to see me and I tried to avoid her because I just didn’t know how to tell a mother that I did not succeed.</span> <span id="s514">The men continued for days in these cattle cars.</span> <span id="s515">Our end station was Dachau and we came into these various camps which are called lagas and they had laga 1 and laga 2 and laga 3 and each one was worse than the other one.</span> <span id="s516">This was the Hungarians, this was the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s517">This was the sick…uh part- so- called hospital.</span> <span id="s518">I suppose if one can ever connect it with a hospital.</span> <span id="s519">I don’t know, but that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s520">And, this is where it started all over again.</span> <span id="s521">Now there were no more -- your clothes were taken away.</span> <span id="s522">You were landed on a field again there.</span> <span id="s523">You were x-rayed by human eyes standing split-naked, marching around the street.</span> <span id="s524">You were x-rayed to the extent whether you had God forbid succeeded in smuggling a piece of jewelry or some money or whatnot.</span> <span id="s525">I remember, on this field, standing around waiting your turn and they were actually going with their fingers, bare fingers, right up your rectum, mouth, anything, any cavity that your body had was checked through and I remember, being a youngster, some elderly people and including the Doctor Elkins who came to me with a bundle of money, and somehow they smuggled it around all the time and says “take it” and I said “No, No” no, no, no, I said “I’m not going to be killed for that.</span> <span id="s526">I’ll be killed but I don’t have to do that because you can’t get away with it.”</span> <span id="s527">So, these are memories that are linked that I remember and…um…we started the…Dachau, of course, uh…I don’t think there’s anything that the world doesn’t know about Dachau by this time 40 years later today…uh…I was first personally in the place called Lunsberg which is a city in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s528">By the way Dachau is in the Bavarian part of Germany.</span> <span id="s529">Lunsberg prison where we were sitting for a few days turned out later after the war the place where Hitler was sitting and Hitler wrote his book “Mein Kampf’ in the same cell block that I was sitting in, not that it was of any significant to me nor did I know that he was sitting in there but I learned that after the war…uh…that this was where I was in.</span> <span id="s530">Well, I would rather have been in a room where it said George Washington slept here but it worked out a little different.</span> <span id="s531">Uh, hard labor, insecure, sickness, diseases, hunger, exposure to the point, personally, where, as strong as I was, I finally faltered.</span> <span id="s532">I guess the years have taken…it’s now 4 years, practically uh…from a strong fellow…uh…it got to me and I had swollen legs, swollen body, swollen was from hunger, also you don’t know any more, you don’t feel anything any more, yourself, because actually you’re not a human being any more.</span> <span id="s533">Un…lice…lice that infested my skin, and to this date, I can take my shirt off and people will ask me “Was that an operation?”</span> <span id="s534">and I will say “No, these are lice.”</span> <span id="s535">I have it on my leg.</span> <span id="s536">I have it on my belly.</span> <span id="s537">You just think it was another little skin graft or something…operation.</span> <span id="s538">Normal lice…lice entered who entered any wounds that you had and they were breeding in the wounds and there was no…uh…medication or anybody to attend to the wounds so they had a good time and your clothing or the sweater, what little piece that you had, was, of course, infested with lice and, in order to kill lice, we had these iron stoves at night going on you know for to keep a little warm so you would take your sweater for example or whatever you had on and you would put it against the hot stove and you would hear the machine gun sounds br bu br bu (ah) the heat, the fire knocked them open, do you follow?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Of course!</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Th tu ch ch, so this was another way of entertaining and getting rid of them.</span> <span id="s541">I was finally put into the sick quarters.</span> <span id="s542">It was called the revere and you were lying on…on boards, not beds.</span> <span id="s543">But, you know, like one plank going across for 30 or 40 feet and bodies were lying there and blankets were on top of them.</span> <span id="s544">And I don’t know, once a day or so, somebody brought some soup in there, I guess.</span> <span id="s545">It was called soup but I guess it was nothing but hot water or maybe drinking water or whatever.</span> <span id="s546">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s547">At that time came through an elderly person to me.</span> <span id="s548">At that time I guess he was younger then than I am today but, being 20, he was an elderly person to me.</span> <span id="s549">His name was Elias Friedman and he stopped in front of me -- among all these people he came through he was working in the kitchen and he looked at me and said “Burstein, Burstein” or “Bushstein” was my mother’s maiden name and my grandfather worked for this Mr. Friedman, who had a flour mill and he knew me as a little boy because the family was close and he recognized me and he didn’t know my name.</span> <span id="s550">but he knew “Burstein” and he said “Burstein” and I with the little strength that was in me shook my neck, lying down, and he sent two fellows who were a little better off than I, and they carried me -- literally carried me -- put their hands underneath my rear end -- I put my arms around their shoulders and they carried me off into the kitchen where he instructed the kitchen people to put thick soup into my canister instead of the water and he did that every day.</span> <span id="s551">I could not walk there.</span> <span id="s552">I had no legs to walk on anymore, and he brought me back this way.</span> <span id="s553">He just nourished me back.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: How did he obtain such an exalted position?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Well, it’s the same thing, how people will say well how did he attain to be that day in the…</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: …in the Gestapo when everybody else was wiped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: It is somehow due to age or maybe due to his German background he was also German background.</span> <span id="s560">The German liked him better because he was one of theirs.</span> <span id="s561">Who knows, you know, there is a Jewish word that’s called “chein”.</span> <span id="s562">I don’t know whether you are familiar with that.</span> <span id="s563">And so, somebody had “chein” or he had “chein” with somebody and you liked the man and that’s all what I mean.</span> <span id="s564">You, know, so you picked him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Surely.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Maybe he was a little cleaner than the other one.</span> <span id="s567">He says, “Well, this is a Jew bastard but at least he’s a little cleaner Jew bastard than the other one.”</span> <span id="s568">Whatever, we don’t know and that brought me back onto my feet and I was able to continue.</span> <span id="s569">In the meantime, my father-in-law, who was with me and that little nephew, that little boy, he and my father-in-law became sick.</span> <span id="s570">He got ah gangrene and was taken away from this camp, in another camp where he died.</span> <span id="s571">And now came the end…to a closer…toward the end of the war.</span> <span id="s572">The reason we knew it came closer to the end of the war because we had not newspapers, radios, televisions or any communication with anybody -- was because we started seeing more planes.</span> <span id="s573">We started seeing some…we heard some bombs…we heard some explosions.</span> <span id="s574">Uh, we knew.</span> <span id="s575">Ah, something is happening in the vicinity.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: And it gave you hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Within your reach.</span> <span id="s578">Hope, well hope is something that is part of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s579">A Jew has never been able to succeed, to live without hope.</span> <span id="s580">This is our heritage.</span> <span id="s581">You will hear us say very often when questions are asked.</span> <span id="s582">“Will you be there?</span> <span id="s583">Will you come?</span> <span id="s584">Can I count on you?”</span> <span id="s585">The answer normally is “With God’s help.”</span> <span id="s586">You see and this is all.</span> <span id="s587">I hope I’ll be around.</span> <span id="s588">I surely will be there.</span> <span id="s589">But it’s always hope.</span> <span id="s590">So as long as he had hope we went, but if you would have asked me point blank at that time, uh…”Will you make it?’</span> <span id="s591">Well, the answer would be very simple, very quick.</span> <span id="s592">None of us will make it.</span> <span id="s593">None of us.</span> <span id="s594">There was no way of making to come out of there.</span> <span id="s595">Some of them lasted longer.</span> <span id="s596">The ones who fell at the wayside were the big husky men -- the ones you would think, you would think are the shtarker, the strong ones oh.</span> <span id="s597">They got something to go by now.</span> <span id="s598">The skinny one, the frail looking one.</span> <span id="s599">He was the one that was much stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Wiry?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Wiry uh uh the sick person, of course, didn’t have any chances because he was useless to the Germans.</span> <span id="s602">Uh…it came to the point where American troops came closer and it came to the point where we were they decided to evacuate us.</span> <span id="s603">So, they put children, if there were still…by this time they were already not…I mean they were not small children, young, youngsters on the train.</span> <span id="s604">Again the cattle cars, into nowhere.</span> <span id="s605">No destination.</span> <span id="s606">Just go whichever way the bomb is not flying or uh and us, they started on a march.</span> <span id="s607">Well, we marched, I think 8 or 7 days, and we found out at the end that we really marched in a circle.</span> <span id="s608">We were still at the same place but we marched all the time because the Americans or the allies were bombing.</span> <span id="s609">It was always circular.</span> <span id="s610">So, when they took us north, it came from north.</span> <span id="s611">So, they turned us east and we went to east and west and so we went.</span> <span id="s612">.</span> <span id="s613">The end result was, you know, constantly circles.</span> <span id="s614">The trail had been bombed.</span> <span id="s615">People in the train were dead.</span> <span id="s616">One of them was the young cousin of my wife who was killed actually by the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Nobody can is blaming anybody but he was killed by the Americans.</span> <span id="s619">American bomb has bombed that train.</span> <span id="s620">Of course, they didn’t know what was on the train.</span> <span id="s621">We were back again in Alach, which is just in the same vicinity as Dachau.</span> <span id="s622">Also, concentration camp, barbed wires.</span> <span id="s623">When the Americans came and the only reason we knew now that the end is there, was because all of a sudden we had no more German guarding us.</span> <span id="s624">We had the barbed wires about us but nobody would make a move , you know.</span> <span id="s625">But, of course, it was suspicious -- the whole thing and we knew that’s it.</span> <span id="s626">The first truckloads of soldiers, coming in to look at us were colored troops, black troops, black soldiers, or Negroes, if you want, whichever is the right word today.</span> <span id="s627">And I must admit since I have never in my life seen a black person, I know I’ve seen them in bunches that I have said “now comes the Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s628">Because to see an army of black was unknown to us.</span> <span id="s629">We didn’t know…we didn’t know these people, once in awhile we have seen a person.</span> <span id="s630">My wife says she has seen once a black person in the circus but I don’t recall ever having seen a black person nor did we know what black people are.</span> <span id="s631">So to us, this was very strange and scary.</span> <span id="s632">But it turned out that they were the best-hearted, friendliest, concerned.</span> <span id="s633">They came by in open trucks and we stood behind the barbed wire, electricity was cut off evidently, and they threw overboard the personal belongings, whatever they had, chewing gum, cigarettes, pencils, pens, uh…whatever was in their pocket came over the fence and all concerned…uh…some of them had tears in their eyes.</span> <span id="s634">I mean what we have seen in them they have seen in us.</span> <span id="s635">They didn’t know what -- what this looks like.</span> <span id="s636">We didn’t know what they looked like because we didn’t look like normal people.</span> <span id="s637">We were swollen.</span> <span id="s638">We were skinny.</span> <span id="s639">We were hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Were you still in the hospital at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No, no, no, no, I was marching.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Oh, that’s right, you were marching around.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I was back on my feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: We were liberated and…uh…the end wasn’t…this was not…we didn’t suffer enough yet.</span> <span id="s646">We were quarantined because we…the camp came down with typhus.</span> <span id="s647">So our liberation wasn’t there…back in there, so if you didn’t die one way, we died the other way.</span> <span id="s648">And from that typhus camp which was strictly watched by the Americans not to get out for reasons of not carrying on with it.</span> <span id="s649">I escaped through barbed wire, through machine gun fire by the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: MM.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Because I didn’t have typhus and I certainly didn’t want it this time, because there was no way that my body could have fought that disease yet.</span> <span id="s652">I succeeded in coming out of there.</span> <span id="s653">The bullets did not hit me.</span> <span id="s654">It was night time.</span> <span id="s655">The flashes of the thing.</span> <span id="s656">I know that we were several guys.</span> <span id="s657">We were just there.</span> <span id="s658">They were just not good sharpshooters or they didn’t want to hit us.</span> <span id="s659">And,…uh…I came to somewhere else, into Munich, I met up with another friend of mine and we stayed together.</span> <span id="s660">Uh…we have personally taken revenge wherever we could take revenge at that time.</span> <span id="s661">Either by plundering, robbing, killing.</span> <span id="s662">Whatever we did to the Germans, it was certainly done out of revenge and without hesitation…any hesitation.</span> <span id="s663">Nobody should ever consider any person who has done any of these things as a cruel bad person.</span> <span id="s664">No, he should be considered as a hero for having done that.</span> <span id="s665">And some of us have succeeded.</span> <span id="s666">Some of them have not succeeded.</span> <span id="s667">This is the end of the war.</span> <span id="s668">Uh…we tried to straighten out our…straighten out our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: How did you find your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: We were…this was the concern of everybody who remained wherever in Europe, female or male.</span> <span id="s671">Where is my next one, wife, husband, son, father, daughter, mother…uh, first we were taking care of ourselves.</span> <span id="s672">I was very successful right away because I was in Germany with my language and, uh…a little guts and I felt that this is my world now and there’s nobody coming in my way with anything.</span> <span id="s673">God help the one who comes in my way!</span> <span id="s674">No mercy.</span> <span id="s675">I lived in Munich.</span> <span id="s676">If you have seen a Jewish woman somewhere you would stop her and you would say maybe you would know about my husband, wife, son or so on.</span> <span id="s677">Another person would stop you and would say maybe you run across my father, aunt, uncle or grandmother.</span> <span id="s678">And, you would stop just people and talk.</span> <span id="s679">Who knows maybe stupid question -- but let me ask anyway.</span> <span id="s680">So this was the conversation and I remember it was already…so I was prepared.</span> <span id="s681">I was doing financially well already.</span> <span id="s682">Uh, but I had nobody and I said I’m going to go every place and any place until I find either my wife my people or if I find the graveyard where they lie.</span> <span id="s683">I will not stop on rumors and whatever it takes, it will take.</span> <span id="s684">And, at that time, I was a member…was in Munich.</span> <span id="s685">Very little things…uh…restaurants were open.</span> <span id="s686">Very little coffee houses were open but one day I came into a coffee house to have some coffee or maybe a little bite -- I don’t remember -- and I ran across a lady, Jewish lady, and I said to her “I think I your face is familiar” and she says “Sure, you know me.”</span> <span id="s687">And she happened to be a female doctor from Kovno and she said to me, I said “Where you coming from?”</span> <span id="s688">and she says, “I’m coming from Vienna and I’m traveling because I heard that my family member -- I don’t remember what is there.</span> <span id="s689">What can you tell me about it.”</span> <span id="s690">I said…I said “You know I have so far found nobody.</span> <span id="s691">I’m looking for Mama, I’m looking for my wife, which she didn’t know that I married and she said, “Let me tell you something.</span> <span id="s692">I was with your wife in the ladies’ bathroom in Vienna a week ago…uh…so she is fine and she is looking for you.”</span> <span id="s693">And I asked her how she is doing, whether she needs any help and so on.</span> <span id="s694">I told her I said I can give her everything that she needs.</span> <span id="s695">I thanks God, I’ve got everything and I had everything.</span> <span id="s696">And of course this was the first life sign but I still don’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s697">I couldn’t pick up and call up Eastern Airlines.</span> <span id="s698">You know, make a reservation to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: You know, on the next flight in an hour…uh…you have a discount fare?</span> <span id="s701">It was just no normal transportation.</span> <span id="s702">Everything was bombed out, there’s a war that was on.</span> <span id="s703">And so there’s no transportation, nothing, not even highways which were halfway good.</span> <span id="s704">And then I had no address either.</span> <span id="s705">I had nothing.</span> <span id="s706">No mail -- nothing.</span> <span id="s707">At that time, I had to stop because I could not…I could not go any further…uh…I had no more contact to make there, I couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s708">So, I decided that I’m going to look for my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s709">And I decided they might have gone back to Russia.</span> <span id="s710">Who knows, people did, you know, you don’t know what’s right and wrong again.</span> <span id="s711">But I cannot go back to the Russian territory because I’m now a traitor for not having come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Hm hmmm</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: So, I‘m not going to risk that but I was bribing some people to go to Poland and then gave enough -- watches was the big thing at that time -- you know, uh, things of that sort to bribe again maybe, uh, uh, a Russian soldier or Polish soldier to find…to go into Lithuania to ask among Jewish people…was all prepared plans and for a big price to bring ‘em back in a sack, in anything, I don’t care.</span> <span id="s714">And…uh…at that moment; yah, that was prepared so but I traveled in the meantime first through camp sites in Germany, British zone, French zone, American zone, not Russian zone, And a friend of mine, a German Jew, strictly German who spoke nothing but German, who was 100 % German said “I go with you.</span> <span id="s715">I have nobody.</span> <span id="s716">I go with you” and we went on coal trains or cattle trains whatever moved, we jumped on.</span> <span id="s717">Don’t know where to go but wherever it went and landed that was a place to go and we came in to a city not far where the train stopped after weeks sitting on these coal trains called Bergen Belsen.</span> <span id="s718">Bergen Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">I am now entering Bergen Belsen, which was one of the very famous, notorious, concentration camps.</span> <span id="s720">At this time, I found this camp surrounded with the same barbed wires.</span> <span id="s721">Still with guards, but not German guards.</span> <span id="s722">These were English guards.</span> <span id="s723">I just could not understand that the liberation has been already some time before, that we were still under guard with watch towers, as in the days before.</span> <span id="s724">Coming to the gate, I was checked and searched by the British, and led into camp, completely unknown to me -- anybody,, anything that was moving inside.</span> <span id="s725">It was a lovely day, and people, young people, were walking…uh…the camp streets, and I said to my pal, who traveled with me, after listening to the language spoken by the people there, which was Jewish.</span> <span id="s726">And, then when I walked further, I determined that these people were either Lithuanian Jews or Jews from Bialystok.</span> <span id="s727">Because Bialystok and Lithuania -- the accent is exactly alike.</span> <span id="s728">You cannot differentiate between the two when they speak.</span> <span id="s729">So, it had to be one or the other, and I said to my German friend, who walked with me, I said “Do me a favor.</span> <span id="s730">You become, at this moment, deaf and dumb.”</span> <span id="s731">I meant that very seriously, because a German, Jew or not Jew, was not liked, and since he spoke only German, and nothing else, I just did not want to let on to that -- so I told him, “You have to act.</span> <span id="s732">And, acting might be tough, so you must now be deaf and dumb.</span> <span id="s733">And, hold on as long as you can.”</span> <span id="s734">I approached the first bunch of girls that walked down the street, and I asked them in Jewish from where they come.</span> <span id="s735">And, the moment I asked them, in their own native slang Jewish --that’s the only way that I knew -- and it was theirs.</span> <span id="s736">Alike.</span> <span id="s737">They immediately got so excited and hollered all over the place, screamed out, “ A Bialystoker ingle is da.</span> <span id="s738">A lebediker.”</span> <span id="s739">Meaning, “A Jewish boy from Bialystok is here, and he is alive.”</span> <span id="s740">That was a rarity, that was not known to them -- and, of course, it became like a flock of birds around me.</span> <span id="s741">And, then, I introduced my friend as one who suffers -- as one who is now deaf and dumb due to the war, and therefore he cannot respond to anything that is going on -- and, they took me into one of their rooms, and, of course, a little time passed and the word went like a fire through the camp that there is a live Jewish boy among us.</span> <span id="s742">So, all of these girls -- this was a female camp.</span> <span id="s743">So, all 0f these girls, of course, begged and screamed and asked, in any way, shape or form, to get through.</span> <span id="s744">“Maybe you know this man and this man and this man” which were dear ones of theirs, brothers, fathers, uncles, aunts, husbands and regretfully, after we calmed down a little bit, of course, I couldn’t tell them anything, because I really didn’t know any of them.</span> <span id="s745">I could have run across somebody, but it would have been very unlikely even to remember a name.</span> <span id="s746">But, that was the situation at that time.</span> <span id="s747">That was the only way you could get about the news…about a dear one.</span> <span id="s748">There was no newspaper.</span> <span id="s749">There was no telephone.</span> <span id="s750">There was no television.</span> <span id="s751">There was nothing, except nose to nose contact, if you were lucky enough.</span> <span id="s752">And, I was there for the same purpose.</span> <span id="s753">To find out whether really my wife or my mother -- although I knew about my wife through that lady in Austria, but, then, I tried again to get some more news and some more information, if I could.</span> <span id="s754">I asked primarily about my mother now, and my sister, and these were not the people they were together with.</span> <span id="s755">These were not Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s756">These were from Bialystok people, as I thought they would be, because I didn’t recognize…walking down the street already, I didn’t recognize any similarities.</span> <span id="s757">You would have figured somebody you would have recognized.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Now they were very kind.</span> <span id="s759">They were very lovely.</span> <span id="s760">I became one of them.</span> <span id="s761">My friend, also.</span> <span id="s762">But, night approached, and no male can be in that camp.</span> <span id="s763">And, so they decided that we stay here anyhow, and they wouldn’t let us out.</span> <span id="s764">We were one of theirs.</span> <span id="s765">One of their brothers.</span> <span id="s766">One of their kin.</span> <span id="s767">So, they had bunk beds they slept in, and they gave us a double bunk, while some of the girls crawled in together in another bunk.</span> <span id="s768">And, we were tired, and we fell asleep.</span> <span id="s769">But, in the middle of the night, we heard a lot of thundering, and hitting on doors, and knocking on walls, and, although I was fast asleep, I felt a hand over my mouth, not to make noise or ask, “Who is there?”</span> <span id="s770">And the girl whispered in my ear -- it was dark -- and she says to me, “The British are outside…were coming in…and you and your friend better get up quickly and get out through the window.</span> <span id="s771">This was on the first floor.</span> <span id="s772">We opened the window and went into the darkness, unfamiliar to us -- what it looks out there, looks like.</span> <span id="s773">In our shorts…ran out in the back yard.</span> <span id="s774">They turned the lights on, and we could see from the dark into the light -- from the outside into the inside that the British came in, with their rifles, with their bayonets in front there, and looked for men in every room, because they knew they signed in two, but they signed out none.</span> <span id="s775">Didn’t find us.</span> <span id="s776">Came back in again, into the room, through the window, and continued sleeping until the morning and that was everything fine and dandy.</span> <span id="s777">Then we left camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">From there on, we continued further -- same transportation.</span> <span id="s779">Find a coal train -- get on top of it.</span> <span id="s780">No schedules.</span> <span id="s781">Maybe they leave in an hour.</span> <span id="s782">Maybe they leave today.</span> <span id="s783">Maybe it leaves tomorrow.</span> <span id="s784">If a horse and buggy came by, hop on that and go.</span> <span id="s785">Go.</span> <span id="s786">Going to nowhere.</span> <span id="s787">And after so many days of being nowhere, we came in to…we came in to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s788">I was hesitating a moment to say Hamburg, because I wasn’t sure whether it was Hamburg or was it Bremen.</span> <span id="s789">But, I think it was Hamburg.</span> <span id="s790">Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s791">And, there we stood again.</span> <span id="s792">There was a bombed--out railroad station, in the middle of the city, I guess.</span> <span id="s793">And, coming out there, all I had was a pack, a rucksack, and my friend had it, too.</span> <span id="s794">And, there was water -- like a pier and there were people sitting like waiting for a ferry or something to go somewhere.</span> <span id="s795">And, I asked them where we are, and they told us where we are, and I asked them, “Would you know this city well?”</span> <span id="s796">And they said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s797">And I said.</span> <span id="s798">“Well, is there a Jewish congregation here”.</span> <span id="s799">Is there a Jewish synagogue here in town?</span> <span id="s800">Is there a rabbi in town here?</span> <span id="s801">Is there anything that has…somewhere where Jews are organized?”</span> <span id="s802">And, a man said to me, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s803">That he was Jewish too.</span> <span id="s804">But, I guess, he was Jewish more by convenience after the war.</span> <span id="s805">Certainly, nobody knew about him during the war, that he had any contact with Jews.</span> <span id="s806">So, maybe he was a little bit of a Jew.</span> <span id="s807">Maybe some blood went through him.</span> <span id="s808">But, anyhow, he directed me where to go, which was at the other end of town.</span> <span id="s809">On the other end of town -- how do you get to the other end of town?</span> <span id="s810">If there is no transportation…</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Well, you cannot walk.</span> <span id="s813">You know, it is not like…you know…it is a big Jewish city, and to go from one end to the other end takes another month.</span> <span id="s814">But, lucky there came a farmer through with a wagon, and he took us along, and he dropped us off where we had to go.</span> <span id="s815">I came to the door of the head of the Jewish community in Hamburg, formed after the war.</span> <span id="s816">And, knocking on the door, a lady opened up, and I asked for the gentleman, and I was told that he wasn’t in, and she looked us over.</span> <span id="s817">She said to me, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s818">And I said, “The truth of the matter is…I am here…we are searching for family.</span> <span id="s819">I am searching for my mother.</span> <span id="s820">I am searching for my sister.</span> <span id="s821">I am searching for everybody…for anybody.”</span> <span id="s822">And, she said…and I told her what my name was.</span> <span id="s823">I told her my name was “Zemon”, which is the pronunciation of Simon in Germany…spelled the same way.</span> <span id="s824">And she says, “Please come in.”</span> <span id="s825">Made us very comfortable.</span> <span id="s826">And, said to me, “Is your mother Rosel Simon?”</span> <span id="s827">And, I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s828">I don’t know how to express and to tell what went through me, at that moment, because I realized that they are alive, before asking further questions.</span> <span id="s829">And she told me, “You know, only a few days ago, they left from here.</span> <span id="s830">They stayed right here, in this house of mine, and slept.</span> <span id="s831">And, they left here for Munich, because your mother learned that her son, which is you, evidently, is alive in Munich, and she is working her way over to you.”</span> <span id="s832">So, I learned from her, that she would have to go first…O.K. I have to retract…I have to make a correction here because it just now comes to me.</span> <span id="s833">That was not in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s834">That happened in Bremen, and I realize that now because she told me that “Your mother had to go to Hamburg first, in order to continue.”</span> <span id="s835">The third girl that she mentioned did not…she didn’t know the name, and the way she had explained to me her looks and her walks and her height, etc., didn’t…were not similar to that of my wife.</span> <span id="s836">I did not recognize her by the explanation, and I couldn’t think, either, who else it could have been.</span> <span id="s837">But they traveled together.</span> <span id="s838">So, my thoughts went back again now that, I guess, my wife somehow was split away and she somehow landed in Vienna as that other doctor lady had told me, and I wasn’t concerned any more.</span> <span id="s839">Once I knew they were alive, I really didn’t have any further concern as to find them, and I was in no particular rush.</span> <span id="s840">I was satisfied now, and the rest of it will fall in line.</span> <span id="s841">And, this lady offered to stay in her house, and we thanked her for it.</span> <span id="s842">I didn’t want to impose.</span> <span id="s843">Although I didn’t know where I am going to be tonight.</span> <span id="s844">I didn’t know one night from the next.</span> <span id="s845">And, I asked her whether there are any Jewish women around here, and she told me that there is an island that can only be reached by ferry, by boat.</span> <span id="s846">It’s about an hour’s ride and that there is a whole group of Jewish women having been liberated.</span> <span id="s847">And, she directed me back to that pier where I have been earlier, and she told me that the ferry is leaving at certain times.</span> <span id="s848">So, we barreled our way back to that pier.</span> <span id="s849">There was no way of calling a taxi or anything else because it didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s850">I come to the pier and there was that ferry waiting, and my friend and I boarded that boat, and, just, after when it left, we looked around us…I remember that so vividly -- there were the staircases that go to the second deck, and we stood on the first one, and I found myself surrounded by Jewish women staring at my face, and I, staring in their face, because we know each other.</span> <span id="s851">These were women from Kovno, from Lithuania, who have been that day in town to take passport pictures, for whatever reasons and returned back to their quarters on that island.</span> <span id="s852">I don’t remember the name of the island and I stood there…I mean…I don’t think you can imagine what it means to look at tens and twenty…I don’t know how many women…in faces you don’t know who they are.</span> <span id="s853">You recognize the faces, You know them.</span> <span id="s854">And, you feel, all of a sudden, among your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: How many years had that been, Manny?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Well, that has been, still that has been in 1945, so it it’s exactly 41 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s858">Since you have seen them in Kovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Oh, since I have seen these people?</span> <span id="s860">Well, these people I have seen probably sometimes during the ghettos…some people, you know were older…my mother’s age…who recognized me as the child of…</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s862">But, I mean how many years had it been, about?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Oh, I would…could be two, three and four years and up, you know.</span> <span id="s864">Some of them may have been toward the end in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s865">Some of them maybe have left earlier.</span> <span id="s866">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s867">But, a number of years.</span> <span id="s868">But, all of a sudden, we became novelties to each other, and I was a greater novelty to them than they were to me, because they didn’t know any more what a male looks like, a Jewish male who came back.</span> <span id="s869">They had no…no contact.</span> <span id="s870">They lost everybody.</span> <span id="s871">Lost everybody.</span> <span id="s872">So, of course, again it started all over…the same thing.</span> <span id="s873">Do you know him?</span> <span id="s874">And do you know him?</span> <span id="s875">And do you know him?</span> <span id="s876">Do you know…is he alive?</span> <span id="s877">Is he dead?</span> <span id="s878">Have you seen him?</span> <span id="s879">Haven’t you seen him?</span> <span id="s880">What can you tell me about him?</span> <span id="s881">You have no idea?</span> <span id="s882">Rumors?</span> <span id="s883">Anything.</span> <span id="s884">Some of them I could tell.</span> <span id="s885">Some good news.</span> <span id="s886">Most of them -- it was sad news.</span> <span id="s887">But, I was told by them that my mother is alive, and that my sister is alive, and that my mother has lost an eye due to typhus, and that they are fine.</span> <span id="s888">And, of course, the excitement was great when they found out that I was alive in Munich.</span> <span id="s889">The third girl was a little girl that my sister picked up, her age, and my sister, at the time was…uh…probably seventeen years old – sixteen, seventeen.</span> <span id="s890">The little girl was the same age, and, just…they took her along…an orphan.</span> <span id="s891">An orphan, and I guess, Mama says, “Come with me.’</span> <span id="s892">That’s what I gathered at that time.</span> <span id="s893">I recognized it was not family.</span> <span id="s894">It was a strange girl.</span> <span id="s895">And, now, before I left Munich to go on this extensive trip, and I didn’t know where I would end up, or when I would return, or if I will return, everything went unscheduled, I left word in a Jewish organization in Munich, and gave the key to my place to a good friend of mine, who was one of the leaders of the organization.</span> <span id="s896">His name is Dr. Gershwin today…Gershowitz at that time.</span> <span id="s897">Dr. Gershwin is still a dear friend, and we are still very much in touch with each other, and he has only been visiting with his family…with us…here in Sarasota two weeks ago.</span> <span id="s898">Uh…I told him, “Should Mama or my wife come into these offices – and that’s where you would go -- any place you come, you find an organization and you go -- remember what to tell them, where I went.</span> <span id="s899">Give them the keys and lead them to this place.</span> <span id="s900">There is everything in that place for them for months to eat.</span> <span id="s901">There was everything loaded up and have a good life.</span> <span id="s902">I’ll be back.”</span> <span id="s903">Money, everything was there for them.</span> <span id="s904">All this left the word that with the eventuality, with the hope, and to this date, forty years later, I still live -- on one vitamin -- and that is hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Now since I knew that they were well and safe and in good hands, I decided there was no rush for me to barrel my way back, and I went further to Frankfurt because Frankfurt was the city I was born in.</span> <span id="s906">Also, I didn’t remember anything of it.</span> <span id="s907">But, I felt that I could find out and learn some other things maybe about some other people in that town.</span> <span id="s908">And, found my way to Frankfurt, found very little Jewishness coming back -- people having come back, found transportation back to Munich with Jewish soldiers who were…made some transports available from one time to another one…military transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: American soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: American soldiers, yes.</span> <span id="s911">And, on these transport trucks, really no comfort or anything exciting or anything enthusiastic about these things.</span> <span id="s912">These were not Concord airplanes that took you there in style.</span> <span id="s913">We came to Munich, and that is…and I found…and I went to the organization, and immediately I was told in the organization…I didn’t meet my friend there…that my mother and my sister and a third girl went in to a sanatorium.</span> <span id="s914">A sanatorium in English translated -- I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Rest home?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: No.</span> <span id="s917">I suppose maybe we could consider it as a home to recuperate in.</span> <span id="s918">Where you have the comforts and the care, yet you are not confined to a bed, and you don’t need, really, a doctor.</span> <span id="s919">But, you are taken care of.</span> <span id="s920">And, this again was somewhere past the town, but transportation was bad, again, to get to it.</span> <span id="s921">I rested a night at home.</span> <span id="s922">In the morning I got to the train so far, and from there I think another twenty-five miles to walk.</span> <span id="s923">And, I set out to walk out.</span> <span id="s924">That’s all.</span> <span id="s925">It’s not a big thing.</span> <span id="s926">And, on the way, on that highway walking, I sang a little bit, and philosophized a little bit, I guess, to waste the time.</span> <span id="s927">And all of a sudden -- you know, here and there you find a house standing, and all of a sudden, I hear somebody screaming, in the middle of nowhere, my name.</span> <span id="s928">So, I look up, look around, and I looked up at the house.</span> <span id="s929">There stands a house, and who was looking out the window -- Mrs. Gershwin -- not only was she the wife of my friend -- but Miriam Gershwin went to school with me in Memel.</span> <span id="s930">And she somehow was living in that house after the war.</span> <span id="s931">So, of course I stopped there.</span> <span id="s932">I rested there.</span> <span id="s933">I got a little something to drink, and we chatted, and she knew exactly that Mother was there, and where it was.</span> <span id="s934">So, this was a pleasant break, and now, when I come to my Mother she was waiting for me because she knew that I went to see her, and she knew that I had to come back for her one of these days.</span> <span id="s935">And, the whole hospital…or…or…the recuperation house…the whole place knew about me.</span> <span id="s936">I evidently was the most famous person there.</span> <span id="s937">Also, nobody knew who it was.</span> <span id="s938">I was the son of Mrs. Simon.</span> <span id="s939">And, the moment I came into that big place, and I caught the man who was mopping the floors, and I said, “Could you tell me which room I could find Mrs. Simon?”</span> <span id="s940">and he knew right away.</span> <span id="s941">He said right away, “You must be the son.</span> <span id="s942">You are the son.</span> <span id="s943">The whole house is waiting.”</span> <span id="s944">I said, “oh, my God.”</span> <span id="s945">And, of course, I don’t have to tell you the meeting of…the meeting of a mother of a child…I am not talking about me, the child meeting the mother.</span> <span id="s946">It is something.</span> <span id="s947">It is an unforgettable affair.</span> <span id="s948">Indescribable.</span> <span id="s949">And that was, actually, more or less, the end of this story.</span> <span id="s950">Of course we were happy.</span> <span id="s951">My sister, everybody was fine.</span> <span id="s952">The little girl was…the girl that they befriended and stayed with them.</span> <span id="s953">And, I took them out of there.</span> <span id="s954">As a matter of fact, the doctors in that place…one was…one of them was a cousin of my mother and the other one was an old friend of the family.</span> <span id="s955">I met a lot of people there whom we knew, and I said to my mother and to my sister that they don’t belong here.</span> <span id="s956">Although it is very nice, but, that I will take them into a very beautiful place which I was going to get for them in the mountains – in the Bavarian mountains -- in the Bavarian Alps -- in…uh…maybe half an hour’s drive away from Garmisch -- Partenkirchen, which is a world renowned ski resort to this date and always has been.</span> <span id="s957">And, I came…and I arranged and I came there and got them a very nice little place.</span> <span id="s958">And then there was Rosh Hashanah that came, and there was a Jewish camp -- a displaced persons camp -- not any more concentration camp -- we cannot mix the two things up.</span> <span id="s959">Here they were free at least, but they were under supervision of Jewish organizations like the Joint Distribution Committee, like the HIAS, and I remember, on Rosh Hashanah, when General Eisenhower came through and came to the tent where we had our services.</span> <span id="s960">And, the tent did not really have many seats, but everybody found seating around and above and below, and he welcomed us and gave us confidence and strength, and when he left, I went up to him and I said to him, in the broken English that I thought was English, but really wasn’t, with his interpreter.</span> <span id="s961">I told him of my plight and I told him that I have a sick mother and that I have a sister and they deserve better, and I said, “the whole town here is of the finest villas.’</span> <span id="s962">And I assured him that every second one, if not every one, has been a former Nazi homestead.</span> <span id="s963">And he told me to hop in the jeep that he was riding, and we went to a villa, and he confiscated this villa, and he says to me, “That’s for your mother.’</span> <span id="s964">That was it.</span> <span id="s965">I needed no lawyers.</span> <span id="s966">I needed no deeds, deed restrictions…all these things we know when we buy a piece of property now.</span> <span id="s967">Search title.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: He was Eisenhower.</span> <span id="s969">What else could you need?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: This…well, he was the commanding general.</span> <span id="s971">He was the god in that country.</span> <span id="s972">He had this…I brought my mother and my sister there.</span> <span id="s973">We had a most gorgeous villa, and the most gorgeous furniture, with the most gorgeous piano, that my mother needed because she was a concert pianist.</span> <span id="s974">And, it wasn’t just a piano, but it was a…</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Grand piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Grand piano, thank you.</span> <span id="s977">And, that’s where we settled.</span> <span id="s978">It was very beautiful, but I still not have seen my wife.</span> <span id="s979">And, then I touched slowly and talked to my mother about all the happenings, and so on, and I asked her, “What do you know about Dita?’</span> <span id="s980">Dita being my wife.</span> <span id="s981">After reluctantly getting out of it, trying not to answer, my own mother told me that my wife is not alive.</span> <span id="s982">And, I said, “Mama, I understand that she is alive.”</span> <span id="s983">She said, “ No.</span> <span id="s984">She is not.’</span> <span id="s985">But, I said, “Mama, if she is not alive, I will not believe it until I know where she lies, and until that moment, she isn’t dead.”</span> <span id="s986">And, I said, “ I am going to work on it -- to bring her -- to find her, dead or alive.</span> <span id="s987">And, when I am being told that she is dead, that person also has to know where she lies.</span> <span id="s988">And, when I know that, then I will travel there.”</span> <span id="s989">Meantime, weeks passed.</span> <span id="s990">Every day, I went to see Mama.</span> <span id="s991">I lived in Munich, and that was an hour’s train ride.</span> <span id="s992">We had a train there.</span> <span id="s993">And so, it was okay to commute for me, and I went every day into the city, and back in the evening to Mama, and every morning, I took an early train.</span> <span id="s994">Mama would get up and play the piano for me and she played one song for me that was extremely dear to me, meaningful.</span> <span id="s995">And that was “My Yiddisha Mama.”</span> <span id="s996">And there is a little significance to this song to me, because, first of all, I remember, as a little boy, that Mama played that song for her Mama, for my Grandmother, who loved it so much.</span> <span id="s997">And, when she played it for her, I guess it became meaningful to me in later years.</span> <span id="s998">I remember having marched in a concentration camp to work every day, in my striped uniforms, six men in a row, groups of maybe thirty men, guards in front and back of you, marching down the dust and dirt road to every place you worked, wherever this was, at that time.</span> <span id="s999">And we had along with us the ration, food ration for the day which consisted of a tiny piece of bread -- not a slice of bread -- but a tiny piece of bread and a little soup, dishwater, and there were many days I remember I walked once next to an old Jewish man who walked next to me.</span> <span id="s1000">When I say old, he was much older than I am, because I was a child, a young man, and I…I was heavy of heart, and we walked, and I said to him.</span> <span id="s1001">“Do you remember the words to the Jewish…to the Yiddisha Mama?”</span> <span id="s1002">I could sing the song, but I didn’t have all the vocabulary for it.</span> <span id="s1003">.</span> <span id="s1004">And, he says, “Sure, I know every word of it.”</span> <span id="s1005">I said, “Could you sing it for me while we marched on.”</span> <span id="s1006">And he says to me, “What else do you want from me?”</span> <span id="s1007">And he said, “Who can sing at a time like this?”</span> <span id="s1008">And I said to him, “Mister, I give you my daily ration if you sing it for me.</span> <span id="s1009">It will be better nourishment for me than that piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1010">It doesn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s1011">I wouldn’t hold out, anyhow, with that bread or without that bread.”</span> <span id="s1012">And, of course, this being a big payment, a whole day’s work, he sang it to me.</span> <span id="s1013">And, we marched, and I cried, and I was grateful to him and thankful.</span> <span id="s1014">And I didn’t want to eat that bread.</span> <span id="s1015">This was the greatest nourishment that I had.</span> <span id="s1016">So, Mama knew that, and every morning, she played that song for me and then I went to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1017">And, why did I go every day into Munich?</span> <span id="s1018">Because I was hoping that my wife will come in somehow.</span> <span id="s1019">Because, in the meantime, during the days…so one day I found a letter from a former German soldier who was a prisoner of war by the British, I believe, and he ran across my wife in Vienna, and he was on the way home.</span> <span id="s1020">He was now let loose, and he went home to Munich where he came from originally.</span> <span id="s1021">And, my wife says,…said to him because she found out from other people now that I am in Munich, and she gave along a little letter to him, to me, in Munich and he dropped it off at a Jewish organization where I found it.</span> <span id="s1022">He had left his name and address.</span> <span id="s1023">And, so, I went to see him, although he was a German…he was a soldier…he was now out of uniform, and I asked him, and he gave me all the information he could, and gave me the first live account of her, and told me not to move…not to go there…because that’s what she says…that she is trying to barrel her way over from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1024">That this was not easy.</span> <span id="s1025">You see, these were not open borders to go.</span> <span id="s1026">You just didn’t have to find transportation.</span> <span id="s1027">You also had to go a little bit above and around things, because, now, you still didn’t have passports.</span> <span id="s1028">We had very little identification.</span> <span id="s1029">If anything, they were worthless.</span> <span id="s1030">So, he warned me not to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: To stay in Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: My wife realized that I would get excited and that I would come…try to come over, and then we’ll…the same thing what happened with my mother, although she didn’t know that story of my mother.</span> <span id="s1033">So, every day, I was hoping that she will come in.</span> <span id="s1034">I knew now that she knows where to move.</span> <span id="s1035">And, uh…she got the information again through people who traveled her way, like I traveled the other way.</span> <span id="s1036">Again, you know, and somebody must have told her, “Yes.</span> <span id="s1037">Your husband is fine and well.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: That was the original Jewish Geography.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Geography?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: We play Jewish Geography all the time.</span> <span id="s1041">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: What is Jewish Geography?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Well, do know somebody in Detroit by the name of…?</span> <span id="s1044">Do you know somebody in Kansas City by the name of…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Oh, I see, yes.</span> <span id="s1046">Well, this turned out later, also.</span> <span id="s1047">You are right, because everybody, when you came to Israel, shortly after the war, as I have, everybody would ask you.</span> <span id="s1048">He said, “Do you know my uncle in…in America?”</span> <span id="s1049">“Where is America?’</span> <span id="s1050">“I don’t know where in America.”</span> <span id="s1051">Sure, where in America?”</span> <span id="s1052">“What do you think this is -- a small town?</span> <span id="s1053">This is a dorf or something like that?”</span> <span id="s1054">But, this is…you are right.</span> <span id="s1055">This is probably Jewish Geography.</span> <span id="s1056">I never realized that we would call it that way.</span> <span id="s1057">Uh…one morning, I tiptoed out of the house to the railroad station, because Mama was asleep.</span> <span id="s1058">I didn’t want her…to wake up.</span> <span id="s1059">And, while I waited at the railroad station, which was only a few minutes from the house, uh…and I heard, already, the whistle of the train approaching the station, I also listened…heard when my Mama came running in a nightgown with a robe over to the railroad station, and said, “Manfred, Manfred.”</span> <span id="s1060">And I said, “Yes, Mama, what is happening.”</span> <span id="s1061">And she says to me, “ I didn’t play the Yiddisha Mama for you and you cannot take the train” And I did not take the train.</span> <span id="s1062">And I went back to the house and Mama had to play The Yiddisha Mama and I took a later train into town, but as irony will have it, on that morning, my wife, with her mother -- with my mother-in-law, who was a physician -- came in and stayed.</span> <span id="s1063">We had some, I guess , a couple of bunk beds for people to put them up temporarily there in that confiscated building where the Jewish organization was.</span> <span id="s1064">And, when I came, there was a big yard, with cobblestones, and two staircases going up to it and I said, “Oh, I swear that’s my mother-in-law sitting there,” From the back.</span> <span id="s1065">I couldn’t…because I remember her hairdo, and, of course I started getting…you can imagine getting a little bit excited, and this was my mother-in-law, and of course the hugging and the kissing and the crying, and I said, “Where is Dita?’</span> <span id="s1066">and she says, “she is searching the rooms here for you.’</span> <span id="s1067">She thought I sleep there, you see, because she got that address.</span> <span id="s1068">And they had these bunk beds.</span> <span id="s1069">People sleeping there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q; Surely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: So, she went through the rooms there.</span> <span id="s1072">There was one guy who was lying with the back to the door, yah…with the back to the door.</span> <span id="s1073">From the back, I looked to her…like it’s me, so she pulled the blanket off from this poor guy there.</span> <span id="s1074">But, it wasn’t him, so, of course, this is where we met and this is how we got together, and I still remember the wardrobe she wore--that green coat with the big star on the back which was painted over, and I took her and her mother and we went to the next town -- not the same town my mother was in, but…because every stop where the train stopped, that was a resort place -- all in the Bavarian Alps.</span> <span id="s1075">And, I took a room there and I opened up…the balconies were open.</span> <span id="s1076">We looked at the mountains with snow on it.</span> <span id="s1077">We were sitting in the sunshine, and I remember the first words when she walked into that room, that gorgeous room.</span> <span id="s1078">And, she said, “…and white sheets”.</span> <span id="s1079">I only say that because you will know what a human being becomes like.</span> <span id="s1080">She certainly knew what white sheets were.</span> <span id="s1081">My wife came from a very affluent house.</span> <span id="s1082">Her father, one of the big manufactures of crystal from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1083">Her mother, a physician.</span> <span id="s1084">Homes that were only served by servants and all of a sudden, some years later, a white sheet is such a big thing…became such a big thing.</span> <span id="s1085">I guess a Picasso painting would not have opened your eyes up as this has at the moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: How long before you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Well, uh…uh…this was in ’45…I guess another year.</span> <span id="s1088">Because, shortly thereafter, now everything was more or less settled, uh…we were happy.</span> <span id="s1089">We were all together.</span> <span id="s1090">Uh…I went with Dita…after a few months, we decided to go to…to move to Frankfurt – the two of us and in Frankfurt, coming back into the city, I had, again, a gorgeous apartment, confiscated on my behalf by the police, again because I was the only full-blooded born Jew in that town, who came back.</span> <span id="s1091">We had hundreds, maybe thousands of Jews up there, but none of them were Frankfurt Jews.</span> <span id="s1092">None of them were full-blooded Jews.</span> <span id="s1093">All of a sudden, we had a lot of half-blooded Jews, quarter-blooded Jews.</span> <span id="s1094">All of a sudden, the mother went to school with a Jewish boy in class.</span> <span id="s1095">I guess she said she is a quarter Jew.</span> <span id="s1096">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1097">And, so me coming back there.</span> <span id="s1098">This, in itself, opened up the doors for me.</span> <span id="s1099">I was very…we were young children yet.</span> <span id="s1100">First, when I came into town I had to stay in a hotel or find somewhere, coming from the first hotel right off the railroad station, when I said, “I would like to have a room.”</span> <span id="s1101">And the man behind the desk said, “I am sorry sir, but this hotel is occupied by occupation troops.</span> <span id="s1102">It’s occupied by occupation troops for their purposes.”</span> <span id="s1103">And, I said, “Well, that’s fine.”</span> <span id="s1104">I said, “I’m sure this is the right place for me.”</span> <span id="s1105">And, he says, “Well, they occupy that only…it’s only for Jewish…members of the Jewish faith.”</span> <span id="s1106">I said, “Well,” I said, “That’s me.”</span> <span id="s1107">again.</span> <span id="s1108">Because I didn’t look Jewish and my name was not Jewish, and, uh…so…we got that.</span> <span id="s1109">We got…we were settled there until the time when we went to the Dept for Housing and that is where the whole ball started rolling.</span> <span id="s1110">Coming to the apartment that the housing authority had given us.</span> <span id="s1111">They sent me with that piece of paper to the local precinct.</span> <span id="s1112">And I came to the local precinct, and I said to the chief there…he said, “I’ll send a man with you, but he is not in.</span> <span id="s1113">Wait a few minutes.”</span> <span id="s1114">So, I sat and waited.</span> <span id="s1115">And while I waited and chat a little bit with me, and he said to me, “Tell me, Mr. Simon, was your father, by any chance, Philip Simon?”</span> <span id="s1116">I said, “Yah, that was my father…” and he says, “Oh, I knew him and you lived on this and that street, at the corner?”</span> <span id="s1117">I said, ‘that’s right.’</span> <span id="s1118">Now, this goes back twelve years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Surely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Because we left in 1933.</span> <span id="s1121">Now it is 1945.</span> <span id="s1122">And, of course, that was a coincidence, and that, of course, opened up everything for me.</span> <span id="s1123">Because here is the kid from the man that he knew.</span> <span id="s1124">Do you follow me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: And now had guilty feelings also, because he is a German, and he is the father who has been killed.</span> <span id="s1127">So he sent along a policeman with me to get into the apartment.</span> <span id="s1128">And, coming up to the apartment, and he rang the doorbell, and he says to them that…the lady opened up, with a little baby in her arm.</span> <span id="s1129">And he said to her, and this was a Nazi, who was a member of the party, and this is why it was given to me.</span> <span id="s1130">But he lived there.</span> <span id="s1131">And he informed…the policeman informed the lady that I am the one who comes into the apartment.</span> <span id="s1132">And, she, of course, tried to slam the door.</span> <span id="s1133">.</span> <span id="s1134">He stuck his leg…foot…in there, and a whole commotion ensued.</span> <span id="s1135">And, he asked “Where is the husband?’</span> <span id="s1136">And she says, ‘He is not here.”</span> <span id="s1137">And, they couldn’t get her out.</span> <span id="s1138">The pushing game started.</span> <span id="s1139">It became unhealthy.</span> <span id="s1140">It became loud, and this policeman turned to me and gave me orders, according to paragraph so and so and so and so, of the constitution, whatever he said up there to assist the police officer.</span> <span id="s1141">And, I said, “Well, sir, that’s just what I need.</span> <span id="s1142">Just leave me alone.</span> <span id="s1143">I am going to handle it just the way I was taught to do that just not so long ago by her people.”</span> <span id="s1144">That was on the first floor.</span> <span id="s1145">I told the officer, “Open up the balcony door.”</span> <span id="s1146">I picked her up by her rear pants and I put her face down right at the balcony, and I said,…wiped off my hands…and I said, “That’s the way things are.”</span> <span id="s1147">At that moment, her husband came out from the bedroom…</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: He was there all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: …all the time, but…you know he thought she could handle it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Surely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: …the front.</span> <span id="s1152">And he came out not to protect his wife, and he put the handcuffs on him and led him away.</span> <span id="s1153">That was the end of it.</span> <span id="s1154">My wife and I were in there, we had a gorgeous apartment -- an apartment that was beautifully furnished by probably 15-20 Jewish families.</span> <span id="s1155">The finest of furnitures.</span> <span id="s1156">.</span> <span id="s1157">the finest of carpets.</span> <span id="s1158">The finest of paintings.</span> <span id="s1159">Piano.</span> <span id="s1160">Everything you want.</span> <span id="s1161">But, nothing really matched 100%.</span> <span id="s1162">Exactly what has happened that you found a Persian carpet that was expensive, that they hauled out from that place.</span> <span id="s1163">They found a beautiful credenza somewhere else, and hauled that up here, and so, everything they had was the most valuable thing, but it was not bought at one time where you matched things together.</span> <span id="s1164">So, you knew from there that this has been hauled, robbed, stolen, plundered and probably the people killed.</span> <span id="s1165">Normal life, we started out.</span> <span id="s1166">We had a car.</span> <span id="s1167">I had a chauffeur.</span> <span id="s1168">We had a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: You did very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Very well.</span> <span id="s1171">And, I was the forerunner of the HIAS in Frankfurt on the Main, Germany.</span> <span id="s1172">And I was there to help the people who came through and then the HIAS came and took over.</span> <span id="s1173">I helped them.</span> <span id="s1174">It was my job.</span> <span id="s1175">I wasn’t paid for it.</span> <span id="s1176">I was not looking to be paid for it.</span> <span id="s1177">I didn’t need to be paid for it.</span> <span id="s1178">And, then, when it came…in the meantime, yes, and then when it came to the time one day I got a call from a Jewish chaplain, who was leaving the community in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1179">His name was Captain Vido.</span> <span id="s1180">I don’t remember his first name, but I still have a letter at home, on a wall, hanging.</span> <span id="s1181">And, by the way, Elinor, whenever you come in there, I’ll show you a wall full of this paraphernalia hanging there that I…a little bit…accumulated after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Good, I will come see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: I know you have something very exciting for me because I know the history of your father, Eddie Jacobson, and I am fascinated by that, and since I am a reader of all biographies and autobiographies, of course I have Truman’s and I have all the stories in there, and when I met you, and you told me -- only because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Tonight I will bring you the only really authentic history of what happened between my Daddy and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: I can read that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: I would appreciate that very much.</span> <span id="s1188">Uh…I really did…I love these…all these stories and I am very familiar with them.</span> <span id="s1189">So when I met you, it was old stories told again and it was an excitement to meet the daughter of this…to me… great man.</span> <span id="s1190">It is even history brought them together.</span> <span id="s1191">O.K.</span> <span id="s1192">We are now being called by this Captain Vido.</span> <span id="s1193">He says, “Can you help me tomorrow morning to register the Jewish people who want to emigrate to Israel and who want to emigrate to America?</span> <span id="s1194">America has opened the doors to take immigration in there, and Israel also.</span> <span id="s1195">Israel, of course, at that time was not Israel.</span> <span id="s1196">It was still Palestine, and all immigration was done on an illegal basis because the British didn’t let them in.</span> <span id="s1197">And, I said to the Captain, I said, “I will be very happy to help you, but I would love to go, too.”</span> <span id="s1198">He said, ‘Just put your name on top of the list.’</span> <span id="s1199">And I said to him, “You know, Captain, that’s very nice of you.</span> <span id="s1200">But I have nobody to sponsor me.”</span> <span id="s1201">So, he said, “I will sponsor you.”</span> <span id="s1202">And, I went, in the morning, before I went in the morning, I sat down.</span> <span id="s1203">Now, my mother was there.</span> <span id="s1204">My sister came there.</span> <span id="s1205">They moved also to Frankfurt in the meantime.</span> <span id="s1206">Lived in the same building on another floor.</span> <span id="s1207">And, I said, “Well, tell me…I put everybody, today, on a list.</span> <span id="s1208">Where do you want to go?</span> <span id="s1209">Do you want to go to Israel?</span> <span id="s1210">Do you want to go to America?”</span> <span id="s1211">So, my sister immediately looked at her boyfriend, who is her husband now…a great Zionist, a man who has channeled ammunition and guns, and what have you, to Palestine at the time.</span> <span id="s1212">So she looked at him.</span> <span id="s1213">He, of course, goes to Israel.</span> <span id="s1214">So, of course, this was the end of that.</span> <span id="s1215">The answer was, “We are going to Israel.”</span> <span id="s1216">My mother gave the answer immediately since the umbilical cord has never been cut between my mother and sister, so Mama goes with my sister, and my wife, having been brought up in a very Zionistic way, having finished her total schooling into college in a Hebrew gymnasium, Hebrew language being the language of the studies, having only love for Israel, said, “I go there, too.”</span> <span id="s1217">I was differently…I was brought up in the same way, but I was more realistic.</span> <span id="s1218">I was more thinking on the economic side.</span> <span id="s1219">I said, “I am a young fellow.</span> <span id="s1220">I gotta build up my life.</span> <span id="s1221">I am not ready to build up a whole country.”</span> <span id="s1222">I said, “I am going to America.”</span> <span id="s1223">And my wife says, ‘Well, what am I to do?”</span> <span id="s1224">I said, “ You go where you like to go.</span> <span id="s1225">If we have to spit, we will split.</span> <span id="s1226">But, I will not go and start all over again, and go to the farm and build up a country.</span> <span id="s1227">No.</span> <span id="s1228">I will not do that.”</span> <span id="s1229">So, the answer was very simple.</span> <span id="s1230">As any nice Jewish woman would do, “I go where my husband goes.”</span> <span id="s1231">And, that’s where she went, and we came to the United States…uh…in May 1946.</span> <span id="s1232">We were on the very first ship with refugees arriving in New York harbor after the war.</span> <span id="s1233">And, of course, I remember where Jewish people came out en masse to greet us and to look with binoculars from afar, to see -- I suppose -- what these animals looked like.</span> <span id="s1234">At least that’s the way we felt -- I felt.</span> <span id="s1235">So, we came here and this is the story.</span> <span id="s1236">And, whatever happened thereafter -- that’s fine.</span> <span id="s1237">We are free here.</span> <span id="s1238">The end, what I can report to you about my experiences -- what I still remember -- I am today 62 years old.</span> <span id="s1239">I have a lovely wife.</span> <span id="s1240">I have two lovely children.</span> <span id="s1241">We have a daughter, highly educated, happily married, with two lovely grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1242">My granddaughter, Lisa, is fourteen.</span> <span id="s1243">My grandson, Darren, is eleven.</span> <span id="s1244">I have a lovely son, Theodore, who is a physician in Sarasota, Florida, and we are a happy family and a healthy family.</span> <span id="s1245">I am glad I could have told you a little bit about it.</span> <span id="s1246">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: May it continue for a long, long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">PAGE
