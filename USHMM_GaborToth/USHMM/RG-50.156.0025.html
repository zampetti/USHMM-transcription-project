Paul, Minnesota.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Jewish Community Relations Council, Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT (…) cannot understand what word is said.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: This is an interview with Dr. Herbert Jonas for the JCRC-ADL Holocaust History Project by David Zarkin at Dr. Jonas’ office on May 6, 1983 in Saint Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Dr. Jonas please tell me your complete name, including your Jewish name, if it is different.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: Well, it’s very simple: Herbert Jonas; and no Jewish name there.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: And when were you born, Dr. Jonas?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: May 23, 1915.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: And in what town and country were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Dusseldorf, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: What were your parents’ names, and where were they born?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: My father’s name was Rudolf Jonas, he was born in Daltmo (sp?)</span> <span id="s15">.</span> <span id="s16">Germany.</span> <span id="s17">My mother’s name was Erna Jonas, born Danzig, like the city of Danzig?</span> <span id="s18">Born in Moivee (sp?)</span> <span id="s19">, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And your grandparents’ names and where were they born?</span> <span id="s21">Do you remember them?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: My father’s parents were born in Westphalia.</span> <span id="s23">I don’t know the town exactly, and was Ferdinand and Clara Jonas.</span> <span id="s24">They lived in Daltmond where my grandfather had a grocery wholesale business, and he was the secretary or business manager of the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Were your grandparents from Germany, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: I mean your great-grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Yes, I have records, not quite firm records, going back through relatives in Iowa and San Francisco who we discovered accidentally in Israel, that family goes back at least to the early 1700’s, who had always been living between Westphalia and the Dutch border, especially in the town of Borken, B-o-r-k-e-n, which is near the Dutch border, and had intermarried, frequently, so it’s kind of a clan by itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">And on my mother’s side, the family came apparently, on my grandmother’s side -- Bertha Danzig -- from the old city of Worms, W-o-r-m-s, where the (…) where famous rabbis lived, up in the Polantany (sp?)</span> <span id="s30">for Western Germany, southwestern Germany, but I don’t know too much about the history there except there seems to be some blood in there that came from Spain, from the Spanish exodus, and some that came with the Roman migrations, 2,000 years ago.</span> <span id="s31">People settled there.</span> <span id="s32">On my grandfather’s side, on my mother’s grandfather’s side, I don’t know much, he died very early, and we don’t know much about the history of this man.</span> <span id="s33">He died in the early 1900’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: In Germany, or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: In Germany.</span> <span id="s36">And my grandmother took over business and then they moved to Cologne from Moivee, where she and her older son opened up a real estate business.</span> <span id="s37">And this son had come to the United States in 1905, and went to Alaska to look for gold.</span> <span id="s38">He didn’t find any gold.</span> <span id="s39">And the earthquake came in San Francisco, and he went back home to Cologne.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Back to Germany.</span> <span id="s42">This particular person, of interest probably to future historians, stayed in Cologne.</span> <span id="s43">He hid while the Nazis were there.</span> <span id="s44">He had married a Catholic lady, and two weeks before the Americans moved in, somebody denounced him, and he was caught and died in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: When you say denounced him, what exactly does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Somebody saw him on the street, he went out, so the story goes, that he wanted to take some pictures of the destruction of some of the real estate he had.</span> <span id="s47">Another story is that he wanted to join the American troops standing outside the city and help them come in, and some of his former clients saw him, and turned him in.</span> <span id="s48">And he had been hiding underground in Cologne with the help of friendly people for four years, so that’s this person.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And this person was…</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: My uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: This was your uncle, OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: On my mother’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: And so he died in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s55">Now, to continue this particular tale, that…he had a brother, another brother of my mother’s, a chemist.</span> <span id="s56">The inventor of the first plastic fabrics -- self-made chemist.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">When the Nazis came to his house in 1936-or-7, I believe, where he had lived with a Jewish lady, they both took cyanide before the Nazis could take them.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">My mother had a third brother, who died before the First War, a writer who died of T.B., so he’s not involved in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s59">On my father’s side, there were several brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s60">I’ll start with my father first.</span> <span id="s61">He was…or had studied in Germany before the First War, first engineering, and as a Jew he couldn’t get a job -- which he should have known -- then he went into economics, and he couldn’t get a job -- before the First War.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q” Before the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Before the First War.</span> <span id="s64">Then he went into journalism, and he found a job at a newspaper, in Manheim, Germany, where he also met a cousin of my mother, his future wife, who was a publisher of a journal about the theater.</span> <span id="s65">Something like the American Journal Variety.</span> <span id="s66">This journal was called Desterreauto.</span> <span id="s67">(sp?)</span> <span id="s68">My father took over this one, too, and became a publisher.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: In what town was this?</span> <span id="s70">What city?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: In Manheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Manheim?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: First World War came along and he was drafted into the munitions industry, because of his knowledge of engineering and economics, with a company called Rhinemetal (spelling?)</span> <span id="s74">Rheinish Metals, a big munitions factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: What kind of metals?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: The Rhineland.</span> <span id="s77">Rhineland Steel in translate.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Oh, steel, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Rhinemetal means along the Rhine river and steel.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: …with whom he stayed until the end of the war -- First World War, when he had to go underground, when the Communists took over for awhile in the Rhineland, ‘cause he was a capitalist.</span> <span id="s82">When he came back he opened up his own publishing house in Dusseldorf.</span> <span id="s83">He printed books, magazines, newspapers…</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: This was back about when?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Between 1920 and 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: So I grew up as a printer’s ink.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: You worked in the shop -- in the printer’s shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Well, I was a boy still.</span> <span id="s90">I was born 1915, but I grew up in this atmosphere of newspaper business.</span> <span id="s91">And specifically my dad was interested in writing critiques for the theater and the arts in his own paper.</span> <span id="s92">He lost this in the depression, 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: He lost the newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yes, the whole publishing house.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Because his customers couldn’t pay him.</span> <span id="s97">He couldn’t pay for the paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: The advertisers couldn’t pay…</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: They paid him with goods, with wine and groceries, and furniture with which he couldn’t pay the supplies or electric company.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Uh-huh, yea, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: And then he got a job with the largest German newspaper in Berlin, Berlin Atagabulit (sp?)</span> <span id="s102">, equivalent to the New York Herald Tribune, and he became a leading person there, and in the fall of 1932, the Jewish publisher fired practically all Jewish employees, trying to save his neck.</span> <span id="s103">He knew the Nazis were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">And then my father was unemployed, but in 1934, the day that I left Germany, he started to work underground for a Dutch newspaper until 1941 --April, ’41 -- with false identification papers with which he survived In April, ’41, he and my mother took the last sealed train out of Germany via France and Spain and Portugal to come and join me and my sister in California.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: That was the last -- what train did you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Sealed.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: What’s a sealed train?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Sealed train means the Germans sealed the doors so nobody could go in and out, and the seal was not taken off from the train until they stopped in Lisbon, Portugal.</span> <span id="s109">Was special train.</span> <span id="s110">Like a prisoner’s train.</span> <span id="s111">You see?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">And my father then worked in Berkeley, California as a streetcar and bus mechanic…</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: This would be in what year then?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: From ’34 until 1945, when he died of cancer.</span> <span id="s115">He worked as a mechanic and as a warehouseman for Palmolive Peat Corporation, always hoping he’d go…could go back to Germany and go back in the newspaper business.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">And my sister who is living now in Boston, Gertrude Jonas, was born 1918 -- August 17, 1918 -- and she left Germany in 1938 and joined me in California where we both were students at the University of California.</span> <span id="s117">She made her master’s degree in music.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">And she spent two years, from ’36 to ’38, in what we call Hachshara camps.</span> <span id="s119">Are you familiar with that?</span> <span id="s120">Hachshara?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Maybe we should explain about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: That is the agricultural training camp for people who wanted to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: And they were located where?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: More than several places in Germany.</span> <span id="s125">This was near Berlin under the surveillance of the storm troopers.</span> <span id="s126">And they had to do double duty; work on the farm and work also for the Nazis -- where upon she had a nervous breakdown and was in a coma for three months prior to coming here.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: How did she get here?</span> <span id="s128">How did she make those arrangements?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Well my relatives in California, in Stockton and San Francisco and San Jose…</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Stockton?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A; Yea, Stockton, you know where that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Yes, near Sacramento, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Yea, Stockton and at Santa Clara and San Francisco we wrote affidavits.</span> <span id="s134">And in 1939, you could still get out.</span> <span id="s135">And she studied music where I was studying agriculture.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: What kind of work did she have to do for the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Oh they had to furnish food for them, and they had to take exercises and air raid exercises in air raid shelters.</span> <span id="s138">In other words, half the work in the training camp was for Jewish training and the other half was supplying supplies to the Nazi Party.</span> <span id="s139">They used them as slave labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Agricultural supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yea.</span> <span id="s142">So that’s her story.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Now, come back to my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s144">Let’s see…now wait a minute.</span> <span id="s145">I’ve gotta think.</span> <span id="s146">I want to amplify (…) on my mother’s side so to… She had relatives in the town of Aachen, A-a-c-h-e-n.</span> <span id="s147">It’s also called Aix, A-i-x, at the German-Dutch-Belgian border, the town where Charlemagne was crowned in the year 800.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">And that part of the family fled to Holland, and some of those disappeared when they were occupied by the Germans -- some survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Now coming back to my father’s side, the uncles I alluded to before.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">One brother had a department store in the town of Dusseldorf with the name of Alfred Jonas.</span> <span id="s151">He had married into the family of Coppel, C-o-p-p-e-l, like Ted Koppel on ABC in the evening?</span> <span id="s152">Maybe he’s related, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">And that family fled when their store was taken over in 1933 by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s154">Alfred Jonas died of cancer in Holland before the Nazis came, but his wife and one son were grabbed by the Nazis when they invaded Holland in 1939, and disappeared, while two daughters escaped -- or rather were underground with Dutch families and came to the United States after the war.</span> <span id="s155">They were hiding like Anne Frank, in an attic.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Another brother, Hubert Jonas, who worked with him, with the help of his Catholic wife, was hidden in Germany, and then hidden in Holland.</span> <span id="s157">So he spent half a year in a concentration camp, but she got him out again…</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Do you know which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I don’t know, there was this famous camp in Holland.</span> <span id="s160">I can’t remember the name.</span> <span id="s161">And he survived the camp.</span> <span id="s162">Was a very sick man when he came out.</span> <span id="s163">He came back to the town of Dusseldorf and died in 1953.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">And that more-or-less runs out the family story.</span> <span id="s165">Now to your question about what I, personally, experienced in 1933 to ’34 when I left.</span> <span id="s166">I left June 19, 1934 from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Oh, I’m preceding that, too.</span> <span id="s168">We can talk about what happened before the war, before the Nazis actually came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Well, before the Nazis came, as far as anti-Semitism goes, I experienced this right in the town of Dusseldorf when I was in grammar school, elementary school, where we had bloody fist-fights between myself, and communists and myself, and the good society of the industrialists -- both.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">The communists would attack Jewish kids with open bottles and knives, because we were equivalent to capitalists.</span> <span id="s171">To the people of the industrial, managerial society, we Jews were communists.</span> <span id="s172">We got it from both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">And my dad said one day, “Now if you come home again beaten up, I’m going to give you a shellacking, too.</span> <span id="s174">If you beat them up, we open a bottle of wine.”</span> <span id="s175">And that worked.</span> <span id="s176">I never got beaten up again, though I had to change schools several times.</span> <span id="s177">I have a few scars on my legs, still today, from these fights.</span> <span id="s178">And that’s when I decided that I wanted to go into agriculture, go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: That was in 19…?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: That was about 1926, ’27 already.</span> <span id="s181">And always had in my mind to come to California, join relatives that came in the 1880’s the big migration of the 1880’s, and learn agriculture.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">When I came to Berlin, to high school, in 1930, there was anti-Semitism -- plenty of it.</span> <span id="s183">And also very strong animosity between the eastern Jews and the, you might call it, indigenous German Jews -- something I still feel right here in town now-a-days.</span> <span id="s184">The clash of two civilizations, Eastern and Western.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">And we had some tough times in school.</span> <span id="s186">Being a very outspoken person, I complained to the principal about mistreatment by certain teachers who always gave me an “F”.</span> <span id="s187">And so I got transferred again.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">With the approach of 1932, it became more obvious that the National Socialists would take over.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: The Nazis…</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: …would take over.</span> <span id="s191">So I started to join a Jewish sports group and learn jujitsu and judo, against the wishes of the Jewish community who was scared to provoke the Nazis.</span> <span id="s192">And a… I remember there were many communists in uniform in school.</span> <span id="s193">The day the Nazis took over, they put on their Nazi uniform.</span> <span id="s194">(…) kind of glove.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Now my father knew, just as well as I did, that Nazis would come, and I left school the summer of ’32 to learn something practical, which meant I never finished German high school, which at that time was 13 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: You mean you’d been in school 13 years, is that…</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: No.</span> <span id="s198">If I had finished, it would have been thirteen.</span> <span id="s199">I finished after 11 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s201">You quit after 11 years there.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Yea, which was sufficient to come here.</span> <span id="s203">And I went to work in a department store, a Jewish department store, with the name of Nathan Israels, which had been founded in 1815.</span> <span id="s204">And all it’s members were British subjects, because the women were sent to England to deliver their babies there, to be sure the Germans wouldn’t touch them.</span> <span id="s205">That speaks for a long term of anti-Semitism in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">And there were two sons in this store, Wilfred and Herbert Israel.</span> <span id="s207">Wilfred was a man who founded Bet Shamin (sp?)</span> <span id="s208">the children’s village, in that time, Palestine.</span> <span id="s209">And he and the actor, the one who played the Hunchback of Notre Dame…</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Charles…</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: No, not Charles Laughton, there was a famous actor…have you seen the old film?</span> <span id="s212">Hunchback of Notre Dame ?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: It’s a Jewish actor.</span> <span id="s215">(…) Anyhow…</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Not Lon Chaney?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: No.</span> <span id="s218">They were shot down by…they were flying back from Palestine to England when the Germans shot them down.</span> <span id="s219">But he had managed to found Bet Shamin (sp?)</span> <span id="s220">and the kibbutz, Hachshara, which was the same group of German Jewish kids to whom I belonged to.</span> <span id="s221">And this man, Wilfred Israel, convinced me to come to California as soon as possible…</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Tell me just a second about the group of Jewish kids that you belonged to before we skip over that.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: That was, they’re still living in the kibbutz called Hachshara, and they had a German name called Vakfloiter (sp?)</span> <span id="s224">That means, working people.</span> <span id="s225">They were a kind of politically active, like the British Labor Party or something like this, but with a very strong, cultural, intellectual input.</span> <span id="s226">And they have now-a-days the agricultural sector, furniture factory, and a big concert hall.</span> <span id="s227">They give many concerts there.</span> <span id="s228">Have you seen them?</span> <span id="s229">Have you been over there?</span> <span id="s230">It’s an interesting place.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Well, in any case, after finishing two years in that store of apprenticeship, I decided it’s time to get out.</span> <span id="s232">In fact, I wanted to get out in 1933, but my parents wouldn’t let me.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: What town was this in now?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Berlin, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: My parents wouldn’t let me go yet.</span> <span id="s237">And in ’34 I was 19 years old and I just took off.</span> <span id="s238">I went by boat through the Panama Canal to San Francisco.</span> <span id="s239">And then I worked on farms for a year, and then went to school in California, and got my B.S. in fall of 1941, a Ph.D. in 1950.</span> <span id="s240">And that’s about…gives a rough outline of what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: I think that there’s a lot of good stories there, you know, I mean recollections about people and events, and maybe there’s some others that you could think about.</span> <span id="s242">For instance while your father was a journalist and you working, also, associated with him, what news events do you remember during this time?</span> <span id="s243">Up till 1934, or did you get news?</span> <span id="s244">I suppose that wasn’t a problem, maybe you could tell me something about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: The news events were…how do you mean…?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: World events, things that were going on in Nazi Germany, things that were going on in Europe…</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Well, of course, we could…we would get news indirectly.</span> <span id="s248">If you live in a city like Berlin, it’s like Washington D.C.</span> <span id="s249">You know people, you hear about it, you have press services, and being with a very large newspaper, of course you have lots of sources, and you know whose reporters were harassed.</span> <span id="s250">You knew that Nazi Storm Troopers would come into the place and smash up 15 presses, or beat up reporters even before they came into the government.</span> <span id="s251">And threaten people at home.</span> <span id="s252">Or say in the store that I worked in, they would come in and beat up people, and the police never interfered -- that was before 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">But the communists did the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Yea.</span> <span id="s256">It’s an old tradition in continental Europe.</span> <span id="s257">If you don’t like someone in the news business or in some other companies, people take to the streets where they invade the premises and beat people up -- especially between World War I and World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">And before World War I, the Kaiser did the same thing.</span> <span id="s259">Like my mother’s cousin who was locked up in jail for writing something the Kaiser didn’t like, because he criticized the Kaiser’s girlfriend who was a ballerina, and so the “dirty Jew” was locked up, which was a (martyr?)</span> <span id="s260">in those days, to be locked up for reporting the free press.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">So, we knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s262">You were always under tension.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Did you father have any problems with the Nazis because of his publishing business, or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Oh, well, let’s see, in the Rhineland, in Dusseldorf where he had his own business, people were more liberal.</span> <span id="s265">They were not Prussians.</span> <span id="s266">And they were much more tolerant.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">That’s another interesting aspect of the German-Jewish history that you might not be aware of, and that is: In northwestern Germany, people were much more tolerant, to have influence by French traditions from the French revolution.</span> <span id="s268">And the…along the Dutch border, people were much more tolerant.</span> <span id="s269">They never bothered the Jews.</span> <span id="s270">The big pogroms were in southern Germany, because that’s where the Crusades came through from France heading for the Holy Land.</span> <span id="s271">They never hit the north.</span> <span id="s272">So these families lived there for a long, long time, and never were bothered.</span> <span id="s273">But in Berlin, under the auspices of the court, until the early part of this century, Jews had to have a permission to live there.</span> <span id="s274">And then around 1890, 1900, it became liberalized, but Jews were still second-class citizens, and anything was permissible.</span> <span id="s275">You see what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Yea, right.</span> <span id="s277">Yea.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: But they were (…), I mean they were the maintenance of culture, civilization, medicine and so on.</span> <span id="s279">In other words, the Germans wanted to have it both ways.</span> <span id="s280">They wanted second-class citizens, but they used them as first-class experts, a kind of a schizophrenic society in (…) today.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: They do.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Oh happened (…) several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: How did the Nuremberg Laws affect your family at the time, or were those…had you already left?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Well the Nuremberg Laws didn’t affect us, because they were essentially that Jews could not be civil servants, Jews could not be teachers, Jews could not intermarry -- that didn’t affect us, as a family.</span> <span id="s285">It made it tough for both my uncles who had Christian wives.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: In what respect?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Well the wives were harassed as if they had been Jews…</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: …but they were not locked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: I know we’ve discussed certain members of your family.</span> <span id="s291">Are there some that we haven’t discussed as to whether they perished in the Holocaust, or whether they got out, or have we discussed all the members of your family: cousins and aunts and uncles -- and what became of them…?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: No, the others.</span> <span id="s293">No.</span> <span id="s294">This is all that lived at that time.</span> <span id="s295">That means a total of four of them died in concentration camps or disappeared, and the others got out and survived in some fashion or another.</span> <span id="s296">And others had died before already.</span> <span id="s297">Now these other people I mentioned to you, there was everyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: O.K.</span> <span id="s299">What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Was your family secular or religious in practice or orientation?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Well, I’d say equivalent to Reform in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: O.K.</span> <span id="s304">Did you have any formal Jewish education yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: No, not really, because the two rabbis in the town of Dusseldorf, I didn’t care for.</span> <span id="s306">And as happens in many families, while my parents were not enthused about Jewish education, my sister and I went the other way.</span> <span id="s307">We educated ourselves by going to lectures and the Jewish youth group, and of course in Berlin there was the Institute of Jewish Studies headed by Rabbi Leo Baeck and Yochan Prinz (sp?)</span> <span id="s308">, and we learned quite a lot there, so at the end, we knew more than our parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Were there regular programs that you went to at the Institute, or did you…</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s311">They had as long as I was…well until about 1938, I would guess, it was like a college: courses, theater, lectures; like an extension service, owned by the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s312">Very active.</span> <span id="s313">Symphony concerts and so on.</span> <span id="s314">And that (…) Jewish Community Center, only more intensively so --or Saint Paul, the Community Center.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">And then we both accumulated a large Jewish library, and I still have one right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: That you were able to bring with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well, some…some we brought over.</span> <span id="s318">My parents a big container via Siberia to California.</span> <span id="s319">Some of the things were stolen by the Russians or Germans and some came in.</span> <span id="s320">And then of course, I’ve bought much in the meantime, continuously.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Did you have contact with gentile people during the time you were in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Well, in the beginning, of course, before ’33.</span> <span id="s323">We had contact with gentiles.</span> <span id="s324">And the one year that I was under the Nazis, ’33 to ’34, I had contact, but it became less and less and less.</span> <span id="s325">People were scared.</span> <span id="s326">When my sister left in ’38, she had even less contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: In what kind of settings would you have contact with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Well they wouldn’t dare to come to the apartment anymore.</span> <span id="s329">You would meet them in restaurants, or you would meet them at work.</span> <span id="s330">Meet them on the street.</span> <span id="s331">But they wouldn’t come to your house.</span> <span id="s332">If they came, they would come at night to the back door -- when nobody was watching.</span> <span id="s333">Similar to the situation of Russia today.</span> <span id="s334">People couldn’t come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">But I had some contacts, too, I might say, where we had some fist-fights where I’d use my judo to good advantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: What kind of incidents were those?</span> <span id="s337">How did those…?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Well you’d go out…Nazi Storm Troopers or young Nazis in school, or at work or anywhere else, they could attack you any time they wanted to.</span> <span id="s339">And they call you dirty names and start pushing you, like young people do, and then you have to defend yourself -- which was not permissible, according to the rules of the Jewish community, because we’re not gonna supposed to provoke the enemy.</span> <span id="s340">Another reason why I left so early.</span> <span id="s341">I didn’t want to participate in this lying down.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Did you have any discussions with other people in the Jewish community about what was going on at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Well, not formal discussions.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Well, I mean among friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Here?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: No, in the Jewish community in Germany when you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Well of course, synagogues were still open, and the study centers and so on.</span> <span id="s348">Of course.</span> <span id="s349">You exchanged an information: which streets were safe, which streets were not safe, which stores were safe, which one was not, which grocery store to go to and get food, and which you wouldn’t get any food.</span> <span id="s350">Sure.</span> <span id="s351">Because the big department stores didn’t start until I left -- until after I left!</span> <span id="s352">You see.</span> <span id="s353">The big deportations started about 1938, after the Crystal Night when all the Jewish establishments were busted out.</span> <span id="s354">So, that’s when it really became bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: That was about in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: ’38, November ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: So, was there discussion with you and your friends about leaving Germany and, ah…</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Sure, we’re discussing this, and some left, and some said, “Augh, will blow over.”</span> <span id="s359">Some were scared, some didn’t want to leave their families behind.</span> <span id="s360">Some insist on going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s361">Some made it and some didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Now you had contemplated going to Palestine, didn’t you, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: I wanted to go after I’d finished studying agriculture, but I never made it, because the war came along, and my family came over, and I had to take care of them first.</span> <span id="s364">So I didn’t get to Israel until 1956.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Oh, O.K., so you were thinking about going from this country, from the United States…</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I wanted to study here and then go over, but then the war came, you couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s367">And during the war, I was working for the United States Navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: You were.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yea.</span> <span id="s370">Civil Service, in the electronics and engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: From Pearl Harbor until Christmas, ’46.</span> <span id="s373">Then I went back to school.</span> <span id="s374">So, things never come out the way you want them to come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Did you have any problems with security clearances, or did you need security clearances?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Here?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: When working for the Navy, or was that taken care of…</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: No, I was a civilian already, I became a citizen in ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: O.K., you were already a citizen, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s381">Of course there was also some anti-Semitism involved.</span> <span id="s382">I was here five years by 1939, and I lived in the International House at the University of California at Berkeley.</span> <span id="s383">You might know it.</span> <span id="s384">And the immigration people at that time were in the Labor department, and they thought I was a communist, because of International House.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: And they lost my papers, probably, until one of my professors found out about it.</span> <span id="s387">He had a hunch.</span> <span id="s388">We told them the International House belonged to the Rockefeller family.</span> <span id="s389">Two weeks later I was a citizen.</span> <span id="s390">(Laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s391">B: And so I had no security problems -- being a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">I married in May, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">The tape’s getting full?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Yes, I have to turn over the tape.</span> <span id="s395">It will just take a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">( End Of Side One)</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: This is an interview with Dr. Herbert Jonas for the JCRC-ADL Holocaust History Project by David Zarkin at Dr. Jonas’ office in Saint Paul on May 6, 1983.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Let’s continue the discussion of your recollections of families and relatives and friends in the pre-war and post-war time that you recall.</span> <span id="s399">After you got to this country, did you hear from people in Germany about what was going on?</span> <span id="s400">Was there any communications?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: No, not really, because nobody dared to write anything in the mail, because the mail was censored.</span> <span id="s402">It was the only thing you could find out is when people came over.</span> <span id="s403">However there were not many refugees coming to San Francisco, that area.</span> <span id="s404">They all went on to Hollywood -- if they went to California -- and Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s405">So I was rather a rare animal.</span> <span id="s406">In fact, San Francisco radio station, KGO, had a teacher in school -- in college that time --that me, come to the studio and tell them about Germany on circuit for the eleven western states, early in 1935, because they had never met a refugee from Nazi Germany until I came.</span> <span id="s407">The other refugees were all people had come over in the 1880’s, 1890’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">But later on, of course, people came over.</span> <span id="s409">And I met many people, and I hear about it, what they went through.</span> <span id="s410">There was family members disappeared -- the usual story.</span> <span id="s411">But you couldn’t get it by mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Not by mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No, because every letter was opened.</span> <span id="s414">And during the war, from ’39 to ’41 until my parents came, we could exchange a few letters through the Red Cross -- Red Cross mail -- but they were censored, too.</span> <span id="s415">So I got more information from the American press than I got by mail.</span> <span id="s416">You see?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: And your parents came over in what year did they come over?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: April, ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Is there anything more we should tell about their story?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: No, that’s about it.</span> <span id="s421">If they had been harassed personally, physically, they never told me.</span> <span id="s422">But since my dad had false papers, and his other connections, and he looked very German, had long, flax-blond hair and blue eyes, coming from northern Germany.</span> <span id="s423">They never suspected him of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s424">And my mother kept in the background.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">B: So, I just remember an incident what happened after the First War -- that’s interesting, too.</span> <span id="s426">In the town of Dusseldorf there was a Jewish grocery store across the street from us owned by a man with the name of Erdman (sp?)</span> <span id="s427">, and the communist hordes who tried to take over western Germany beat him up, destroyed one eye, and burnt up his store -- in 1921 or ’20.</span> <span id="s428">When I went back a few years ago, I visited that place, and I met the people who had taken over his store at that time and who are retired now.</span> <span id="s429">I met them purely by accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">B: And I asked them “Do you remember old Mr. Erdman -- when I was a little boy?”</span> <span id="s431">“Oh, you mean that dirty…” They didn’t say anymore.</span> <span id="s432">And they changed their language, realizing who I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">So you see, the anti-Semitism is endemic.</span> <span id="s434">There was nothing new about it.</span> <span id="s435">So…we lived with it and didn’t think much about it.</span> <span id="s436">From the sociological point of view, I would say that the older people accepted it.</span> <span id="s437">The younger people, born during the First World War, right afterwards, did not accept it.</span> <span id="s438">And they’re the ones who left early.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">If you look at the statistics of the people who were caught by the Nazis and put into camps, you will notice that they put into camps people who were in their 40’s and 50’s and old people and young children.</span> <span id="s440">The people who were like me, late teenagers, early twenties, were not caught by the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: With a few exceptions, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: With a few exceptions.</span> <span id="s443">They all had skipped out -- I mean, in Berlin and western Germany-- in the beginning, when they start rounding up -- the beginning in ’33 to ’35, ’36, they, as I did, skipped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">B: There’s an interesting sidelight to this.</span> <span id="s445">In April of ’41, I went through Denmark on a bicycle to join a group of Jewish young people from all around Europe who were meeting in a Danish Army camp with the help of the Danish army and the Jewish community in Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s446">Try to exchange information, what to do, where to go, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">B: I was smart enough not to go in the traditional Jewish, young Jewish short pants, blue shirts and so on, so on, as all the youth groups over there had their own, what you might call a uniform I came in regular street clothes with a necktie which I took off in the camp, put back on again when I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">We had to go by ferryboat from Denmark to Germany, and of course the Nazi storm troopers checked everyone coming off the ferry.</span> <span id="s449">They didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s450">I took my bike and went to suburban railroad station in Stetein (sp?)</span> <span id="s451">, and I took a train to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Two of my best friends were with me.</span> <span id="s453">They were too proud to put on regular street clothes.</span> <span id="s454">They were in their shorts, hiking clothes.</span> <span id="s455">They disappeared in April of ’41.</span> <span id="s456">So you had to…</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: …know what happened?</span> <span id="s458">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Disappeared.</span> <span id="s460">Never came back.</span> <span id="s461">Probably got shot, beaten up.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">B: And another good friend of mine -- of Italian background -- Edsel Zarainey (sp?)</span> <span id="s463">whose father was the physician at the royal court.</span> <span id="s464">This young man was a founder of the Hehalutz movement; it’s a Jewish pioneer, Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s465">And I met him many times in Berlin.</span> <span id="s466">We were very good friends.</span> <span id="s467">Spoke fluent German and English.</span> <span id="s468">He organized the underground young Jewish youth movement -- the underground railroad from Germany to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">When the Jewish Brigade was formed, by the British, during the war to fight the Germans, he volunteered as a paratrooper.</span> <span id="s470">He parachuted into Yugoslavia and was caught and executed after a long, long torture.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">I found out about this after the war.</span> <span id="s472">Friends told me.</span> <span id="s473">Similar to that story of this girl from Palestine, I forgot her name, who also parachuted into Hungary and was caught.</span> <span id="s474">I can’t remember her name now.</span> <span id="s475">But these are some indirect things that affected my life quite a lot -- indirectly.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">And I might say right here for the record, that since I came to this country, I never denied that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s477">I never denied that I am for Israel.</span> <span id="s478">I always show my disdain for people who try to hide and say they’re not Jewish.</span> <span id="s479">My students know it.</span> <span id="s480">In my lectures I mention things that go on in Israel from the agricultural point of view.</span> <span id="s481">And I feel much better about it, and I’ve found people have a much higher regard for me than if I would trying to hide it.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">There was a case a few years ago.</span> <span id="s483">One of my neighbors called my wife a “dirty Jew-girl” -- right here in Saint Paul.</span> <span id="s484">And she told ‘em “Shut up, you dirty (foghorn?)</span> <span id="s485">,” and he shut up.</span> <span id="s486">He became very polite since then.</span> <span id="s487">I would say if you speak up, they don’t bother you.</span> <span id="s488">We both learned this over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Now my wife does not like to talk about these things, because she lost many, many more people in her family…</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: She lost many more people…</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Many, many more people, and has affected her psychologically very much, so she doesn’t want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: She lost about three-quarters of her family.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: How did you and your wife meet?</span> <span id="s495">Or where did you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: We were both students in Berkeley.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Oh I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Where my sister was a student.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Can you tell me what it means to you to be a survivor of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: What it means?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: It’s a good question.</span> <span id="s503">You can answer that in many ways.</span> <span id="s504">If you ask Cooperman, he would give you many interpretations.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">I feel that being a German Jew, we are the last of a breed.</span> <span id="s506">We’re living fossils.</span> <span id="s507">There aren’t any more.</span> <span id="s508">The Russian Jews, there’s some Polish Jews, they’re Hungarian Jews, but German Jews, there aren’t anymore.</span> <span id="s509">The Jews living in Germany now, there are about 5,000.</span> <span id="s510">There used to be about 600,000.</span> <span id="s511">Half of them are displaced persons from the east, a thousand Israelis who study there and do business.</span> <span id="s512">German Jews are very, very few.</span> <span id="s513">So the tradition, and developments of German Jewry is finished -- after 2,000 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">And, if you think about this, it gives you a certain outlook on life, a certain stubbornness -- to some people -- and some people again will feel very depressed about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Would you be in the first category, the people who…</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yea.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Yea, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: I’m the first category.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: And I make it a practice -- I belong to the Leo Baeck Institute (you might know about this)…</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: You should know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Well…</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: The Leo Baeck Institute exists in New York, London and Jerusalem, and it is a very serious element, U.S. government supported enterprise, that collects all documentation concerning German speaking Jews from east Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary (…) or the composer Mendelssohn, or Einstein -- as much documentation, on tape like this, or written documents.</span> <span id="s525">And they put out a whole series of year books, quarterly journals, and they incorporate and publish by now maybe about 50 books (…) honored, and has become the only research depositary on German speaking Jewry.</span> <span id="s526">But that’s nothing compared to…in Polish, or Russian Jewries, or French.</span> <span id="s527">There’s a French Holocaust Institute in Paris.</span> <span id="s528">I have been there.</span> <span id="s529">They’re collecting, but they’re not at that extent.</span> <span id="s530">And of course there was money available here when it started.</span> <span id="s531">So some of the things I mention here are deposited there by documentation in the Leo Baeck Institute in New York.</span> <span id="s532">Also things from, as I mention the beginning, relatives whom we discovered here.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">There’s another Herbert Jonas at Fort Dodge, Iowa, a veterinarian who we discovered as related.</span> <span id="s534">And he knows very much about the family.</span> <span id="s535">I have some of the documents from him.</span> <span id="s536">And there’s another one, Jared Jonas, in San Francisco, who’s also related to me, and his wife is related to my mother’s side, indicating again the close knit intermarriage of these old Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">And my mother’s side we found out, is also relationship to the Port Heinrich Hilet (sp?)</span> <span id="s538">who was born in Dusseldorf, my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">And some of those people, from both mother’s and father’s side must have had cross-overs, hundred, two-three-hundred years ago, because all refer to the town of Kleve which is near the Dutch border on the Rhine river where apparently the long-range saga existed, too -- old Roman settlements.</span> <span id="s540">And it’s almost impossible to take apart this interwoven family ties.</span> <span id="s541">That’s a whole story by itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Well, that’s interesting, the fact that your family goes back many, many years in Germany, in Holland, too, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: In Holland, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Yea.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Of course the Dutch-German border shifted back and forth, and people speak both languages.</span> <span id="s546">And these people in San Francisco, relatives who were again related to the department store my uncle had, his wife’s family we found out is related to those people in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s547">That San Francisco’s the family Sloss (sp?)</span> <span id="s548">who came the 1880’s who built up the Seattle and Alaska shipping trade, lumber and fur, whaling.</span> <span id="s549">We found out they’re related to my mother’s family in Kualt (sp?)</span> <span id="s550">which we didn’t know when we came here.</span> <span id="s551">I found out later on.</span> <span id="s552">They come from the same neck of the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: So you’ve done some studying then on the genealogy then of your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Well a little bit on the genealogies, same as my relative from Fort Dodge, Iowa, and slowly things piece together, you see, but I never have the time to go into the old libraries in Germany and whatever’s left over after the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">I have a nephew in Boston who did this as a hobby as a teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Doing -- doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: He went to Germany and studied it as a teenager, trying to figure out his family background.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: And, he’s now well known bio-chemist at M.I.T, Bobby Weinberg (sp?)</span> <span id="s560">Even had him…you had him even on KUOM, indirectly, from All Things Considered.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Oh I see.</span> <span id="s562">On national public radio there.</span> <span id="s563">He was featured on that news and public affairs program that’s broadcast nationally and heard locally.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: About the gene structure of cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Oh I see.</span> <span id="s566">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: He’s my nephew who did these studies.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: On the genealogy of your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: O.K.</span> <span id="s571">So how far was he able to trace them back, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Oh, to the early 1700’s</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: To the early 1700’s, your family -- in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: And his figures seem to jive with the ones that they have in Fort Dodge.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: In Fort Dodge.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yea, the other Herbert Jonas.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: And they’ve also done genealogy work, too.</span> <span id="s578">And they’ve traced your family back…</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: About the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Yea, back to the early 1700’s</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: They’re some missing links which we only can put in by conjecture.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Do you have any photos or mementos or other things from say, pre-World War area of…</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No, just the family photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s585">Have you had the chance to read any of the books, novels, or other kinds of accounts of those years, or see any films, and if so, do you think they accurately depict --or do any of them?</span> <span id="s586">Or would you…</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Do you mean films that you…like Holocaust films on T.V. or so on?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Yes, and novels, and also biographical accounts that have been written regarding the Holocaust or the… A; Well, I would say those things which, like this big series from Hollywood, there’s too much Hollywood drama in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: The essence is all right.</span> <span id="s591">Films here show ‘em very good.</span> <span id="s592">I’ve seen one very good series of films in Switzerland two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Do you recall what the film was?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: It was in German.</span> <span id="s595">It was very, very accurate.</span> <span id="s596">No theatrical play, no love stories put in.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: That was…one film was which was also shown here called The Boat is Full ?</span> <span id="s599">Have you seen it?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: No, I haven’t.</span> <span id="s601">The Boat is Full.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: That meant the Swiss were not letting any German Jewish ref -- or any refugees come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: After the Swiss population found out about it, they smuggled them in illegally.</span> <span id="s605">These were that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Then I saw…I go over there quite often.</span> <span id="s607">Another film made in Germany about Dachau, the Dachau concentration camp near Munich.</span> <span id="s608">Very accurate.</span> <span id="s609">Very documentary.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And that was a German made film.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: A German made film.</span> <span id="s612">In fact, I was over in Switzerland, in Germany this past winter, and they showed a whole series of German concentration camp films, which were superb documentaries.</span> <span id="s613">Nothing Hollywood about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">And their reaction to our big Holocaust series on T.V. was; “A very good film, but why you put a love story in there?”</span> <span id="s615">You see what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Yes, yea, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: You, as a journalist, understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Yes, yes, I do, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A; And they have very much literature over there on Holocaust books, now.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: They have a lot of literature on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Oh, full of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: In Germany.</span> <span id="s623">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: And France, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: And France.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Now as far as biographies go, there are two books which are authentical.</span> <span id="s627">One is written by the widow of Enrico Fermi who developed the atomic bomb in Chicago -- Italian Jew -- who wrote about famous German Jewish scientists who were involved in the Holocaust -- or Jewish scientists, not just German Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Another one came out by the Springer Verlag in Germany about Jewish scientists.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: That was by who?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Springer Verlag.</span> <span id="s631">You have seen this Springer, S-p-r-i-n-g-er Publishing House.</span> <span id="s632">Puts out a lot of scientific books.</span> <span id="s633">They published a book on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">I have seen nothing comparable documentary in book form in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Now I have given my library of the Leo Baeck Institute to Mount Zion Temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: When you say your library, you’re talking about all the books that you’ve collected.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: All of the books I got from there, which are still kept.</span> <span id="s638">I give it to them.</span> <span id="s639">And the Bible here from Mount Zion temple, Saint Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: I’ve probably read some of the books that you’ve contributed then.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: The only ones written in German, none were written in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Oh, O.K. Maybe not.</span> <span id="s643">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: That’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: I guess that is about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: I cannot say anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: O.K. Well I appreciate this.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: That’s long enough.</span> <span id="s649">You know a quarter-to-three.</span> <span id="s650">We start at one.</span> <span id="s651">One-thirty.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: One-thirty, yes.</span> <span id="s653">I just have to put an end tag on here.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Set up a (…) examination here.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Oh, O.K.
