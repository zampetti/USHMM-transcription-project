<p><span id="s12">Question: I’d like you to just begin by introducing yourself, and -- and telling us where and when you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: My name is Max Heller.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1919.</span> <span id="s15">I come from a relatively small family, just a sister, and of course my parents.</span> <span id="s16">I grew up in a very Orthodox home.</span> <span id="s17">My parents observed the Shabbas, they would not work on the Sabbath; in fact, they would not even light -- put the light on.</span> <span id="s18">In fact, what -- that sort of gives me wonderful memories.</span> <span id="s19">My father was more Orthodox than -- than my mother.</span> <span id="s20">My father had the philosophy that God takes care of everything, and my mother said God takes care of those who take care of themselves.</span> <span id="s21">So I’m sort of an in-between.</span> <span id="s22">If I lean to anything I lean to, you must take care of yourself rather than -- and my father would run across the street against the light because he knew God would take care of him.</span> <span id="s23">But it’s interesting, that kind of faith helped us when things got very bad.</span> <span id="s24">Our home was a very happy home.</span> <span id="s25">We were not wealthy by any means, I would say we were middle income people, both my mother and my father worked.</span> <span id="s26">They had their own business, which was a -- a textile business, but they sold to individuals on a credit basis, and they had several salesmen that went out and sold the merchandise and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s27">I -- as I told you, I was brought up Orthodox.</span> <span id="s28">In fact, I had a Hebrew teacher from the time I was eight years old to prepare me for -- for my Bar Mitzvah, he came to my house three times a week.</span> <span id="s29">I remember that teacher, because he taught me a lot, not just the Hebrew part, but also, after the lesson he would sit with me and talk to me about what Judaism is all about, the ethics, the morals, and the stories, and I was fascinated with that.</span> <span id="s30">And I would say that today I’m a strong Jew, more on the side of the morals and the ethics, and how you’re supposed to behave, than the rituals.</span> <span id="s31">I -- I have nothing against rituals, I -- I observe but not -- not as much as I -- I try to live like this man taught me, so I’m -- I’m trying to give you a picture of what life was like in our house.</span> <span id="s32">My sister was two years old than I am.</span> <span id="s33">She -- she probably did not experience things the way I did because as a youngster I was involved in a lot of fights because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s34">I experienced a lot more anti-Semitism than my sister did.</span> <span id="s35">So it -- in that respect, perhaps we grew up a little bit different.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Why would you have experienced more than your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Well, my sister, if there was any -- any anti-Semitic action on the street, she certainly would run home rather than get out and fight.</span> <span id="s38">So -- so it was a -- really different, she was not exposed as much as -- as I was.</span> <span id="s39">And I -- I -- you know, I-I sort of lived through it.</span> <span id="s40">I belonged to -- when I got older I belonged to a sport club called Ha-Koah, the word stands for strength, and I was in the wrestling section.</span> <span id="s41">So all of these guys -- I was like a mascot.</span> <span id="s42">In those days they were really national champs.</span> <span id="s43">They didn’t shy away from defending yourself.</span> <span id="s44">And it’s interesting when I think about it now, is what made my Judaism stronger then, and still is today is you cannot shy away.</span> <span id="s45">You must face, you must face anti-Semitism, if it exists.</span> <span id="s46">You -- you cannot just walk away from it.</span> <span id="s47">And even today when I see something that I feel -- and I’ve been in company of people that say things like, oh, I Jewed him down, as an example.</span> <span id="s48">I speak up.</span> <span id="s49">And perhaps this goes back to my childhood when I was -- I spoke up, and I defended myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: But what at that point gave you the strength to defend yoursel -- yourself, instead of to --</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Well, I -- th-that’s a very good question.</span> <span id="s52">You know, people say I’m proud to be a Jew, right?</span> <span id="s53">That’s -- but you have to know why you are proud, and I think because of my upbringing, both my mother and father, and then this teacher that I’m talking about, I felt good being Jewish.</span> <span id="s54">I never -- I never had to shy away, it was something that I was very proud of, but I knew why.</span> <span id="s55">And so this, I think, made the difference, it’s the upbringing that makes the difference.</span> <span id="s56">I was very happy.</span> <span id="s57">Even today I have people that -- I live in a small town in the south, and we have a college in our town called Bob Jones University, and they always send people out trying to convert you.</span> <span id="s58">They knock on my door.</span> <span id="s59">And both Trude, my wife and I, when we answer the door, we say, you have the wrong address.</span> <span id="s60">We are very happy with what we are.</span> <span id="s61">Maybe you’re happy with what you are.</span> <span id="s62">And so this -- you know, it carries forward, there’s no question about it.</span> <span id="s63">And we -- I think our children feel the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Let’s go back.</span> <span id="s65">You were talking about the fact that your family was very observant.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Do you have fond memories of some of those observances?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Probably the happiest time of my life, this may sound ridiculous, when we were the poorest.</span> <span id="s69">And this was during the depression, I -- in Europe the depression started perhaps a little earlier than it did in the United States.</span> <span id="s70">But my parents had practically lost their business.</span> <span id="s71">And they refused to go into bankruptcy.</span> <span id="s72">And so we had to give up our apartment, and we moved into one room.</span> <span id="s73">My sister, myself, my mother and father, and occasionally my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s74">And on the Sabbath, in this one room, when during the day we would not light -- there was no light, the most beautiful time was when later in the afternoon -- we went to synagogue in the morning, but later in the afternoon we would crawl in bed with Mother and Father, and my father would tell these stories about he served four years in the war -- in -- on the side of Germany, incidentally.</span> <span id="s75">But my mother would sing the most beautiful Jewish songs, and most of them are very sad, but they were beautiful.</span> <span id="s76">And we -- my -- we used to si -- we were lying in bed crying, not because we were unhappy, because we were happy.</span> <span id="s77">And I’ve learned a lot from that.</span> <span id="s78">I -- I’ve learned to become really sentimental about my -- my Yiddish [indecipherable] and to appreciate li -- really life, because the songs deal with life.</span> <span id="s79">So I would say i-if you say what gave it to me, and what -- what my life was like, this I think determined the way I am.</span> <span id="s80">Those times.</span> <span id="s81">I remember at the end of the day on the Sabbath, they turned the lights on, and they would sit down at a table and they would divide the money they had earned -- they went to work for other people, and they divided the money that they had to pay the creditors.</span> <span id="s82">And when things got better, my mother and father were able to get back into business.</span> <span id="s83">My father was very proud of the name, he wouldn’t think of bankruptcy.</span> <span id="s84">And again, that I think taught me a great deal.</span> <span id="s85">So these were -- these were happy times, although they were tough times.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Tell me about the Jewish life in Vienna in general.</span> <span id="s87">A: Well, Jewish people were about 10 percent of the population.</span> <span id="s88">And it was a very rich life.</span> <span id="s89">The Jews were involved in -- in the music, they were involved in -- in politics, they were involved certainly in the arts and sciences, and in teaching.</span> <span id="s90">And Jews, generally speaking, I would say, were quite influential.</span> <span id="s91">They were also -- not all of them were successful, but they were mostly successful people, and -- and very law abiding.</span> <span id="s92">We didn’t -- we had nobody to be ashamed of.</span> <span id="s93">So Jewish life was a rich life, I would say, although I must tell you, sa -- when -- I go back now to -- to this sa -- during the day on Saturday, the thing that really touched me is my mother would tell us stories about her life as a teenager in a little town in Poland.</span> <span id="s94">She grew up in a town called Lubachow.</span> <span id="s95">Her parents, I would say, were poor people.</span> <span id="s96">Very, very observant.</span> <span id="s97">I still remember my grandfather, very much so because he was a very imposing man with a white beard, and -- but he always would tell me these stories, and my mother would tell us what happened to her as a child.</span> <span id="s98">She was sent away from home when she was not even 10 years old because the fear that they had of pogroms, when soldiers would come and rape girls.</span> <span id="s99">They -- she and her sisters would hide under the house.</span> <span id="s100">And so one day they were sent to -- to Kraków to a -- to a member of the family, and my mother, at age 10 or so, had to work for that family, although she lived with them.</span> <span id="s101">She was like a -- she took care of the baby, she helped clean the house.</span> <span id="s102">So when you hear from your own mother what -- what she went through -- but my mother was never bitter.</span> <span id="s103">The -- the thing that my mother always said, but look, here we are.</span> <span id="s104">And thank God we are alive.</span> <span id="s105">I -- I survived that.</span> <span id="s106">So these are -- these are all part of my -- my make-up, and it was very meaningful to me to hear what my parents went through.</span> <span id="s107">My father went -- was in the service for four years as I told you, he was wounded in the war.</span> <span id="s108">And yet, when Hitler came, it made absolutely no -- no difference.</span> <span id="s109">Neither my mother nor my father went to public school because the public school would not have them.</span> <span id="s110">And both my parents were self educated, and went in business self educated.</span> <span id="s111">So as a result of that, education was the most important thing in our family.</span> <span id="s112">So it -- it all comes back.</span> <span id="s113">You know, people say, well, the Jewish people are so intent on education.</span> <span id="s114">This is a good reason.</span> <span id="s115">That’s why.</span> <span id="s116">And my mother would even write in her -- she -- she sometimes would keep a journal, which we found only recently, and it was very touching what she said.</span> <span id="s117">She says, one day I had -- I prayed that my children would have a good education.</span> <span id="s118">It’s the most important thing in the world.</span> <span id="s119">So -- so perhaps this gives you a -- a picture of what -- what it was like, life for me in our house, and generally life in Vienna.</span> <span id="s120">But we had good times in Vienna, too, we used to -- we used to go to balls, and -- during Mardi Gras season.</span> <span id="s121">In fact, every summer we would have a house in the country, and that’s where I met my -- my wife, when I was -- I was 17 and she was 14.</span> <span id="s122">And the day I met her I told her I was going to marry her, and her father overheard it, and I was not his favorite person after that.</span> <span id="s123">She was -- she was the only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: You spoke of education.</span> <span id="s125">I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that, and whether you went to integrated schools --</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: -- or whether you went only to Jewish institutions?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s129">No, I went -- when my -- my grammar school was boys only, and that’s not unusual, it was a public school.</span> <span id="s130">I went to grammar school for four years, it was totally integrated.</span> <span id="s131">We had -- in fact I had many non-Jewish friends when I went to school.</span> <span id="s132">And then after -- at age 10 is when I finished grammar school, and stood an exam to enter into a private high school called gymnasium.</span> <span id="s133">And that too was integrated.</span> <span id="s134">We had religion -- we took religion in school in contrast to America, and this is -- that’s one reason why I feel so strong about not mixing religion with the state, because we -- when we went to school, we had religion, but we had to leave our room, and we went to Jewish class, so to speak, when others went to the Christian class.</span> <span id="s135">That was not very good, but -- but the school was integrated.</span> <span id="s136">I experienced anti-Semitism then, where you know, you’d find scribbled notes, you Jew, or Jew go back to Palestine, and things like that.</span> <span id="s137">Some of the professors we had, I felt were anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s138">Maybe it’s because I didn't study that much, but some of them, on the other hand, I felt were very sympathetic.</span> <span id="s139">So my schooling -- I finished school not because I was genius, but the system was that you can finish high school after four years, and I went to work as an apprentice.</span> <span id="s140">And I made the equivalent of maybe 20 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s141">And while I, however, while I was working I went to a business school for three years.</span> <span id="s142">And while I was not a very good student in the gymnasium, business school was really what I wanted, and I -- I -- I did quite well.</span> <span id="s143">So I worked and went to school at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: And what was the work?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: I -- the sc -- the business that I worked for, they had five and 10 cent stores which they started, and in fact they were among the first.</span> <span id="s146">And they also would sell merchandise on consignment and put people in business.</span> <span id="s147">And my work when I first started was sweeping floors and cleaning bathrooms and that sort of thing, but within -- when I was 17, I was in charge of a department and I had learned about import/export, because a lot of the merchandise which we sold was imported.</span> <span id="s148">And I had taken all kinds of courses which enabled me to become a buyer for -- for that company.</span> <span id="s149">And a good many of the people that worked -- the company was owned by a Jewish man, and the people that worked there were both Jews and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s150">And I must tell you this, we haven’t come to Hitler yet, but Hitler came in on a -- on a Friday, on, I believe it was March the 11th.</span> <span id="s151">On Monday I went to work, we didn’t know what to do, so you go, like you always go, I went to work.</span> <span id="s152">And the same people that I had worked with for several years already -- this was 1937 -- is when -- ’38, excuse me, when Hitler came.</span> <span id="s153">The same people that I had worked with for several years suddenly appeared in Nazi uniforms with the swastika band.</span> <span id="s154">The same people that I had lunch with every day, that I -- that I went out with, the very same people.</span> <span id="s155">And that was a shock.</span> <span id="s156">And this -- this just tells you really, what went on, and how -- how life was.</span> <span id="s157">In a way we kidded ourselves.</span> <span id="s158">We -- we kidded.</span> <span id="s159">Although we had all of these fights and troubles, but never thought that it would get to a point as it did.</span> <span id="s160">What also happened is a man who worked for the owner of our company, that our owner had put in business, came in one day and took over the business.</span> <span id="s161">Came in with a group of Nazis in black and brown uniforms and just took the business.</span> <span id="s162">And ironically made out a receipt, and fired everybody, except three of us.</span> <span id="s163">And we were put into one office, in one room, and we -- and the reason they didn’t fire us is the people they put in charge had to learn something.</span> <span id="s164">So I’m -- I’m trying to really give you a picture of -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- when I think about it, I’m really amazed myself of how we were so foolish prior to Hitler not to recognize, or not to sense that there was more to this than just having a fight in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Let’s just backtrack, cause of course I -- I want you to tell me much more about when Hitler came in.</span> <span id="s166">You mentioned that there were fights in the s -- in the street, or scribbled notes.</span> <span id="s167">Can you talk a little bit more about other hints, or -- or outright incidents of anti-Semitism prior to Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Well, of course the Nazi party had started many, many years ago.</span> <span id="s169">And in fact, they killed a chancellor, his name was Dollfuss, several years before Hitler came into Austria.</span> <span id="s170">But it was after 1933, where Hitler came into Germany, where he took over the German government.</span> <span id="s171">And those people, his followers, killed Dollfuss, and they were put in jail.</span> <span id="s172">So there was always that unrest, and there was always -- Austria had maybe 10 - 15 political parties, and there were marches in the streets.</span> <span id="s173">It’s -- it’s quite different than it is here.</span> <span id="s174">And it always resulted in -- in fights and even killings.</span> <span id="s175">There was -- the anti-Semitism that you could feel in Austria was that sometimes you could not live where you wanted to live.</span> <span id="s176">You were rejected on a job because you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s177">So it -- it wa -- it wa -- those kind of things.</span> <span id="s178">But we lived with it, and this was -- you almost get used to a way of life, that’s just the way it was.</span> <span id="s179">And so you -- you live with it.</span> <span id="s180">When people came -- we had somebody in the place where I worked who had come from Germany, from Leipzig and he told us stories about that Jewish businesses were taken over, and Jews were beaten and all that.</span> <span id="s181">I must tell you the truth, we didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s182">We thought oh, there must be something wrong with that man.</span> <span id="s183">Why would they do anything like that?</span> <span id="s184">So there was a difference between political national socialism and the anti-Semitic part of anti -- o-of that fascism.</span> <span id="s185">It was either political, but it was also anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s186">So it was in that atmosphere that we grew up.</span> <span id="s187">Maybe I felt it more than others because I was in a Jewish club, and maybe because of the section where I lived.</span> <span id="s188">Maybe I was more aware of it because of the education that I had.</span> <span id="s189">And my mother, the stories that she would tell me, I -- I was sort of on the -- I -- I had like an antenna.</span> <span id="s190">You -- you get sensitive where you -- where you feel these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Were you beaten up?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: I was beaten up and I beat up.</span> <span id="s193">I did it both ways.</span> <span id="s194">Oh definitely.</span> <span id="s195">I -- I came home sometimes with a bloody nose.</span> <span id="s196">But I also came home where I felt very triumphant, where I gave somebody a bloody nose.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: But none of this taunting -- was that disturbing to you, or that surprising to you?</span> <span id="s198">Didn’t you come home and -- and talk to your family and say why is this happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: No, not really, because I knew the history of the Jews.</span> <span id="s200">Not only my mother’s experience in Poland, but I knew about the Spanish Inquisition.</span> <span id="s201">I knew what happened in Europe, in many countries where Jews lived, and then came another king or another prince or another chancellor, and Jews had to leave.</span> <span id="s202">I knew all that.</span> <span id="s203">I had -- I had heard stories from my grandfather in Poland, who told me what -- what he had experienced.</span> <span id="s204">So this -- you know, this was the history of the Jews.</span> <span id="s205">I accepted that.</span> <span id="s206">That was the way life was, and -- and the more -- the more they -- the more they were after us, the stronger we became, I felt, at least.</span> <span id="s207">It’s like when you -- when you hunt an animal, the fox becomes very fast and clever, because it hunted in -- in a way, that’s the way it was, certainly with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Now you went to public schools or private schools, but they were mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Were your friends mixed, or were your friends Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Most of my friends were Jewish, but some of them, of course, were not.</span> <span id="s212">And one of the bad experiences I had after Hitler came was with a friend, a non-Jewish friend that I had known for many, many years, who in fact belonged to the same club, the sport club that I belonged to.</span> <span id="s213">And he is the one that threw me on the street, and made me scrub the street.</span> <span id="s214">And when I wanted to pull my pants up not to make -- make them wet, he -- he pulled them down, and he called me a [indecipherable] a pig Jew.</span> <span id="s215">That was perhaps the greatest shock.</span> <span id="s216">Can you imagine that you -- you sort of grew up with somebody and suddenly this is what happens to you.</span> <span id="s217">You really feel, when something like that happens, you feel it perhaps more because of the disappointment, because it’s something I did not expect.</span> <span id="s218">Fighting on the street I -- I expected.</span> <span id="s219">You know, that -- it really didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s220">But this was a betrayal, I was betrayed.</span> <span id="s221">So when you ask me about friends, I’m not saying that every one was like that.</span> <span id="s222">Most of my non-Jewish friends would not have anything to do with me after that.</span> <span id="s223">That -- and this, in a way, I -- I expected that.</span> <span id="s224">I -- I -- I just -- they were protecting themselves, and at that point I was much more interested with what was going to happen to us, could we get out, than if somebody spoke to me or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: But it must have been tremendously hurtful.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Oh, it was very hurtful, it was very hurtful.</span> <span id="s227">One time I was surrounded by a group of people -- when I went to this school I was telling you about, th-the business school while I was working, and one time I was surrounded by maybe 10 or 15 people my age that I had gone to school with, who threatened to beat me up.</span> <span id="s228">And if it hadn’t been for a police officer -- and that was unusual by the way, that a police officer would interfere, because normally they looked aside, I would have been beaten to a pulp, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s229">It was hurtful.</span> <span id="s230">Th-There’s no question about it.</span> <span id="s231">But you know, it just didn’t get me down.</span> <span id="s232">This is where my father’s faith comes in.</span> <span id="s233">I knew that some -- we -- we had to get out, there was no question about that, and we did not go to pieces.</span> <span id="s234">It’s interesting, with all the troubles, Jewish people would still tell jokes.</span> <span id="s235">When -- when all these -- these bad things happened, they would still tell jokes.</span> <span id="s236">They would still talk about normal life.</span> <span id="s237">You don’t just give up everything.</span> <span id="s238">That’s the way life was, you -- you went on, you tried to do -- live as normal as you could, which really wasn’t normal.</span> <span id="s239">Because I remember my mother and father had -- or everything they had, their bank account was confiscated after Hitler, and we lived from what my mother had saved -- and I often tell Trude I hope you have some money somewhere I don’t know about.</span> <span id="s240">And after awhile when that ran out, we began to sell, like my mother liked silver and things like that.</span> <span id="s241">And this is what we lived from.</span> <span id="s242">My mother made -- I -- every day we ate like potatoes.</span> <span id="s243">Meat was hardly ever, but never complained.</span> <span id="s244">We never -- we never complained about it.</span> <span id="s245">So I -- I don’t know how others reacted.</span> <span id="s246">We were glad that we -- we were still alive, we were hopeful that we would get out, and of course we -- we -- we did get out.</span> <span id="s247">I -- I -- I don’t want to talk about the beatings that people took, and what we saw on the street.</span> <span id="s248">It is indescribable in a way.</span> <span id="s249">It’s -- it’s unbelievable that this happened to people that confessed to be God fearing -- I mean that people who -- who said they believe in God, went to church, went to concert, loved music, loved literature, that these are the very same people that turned into -- to beasts, and then came home and loved and hugged their children.</span> <span id="s250">So it was a tough time.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: This probably does take us up to, you know, what happened in March of -- of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Because you -- you’ve mentioned that you knew a little bit of what was going on in Germany, but you didn’t either believe it or --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: We -- we did not -- we knew a little bit, we did not know everything, of course.</span> <span id="s255">And also you have to remember during those years there were not -- the concentration camps had not started yet.</span> <span id="s256">Businesses were confiscated, laws were passed in Germany that for instance a Jewish doctor could -- did not cre -- treat a non-Jewish patient and the other way around.</span> <span id="s257">That Jews could not employ non-Jews, etcetera.</span> <span id="s258">Those -- those were the laws that were passed, but there were no -- no concentration camps yet.</span> <span id="s259">There was always a rumbling going on, and Hitler proposed that Austria be annexed to Germany.</span> <span id="s260">And a boat was to be taken, I believe it was on the 13th of March, 1938.</span> <span id="s261">The chancellor, the Austrian chancellor at that time, his name was Schuschnigg went to Berchtesgaden two or three days before the vote was taken -- or to be taken and told Hitler that we’re fighting it, we’re not -- we’re not going to just accept this, and so forth.</span> <span id="s262">Well, on Friday before election, I was outside of the business, I had been at a meeting, and it was in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s263">And of course there was a lot of literature about how to vote, vote yes or vote no and that sort of thing, but you didn’t see any swastikas.</span> <span id="s264">And in the afternoon, within one hour, word got out that Hitler’s troops had marched into Austria, and I have never seen a people more organized than the Austrians were.</span> <span id="s265">Police officers put on swastika bands, public buildings flew the -- the -- the swastika flag.</span> <span id="s266">The trucks were already out in the street looting.</span> <span id="s267">And this all happened within -- within an hour.</span> <span id="s268">It was highly organized, and I must tell you, Austria was really not taken over, because Austria was happy to become part of Germany.</span> <span id="s269">The people were jubilant, they were absolutely jubilant.</span> <span id="s270">They were not victims, the Austrians were not victims.</span> <span id="s271">They were part of it.</span> <span id="s272">And I -- I remember this was on a Friday and I went home immediately, came home, and I said, what are we going to do?</span> <span id="s273">And my mother said, “It’s Shabbas, it’s Friday night.</span> <span id="s274">We’re gonna have a -- we gonna have Sabbath.”</span> <span id="s275">And believe it or not, we sat down at the table -- Friday was a -- was a wonderful day in our home, everything was cleaner, it smelled more -- better.</span> <span id="s276">It was really like a festival.</span> <span id="s277">My mother said this is Shabbas, we’re going to sit down, we’re going to have our meal.</span> <span id="s278">She lit the candles, she prayed over the candles, we had our meal, my father said the prayers.</span> <span id="s279">And then, after that is when we really began to talk.</span> <span id="s280">But this -- that -- the -- the ritual of the Friday night service remained, in fact it probably was the most meaningful Friday night we ever spent.</span> <span id="s281">There was great strength there, and great faith.</span> <span id="s282">Well, now I must tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s283">I’ll go back a little.</span> <span id="s284">In 1937, on -- this is when we went to the country in the summer and rented a house.</span> <span id="s285">I met my wife, I told you about that.</span> <span id="s286">I immediately fell in love with her.</span> <span id="s287">But the week when I met her, for some unexplainable reason -- my father would commute and he would come in on a Friday and stay til Monday.</span> <span id="s288">On Thursday, I cannot tell you why, I’ll never know why, I decided to go to Vienna and come back on Friday with my father.</span> <span id="s289">And everybody said, why you going, you just met Trude, and I said, I just feel like going.</span> <span id="s290">And when I got off the railroad station in Vienna, I met a boy friend of mine.</span> <span id="s291">And he said, what are you doing this evening?</span> <span id="s292">And I said, I really have no plans, I don’t even know why I came.</span> <span id="s293">He said, why don’t go we -- why don’t we go dancing.</span> <span id="s294">And so I met him that evening and we went to an outdoor restaurant where there were -- where there was dancing.</span> <span id="s295">And I -- in -- in Europe it is quite appropriate that you can get up from your table, walk over to -- to a lady and ask her to dance, and if she says no, you -- you know, you’re a little embarrassed, but you go back to your table.</span> <span id="s296">So I had noticed a table with a -- it was obvious that they were Americans.</span> <span id="s297">There were five girls and a chaperone.</span> <span id="s298">And I said to my friend, I says, you know this -- this -- there’s one girl there, I really like her looks and I’m going to ask her to dance with me.</span> <span id="s299">If she says no, I’m going to walk out, cause I’m not going to come back to the table and be embarrassed.</span> <span id="s300">So I paid my bill and I walked over, and in German -- I couldn’t speak English, I asked the chaperone, may I dance with one of the girls, and they looked me over, and they agreed, and I asked this girl to dance with me.</span> <span id="s301">And we danced until the place closed, about one o’clock.</span> <span id="s302">And then I asked the chaperone, may I come the next day on Friday and take this young lady for a walk and show her Vienna, and they -- after a conference they agreed.</span> <span id="s303">And so the next day I -- I bought a little dictionary, and I picked her up at the hotel and we made -- we walked for about two hours, made conversation through this dictionary.</span> <span id="s304">I took her back to the hotel, and she by the way was -- she had just graduated high school, so she was just about my age.</span> <span id="s305">I said, give me your name and address, and I will learn how to speak English and then I will write to you.</span> <span id="s306">So she gave me her name and address, and her name was Mary Mills, she lived on Mills Avenue, Greenville, South Carolina, U.S.A. And I took that address and I put it in my wallet.</span> <span id="s307">Then on Friday evening I came back to the summer resort and I told Trude, “Guess what, I danced with an American.”</span> <span id="s308">And Trude says, “I could care less.”</span> <span id="s309">She wasn’t too impressed.</span> <span id="s310">Well, I saved that address, and now go back -- I go forward, Friday night after si -- after we had our meal, I said to my parents, “You know, you remember I met this girl in -- in fisil -- in Vienna, after I had come back from the summer resort?</span> <span id="s311">I have her address, I’m going to write to her and see if she will help me.”</span> <span id="s312">And my parents said, “She’ll never remember you.”</span> <span id="s313">I says, “Well, we’ll see.”</span> <span id="s314">In fact, I told that to -- to Trude, my -- now my wife, and she said, “Good luck and good weather.”</span> <span id="s315">I wrote to her and I still have a copy of that letter.</span> <span id="s316">I remember I wrote the letter in German and then I took each word and translated it to English so the -- the grammar is not good.</span> <span id="s317">But she -- the letter I wrote to Mary Mills, she understood what I was saying.</span> <span id="s318">And I -- I said to her in the letter, perhaps you will remember me.</span> <span id="s319">I must get out of here.</span> <span id="s320">If you will help me, I promise you I’ll never be a burden to you.</span> <span id="s321">And that was in March of 1938.</span> <span id="s322">And several weeks went by and I did not hear from her, and one day -- I think I was with Trude at their store, if I’m not mistaken -- I get a call from my father, you have a registered letter from America.</span> <span id="s323">I cannot tell you what that felt like.</span> <span id="s324">When I came home, and I opened up the letter, it said, I have not forgotten you.</span> <span id="s325">I have gone to see a man here in Greenville, who promised that he would help you.</span> <span id="s326">His name is Shepherd Saltzman, he owns a shirt factory, and he said that he would send you the necessary papers.</span> <span id="s327">There’s no way that I can tell you [indecipherable] we were very lucky.</span> <span id="s328">And this is really how I came to America.</span> <span id="s329">This man helped me.</span> <span id="s330">He later told me, he said, “When Mary came to see me, I said to her, how can I not help, when I a Jew -- when you a Christian want to help, and I as a Jew, how can I not help?”</span> <span id="s331">So he sent me an affidavit that would guarantee that I would not be a burden to the government.</span> <span id="s332">In the affidavit he said, if there’s anybody else in your family that you want to come with you, let me know.</span> <span id="s333">Well, we didn’t the chutzpah, the gall to -- to ask for more, but then when things got worse, and my sister had a very close call, frightening experience, we sent a telegram to this man and said, would you include my sister Paula?</span> <span id="s334">And he wired back to the consulate to include her.</span> <span id="s335">And so my sister and I came here -- came to America in the end of July 1938, and left my parents behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: I want to backtrack.</span> <span id="s337">I know that this is difficult to talk about, but I think what’s important for those of us who were not there to understand is -- is really the mood and the circumstances of Vienna after the Germans essentially annexed Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: And what -- what was going on.</span> <span id="s340">What you saw, what you experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: How your life was changed.</span> <span id="s343">I think that’s really important.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Well, let me start off how my life was changed, on -- on the out -- on the outside.</span> <span id="s345">How did -- how did we know that there was a difference.</span> <span id="s346">The following week after Hitler marched in, the benches in the parks were already marked no Jews.</span> <span id="s347">No Jews allowed.</span> <span id="s348">That following week, Jews were dismissed from their job.</span> <span id="s349">That following week, some synagogues were burning, stores were broken into.</span> <span id="s350">We saw trucks that took, especially groceries, out of stores.</span> <span id="s351">In our own case, our bank account was confiscated.</span> <span id="s352">The customers my parents had stopped paying.</span> <span id="s353">What I saw was neighbor turning against neighbor.</span> <span id="s354">If -- if some people wanted to have a certain apartment, they would go to the -- to the government and say so and so has said something about the German, and the result was that they had to move out of their apartment.</span> <span id="s355">And I’ll give you an example, happened in -- in my wife’s case, Trude and her family were ordered out of their apartment and given six hours to get out, and they had to find another place.</span> <span id="s356">And that other place where they lived was like a ghetto, really.</span> <span id="s357">But that’s how it happened.</span> <span id="s358">How was life otherwise?</span> <span id="s359">People disappeared, people were scared to death.</span> <span id="s360">When I heard anybody walking in back of me, there was a fear.</span> <span id="s361">A fear I cannot explain.</span> <span id="s362">I remember one night, about 11 or 12 o’clock, there was a knock on our door, and our first thought was oh my God, the Gestapo is here.</span> <span id="s363">I open up the door, and it was a -- a man who said, I’m a conductor, train conductor.</span> <span id="s364">I have an envelope for you from your family in Poland.</span> <span id="s365">My father had family in Poland, and my mother had family in Poland.</span> <span id="s366">And they’ve said to tell you to come to Poland.</span> <span id="s367">And I said to this conductor, tell them they better get out of Poland.</span> <span id="s368">See, the people in Poland were in the same position that we were about Germany.</span> <span id="s369">People in Poland thought this -- they’re going to be okay.</span> <span id="s370">We already felt that there was no place in Europe for us.</span> <span id="s371">So life was -- people were already, as I told you -- we had a friend in our family who was picked up by the Gestapo, he was put into a basement, and he wa -- with -- with a group of other Jews, and he was told, say your last prayers, we’re gonna -- you’re gonna be executed.</span> <span id="s372">And they did it in alphabetical order, they would call.</span> <span id="s373">His name was Lang, L-a-n-g.</span> <span id="s374">They called people in alphabetical order.</span> <span id="s375">In the -- in the -- in that basement, people were already saying their Shema, hear oh Israel, the last prayer that you say before death.</span> <span id="s376">And when he came outside, they were shooting in the air and laughing, and then kicked him out.</span> <span id="s377">But in the meantime, some people died of fear.</span> <span id="s378">I mean, it was that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s379">And I remember we used to stand in line at embassies, hoping to get -- there were always rumors.</span> <span id="s380">Oh, you can go to Australia, you can go to England.</span> <span id="s381">You can get a visa here or there.</span> <span id="s382">So we would stand all night, waiting to get into the embassy.</span> <span id="s383">And the young Hitler youth would come in trucks, and they would throw horse manure at us, and the police would stand there and laugh.</span> <span id="s384">So what -- what was life like, it was -- it -- it’s very hard to -- for people to understand how we even survived mentally.</span> <span id="s385">And yet we -- we would -- we would try to listen to the radio, although it was forbidden -- foreign -- foreign broadcast.</span> <span id="s386">And yet we -- during all that time we still hoped -- we said, oh well, maybe America is not going to allow this to happen, and maybe Russia will -- will do something.</span> <span id="s387">Maybe France will do something.</span> <span id="s388">There was still that hope that somebody was going to come to our rescue.</span> <span id="s389">And you know what I learned?</span> <span id="s390">The world does not hear tears.</span> <span id="s391">You can cry, and cry, nobody hears you.</span> <span id="s392">The world does not hear you cry.</span> <span id="s393">And that’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s394">We were crying, but nobody was listening.</span> <span id="s395">So that’s -- that’s what life was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: You continued to go to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Until I -- but just for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s398">I still have a copy of the letter, saying you’re discharged, yeah.</span> <span id="s399">I worked, I think, until May.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: And then they discharged you?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s402">They discharged me within a week of -- after he took over, and gave me a letter -- I have a letter of recommendation, which is ridiculous, but -- what a good worker I was.</span> <span id="s403">But they discharged me, as of -- I’ve forgotten the date exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: So when you describe police or soldiers or Hitler youth, are we talking about Germans or Austrians?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Austrians more than Germans.</span> <span id="s406">It’s very interesting that -- that you ask me that question, because I had some narrow escapes where I was saved by a German.</span> <span id="s407">I remember one time, Trude’s father had loved cars, and he had a brand new car.</span> <span id="s408">And one day I came to her house and she said, “They came and got my father’s car.</span> <span id="s409">They just -- they gave us a receipt, they took the keys.”</span> <span id="s410">I says, “They can’t do that, how can they do this?”</span> <span id="s411">And like a fool I went to the Gestapo headquarters, and there hundreds of people were standing in line because they had been called to come to the Gestapo, and I, like a schmoe stand there, and suddenly a -- a -- a staff car, a German officer gets out of the car and he takes a look at me and says, “Why are you here?”</span> <span id="s412">And I tell him the story, he says, “Take my advice.</span> <span id="s413">Go home.”</span> <span id="s414">So this is -- this is one time when -- when a German really -- a German officer helped me.</span> <span id="s415">I had another experience -- you know, you gotta have some luck in life.</span> <span id="s416">People call it miracle, luck, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s417">In order to cu -- to get the visa from the Americans, we had to have a paper from the Austrian government saying that we had no -- committed no crime, and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s418">My sister applied for it and I did, and hers came back and mine didn’t.</span> <span id="s419">And in the meantime I received a letter from the American embassy saying your papers are ready, but when you come be sure you have this and this and that.</span> <span id="s420">Included in that was the letter from the government that I was not a criminal.</span> <span id="s421">And it was just two or three days before I was supposed to get my visa.</span> <span id="s422">And if you don’t have the papers, they pass you up.</span> <span id="s423">So I stood in line again for hours and hours with my mother, to this -- to the police station.</span> <span id="s424">I finally come upstairs and this German, he says what do you want, and I tell him what happened.</span> <span id="s425">And I plead with him, he says, I’m sorry, there’s nothing I can do for you.</span> <span id="s426">It’ll take days and days and days to -- to search your record.</span> <span id="s427">And while I’m talking to him, a young girl walks up, and calls him aside, and they -- two of them look at me, and they whisper, and he comes back to me and he says, if I have your word that you will not tell this to anybody, come back this afternoon.</span> <span id="s428">This -- this young lady has agreed to spend the rest of the day just on your case.</span> <span id="s429">I come downstairs and my mother said, what happened, and I squeezed her arm, which I tried to show her it’s good, because I was afraid to say anything in front of anybody.</span> <span id="s430">You know, you save your own skin.</span> <span id="s431">I come back in the afternoon, he hands me the papers and he said, I must tell you, he says, “I’m a nationale socialist.</span> <span id="s432">I’m a national socialist.</span> <span id="s433">I’m a political one.</span> <span id="s434">I never, never thought this would happen.</span> <span id="s435">I wish that I could go with you.”</span> <span id="s436">He says, “And you will do well in America, and I wish you luck.”</span> <span id="s437">So I -- you -- you sort of -- you -- you -- you lived by your experiences, and what I have learned is, with all these terrible experiences that we have, there is somebody good.</span> <span id="s438">And I live on the good experiences, rather than the bad ones.</span> <span id="s439">If I didn’t, I don’t think I could have survived mentally.</span> <span id="s440">I could not.</span> <span id="s441">And so I grew up and I matured, and tried not to hate, because that -- hate eats you up, it doesn’t -- it doesn’t hurt the one you hate, it hurts -- it hurts you.</span> <span id="s442">For every bad that I had -- not for every, but look, I had a Christian girl save my life.</span> <span id="s443">I had these people that helped me.</span> <span id="s444">And the others, those that -- the real -- I -- I can’t even find a word for them, that behaved like they did, I -- I -- I -- I try to forget -- somebody once asked me, have you forgiven?</span> <span id="s445">And I said, that kind of crime requires a greater -- a greater force than what I am, to forgive.</span> <span id="s446">That is not up to me.</span> <span id="s447">They gonna have to answer to a greater being than -- than to me.</span> <span id="s448">And -- and this is -- this is the way I feel, and this is true.</span> <span id="s449">I cannot -- I cannot -- nobody can imagine how these people acted.</span> <span id="s450">And I must tell you, they were overjoyed, the Austrians.</span> <span id="s451">They were overjoyed.</span> <span id="s452">I mean, here is Hitler promising -- don’t forget, 10 percent of Vienna’s population was Jewish, and -- and it was a -- basically a thriving community.</span> <span id="s453">And Hitler says to these people, you see, all that they have, you will have.</span> <span id="s454">You can have it.</span> <span id="s455">Just take it.</span> <span id="s456">So they were -- they were -- they were pro -- pro-Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: When the Germans came in, were there German troops in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Oh yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s459">They -- at first, in fact, my God, there was a parade.</span> <span id="s460">The German soldiers, they parading.</span> <span id="s461">He -- they probably picked the -- the best looking ones, and the people were jubilant.</span> <span id="s462">Unfortunately, some of the churches welcomed Hitler, issued proclamation welcoming Hitler.</span> <span id="s463">Sure, there were -- there were German troops, but they didn’t have to stay there, because the Austrians were very happy to do that.</span> <span id="s464">The Austrian police was like -- was Hitler supporters, there’s no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Now in the early days, as I understand it, there was a lot of chaos, a lot of sort of uncontrolled violence.</span> <span id="s466">And from what I’ve read, that after some time, and I don’t know how much time, that sort of the efficiency of the German machine demanded that -- that that chaos be controlled.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Well, they actually, y-y-you remember the story about Kristallnacht, and I think that was in November of 1938, what the government actually said, on this and this day, you can go out and do what you want.</span> <span id="s468">You go ahead, break -- break the -- the store windows, go ahead and beat up people.</span> <span id="s469">Go, do what you want, you’ve got 24 hours to do it.</span> <span id="s470">So it was the government that controlled the chaos, you’re right.</span> <span id="s471">But individuals, that doesn’t -- didn’t mean that individuals did not perform violence.</span> <span id="s472">But the government controlled -- which was even worse than if it were just a riot on the part of people, cause by that time they already began to build concentration camps, and they had passed all these different laws.</span> <span id="s473">The Nuremberg Laws became the Austrian laws.</span> <span id="s474">So that -- it was a -- it was a very well organized effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: I guess my question here is, how long did it take after March 13th for things to settle down a little bit, and for the government, German or Austrian, to really take charge in a -- in a systematic way.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Well, I left Vienna in July, the end of July 1938.</span> <span id="s477">By that time it was not systematic, it was still -- some of it was systematic yes, if you wanted to take over a business, if a -- if -- if a Austrian wanted to take your business, and they would have a friend who is a Nazi, they were so well organized that they gave you a receipt.</span> <span id="s478">Now, I’m not being facetious.</span> <span id="s479">So when I left there was still that -- that sort of thing going on.</span> <span id="s480">In fact, I would say, after that is when it became more regulated.</span> <span id="s481">But that didn’t mean that you didn’t fear of your life.</span> <span id="s482">The difference was that it wa -- the -- the uniform people that came, it was the Gestapo people who came for you, rather than an individual ho-hoodlum, if that’s -- if that’s what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Yeah, well, I -- I -- I mean, I can’t imagine that this massive violence and looting and beating that s -- that began immediately, went on continuously for months.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: No, no, n-no, you’re right, no.</span> <span id="s485">It -- it was still there, but not -- not in the same force.</span> <span id="s486">At first people were evidently told, do what you want.</span> <span id="s487">And that was an outlet for them, I mean, they were so happy that Hitler came because now they could loot.</span> <span id="s488">Now, if they wanted our apartment, they got it.</span> <span id="s489">Now, if they wanted our business, they got it.</span> <span id="s490">Right?</span> <span id="s491">So that was at first, and then, of course it became more regulated because the government stepped in and built the concentration camps, an-and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: But this cra -- this real craziness, did it last two weeks, two months?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: N-No, it lasted several weeks.</span> <span id="s494">It lasted several weeks.</span> <span id="s495">But the -- the fear did not leave us.</span> <span id="s496">Perhaps the fear was even greater because the -- because the government without a doubt, took over the violence, or controlled the violence.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: And when you speak of the government, I don’t mean to be [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: The Austrian government, the Austrian government.</span> <span id="s499">But they had put in -- Germany put in a -- a -- a -- like a governor let’s say, you could call it, a German.</span> <span id="s500">Or they found an Austrian who had been a Nazi, and made him the mayor, let’s say.</span> <span id="s501">They also released all the political prisoners who had been put in prison because they killed, like this Chancellor Dollfuss, who was killed.</span> <span id="s502">His killers were let -- were let out.</span> <span id="s503">So it -- that was all well thought out, and this -- this is how that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Okay, why don’t we stop right here and change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Now you were discharged from your business, and it took you a few months to get out.</span> <span id="s508">How did you spend your time in those few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Well, most of the time we would go and stand in line, trying to get information about how to get out, i-is there a -- a -- a possibility of getting a visa to certain places.</span> <span id="s510">That’s how most of the time was spent almost -- almost every day.</span> <span id="s511">The rest of the time, I -- I visited friends.</span> <span id="s512">There was really nothing to do.</span> <span id="s513">I did not walk the streets if I could help it.</span> <span id="s514">You stay as low as possible.</span> <span id="s515">You try not to be noticed.</span> <span id="s516">In fact, my father and mother, who were Polish citizens -- I was born in Vienna, but they were born in Poland -- because of that, I was considered a pole -- a citi -- a Polish citizen.</span> <span id="s517">And so I -- people started like a business of emblems that you wear, and so I wore a Polish emblem, to indicate that I will -- was a Polish citizen, thinking that that would protect me.</span> <span id="s518">And anybody who had anything that they could wear, they would put on.</span> <span id="s519">Of course, if you were a Nazi, you put in your lapel the button, the swastika button.</span> <span id="s520">And so I carried this, thinking maybe this -- this would protect me.</span> <span id="s521">Th -- well, evidently it did, although, you know, I was pushed off the street, did not walk on the sidewalk with somebody else and that -- that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Well how did people know you were a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Well, I was not blonde and blue di -- blue eyes.</span> <span id="s524">I lived in a certain district, and people -- by the way, we had to carry an I.D. card that indicated that we were Jewish, an-and that’s one reason why I’m opposed.</span> <span id="s525">I hope to God it never happens here.</span> <span id="s526">But so they knew if I had been picked up, they knew, of course, that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s527">I lived in that district.</span> <span id="s528">And if I did not wear a swastika, I was suspect.</span> <span id="s529">So I think it was very simple.</span> <span id="s530">It’s either you wore a lapel button or an armband, or you didn’t.</span> <span id="s531">So it wasn’t -- it was not very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Was the identity card the new thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: You’d always had those?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yes, yeah, always had that.</span> <span id="s536">In fact, when I went to the bank, when my parents send me to the bank to take money out, and the system is different, you -- you -- you go to the teller, you put in your check, you get a number.</span> <span id="s537">And I guess they check and see if you have the money in the bank.</span> <span id="s538">And then they call your number.</span> <span id="s539">When my number was called, they said to me, your -- your account is closed.</span> <span id="s540">They knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s541">That -- that -- that -- that’s how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Were you ever put on any work details, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: -- rounded up, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Oh, I was rounded up to wash the streets, I told you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Well, you actually didn’t describe that very much in this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Well, I was walking -- I was walking on the street, in fact, I was walking with a girl, other than Trude, and forgive me Trude, and minding my own business when across the street, there was this action, called an action.</span> <span id="s548">The streets had been full of paint in anticipation of the vote, so there would be all kinds of lettering in the street, or on the walls.</span> <span id="s549">And what they did, is they picked up Jews, and they made them clean it.</span> <span id="s550">And I was walking in the opposite side of the street when this -- this fellow who I thought was my friend, grabbed me and pulled me over, and made me -- made me clean the street.</span> <span id="s551">That’s exactly how it happened.</span> <span id="s552">And that wa -- that was a -- a tremendous shock.</span> <span id="s553">A-Aside from that, you know, like I told you what happened at the school where I was surrounded by people, I was not beaten up, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Were you shoved off of sidewalks?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Oh yeah, that, sure.</span> <span id="s556">Yeah.</span> <span id="s557">Shoved, or I would just be plain cursed at.</span> <span id="s558">People just -- some people just took pleasure in simply cursing you.</span> <span id="s559">The -- the -- the house where we lived had maybe 25, maybe 30 apartments, and it was already even with our house -- our apartment building rather, there were Jews and non-Jews living there.</span> <span id="s560">And some of the non-Jews already started to take over apartments that the Jews lived in, that they liked better.</span> <span id="s561">So there was neighbor turning against neighbor.</span> <span id="s562">We had a superintendent of the building who was not Jewish, who would warn us, actually.</span> <span id="s563">He -- he was a pretty good person.</span> <span id="s564">Would warn us if they saw, you know, Nazis coming, to lay low.</span> <span id="s565">It was -- it was -- ye -- you learned not to really -- I hate to say that, not to trust anybody, because you live in constant fear.</span> <span id="s566">It reminds me sometimes of how cattle herded into cars, and they’re taken to slaughter.</span> <span id="s567">And somehow, this is what happens to you as a human being.</span> <span id="s568">You begin to develop fear like you feel like you’re being herded.</span> <span id="s569">Yo -- you -- you -- you change.</span> <span id="s570">You change because you don’t -- you even walk different, you -- you -- you don’t -- you’re just a totally different person.</span> <span id="s571">And unless you live through it, you -- you wouldn’t -- you wouldn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s572">We didn't realize it.</span> <span id="s573">We did not realize it.</span> <span id="s574">The -- the -- when I saw a uniform, it scared me.</span> <span id="s575">It sc -- when I came to America, when I got off the ship, and I saw police officers talking to people as friends, I could not get over it.</span> <span id="s576">I -- I met a -- the man who brought me over was at the ship to pick me up, and he was with a -- a -- a gentleman and he introduced me.</span> <span id="s577">He said, this is Rabbi Mezuer.</span> <span id="s578">And I looked at the man, and I called Shep Saltzman aside and I said, “He’s not a rabbi, he’s a spy.”</span> <span id="s579">He said, “Why in the world would you say that?”</span> <span id="s580">I said, “Well, he’s clean-shaven, he does not wear a skullcap and he speaks perfect German.”</span> <span id="s581">Anybody, when you hear that German in back of you, you have fear.</span> <span id="s582">I mean, that -- this is what happens to you in just a few months.</span> <span id="s583">Fortunately, the wounds heal, if you -- it -- it’s just like anything else, if you cut yourself and -- and there’s an infection, it keeps on going and going.</span> <span id="s584">If you let it heal there’s a scar, the scar never leaves you.</span> <span id="s585">The scar is there, but it doesn’t fester.</span> <span id="s586">And so all this that you go through, if you’re fortunate enough you can survive it and still live a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: During this few months that you stayed over there, did you continue to observe the Sabbath, did you have a Passover?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s589">We observed, sure.</span> <span id="s590">It -- it was perhaps even more meaningful, more meaningful than ever, yeah.</span> <span id="s591">The -- the question that perhaps underlying your -- your question is did you lose faith, and no we did not.</span> <span id="s592">This is -- my father would always say, don’t worry, God’ll help.</span> <span id="s593">I told you before, that’s the way he was.</span> <span id="s594">Oh, don’t worry, God -- God is going to help.</span> <span id="s595">No, we did not -- we -- we did not go to synagogue because I -- one of the synagogues was a very small place where we went to, and that one was -- was demolished, totally demolished.</span> <span id="s596">So whatever services were at home, and sometimes a -- a friend would come over, or a relative would come over, and you sit together, and you observe the Friday night, and I must say that the food was not as good as it was before, but that -- that really -- that -- that didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s597">You -- you cannot -- you cannot lose hope.</span> <span id="s598">If you -- if you lose hope --</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Sorry.</span> <span id="s600">[interruption] The meals weren’t just good because you couldn't afford the food, or because food was rationed and there just wasn’t much?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Well, first of all, we didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s602">Because as I told you, we -- in fact, my mother started to, at the beginning would go to the pawn shop and it was -- it was called [indecipherable], it was run by the government, and would pawn things.</span> <span id="s603">But then after a few weeks we realized that this is not going to get better.</span> <span id="s604">There was no sense to pawn it when you know you can’t get it back, so we began to sell.</span> <span id="s605">And there you got a little more money, and this is what we lived off.</span> <span id="s606">So this -- and we did get some money from relatives, both in Poland and in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s607">The relatives that sent us money through this train conductor, half of the money went to him.</span> <span id="s608">That was his -- his take, because he put his life in danger.</span> <span id="s609">So we had some of that money, we -- we -- we had paid for the ticket on the ship.</span> <span id="s610">We took -- when I left Vienna we took eight -- the equivalent of eight dollars in my pocket.</span> <span id="s611">But the ship was paid for.</span> <span id="s612">And then I had prepaid I think something like 10 or 20 dollars that I could s -- that was part of the travel expense, that I could spend on the boat.</span> <span id="s613">So when I came to the United States, I had left a dollar and 60 cents, out of that eight dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: How -- you mentioned that peop -- you -- you lined up along with other people every day to try to get out.</span> <span id="s615">Was there an immigration policy in place at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Wa -- how easy was it for people to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Well, you could only get out if you could get in.</span> <span id="s621">In other words, you could not get out unless you had a place where to go.</span> <span id="s622">And most of the countries did not want you.</span> <span id="s623">For instance if you escaped to Belgium, which is what happened to my wife, the Belgium government would give you a 30 day permit.</span> <span id="s624">And then you have to come and register again, and if you’re lucky you get another 30 day permit.</span> <span id="s625">So it was not easy to get out unless you had a place where to go.</span> <span id="s626">The world simply did not want us.</span> <span id="s627">What’s the use of kidding?</span> <span id="s628">When I compare, as an example, what happened in -- in recent history, under President Carter, where maybe 100,000 or more Cubans were let in, there was no such thing where the American government say well, come.</span> <span id="s629">Or -- or not just the American government, any of the other governments.</span> <span id="s630">That did not happen then.</span> <span id="s631">So, we had no place to go, nobody wanted us.</span> <span id="s632">But there were always rumors that -- yeah, you could get, I think into Australia if you had the equivalent of maybe 10,000 dollars or so, but who had it?</span> <span id="s633">I mean, we -- it was taken away from you.</span> <span id="s634">So we -- we didn’t -- when my mother and father ultimately left Vienna, all they had left in the apartment was their bed and a table and two chairs.</span> <span id="s635">Everything else was either taken or sold.</span> <span id="s636">That’s -- if you can visualize that.</span> <span id="s637">When I went through it, my -- my sister and I, Paula left Vienna, I did not know that I would ever see my mother and father again.</span> <span id="s638">In fact, that was the saddest day in my life.</span> <span id="s639">They took us to the train station, of course, and we pulled down the windows of -- on the -- in the car, and we held hands.</span> <span id="s640">And then the train started to move, and my mother and father walked with us first, and then ran as long as they could, holding hands.</span> <span id="s641">And then we no longer could hold hands.</span> <span id="s642">And we pulled out, and they became smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s643">I never thought I would see them again, never.</span> <span id="s644">These are the -- these are the kind of things that stay with you all your life.</span> <span id="s645">Fortunately they -- they were able to come over, there was another miracle.</span> <span id="s646">A -- a woman at the American embassy was helpful for that.</span> <span id="s647">When I went to get my papers at the American embassy, you stand in line -- you’re scared to death anyhow, you don’t know what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s648">You go through a physical exam, and you have all your papers.</span> <span id="s649">And there was a -- a woman sitting at the desk and I liked her looks, and I said to my mother, “I like her looks, I want her to examine my papers.”</span> <span id="s650">We come to her, and she looks at my papers and she says, “Is this your mother?”</span> <span id="s651">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s652">“Are your parents going with you?”</span> <span id="s653">I don’t know what made me say it, I says, “No, but they will as soon as their affairs are straightened out.”</span> <span id="s654">They had no papers.</span> <span id="s655">So she gets up -- I remember this vividly, and she takes my file and she puts it in a file.</span> <span id="s656">That’s all I knew.</span> <span id="s657">When we received a wire from our mother and father saying we’re -- we’re coming in -- I think it was in -- I’ve forgotten the date in November.</span> <span id="s658">And when they finally came, I didn’t have enough money to go to New York to meet them in New York, but I had enough money to call them.</span> <span id="s659">And I said, “Tell me, wha -- how did you get out?”</span> <span id="s660">And my mothers says, “Do you remember this woman at the American embassy?</span> <span id="s661">She called us and she says, are you ready to leave?</span> <span id="s662">You have a special quota.”</span> <span id="s663">Because my sister and I were minors, they put us in a special quota and followed up, and this is how my mother and father came here.</span> <span id="s664">That -- that’s another miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Did you ever -- I’m trying to sort of imagine the mindset.</span> <span id="s666">It was very clear to you that you needed to leave.</span> <span id="s667">Did that ever get confused by sort of a feeling of desertion of your past and of your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Oh, never.</span> <span id="s669">Never.</span> <span id="s670">Not for a moment, never.</span> <span id="s671">There was no loyalty to Austria.</span> <span id="s672">What loyalty --</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: But to the Jewish community there?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s675">Never thought about that.</span> <span id="s676">No, not at all.</span> <span id="s677">The only thing I would feel guilty, I said -- felt bad about, was leaving my mother and father.</span> <span id="s678">But it was quite clear, and my parents spoke about it, they said, “Look, you’re young, and we’ve already lived a lot of our lives.</span> <span id="s679">We’ll manage somehow, with God’s help.”</span> <span id="s680">No, there was never a feeling of deserting anybody, or leaving anybody.</span> <span id="s681">The first time I went back to Vienna, after having lived in this country for a number of years, I remember I -- I could not -- I couldn’t wait to show my American passport.</span> <span id="s682">Oh, American.</span> <span id="s683">You don’t realize what that means to be an American.</span> <span id="s684">And ti -- the man at the border when you -- when you checked your -- your passport says, “Oh, you’ve -- you’ve come home.”</span> <span id="s685">I said, “Oh no, my home is America.”</span> <span id="s686">I never -- the only thing I -- I -- if I ever missed anything about Austria was I get nostalgic when I hear the music, and some of the food.</span> <span id="s687">But no, not at all.</span> <span id="s688">Unfortunately we’ve been back to Austria several times, but the last time I was there I experienced anti-Americanism, and anti-Semitism, and I will never go back, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Tell me a little bit about your journey over here with your sister and --</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: -- we can sort of move forward there unless -- unless --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: No, no, no, no, okay.</span> <span id="s693">Now I’m -- I arrive in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: How was the trip over, were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: It was wonderful, wonderful.</span> <span id="s696">You know, I was 18 - 19 years old, I -- we went second class, there were three classes on the ship.</span> <span id="s697">I was on a French boat, I met people.</span> <span id="s698">And interestingly, I have to tell you this, I was kosher.</span> <span id="s699">I observed the Shabbas, and never smoked on the Sabbath, I never ate ham, for instance.</span> <span id="s700">When I got on the ship, I asked the -- the headwaiter, I says, “Do you have a kosher kitchen?”</span> <span id="s701">“Oh,” he says, “yes.”</span> <span id="s702">I say, “I want to see it.”</span> <span id="s703">So he took me into the kitchen, I said, “Where is your kosher kitchen?”</span> <span id="s704">“Oh,” he says, “this is kosher meat, and this is not.”</span> <span id="s705">And I says, “And that’s it?”</span> <span id="s706">He says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s707">I says, “I’ll eat what everybody else does.”</span> <span id="s708">I mean, it -- it was a farce.</span> <span id="s709">And then the other thing that happened to me, my sister caught me smoking, and she said, “My God Max, it’s -- it’s Shabbas.”</span> <span id="s710">And I had not realized that it was the Sabbath, you know, you lose track of time.</span> <span id="s711">So that’s when I -- that’s really what happened to me, I -- I no longer observed the dietary laws, and I -- I s -- smoked on the Sabbath, and of course worked on the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s712">So my trip over was -- was really very pleasant.</span> <span id="s713">I met some people that I stayed in touch with for a -- a number of years, and when I came to New York, I was a -- my mother had two sisters who lived in America, who never responded to our letters -- while I was there, let me add, but ultimately did write.</span> <span id="s714">Well, anyhow, so I had cousin, picked me up, together with this man Shep Saltzman who brought me here.</span> <span id="s715">And he said to me, he says, “I have a few days in New York.</span> <span id="s716">If you li -- want to stay with your cousin, come and then come to Greenville in -- in a few days.”</span> <span id="s717">So I stayed with -- with my cousin.</span> <span id="s718">The first experience I had, and this is interesting.</span> <span id="s719">They looked at me and says, “Oh you don’t look half dead.”</span> <span id="s720">And I said no.</span> <span id="s721">But -- but you -- you look okay.</span> <span id="s722">They expected me to be a skeleton.</span> <span id="s723">And the only thing we could take with us was clothing.</span> <span id="s724">Then they told me, “Oh, you don’t wear these clothes here, this is -- this is not -- you have to wear American clothes.”</span> <span id="s725">But make a long story short, I stayed with them for about two or three days, and then they -- they bought me the ticket, a train ticket, to come to Greenville, South Carolina.</span> <span id="s726">My sister stayed in -- in Newark, that’s where my aunt lived, to see -- she says, “Why don’t you go and see what it’s like?”</span> <span id="s727">My relatives in Newark said, why don’t you go and work for cousin Joe?</span> <span id="s728">We had a cousin who -- who had done quite well, he was an immensely wealthy man, who was a very good person, he gave every -- every immigrant a job.</span> <span id="s729">And I said no, I’m going to South Carolina.</span> <span id="s730">So they bought me a pack of cigarettes and gave me a sandwich and I had a ticket and I went to Greenville, South Carolina.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Let me just -- before you go on, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s732">When you arrived in New York, or in America, was there anything that really struck you?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Oh God, yes.</span> <span id="s734">There was freedom.</span> <span id="s735">Freedom.</span> <span id="s736">Unbelievable feeling.</span> <span id="s737">I never had that feeling, ever.</span> <span id="s738">I mean, here you come off, after this experience scared to death, especially of uniforms, scared of hear a -- a German word, scared to move, or scared to have somebody walk in back of you, and here it’s just this mass of people, and people are laughing, and -- and it’s -- it’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s739">You have to experience it.</span> <span id="s740">This -- this is -- was freedom.</span> <span id="s741">It’s a -- it’s a -- it’s a wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s742">So this was -- it’s just like new life.</span> <span id="s743">If I had been given a -- a transfusion, it wa -- it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s744">I have never -- and I -- I was happy from the moment I got off.</span> <span id="s745">I was -- I was happy to get on the ship.</span> <span id="s746">I never had any doubt.</span> <span id="s747">That -- that’s interesting.</span> <span id="s748">I never had any fear of the unknown, so to speak.</span> <span id="s749">I was so happy, I would have done anything.</span> <span id="s750">And when I got off the train in Greenville, for instance, the man who brought me over here, he was at the station.</span> <span id="s751">The girl I had met in Vienna, she was at the station, and he -- this Mr. Saltzman says, “Come, I’ll take you to the factory.”</span> <span id="s752">But on the way -- this was around noon, he says, “Let me buy you lunch,” and I said, “No.</span> <span id="s753">I -- I -- I’m going to pay for my own lunch.”</span> <span id="s754">You have to remember, I could get lunch for a nickel or a dime.</span> <span id="s755">And he said, “No, let me pay.”</span> <span id="s756">I said no.</span> <span id="s757">I said, “When I can afford to take you for lunch, then you can take me for lunch.”</span> <span id="s758">I was so concerned not to take charity.</span> <span id="s759">I -- I wanted to be on my own.</span> <span id="s760">I’m getting a little emotional.</span> <span id="s761">So I got in -- I -- I -- I paid for my soup, and then about noontime I went to the factory and I started working right then, immediately.</span> <span id="s762">And they put me in the shipping department because his office was on the same floor as the shipping department, and besides that, in order to sweep floors you don’t have to be fluent in English.</span> <span id="s763">I had learned a little English by the way, from the time I knew that I was coming until I got here, I learned enough to say hello, good-bye, I love you, or I see you later, you know, I -- I wouldn’t get lost.</span> <span id="s764">But anyhow, so I started working in the shipping department, sweeping floors, carrying boxes and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s765">A very interesting thing happened to me the next day.</span> <span id="s766">I get a call from the office, paging Max Heller, come to the office.</span> <span id="s767">Scared to death.</span> <span id="s768">I come to the office and she says to me, a judge is here to see you, Judge Plyler.</span> <span id="s769">I said, oh my God, they’re going to send me back.</span> <span id="s770">That’s the first thing I thought of.</span> <span id="s771">There was something wrong.</span> <span id="s772">And here is this tall, handsome man, and he introduces himself and he said, “I am Judge Plyler, I have come to welcome you.”</span> <span id="s773">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s774">He says, “I’m -- I’ll be president of a university this fall, and I want you to think of my home as your home.</span> <span id="s775">I will see that you learn to speak English, we have students here that’ll help you.”</span> <span id="s776">And that was my welcome.</span> <span id="s777">It means so much.</span> <span id="s778">A simple act of kindness can undo bitter things.</span> <span id="s779">Just reaching out.</span> <span id="s780">So, that was my beginning in Greenville.</span> <span id="s781">My sister came several weeks later.</span> <span id="s782">I lived with the -- with the family for a week.</span> <span id="s783">And I -- by the way, my first paycheck was nine dollars and 90 cents.</span> <span id="s784">It was really 10 dollars, but 10 cents was for Social Security.</span> <span id="s785">And I worked seven days a week, maybe 70 - 80 hours a week and I was very happy to.</span> <span id="s786">I would have done anything.</span> <span id="s787">So, after one week, I lived with this family who was a superintendent of the factory.</span> <span id="s788">Came the end of the week, I said, “I want to pay you.”</span> <span id="s789">“No,” he says, “I don’t want you to pay me.”</span> <span id="s790">I says, “I’m not going to stay free, I -- I have money.</span> <span id="s791">I have nine -- I have nine dollars and 90 cents.”</span> <span id="s792">I said, “I want to pay you or else I leave.”</span> <span id="s793">He says, “No, you cannot pay me.”</span> <span id="s794">So I had found out there was another Jewish family who took in borders and they charged seven dollars a week to be a border.</span> <span id="s795">So I moved in with them, I paid my seven dollars, and I saved about a dollar, a dollar and a half a week out of the difference.</span> <span id="s796">And then, ultimately, I moved with the family that brought me here.</span> <span id="s797">And they were wonderful to me, absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s798">And he gave my daughter -- my sister a job, and my sister came over and we both stayed with them.</span> <span id="s799">And -- and I insisted that I pay them.</span> <span id="s800">And I said, I will not -- and I did.</span> <span id="s801">And so she worked in the office, I worked in the shipping department, and I’ll never forget -- I remember a -- a few months after I came here -- I used to listen to the radio a great deal, this is how I learned -- I went to movies, which were 10 cents, I think, but listened to the radio and I l -- I learned by the sound, and -- English and -- and it -- it didn’t take me that long.</span> <span id="s802">So one day I learned that there was a bill in the Congress -- I heard that on the radio, to have a minimum wage.</span> <span id="s803">And it was to be 25 cents an hour, for 48 hours, I think, and time and a half over that.</span> <span id="s804">And I says, oh my God, 48 times 25 is 14 dollars, I make 10, and overtime?</span> <span id="s805">I was all for it.</span> <span id="s806">And I’ll never forget that, the republican -- I didn’t know the difference between democrats or republicans.</span> <span id="s807">The democrats, however, I learned, proposed the minimum wage, and the republicans were -- opposed it.</span> <span id="s808">That’s when I became a democrat by the way.</span> <span id="s809">I fig -- I figured I’ll make 14 dollars an hour.</span> <span id="s810">And -- and of course the bill -- bill went through, and interestingly enough, after 48 hours, I checked out the time clock, I didn’t get time and a half, but they gave me money to have supper with.</span> <span id="s811">And my work, I made progress in my work.</span> <span id="s812">A few months after I was in the shipping department, the foreman in the shipping department left.</span> <span id="s813">And so I went to Mr. Saltzman, I said, “I’d like to have his job.”</span> <span id="s814">He says, “How can you have his job, you can’t speak English.”</span> <span id="s815">I said, “I’ll show them what to do.”</span> <span id="s816">He said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s817">I mean really, this is how it happened.</span> <span id="s818">And I became foreman in the shop.</span> <span id="s819">Then ultimately my parents came over and he gave my father a job.</span> <span id="s820">And my mother and father moved to Greenville.</span> <span id="s821">Ironically, I became my father’s boss.</span> <span id="s822">It was tragic.</span> <span id="s823">I mean, he was a man, he was 50 -- he was 50 years old when he came here, and here I was, 19 at that time.</span> <span id="s824">And I told him what to do, and he schlepped the boxes just like I did.</span> <span id="s825">Never complained, never.</span> <span id="s826">It wa -- never a -- not for a moment did we complain.</span> <span id="s827">So we moved into an apartment and ultimately I was able to buy a car, and a -- I made progress in my work.</span> <span id="s828">The internal sales manager left.</span> <span id="s829">I was lucky, they were all leaving, and I -- again I went to -- to the owner of the business, I said, “Give me a chance for this.”</span> <span id="s830">He says, “But how you gonna correspond with customers, you have -- I said, don’t worry, I’ll learn.”</span> <span id="s831">So I would stay every night, and I go through the files and I memorized letters.</span> <span id="s832">And I found out after awhile, well, if you have 10 letters, different situations, pretty much that’s it.</span> <span id="s833">So I gave numbers to the letters and I had a secretary that would type them, and I’d say number two, number three.</span> <span id="s834">And this is -- and I was very fortunate with -- given an opportunity.</span> <span id="s835">I also learned that if you want something, you have to ask for it.</span> <span id="s836">That man was wonderful to me.</span> <span id="s837">The day I met him, I said, “I’ll never leave you unless I can go in business for myself.</span> <span id="s838">That’s the only time when -- when I will leave you.”</span> <span id="s839">Well, Trude in the meantime -- you remember Trude, came to America.</span> <span id="s840">She had a much harder time than I did getting out.</span> <span id="s841">She escaped to Belgium and had terrible experiences.</span> <span id="s842">And in 1942, we were -- we were married.</span> <span id="s843">She came to America in 1940, and we married in 1942.</span> <span id="s844">And her mother and father came to -- came to Greenville with her, and her uncle did.</span> <span id="s845">This same man, this Mr. Saltzman who had given a job to my father, to my sister, now he gave a job to her father and her uncle.</span> <span id="s846">He was a -- this man was -- was an angel.</span> <span id="s847">He rests in peace, I can tell you that.</span> <span id="s848">Then, after -- I made my -- and Trude, my wife, she worked in the factory.</span> <span id="s849">She -- she worked in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Can I just ask what -- when did your parents finally get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: In November of 1938, yeah.</span> <span id="s852">So the whole family, we were all working at the shirt factory.</span> <span id="s853">And -- and I had made progress there, I -- I was there -- after six years, seven years, I became a -- a vice president of the company.</span> <span id="s854">He was very good to me, he -- he said, “I’ll let you buy one percent of the business, and the way you pay for it is from the profit.”</span> <span id="s855">And so I owned one percent of the company.</span> <span id="s856">Ultimately I did go in business for myself in 1946.</span> <span id="s857">I went in business, I left him.</span> <span id="s858">He was, I would say rightfully so, he was upset, because he had been wonderful to me.</span> <span id="s859">But I always wanted to be in business for myself, and we had saved up about 10,000 dollars, because every time I was promoted, I would get a very nice increase, and my wife worked, and I worked, and we -- we were careful.</span> <span id="s860">W-We never had a credit -- a charge card until we had enough money to know that we can pay.</span> <span id="s861">So anyhow, I went in business with a partner in 1946, and went into the shirt business in a different city because I didn't want to be competitive.</span> <span id="s862">And after two years we split.</span> <span id="s863">And he remained with the business, and I had more money than I thought ever existed, because we had done well in those two years.</span> <span id="s864">But as partners we did not get along, and we had a buy or sell agreement.</span> <span id="s865">So after I sold my share of the business, a few days later I went in business for myself, and my only partner was my wife.</span> <span id="s866">I started a company called Maxon shirt company, and that was in 1948.</span> <span id="s867">And the company did well, and we, in the meantime we had three children, three wonderful children, two daughters and a son.</span> <span id="s868">We had bought our own home.</span> <span id="s869">It was modest, and -- but we paid for it.</span> <span id="s870">And so I went into business, as I said myself, and that was in 1948.</span> <span id="s871">14 years later I sold that business, and that was a philosophical decision.</span> <span id="s872">First of all we learned that you don’t worship money.</span> <span id="s873">And Trude and I felt the same way about it.</span> <span id="s874">I had met a friend of mine who had very bad business problems.</span> <span id="s875">And he -- I noticed that he was really beside himself, and I -- I said this -- this -- I just won’t let this happen.</span> <span id="s876">And so I said, I don’t want to be the richest man in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s877">And we had a chance to either go public, or sell the business.</span> <span id="s878">And I told Trude, I said Trude, “I -- I want to sell.</span> <span id="s879">How do you feel about it?”</span> <span id="s880">And she says, “If that’s what you want.</span> <span id="s881">What are you going to do?”</span> <span id="s882">I said, “Don’t worry.”</span> <span id="s883">So in 1962, after in business 14 years, I sold the business.</span> <span id="s884">And I stayed with the business for five years, I had a contract.</span> <span id="s885">I was active in the community as soon as I could.</span> <span id="s886">My first experience in community work was with a group of Christian women who were interested to do something about first and youthful offenders.</span> <span id="s887">It was my first involvement, and I became deeply interested in that when we were able to get laws changed where youthful offenders were separated from hardened criminals.</span> <span id="s888">And I continued to be quite active in the community, including, of course, the synagogue, president of the synagogue and every Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s889">And then one day I received a call saying there’s a rumor that you are interested to run for mayor.</span> <span id="s890">I thought -- that had never, never occurred to me.</span> <span id="s891">But I had been involved do something about housing for the poor.</span> <span id="s892">I became very interested in that, and I started a housing foundation.</span> <span id="s893">And wherever I turned, I found that the government is involved.</span> <span id="s894">And I said no, I -- I’m not going to run for mayor, but maybe I’ll run for city council, and I did.</span> <span id="s895">And so I was elected for -- on a two year term.</span> <span id="s896">And then after two years the -- the term of the mayor was up.</span> <span id="s897">And I -- I ran for mayor and I was elected, about 70 percent of the vote.</span> <span id="s898">Interestingly enough, I ran as a democrat, I had no opposition from the republicans, but I had oppositions from the democrats, and they -- the fellow who ran against me came to me one day, and he says, “You know, God came to me and said that I should run against you.”</span> <span id="s899">This is the truth.</span> <span id="s900">And I says, “Well God never said anything to me about you.”</span> <span id="s901">Well, make a long story short, I -- I was elected, and I was mayor for a -- two four year terms, eight years.</span> <span id="s902">I also ran for the Congress.</span> <span id="s903">At the end of -- we -- we -- I proposed the term limitations.</span> <span id="s904">I felt like eight years is plenty, and so I could not run again and this -- the congressional seat was open, and so I ran for that.</span> <span id="s905">And I won the primary, but I lost the election.</span> <span id="s906">Some of that experience was anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s907">I had -- I had some anti-Semitic experiences.</span> <span id="s908">I’m not saying that’s why I lost, but the fact is -- what happened was 30 days before the election a third candidate entered and he, on Thursday before the election he called a news conference saying that Max Heller is not fit to serve because he does not believe in Christ.</span> <span id="s909">And when you go to Washington, in time of need, who are you going to call on?</span> <span id="s910">And I -- I thought this was ridiculous, everybody knew that I was Jewish, and -- and I -- I really -- I said -- my response was that people are not going to believe any of -- I mean, make this an issue.</span> <span id="s911">My wife told me, she says, “You’re making a mistake, you ought to really fight this hard.”</span> <span id="s912">I said, “Look, it’s Thursday, the election is Tuesday.”</span> <span id="s913">Well, make a long story short, I -- I lost the election by maybe two percent, and then consequently I was asked by the governor of the state if I would serve as chairman of the state development board -- economic development, which is equivalent to secretary of commerce.</span> <span id="s914">And I did that -- we did that, I should say, for four years.</span> <span id="s915">And that was a very good experience.</span> <span id="s916">And then consequently of course, came home, came back home.</span> <span id="s917">We lived in -- in the capital.</span> <span id="s918">Our children grew up, we -- we had wonderful, wonderful family.</span> <span id="s919">We now have 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild, and two great-grandchildren on the way, and we have -- we had a wedding not long ago, one of our granddaughters.</span> <span id="s920">We have another one coming up in four weeks.</span> <span id="s921">We’ve been very fortunate.</span> <span id="s922">We have good children, we have good grandchildren, and I must say that they -- if there’s one thing that they have done that I am proud of, there is no intolerance, no bigotry in those children or grandchildren.</span> <span id="s923">None.</span> <span id="s924">None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s925">And they’ve had some experiences where -- one of my grand -- one of my children came home from school crying and says, so and so said that I killed Christ.</span> <span id="s926">But it didn’t -- that did not change their lives.</span> <span id="s927">So they grew up very, very good -- I have a lot of -- very, very much to be grateful for, and I am.</span> <span id="s928">I am very grateful.</span> <span id="s929">I’ve devoted, I’d say, the last 30 years of my life -- I should say we, because my wife is the same way, for the community.</span> <span id="s930">And I’ve had no regrets to be out of business.</span> <span id="s931">I got enough money when we sold the business to manage it careful.</span> <span id="s932">And we’ve had no [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s933">I’m not the richest man in the cemetery, I never want to be.</span> <span id="s934">And we -- we thank every God -- every day that we are here, we are grateful.</span> <span id="s935">And we’ve told that to -- to our children.</span> <span id="s936">We tell it to -- we -- both my wife and I, we speak in schools, we speak in churches.</span> <span id="s937">And I think it’s important that people hear this message.</span> <span id="s938">We often think that when we are dead, when this generation dies, it becomes a history in the books, or on videotape.</span> <span id="s939">And I think that’s one reason I consider it very important to do this interview, because this should not be forgotten.</span> <span id="s940">I wish that we had today copies of interviews that were done hundreds of years ago.</span> <span id="s941">All we have is mouth to ear, and written.</span> <span id="s942">And somehow, written history is not as powerful as when you can see it, or hear it.</span> <span id="s943">And I respect what is being done today, so that the -- the world should not forget.</span> <span id="s944">There has to be a lesson in all of that.</span> <span id="s945">I don’t know -- we often wonder how -- how -- really, how did this happen?</span> <span id="s946">We lost 90 people in the Holocaust, 90 of our family were killed.</span> <span id="s947">One cousin survived in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s948">She and four of her siblings and her mother and father were alive until the day when the Americans -- and they were in Theresienstadt, and the day when the Americans came in, the Nazis took trucks and ran over her family and everyone was killed except she.</span> <span id="s949">How in the world?</span> <span id="s950">How can we forget that?</span> <span id="s951">And as I said before, these are the very same people, Germany and Austria, and for that matter Poland, the Poles did their share of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s952">They had more churches.</span> <span id="s953">The Viennese loved music, and they -- they -- they produced some of the finest writers in the world, a -- the Germans did.</span> <span id="s954">And these are the very same people who perfected the art of killing.</span> <span id="s955">And nobody can tell me that people didn’t know about this.</span> <span id="s956">When you think about it, hundreds and thousands of concentration camps, it took architects, it took engineers, it took builders, carpenters, guards, railroad conductors, truck drivers.</span> <span id="s957">Millions of people were involved to commit this crime.</span> <span id="s958">And nobody can tell me that people didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s959">They should feel guilty.</span> <span id="s960">The new generation of Germans, I really think, is trying to overcome this.</span> <span id="s961">The Austrians have not learned quite as well.</span> <span id="s962">And yet, I find it very disturbing that in an election not long ago in -- in Austria, about 20 percent of the vote went to the Nazi movement.</span> <span id="s963">And that’s bothersome.</span> <span id="s964">That’s something that we need to be concerned about.</span> <span id="s965">I -- I’d like to -- I think this could be the end of my -- of the interview, unless you have something else that you want to ask me.</span> <span id="s966">I don’t know how we as a people can impart to others that there is so much good in the world, and yet there is so much evil.</span> <span id="s967">And what is so important, that the good overcomes the evil.</span> <span id="s968">Good people can become bad, and I always say, find the good people, find those and protect them.</span> <span id="s969">But also, speak up when you hear bigots.</span> <span id="s970">And what we have to remember, hatred is hatred.</span> <span id="s971">If there is hatred against minorities because of their color, it’s the same as hatred because of religion.</span> <span id="s972">And we, as Jews, especially those of us who survived, have a responsibility, we have a duty, if nothing else, to speak up.</span> <span id="s973">Speak up and help others to overcome this.</span> <span id="s974">If there is nothing else we’ve done, I think that that -- that has to be a mission.</span> <span id="s975">So, we have not lost faith, we have not lost faith in people, and we have not lost in faith in our religion.</span> <span id="s976">I feel very good with what I am.</span> <span id="s977">And I’m very grateful.</span> <span id="s978">And if my children or grandchildren, or great-grandchildren and my wife see this, I just want you know that I love you.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: I actually do have a few questions.</span> <span id="s980">Do you want to take a break, or do you want me to --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: I want to go back to I think when you first came to South Carolina.</span> <span id="s983">I know that Americans can be insular, and I’m -- and you told me about the -- the really wonderful, moving experiences you had with some individuals.</span> <span id="s984">But when you came into this factory, and I suspect especially because you did well, did you ever feel resented because you were a foreigner?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Because you were a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: I mean you --</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Not in the factory, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: In Greenville, it -- I -- I doubt there was a huge Jewish community.</span> <span id="s991">I mean in -- or even a -- a huge European community for that matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: I’m just wondering what that felt like, if you ever felt different, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: No, not -- not really.</span> <span id="s995">You have to remember, I would have scrubbed floors and sw -- and sleep on the ground.</span> <span id="s996">I was so happy to be there.</span> <span id="s997">I never -- I never felt -- i-in fact, I must say that -- I’ll never forget this, I was asked to make a talk, just after I’d been here a few months, and it was to a Masonic group.</span> <span id="s998">And I tried to tell them about the difference between America and what happened in Europe.</span> <span id="s999">And at the end of the talk, they passed a hat.</span> <span id="s1000">And they presented me something like 30 dollars.</span> <span id="s1001">Well, that was a lot of money then.</span> <span id="s1002">And they said, “I want you -- I want you to have this.”</span> <span id="s1003">And I said, “I -- I cannot accept that,” I says, “I have a job, and I’m not hungry,” I said.</span> <span id="s1004">“But if you let me give this to a Jewish charity, I accept it.”</span> <span id="s1005">And they said, “We are honored to do that.”</span> <span id="s1006">I once spoke at a church and I -- and I tried to bring out the difference between America and here, and -- and some of -- always was a question and answer period.</span> <span id="s1007">And somebody said to me, “Oh this -- America’s not as free as you think.”</span> <span id="s1008">And I said, “The very fact that you can get up and say this without fear of being arrested, tells me that this is a free country.”</span> <span id="s1009">So, no I -- I -- most people were -- tried to be very helpful.</span> <span id="s1010">The newspaper -- you know, we were an oddity in a way, because we were the first refugees, and so the newspaper was very interested.</span> <span id="s1011">One of the pictures that I cherish that I have was a picture with a policeman who put his arm around me.</span> <span id="s1012">That meant a great deal to me.</span> <span id="s1013">Here was a policeman who -- who was my friend.</span> <span id="s1014">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: So there never was any cultural adjustment, or you were never ostracized, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1017">When Trude and I, after we became engaged, we were looking for an apartment and we saw an apartment we liked, and I did not hear from the real estate man for a number of weeks and I called him finally.</span> <span id="s1018">And I says, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s1019">And he said, “Well I don’t know how to tell you this, but this man will not rent to Jews.”</span> <span id="s1020">And I was -- I was shocked.</span> <span id="s1021">I was shocked.</span> <span id="s1022">And so, we went out looking for other apartments and we saw one apartment in a wonderful section of Greenville, and we went in there, introduced ourselves, the lady’s name was Keller.</span> <span id="s1023">And showed me the apartment, and I said -- and she told me how much it was, and I said, “My -- we can’t afford that.”</span> <span id="s1024">I think it was like 80 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s1025">And she says, “Pay me less, because I -- I li -- I want you.</span> <span id="s1026">I want you to be here.</span> <span id="s1027">I -- I like you both.”</span> <span id="s1028">And I said, “We are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1029">She says, “That’s wonderful.”</span> <span id="s1030">So, the experience I had before was offset by that.</span> <span id="s1031">So there was very -- you know, I had very -- of course there was anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1032">Some people had never seen a Jew.</span> <span id="s1033">They thought we wear horns, and things like that, and th-there are always -- there always will be -- it’s a question of degree, but no, I -- and when I ran for public office, yes, there was some anti-Semitism, there was no question about it.</span> <span id="s1034">A lot of it was whispered, and you know, people say, well, you don’t want the Jew to run this city, blah, blah, blah, but 70 percent of the people voted for me and the other 30 percent did not vote against me because I was Jewish, they voted against me because maybe they didn’t like me, what I proposed.</span> <span id="s1035">I was very open that I was for integration.</span> <span id="s1036">Totally open.</span> <span id="s1037">And I -- you know, I was shocked, frankly, when I came to South Carolina to find the way it was segregated.</span> <span id="s1038">Blacks were not allowed to work in the same room with whites.</span> <span id="s1039">The toilets were marked white and -- and -- and colored.</span> <span id="s1040">There was a water fountain that the sign was -- said colored.</span> <span id="s1041">I thought it was pink water.</span> <span id="s1042">And -- and I was shocked by that.</span> <span id="s1043">And when I had -- when we had our own factory, one day I just took down the signs.</span> <span id="s1044">And you know what happened?</span> <span id="s1045">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1046">People came to work the next day, they -- they sat next to each other in the canteen, they used the same bathrooms, they worked next to each other.</span> <span id="s1047">Nobody complained.</span> <span id="s1048">I think some people were relieved that this was over with.</span> <span id="s1049">So my -- my experience there was a great -- much greater shock than any kind of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1050">A-As I said, when I ran for office, I was very open with what I want to accomplish.</span> <span id="s1051">And we integrated the city departments, we created commissions that were totally integrated.</span> <span id="s1052">We had a bricklayer next to a banker and they got along beautiful.</span> <span id="s1053">Th-This is -- this made me feel very good, I mean, very happy about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: I was going to ask you in terms of your -- both Jewish community and civic work, what you feel were your most meaningful accomplishments.</span> <span id="s1055">I think especially given your background.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: One, I was mayor.</span> <span id="s1057">I -- I’ll tell you what meant the most to me, that’s -- but -- but -- I get a -- I get credit for having a rebirth of downtown, and I have -- I can show you newspaper articles, and people have been very nice, honorary doctorates and all that.</span> <span id="s1058">What meant the most to me, was we had a -- a -- a public bus system.</span> <span id="s1059">While I was mayor, the people that ran the company came in one day and gave us 30 day notice that they were going to quit unless we -- we subsidize it unlimited.</span> <span id="s1060">And I said, “Well we -- we can’t do that.”</span> <span id="s1061">I called a meeting of churches, and I said, “I know you have buses.</span> <span id="s1062">Would you lend us some buses?”</span> <span id="s1063">And I had more buses than we needed.</span> <span id="s1064">I went to the technical school, and asked them, “Would you train people to drive buses?”</span> <span id="s1065">30 days after they gave me notice, and they walked out, we had a bus system running.</span> <span id="s1066">Some of the buses had signs, Jesus saves and all that.</span> <span id="s1067">People laughed about it.</span> <span id="s1068">That Christmas there was a parade and I -- I was -- my wife and I were in a open car, and what touched me more than anything -- poor people that had to use these buses depended on going to work, and people would yell out, thank you for the buses.</span> <span id="s1069">That really touched the people.</span> <span id="s1070">Whatever else happened, of course it was meaningful and I feel good about it, but that was the thing that brought me closest to the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: It sounds like you were also active in civil rights efforts [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Yes, and I -- and I s -- I still am.</span> <span id="s1073">Right now I co-chair a small committee, a bi-racial committee.</span> <span id="s1074">We’ve had some problems in the jail and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1075">Yeah, I -- I’ve always been.</span> <span id="s1076">I’ve been involved in -- I’ve been -- been involved in education for many years.</span> <span id="s1077">Fighting for better education.</span> <span id="s1078">This judge who came to see me was -- became president of a university called Furman University, and I’ve been involved with them for many years on their advisory board, and we have a scholarship in the name of the girl that brought me here.</span> <span id="s1079">We have a scholarship in the name of the man who brought me here, and we have a scholarship in Trude and my name.</span> <span id="s1080">And -- and that -- I think that’s -- that was important to us.</span> <span id="s1081">Education is.</span> <span id="s1082">And so we continue, we’re -- both of us continue to be active, and why not?</span> <span id="s1083">I live there.</span> <span id="s1084">This is my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: It’s interesting that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q2: One minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: How many?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q2: One minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Well, one minute, we might as well stop.</span> <span id="s1090">So [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1091">But -- End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: It’s okay.</span> <span id="s1094">Couple more questions.</span> <span id="s1095">We talked a little bit about some of your political accomplishments and what’s meant a lot to you.</span> <span id="s1096">The -- I’m wondering if you were impacted slightly differently because of your experience by -- by pivotal events of the last 50 years, whether it’s the civil rights movement, the -- the wars today, the ethnic cleansing today, the Eichmann trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s1098">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: If any of -- or even the -- this -- the [indecipherable] sort of birth of the state of Israel, if there are any of these events that were especially powerful to you?</span> <span id="s1100">It’s a broad question, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Well, let me -- let me start off with the birth of Israel, because I think that was -- that was the turning point for the Jewish community of the world.</span> <span id="s1102">I really do.</span> <span id="s1103">Suddenly, every Jew was so proud to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s1104">Really proud.</span> <span id="s1105">And the -- there were -- people -- there were many, unfortunate, that were not proud, they -- and I can understand that too.</span> <span id="s1106">They’d had nothing to hold onto and suddenly here’s a state, a state of Israel.</span> <span id="s1107">So that was -- that was a joy.</span> <span id="s1108">People would come up to me on the street and congratulate me, as if I had anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s1109">We’re so proud.</span> <span id="s1110">And we were so proud, there was -- and -- and this is one reason I -- I -- I say we must -- we must support the -- the people of Israel.</span> <span id="s1111">They’re the ones that fought a battle for us that we did not fight.</span> <span id="s1112">My children and grandchildren have asked me, how come you didn’t fight?</span> <span id="s1113">I said, that’s a tough question.</span> <span id="s1114">One grandchild especially, Danny.</span> <span id="s1115">And it’s a tough, tough answer.</span> <span id="s1116">And I said, “We had nothing to fight with.”</span> <span id="s1117">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1118">We were like cows going to slaughter.</span> <span id="s1119">And here is this state, here this -- this new Jew, who is fighting.</span> <span id="s1120">So that -- that is a great, great, great happening in the history of the Jews, very dramatic.</span> <span id="s1121">Without a doubt, that -- that’s been one of the events.</span> <span id="s1122">But of course other events in my life are -- are really very personal.</span> <span id="s1123">Getting married, having children, having grandchildren, an-and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1124">I -- I remember at the United Nations there was a -- there was a resolution passed that was very, very anti-Israel.</span> <span id="s1125">And that particular day -- I was mayor then -- I greeted several thousand Baptists who had come to a convention, and I was a few minutes late getting there because I listened to the news program in the morning.</span> <span id="s1126">And when I got up to greet them, I says, “I have to pour my heart out to you.</span> <span id="s1127">I am late because of what happened at the United Nations.</span> <span id="s1128">How dare they did to this remnant of our people?</span> <span id="s1129">God’s people.”</span> <span id="s1130">And I said, “You of all people, you who are good Christians, you have to help me.”</span> <span id="s1131">I got a standing ovation.</span> <span id="s1132">And the next day -- and I still have a copy of it, the newspaper wrote -- had -- had an editorial [indecipherable] Heller gives Hell to United Nation, bravo, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1133">That was -- that was a good feeling, to speak up, but it was also a good feeling to be supported, then.</span> <span id="s1134">So the -- these are [indecipherable] it’s so -- so hard to remember all the different things that happened to you.</span> <span id="s1135">I just happened to think of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: I’m just thinking about all of the -- the -- the wars today and the ethnic cleansing in various parts of the world, does that stir up anything in you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: Well, they asked me -- it does -- it does, it’s -- it’s just when -- when it happened in Yugoslavia and -- and Bosnia-Herzegovina and all that, Trude and I belonged to a group called Renaissance, and we -- once a year there’s a meeting in Hilton Head of hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s1138">In fact, President Clinton, this is where I met him the first time.</span> <span id="s1139">And this was -- that particular time I -- I was asked to have a -- say something, a speech before this group.</span> <span id="s1140">And what I spoke of -- about, this Holocaust, I called it a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1141">And I said, just because they are not Jewish, does not mean that it’s not a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1142">And we don’t do a thing about it.</span> <span id="s1143">And this is tragic.</span> <span id="s1144">And this was very, very, very important to me to be able to say that.</span> <span id="s1145">And there were governors there, and -- and Clinton was there.</span> <span id="s1146">And there were mayors there, and there were politicians there, and writers there, and it had to be said.</span> <span id="s1147">This, I think, was a bad thing that the United States waited that long.</span> <span id="s1148">Because we of all people, we Americans of all people, must understand that we cannot let this happen to others.</span> <span id="s1149">And I’m not saying that you go to war everywhere, but there are many ways that we can assert our leadership.</span> <span id="s1150">We are -- we are the leaders of this world, and I get passionate about that.</span> <span id="s1151">There is killings going on every day, whether it’s in Rwanda, or whether it’s the Hutsies and the Tootsies and what have you.</span> <span id="s1152">And we have to do everything we can to -- to stop that.</span> <span id="s1153">That’s an obligation that we have.</span> <span id="s1154">We are doing a lot.</span> <span id="s1155">I would say that the United States is really the one country in the world that is doing something about it.</span> <span id="s1156">Others totally ignore it, but we don’t, I mean we send help, we’ve sent our soldiers, we -- and we still have soldiers over there.</span> <span id="s1157">But on the other hand we still have soldiers in Japan to protect the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1158">We still have soldiers in Germany.</span> <span id="s1159">We are part of NATO.</span> <span id="s1160">And so when people criticize that we have soldiers in Yugoslavia to keep the peace, why is that bad, and it’s not bad to keep them in Japan?</span> <span id="s1161">So you asked me the right question, I guess.</span> <span id="s1162">I -- I really feel very strong about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: One more question, it’s this -- it’s a slightly different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Let me just add one thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: -- but to be perfectly honest, I have been upset with some of my friends -- ne -- the -- I’m not that friendly any more, that have -- that are immigrants like I am, like we are, and when this happened in -- in Yugoslavia, who said to me, “This is none of our business.</span> <span id="s1167">What do we have to do with it?”</span> <span id="s1168">And I said, “My God, you of all people?</span> <span id="s1169">You are saying what others said when our people were dying in Europe.”</span> <span id="s1170">That’s exactly what they said.</span> <span id="s1171">And I-I -- I can’t understand how people that have been through what we have been -- and -- and they’ve been through more than when I think what others suffered, I -- I did not.</span> <span id="s1172">And yet, they say, oh, it’s none of my business, just because they don’t feel the pain, and they should feel the pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: How -- how do you respond to the conditions in Gaza?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: Well, first of all, Gaza, I -- let -- let the -- the Arabs have Gaza, what’s there?</span> <span id="s1175">.</span> <span id="s1176">What is there?</span> <span id="s1177">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1178">Peace has to become -- has to come to Israel and -- and the Arab nations.</span> <span id="s1179">What is the answer if it’s not peace?</span> <span id="s1180">You know, what is the alternative?</span> <span id="s1181">And how long can Israel go on and bleed themselves?</span> <span id="s1182">And they are bleeding themselves, when -- when such a large portion of their national budget has to go for defense.</span> <span id="s1183">So peace has to -- has to occur.</span> <span id="s1184">Both Trude and I were -- were very, very honored to be asked to be present several years ago at the signing here in Washington.</span> <span id="s1185">And I happened to sit next to an Arab woman, and we both cried.</span> <span id="s1186">She wanted peace for her people, I wanted peace for my people, and there has to be a way.</span> <span id="s1187">Land is not that important unless it is part of the national defense.</span> <span id="s1188">There is no compromise on that.</span> <span id="s1189">Beyond that, it’s only dirt.</span> <span id="s1190">But the national defense without a doubt, and Israel is -- has to be realistic that Israel is surrounded by -- by many enemies, and it’ll take generations, if ever, that this feeling of hatred will change.</span> <span id="s1191">But there is no answer, other than a -- has to be a peaceful solution.</span> <span id="s1192">I wish Solomon was back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Whatever happened to Mary Mills?</span> <span id="s1194">Did you stay friends with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Well, at first -- she wrote me by the way, while I was still in Europe.</span> <span id="s1196">I think you know Shep Saltzman wrote me, “I think you should know that Mary Mills is engaged to be married this fall.”</span> <span id="s1197">Most people thought there was a romance there, and there wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1198">I mean, we didn’t even hold hands when we walked.</span> <span id="s1199">When we first -- when I first came, her husband -- her then became husband, there was some jealousy there, I think, and -- and when Trude and I were married, we didn't -- we s -- once a year we would communicate, and -- but there was a distance at first.</span> <span id="s1200">But then, as we had children, and they had children, our children began to meet.</span> <span id="s1201">And we were -- we became -- we became really good friends.</span> <span id="s1202">Mary Mills died a few years ago.</span> <span id="s1203">She was my angel.</span> <span id="s1204">The beautiful thing about it, she never realized what she had done.</span> <span id="s1205">To her it was a very natural thing.</span> <span id="s1206">We’re still friendly with one of her daughters who -- who did live in Greenville, but recently moved.</span> <span id="s1207">So she is done, she’s -- her picture is -- is -- I have a picture of my family in our bedroom, but I also have a picture of Mary Mills in that room.</span> <span id="s1208">I don’t want my children ever forget who she was.</span> <span id="s1209">I want them to know, too.</span> <span id="s1210">So that’s what happened to Mary Mills.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Is there anything else you want to add on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: No, really, really not.</span> <span id="s1213">I -- I think I poured my heart out.</span> <span id="s1214">I appreciate what you are doing.</span> <span id="s1215">I think it’s very important.</span> <span id="s1216">I appreciate what the Holocaust Museum is doing for -- not just for -- for Jews, this is a Christian problem as well, the problem that we have.</span> <span id="s1217">This is a Muslim problem, this is -- whatever happened to us -- us as Jews was -- is also a problem of the world.</span> <span id="s1218">And the Holocaust Museum can serve to remind people that there can be evil, but also that there can be good.</span> <span id="s1219">So I -- I want to thank you for the work that you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: It’s my honor.</span> <span id="s1221">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1222">Let’s see what -- over there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: The pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: All right Max, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: This is a picture of my grandparents on my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s1226">My grandmother’s name was Miriam and my grandfather’s name was Samuel Norfin.</span> <span id="s1227">They lived in Lubachow, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Do you know what year that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: This -- this was taken maybe -- oh God, I’d say 70 years ago.</span> <span id="s1230">About 70 years, I would say.</span> <span id="s1231">Maybe more, maybe more, 80 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Okay [indecipherable] years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Right, I -- I would say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Okay, we’re rolling.</span> <span id="s1235">Start any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: This is my mother Leah at a costume ball.</span> <span id="s1237">She was dressed as a Gypsy, and this was taken about 1900 and -- in the 1920’s, so this picture is about 78 years old.</span> <span id="s1238">This is September 1998.</span> <span id="s1239">And that was in Vienna at a costume ball.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1241">And stand by [indecipherable] Max, tell us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: This is a photo of my father when he was in service for the German army in nin -- from between 1914 - 1918.</span> <span id="s1243">My father is the one sitting on the left, and I assume that this picture was taken 1915, something like that.</span> <span id="s1244">He, by the way, was wounded in service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Rolling camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Here you see my sister Paula on the left side, my mother, of course in the middle, and next me, on the right side.</span> <span id="s1247">This -- this photo was taken in 1922, I believe.</span> <span id="s1248">I was about three years old and my sister was five years old.</span> <span id="s1249">My sister died recently.</span> <span id="s1250">Her name was Paula.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: This shows me as a happy 10 year old in 1929.</span> <span id="s1253">It was taken in a park.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Okay, tapes rolling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: This shows my wife Trude, the year I met her in 1937 in the summer resort, and I immediately fell in love with her and I still am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Now is that a photo you took, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: They had it taken on the boat.</span> <span id="s1260">It was taken by a ship photographer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: All right, go ahead and tell us about [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: This shows the five young ladies I met in Vienna in 1937.</span> <span id="s1263">The one on the right side, on the outside is Mary Mills.</span> <span id="s1264">And she is the one who saved my life.</span> <span id="s1265">A wonderful person.</span> <span id="s1266">It was taken on the ship, the Ile de France, which is the same ship that I came over on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: You
