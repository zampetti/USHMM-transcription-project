story.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Well, we’re very happy to have you to be here with you.</span> <span id="s18">So, first let me ask you – what was your name when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My name was Helene or Leney, they called me, Mencel, M-e-n-c-e-l.</span> <span id="s20">You would pronounce it sometimes Men-chel.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: M-e-n</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: c-e-l, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And you were born where?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I was born in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: In Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: It was in Vienna, outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: And what year and what day?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: It was 1912, May 10th.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: May 10th?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: So, you’re a Gemini?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A Are you a Gemini?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s35">I don’t go by that there.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: I wanted to get some sense of what life was like for you when you were growing up.</span> <span id="s37">So, first let’s talk about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: All right, I will tell you about my family first, but before I start, I wanted to say something why I am here and why I was hesitating for a long time to tell my story.</span> <span id="s39">The reason was because it’s not the typical story of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s40">I was not in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s41">It is my life during the Nazis outside.</span> <span id="s42">It is actually a story of faith, all about faith, hope, courage, think about all miracles.</span> <span id="s43">I want to bring it out in this story, that if you believe in it or not, miracles still exist.</span> <span id="s44">Now, you want to hear about my family, correct?</span> <span id="s45">I, we have been six.</span> <span id="s46">Originally, we had a brother died before I was born, and other sister.</span> <span id="s47">I am the youngest in my family.</span> <span id="s48">I have a sister Berthe.</span> <span id="s49">She’s the oldest.</span> <span id="s50">Then I have sister Fanny (ph) she is – she comes after.</span> <span id="s51">I adored Fanny.</span> <span id="s52">She was – had charisma.</span> <span id="s53">She was outgoing.</span> <span id="s54">She was beautiful.</span> <span id="s55">Sometimes I wonder how I admired her so that I didn’t resent it in that I wasn’t jealous.</span> <span id="s56">For instance, coming back, all my family was very good in mathematics.</span> <span id="s57">My father was almost a genius in that field.</span> <span id="s58">She was excellent, but I wasn’t very good mathematics.</span> <span id="s59">I was the best in physics.</span> <span id="s60">But I never reached Fanny, you understand, and the teacher would always say when I was a little kid, “You are good, but not like your sister Fanny.”</span> <span id="s61">I didn’t resent her.</span> <span id="s62">I loved her, and it is actually strange.</span> <span id="s63">Then, I had brother.</span> <span id="s64">He was known – he was an excellent chess player, and what he did – Fanny had a doctorate in chemistry, the other sister just told you – he was in business with stamps.</span> <span id="s65">He was a stamp collector, but it was really, it was his business, and then he was excellent chess player, they called him from all Europe (ph).</span> <span id="s66">And then there were myself.</span> <span id="s67">That it is about the story.</span> <span id="s68">We grew up in Vienna.</span> <span id="s69">Vienna is one of the most beautiful cities.</span> <span id="s70">I love Vienna.</span> <span id="s71">I’d go back to Vienna, and people sometimes resent it, coming from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s72">Vienna was occupied – why do you go back?</span> <span id="s73">I did not know at first.</span> <span id="s74">I was thinking, “Why do I go back?”</span> <span id="s75">I found out I go – if I would not go back, if I would be afraid, it would be a victory of Hitler.</span> <span id="s76">This city didn’t belong to him.</span> <span id="s77">It was part of me.</span> <span id="s78">I grew up there with my father and my mother my sisters.</span> <span id="s79">I went to school.</span> <span id="s80">I was so happy there and I want to keep it.</span> <span id="s81">So, I go back whenever I have some money left.</span> <span id="s82">I go back, enjoy the street, enjoy the schools.</span> <span id="s83">That is about.</span> <span id="s84">Do you want me to talk about other things like schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Let me first ask you about-</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: About what it was like in your home.</span> <span id="s88">What’s your earliest memory as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: What is my earliest memory as a child?</span> <span id="s90">You will laugh, but I sort of remember when we celebrated a Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s91">I must have been very little, and my father was sitting was sitting there and this was a Seder, and that he had a pillow sitting it.</span> <span id="s92">I had a feeling he is not really there, he was so involved, but not my mother.</span> <span id="s93">He was so involved and at times, I asked my mother, “Is father God himself?”</span> <span id="s94">I was so little, maybe three or four years old, but it made that kind of impression.</span> <span id="s95">My life was very lively.</span> <span id="s96">We were four children.</span> <span id="s97">As you can imagine, I was the youngest, really the youngest.</span> <span id="s98">My oldest sister Berthe was like a mother to me, and I always thought, well, she tried to boss me around, but it was not easy, and I thought very often, “One day I will be older than all of you, and then I will be the boss!”</span> <span id="s99">And they adored me, but suddenly, nobody expected that there was a little girl here.</span> <span id="s100">And I was actually spoiled, but not spoiled, because if you hear my story and what developed and how I developed, you have to tell yourself, maybe it doesn’t hurt if you spoil somebody.</span> <span id="s101">Vienna was beautiful.</span> <span id="s102">Vienna was a city everybody would like to go.</span> <span id="s103">There was art.</span> <span id="s104">They describe it in the books; later it came out.</span> <span id="s105">There is no other city in Europe that you have at the same time, the most famous writer, the most famous artists, the most famous composers.</span> <span id="s106">There was like music in the air.</span> <span id="s107">Now, when I go back, I hear it.</span> <span id="s108">I walk on the Chancellor Strasse – people are playing the violin, people are singing.</span> <span id="s109">It’s a different world.</span> <span id="s110">When people sometimes visit Vienna now, and they come back and they say something like, “I was a little bit disappointed, the way you describe it.”</span> <span id="s111">I cannot understand it.</span> <span id="s112">They did not feel what I feel.</span> <span id="s113">They do not see the city like I see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Were you close with your – did your father become a less god-like figure to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s116">That was three or – I would say definitely.</span> <span id="s117">I tell you, father and mother were very different.</span> <span id="s118">My father, everything meant to him – study, learn, work.</span> <span id="s119">He says he can take very interest because he can do – they can take everything away from you, but your learning, it will always stay with you.</span> <span id="s120">And I remember when I studied, all the schools, they were very strict, especially when I had the medical exams.</span> <span id="s121">I took the street car.</span> <span id="s122">He would be – he did not know when I would be coming home.</span> <span id="s123">He would wait hours to find out, “Did you pass it?</span> <span id="s124">Did you pass it?”</span> <span id="s125">Yes, I was close, but it was everything was learning.</span> <span id="s126">To a certain extent, I was closer to my mother even.</span> <span id="s127">She was more practical.</span> <span id="s128">She wanted me to have nice clothes to have – to have – father just wanted to have it all, too, but all in that picture of learning.</span> <span id="s129">Both were very different, my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s130">It was a good marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: It was a good marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yes, it was a very good marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: So, did you talk with your father about different things than you talked with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I’ll tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s135">I talked with him about studies and work, but he was interested, but not as much like my mother.</span> <span id="s136">You see, it was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: So, you talk with your mother about more personal things?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yeah, I talked with my mother about myself, about my friends, about Eddie, or whatever.</span> <span id="s139">That was the – my father was always – here about to stress it (ph) – he was unusual.</span> <span id="s140">He was unusual, then I would say he was almost like a genius when it came to mathematics.</span> <span id="s141">He didn’t have a formal training, and he could serve, he could help us with any kind, the hardest problems there was.</span> <span id="s142">He would know how to solve it.</span> <span id="s143">He, himself sometimes, he couldn’t explain it to me how he did it.</span> <span id="s144">He hadn’t learned it, but he came to it.</span> <span id="s145">Fanny, that sister, was to a certain extent like that.</span> <span id="s146">Then, I do not know.</span> <span id="s147">I had a brother, Benjamin – he died when he was 10.</span> <span id="s148">I was not born yet.</span> <span id="s149">And, they would tell stories – none of us children were like him.</span> <span id="s150">They would tell stories about him, how brilliant like as an infant he was.</span> <span id="s151">He would read something.</span> <span id="s152">He read the Torah.</span> <span id="s153">He knew the whole thing by heart.</span> <span id="s154">How kind and good, gentle people would talk to him.</span> <span id="s155">Years after he passed by, there was still, I was told, on his grave from some gentle people a note “Here lies Benjamin” and a few words that would describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: That’s very special.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: What did your father do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: He was in business.</span> <span id="s160">He was in business in men’s; it had to do with men’s clothing.</span> <span id="s161">You see, people made their clothes at the time, more than you went to the stores.</span> <span id="s162">He sold the material, the linings, the buttons, the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: And would you consider yourself fairly well-off?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: I would say middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Middle class?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s167">But not for the American way, you understand, but the Viennese, Austria at the time, nobody had a lot and were rich like here.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Did your mother work, as well, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No, no, she had four children, and no, she did not work.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Did you have lots of friends growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s172">I was at first, I was a little shy – overwhelmed by this, but I had friends and I need friends, until today, you know?</span> <span id="s173">You grow older, you lose sometimes somebody, but I would still say Mahkta (ph), she was my best friend.</span> <span id="s174">Funny, I would not say my sister, she was my best friend.</span> <span id="s175">I had friends.</span> <span id="s176">I was very popular, and I belong to youth groups that the called Maccabi, Blau Weiss.</span> <span id="s177">It was very oriented, but you had wanted to belong to something, and like I was a wonderful gymnast, and I belonged to the – you know, we were divided in row – I belonged to the first row, and we would travel through the blau weiss, through the maccabi, and here I was always little and short, and I was there.</span> <span id="s178">Here I have to tell you a true story.</span> <span id="s179">When you went to the maccabi and to exercise and to jump and to – the people watching – young kids watching, see who is good, who is not good, in a large gallery.</span> <span id="s180">I had a girlfriend and she was there, too.</span> <span id="s181">I was told years later when I started to - I must have 10, 11 years old – and I started to go out with Eddie, and hoping he will marry me one day – my friend Danie (ph) said, “Well, you achieved your goal.”</span> <span id="s182">I said, “What do you mean?”</span> <span id="s183">She said, “Don’t you remember?</span> <span id="s184">When we were little girls, you looked at him, and you said, ‘This is the boy I’m going to marry.</span> <span id="s185">This is a boy I want to marry.</span> <span id="s186">’” And, so, I married him, but it wasn’t hard.</span> <span id="s187">He went to medical school, and Eddie was so, he was known as one of the best looking guy of that.</span> <span id="s188">Sometimes I was wondering, maybe it would have been easier, if he wouldn’t have been so good-looking, because he was quite arrogant.</span> <span id="s189">Forgive me, Eddie, but lovable.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: So, you met – before you were ten years old, you were really children.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: We were children, but don’t you see, I didn’t meet him.</span> <span id="s192">I pointed out to her.</span> <span id="s193">I tell you why she remembers.</span> <span id="s194">Eddie was the best friend of the boy she married, and that’s the way she remembered it.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: That’s very sweet.</span> <span id="s196">Was your home a religious home?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: I tell you, yes, it was.</span> <span id="s198">My father wouldn’t like it that I hesitated because he was not fanatic.</span> <span id="s199">He was very religious, a very believing person.</span> <span id="s200">He knew that we were not so strict.</span> <span id="s201">And he just let it go.</span> <span id="s202">You know how some parents are?</span> <span id="s203">You better do this, or you better – but, it was a religious family.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: So, you celebrated holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Oh, yes, we celebrated all the Jewish holidays, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Did you go to Synagogue on a regular basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I tell you, at that time – my father at big holidays, we went there on the holidays.</span> <span id="s208">Don’t forget one thing, in Vienna – you have – it’s a subject, religion, you can flunk if you don’t do well.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: In the schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: In the school.</span> <span id="s211">You see there is the Catholic religion and the Protestant, but Vienna, Austria, was about 95 percent Catholic.</span> <span id="s212">The schools were very different from here.</span> <span id="s213">My children would get upset when I said it.</span> <span id="s214">It’s a shame.</span> <span id="s215">I pay so much money, you go only half the time you go to school, because in Vienna, Austria, you go six days to school.</span> <span id="s216">You go to mornings and afternoon.</span> <span id="s217">It’s not five days.</span> <span id="s218">Vacation all that you have is two months.</span> <span id="s219">You have here four months, and all the holidays.</span> <span id="s220">That was actually helpful because then you studied, you were much younger when you went to the university because we crammed it in a shorter period.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Did you have both Jewish and gentile friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yes, don’t forget, I sure did.</span> <span id="s223">Where we lived, there were not many Jews around in the district.</span> <span id="s224">Yes, we did, and under Hitler, here I will mention a story.</span> <span id="s225">There was one little girl of my age, but I remember the little girl.</span> <span id="s226">I’m sure her parents became Nazis, and maybe she, too, but she knew in the end I was alone.</span> <span id="s227">She came to me – Genny (ph) was her name.</span> <span id="s228">She gave me 10 dollars.</span> <span id="s229">It was for me, a lot of money, when you have nothing.</span> <span id="s230">I said, “I don’t want it.”</span> <span id="s231">“Please, Leney, please take it.”</span> <span id="s232">And it meant the world to me.</span> <span id="s233">You see that I’m still remembering that.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: So, when you were growing up in both being identified as Jewish, but your being in a context that wasn’t being Jewish.</span> <span id="s235">Did you feel anti-Semitism or was there-</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Yes, you felt it.</span> <span id="s237">You felt it, but it got worse because of the politics, it got worse.</span> <span id="s238">Don’t forget, in the friends I had at that time, there became many Nazis.</span> <span id="s239">They were not Nazis, we were children.</span> <span id="s240">I have very good friends, very good friends.</span> <span id="s241">Certain people who helped us afterward, it’s unreal – you have to see that picture.</span> <span id="s242">He was a janitor (ph) if I mention a name, I want it to be for Prischle (ph).</span> <span id="s243">She practically gave the life for us, you know, and the son, he still came to visit us here in the United States.</span> <span id="s244">She was just a janitor; you made more as a janitor here than over there.</span> <span id="s245">Poor, they are.</span> <span id="s246">She just swept the floor on her knees, but she was very bright.</span> <span id="s247">She helped us wherever she could.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Did you, as you were growing up and becoming an adult, feel that the Jewish community, in spite of anti-Semitism, was well-integrated with in Viennese culture and society and Austrian culture and society?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yes, they were.</span> <span id="s250">You know why?</span> <span id="s251">Because well, you couldn’t join the fanciest country club, but that wasn’t the point, because we were about two million people in Vienna, and we were about 10 percent, 200,000, but I hate to say it, but they were about the brightest.</span> <span id="s252">They would say when the Jewish people left, the spices – it’s still a beautiful, still a cultural city, but the spices had gone from that city.</span> <span id="s253">You see have the famous writers, and composers.</span> <span id="s254">Yes, we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: So it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: The anti-Semitism was developed by that.</span> <span id="s257">A certain amount is over there.</span> <span id="s258">You hear wherever you go, but pronounced they loved you, they liked you, but you were to a certain extent separated, because it was you, not them so much, belonged to the maccabi.</span> <span id="s259">I belonged to the blau weiss.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Explain the blau weiss.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Blau weiss, it was a youth movement, and it was especially motivated politically.</span> <span id="s262">It was a Zionist movement, and the people were very much interested in Israel.</span> <span id="s263">There was nothing here from Israel at that time, but still, the desire, you wanted to go there.</span> <span id="s264">You wanted to build up.</span> <span id="s265">There should be a state.</span> <span id="s266">There should be a country, like almost subconsciously you felt you should have something.</span> <span id="s267">My sister, for instance, Berthe, my parents were very unhappy.</span> <span id="s268">She was very young, 17 or 18 years old.</span> <span id="s269">She gave everything up.</span> <span id="s270">She did not go to the university.</span> <span id="s271">She wasn’t to build a state in Israel, a country for herself.</span> <span id="s272">If you know what it means, she was a halutz (ph); she __________ the story.</span> <span id="s273">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s274">She developed malaria, all of this.</span> <span id="s275">So, I did not grow up, I was not a person like here.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: She was a Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: She wasn’t a Zionist actually very strongly, but in blau weiss, when you became 14 or 15 years old, you already planned to go to Israel, what to do to be strong, not to study, there was no time.</span> <span id="s278">There were no, not that kind of schools.</span> <span id="s279">Like all my friends, my Jewish friends, not all, but maybe 60 or 70 percent, they left school and they went to Israel.</span> <span id="s280">They lived in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s281">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s282">I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s283">I wanted to become somebody.</span> <span id="s284">I wanted to be a physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: And Berthe, did she leave in her early 20s?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: She left probably.</span> <span id="s287">She was very young, 17 or 18 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: And, was your father – were your father and mother both Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yes, they were, yeah, but still they were against her leaving, especially my father.</span> <span id="s290">My mother, too, she wanted her here.</span> <span id="s291">Once you go, you are gone at that time, for days and weeks and there was no money to travel, yet they were, but mother was more practical, like I told you.</span> <span id="s292">She was the oldest daughter, you want her home.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: And, you didn’t see Berthe until – for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Not for a long time.</span> <span id="s295">She came back because she took sick, she had malaria, then she went back again.</span> <span id="s296">She helped actually.</span> <span id="s297">She rescued the parents.</span> <span id="s298">When Hitler moved in, you see, Israel was not – the Jews did not have Israel yet as a country.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: It was Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Palestine, you see, but the English had to give permission if you want to immigrate, and since there was a deadline, that only the parents can go to Israel, and only in this certain period.</span> <span id="s301">If you did not go within these two or three months, that was the end.</span> <span id="s302">You would not be able to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Let me go back a little bit and ask you a question about, by the time you are ten years old, it’s a few years after World War I.</span> <span id="s304">The situation in Austria must be somewhat difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yes, I’ll tell you, they were (ph), like I said, we didn’t have time for that.</span> <span id="s306">Austria once was a big empire and suddenly it became very small.</span> <span id="s307">Yes, we had very hard times, but the hard times were for all or most of the people, 90 percent of them, but you – it’s wrong to say you survived.</span> <span id="s308">Yes, we managed.</span> <span id="s309">That city in the life had to give you so much in a way, the kind of friendships you rarely see.</span> <span id="s310">The way you, when came a weekend, you would hike, you would ski together.</span> <span id="s311">Even in the little money of what- You did things together.</span> <span id="s312">You were _____ cultural, like I said before, it offered you so much, and you would – it was next come a weekend or whenever you had time, you would – even when you were very little, you would stay in the theater hours to be able to, not to get a seat, to get – to stand and to see that famous actors.</span> <span id="s313">You see, it was part of life, the same thing with a concert, it was a must, and you wanted to go to the concert, to the theater, to learn an instrument.</span> <span id="s314">You see, that helps even if you did not have financially all the goods, but to a certain extent, it also offered you a tremendous amount of richness.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Would you say this was fairly typical?</span> <span id="s316">That most of the young people that you knew were participating in the cultural life in this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: I hate to say it, but more Jewish people, more Jewish people.</span> <span id="s318">Whether it maybe brings out my history, I mean, I did not say not gentile, but that was very typical-</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Of Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Were you – other than being Zionist, was there a lot of political sensitivity in the family, so that you talked politics, what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yes, we talked politics.</span> <span id="s323">We talked politics because there were the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats.</span> <span id="s324">The Social Democrats were more liberal, you know.</span> <span id="s325">Muriel belonged to the Social Democrats, and there were, then there were the Communists.</span> <span id="s326">They put quite often the Democrats and the Communist in one party, what was wrong.</span> <span id="s327">Their ideas and ideals was not the same.</span> <span id="s328">And there was time we were not allowed to see the Social Democrats.</span> <span id="s329">And to enter fascists, and Muriel, when it comes out, belonged to...</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: To the Social Democrats?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yes, the anti-fascist movement.</span> <span id="s332">She worked in the underground for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: How’d it happen that you got interested to become a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: It’s a nice story.</span> <span id="s335">Yeah, I’ll tell you what it is.</span> <span id="s336">You remember I told you Fanny, who was extreme – I was the best in the class, but she was even better.</span> <span id="s337">It was Benjamin, when it comes to ______ everything.</span> <span id="s338">My father, who knew all this at the time, wanted to have a doctor in the family, not because of the title.</span> <span id="s339">He always said, “You know, it is the most wonderful thing you can do.</span> <span id="s340">Imagine you have a sick child.</span> <span id="s341">You make it well.</span> <span id="s342">Imagine your mother will be sick.</span> <span id="s343">You can help.</span> <span id="s344">There are no brothers who will go on.”</span> <span id="s345">And hoped – she was much older – that Fanny, you see, Berthe, the oldest, had left for Israel, that Fanny would take over.</span> <span id="s346">Yes, she went.</span> <span id="s347">She started and dissected the first cadaver in medicine, in anatomy.</span> <span id="s348">She came home and she said, “Dad, thank you.</span> <span id="s349">You can have it.”</span> <span id="s350">I never will become a physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: I don’t want to interrupt you, but we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Helene, when the last tape stopped, you were talking about how you became a doctor, and explaining that Fanny came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: That’s right, Fanny, who was my favorite sister, I hate to say it, but Berthe was a different function; she was like a mother to me.</span> <span id="s357">That Fanny, that my father wanted her to be a physician, she came back from anatomy.</span> <span id="s358">She was supposed to dissect.</span> <span id="s359">She saw the cadaver, comes home, and says to my father, “You can have it, not me.”</span> <span id="s360">And that was the end.</span> <span id="s361">She really started afterwards.</span> <span id="s362">She got a doctorate in chemistry and pharmacy, but not medicine.</span> <span id="s363">Then, by and by, when I heard it, that that was a dream of my father, I didn’t tell anybody yet, but by time developed for me, I wanted to be that physician, and so I started to – I really was very much, but it goes with medicine – very much interested in physics.</span> <span id="s364">I was the best _____ than anybody else, and I had a dream maybe I will be an engineer.</span> <span id="s365">I could build bridges and this, but that was unheard in Vienna.</span> <span id="s366">I would have never, never had chance.</span> <span id="s367">You can’t even dream, as a woman, to choose that field.</span> <span id="s368">I said to my father when I was much older, “I think I’m going to try about to be a physician.”</span> <span id="s369">Well, it didn’t bother me whatsoever.</span> <span id="s370">I dissected.</span> <span id="s371">I worked as hard.</span> <span id="s372">I loved it, actually.</span> <span id="s373">And that is the story.</span> <span id="s374">I always tell one story about one thing only that bothered me once.</span> <span id="s375">You know, in Europe, exams were very strict especially pre-medical subjects, anatomy and physiology and all of them.</span> <span id="s376">The people would get, I hope it won’t make you sick, cadavers who will pay for it, and you would dissect it.</span> <span id="s377">It would give you experience that what find this artery and it will give you experience.</span> <span id="s378">And here I was so young, and I’ll never forget, I had paid in and I couldn’t go down there to the anatomy in the daytime.</span> <span id="s379">I went down, and it was the evening.</span> <span id="s380">Until today, I haven’t forgotten!</span> <span id="s381">That’s why I’m bringing it up.</span> <span id="s382">They were all laying around dead, and covered, and all that you could see were just the feet.</span> <span id="s383">I know it’s probably foolish that I mention it, but it wasn’t foolish at that time for me.</span> <span id="s384">So, I started medicine and got finished.</span> <span id="s385">Here, too, is a very – I will bring that other story later because _____ I wasn’t a doctor yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s387">How come it was okay and for a woman to become a doctor, but not an engineer?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Not an engineer –it was the world of men.</span> <span id="s389">You could not get into the school.</span> <span id="s390">You could not enter.</span> <span id="s391">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: But medicine was more open at that time?</span> <span id="s393">Because that wasn’t true here.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yeah, medicine was open because I would say that it was a strange to them that women then ___ in the States.</span> <span id="s395">I would say 40 percent were women.</span> <span id="s396">They didn’t finish, many didn’t.</span> <span id="s397">They got married and that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: But you think 40 percent of your class were women.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Were women, yeah, 35-40 percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: And were there restrictions on how many Jews could come in, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: I tell you, yes and no.</span> <span id="s404">There are two divisions, actually.</span> <span id="s405">It was not spelled out, but it was for anatomy.</span> <span id="s406">You go to one lecture hall, and there are students in the class – there are hundreds.</span> <span id="s407">This is not yet, like, and the other, the gentiles – At that time, the anti-Semitism was tremendous.</span> <span id="s408">Not only this different social peer class.</span> <span id="s409">They hated us.</span> <span id="s410">They would invade our quarters.</span> <span id="s411">There was a law in Austria, a law, police wasn’t allowed to go in, but you have to settle it by yourself.</span> <span id="s412">You saw people jumping out that had nothing on, who tried to throw them out the window, and I had seen it.</span> <span id="s413">That was before Hitler already.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: So, what year would that have been 1930 or ’31?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: No, that was later in the earliest before the Nazi movement came, everything Hitler.</span> <span id="s416">Maybe ’33-’34.</span> <span id="s417">It developed around that time, but I couldn’t tell you exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: So, being in school was dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yes, that wasn’t every day, you understand.</span> <span id="s420">They were lecture halls were still in the same building.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: But you were separated in terms of -</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yeah, I could go over at one point to study, to see friends over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: But, your lectures were all together?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Well, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s425">We had very famous professors.</span> <span id="s426">The professors who taught us didn’t teach them.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Was that true as far as you know in the ’20s or only when the Nazi movement began in-</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: That was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: All the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: It was all the time, yeah.</span> <span id="s433">It was not so in the open.</span> <span id="s434">You went out of your way.</span> <span id="s435">It not only was ____ you go to school, you accept – you don’t accept and you do accept anti-Semitism, but you get use – you can’t be afraid all the time.</span> <span id="s436">And not only this, you had other movements.</span> <span id="s437">You felt so strongly to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s438">Actually, despite all of this, but you were proud of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s439">You can walk in the street as a maccabi.</span> <span id="s440">We would sing our songs.</span> <span id="s441">We were in the day it was a large group of ___.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: And, when you went to medical school, was it not only that the classes were segregated, but the friendships were segregated?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: To a certain extent, maybe I couldn’t tell you because I didn’t have any friends over there, but I almost more think the classes.</span> <span id="s444">Because in public school, the gymnasium, if you want me to talk then after this about the schools, but in gymnasium you were mixed – Jews and Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: But not-</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Not in the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: So, did you keep your childhood friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yeah, but I tell you, yes and no.</span> <span id="s449">Here, I have to come back to our schools.</span> <span id="s450">Our school system was very different than here.</span> <span id="s451">When you first grade schools, you’re about nine or ten years old.</span> <span id="s452">Your parents make the decision if you want to go to the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s453">Others ones went to boergerschule (ph) – that is public school – and gymnasium.</span> <span id="s454">Gymnasium – the difference is tremendous, like day and night.</span> <span id="s455">You really, I would say sometimes, to go to the gymnasium and graduate might have been just as hard like becoming a doctor.</span> <span id="s456">You have to study.</span> <span id="s457">You have to work so hard.</span> <span id="s458">In order to get there, you have to pass when you’re nine years old an exam, a state exam.</span> <span id="s459">You’re just a little girl, it’s like an IQ, and they test your knowledge.</span> <span id="s460">If you pass, you can go to the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s461">You see, it was decided already very young.</span> <span id="s462">My friends over here, most of them didn’t, they went to boergerschule and that was it.</span> <span id="s463">They were bright, and I had pals afterward _________ very much who went to the gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: So, you’re lives separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Separated, yes, Genny with her ten dollars.</span> <span id="s466">I said, “Let them ___”, that name, she went to boergerschule.</span> <span id="s467">The life – friendships you make maybe when you were little, a little older, they stay with you unless you became anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s468">Maybe she was a Nazi, I do not know.</span> <span id="s469">Even more so, I respect it that she still liked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: How would you describe yourself as a young person?</span> <span id="s471">Who were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Well, who was I?</span> <span id="s473">First of all shy, ____ shy, because I was overshadowed by, I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s474">I always wanted to be older than them, and I would show them.</span> <span id="s475">I was bright.</span> <span id="s476">I was outgoing.</span> <span id="s477">I had a tremendous desire to have friends, and if I remember, from there as a child to now, a friend means – you don’t have much or many, just one friend or two – that you can talk with a person who will understand you, you know?</span> <span id="s478">And, that meant to me, the world it meant to me, and it was a trait that showed in me as a little girl, and I wanted to achieve.</span> <span id="s479">Maybe very ambitious, maybe because I had that one sister, Fanny.</span> <span id="s480">It was not only – I was pretty, but she was not so pretty, but she had much more.</span> <span id="s481">She had charisma.</span> <span id="s482">Every boy, everybody who knew her later on, everybody wanted to marry her.</span> <span id="s483">You see, that was Fanny.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: What was the difference in age between you and Fanny?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Seven years.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Seven years?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: So-</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: So, if you are thirty (ph), but she’s a tremendous… Later on, there was no difference.</span> <span id="s490">You see, because it’s only six or seven… But later on there was no difference because when you get older, what difference does it make if you are a few years older or younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Was she with you a lot even when you were a kid?</span> <span id="s492">Did she take you places?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Oh, well, I’ll tell you that Berthe and Fanny, they took me places; I loved it.</span> <span id="s494">You see, Vienna, like I said, was full of music and balls and dancing.</span> <span id="s495">I was too young, in a way.</span> <span id="s496">But I cried about – they took me – sometimes if I went out to different function, they would loan me a dress from them.</span> <span id="s497">They took me.</span> <span id="s498">And, I remember these were balls; these were world-famous.</span> <span id="s499">You know the artists set it up.</span> <span id="s500">It took the whole opera, the whole building.</span> <span id="s501">They were working for it the whole year, to decorate it and you would dance, and the music, and with masks on.</span> <span id="s502">They took me, don’t you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: It seems to me that you had a wonderful childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yes, I had a wonderful childhood.</span> <span id="s505">There’s something else.</span> <span id="s506">When I came here, until today, people will say, whether they are older, or older already, “What do you miss the most?”</span> <span id="s507">You know what I would tell them?</span> <span id="s508">I mean, my friends, I miss the coffee shops and they would say, “What’s a matter with you?</span> <span id="s509">Go buy yourself a cup of coffee.”</span> <span id="s510">It’s not the same.</span> <span id="s511">You see, over there, the different coffee shops – everybody’s allowed to go in – the artists are interested to meet other artist, young or old, and talk.</span> <span id="s512">The medical student loves to go to meet other medical students.</span> <span id="s513">We worked so, so hard.</span> <span id="s514">I would be there in the coffee shop five or six in the morning.</span> <span id="s515">But that man and that child and the other one – everybody was there and studying.</span> <span id="s516">We had something in common – composer, all the different, then, but it’s not that there was a line.</span> <span id="s517">You could go in, but it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s518">You never were alone.</span> <span id="s519">There were always these people.</span> <span id="s520">Until today, I would say that I like a big city.</span> <span id="s521">I don’t have to talk to them, but if I walk in the street, there are so many different lives that go on, that you can see.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Do you remember the name of your favorite coffee shop that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Did you go to one particular – would the medical students show up at one particular one?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: So, you all knew?</span> <span id="s527">This was a real hang-out?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Hang-out you call it.</span> <span id="s529">That’s right, a hang-out.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: So, tell me something – you were so close to your sister Fanny.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: And she ends up going to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: It was hard.</span> <span id="s534">A year before Hitler came, and the reason was – I told you she had a doctorate in chemistry, and she was a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s535">The times were very hard.</span> <span id="s536">Her husband, she had just met, lost his job because he had to – the Christian socialites were very – it was a bank business.</span> <span id="s537">You couldn’t get in.</span> <span id="s538">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s539">Despite her education, so a year before Hitler came in, she went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: And, that must have been really hard for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Oh, for me.</span> <span id="s542">So, many years have passed, and I see still the train.</span> <span id="s543">She was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: And so, even though you were older, you see that point -</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Oh, yes, yes, I keep singing the same song all the time.</span> <span id="s546">There’s a German song, “The Clouds in the Skies”, and a little bird is flying, is flying away, and you sing to the bird.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Can you sing it in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: [Coughs] Oh, I don’t have really a voice.</span> <span id="s549">[Sings several verses in German.]</span> <span id="s550">What it really meant – and Fanny loved that song – it’s a bird, and the bird – somebody said to the bird “Sing for me.</span> <span id="s551">I will take gold and silver, and I will put it around you, and you can have all the goodness in the world.”</span> <span id="s552">And the bird sings to him, “Keep your silver, keep your gold, keep your food, keep everything.</span> <span id="s553">I am a little wild bird, and nobody can ___” and I somehow I associate it with Fanny.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: With Fanny?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: With Fanny, with the song.</span> <span id="s556">And you said what were your friends.</span> <span id="s557">I was maybe also eight or nine years old.</span> <span id="s558">We graduated from one class or _____ everybody – what do you call an album – maybe you do it here, too.</span> <span id="s559">You write the school, you right something, “Oh, you were elegant.”</span> <span id="s560">“I like you.”</span> <span id="s561">“You’re so smart.”</span> <span id="s562">The teacher wrote something, and somehow it really stays to me, and it says in German [Speaks phrases in German] “Don’t blame life and life ever sinking under the Nazis, that life is too hard that you cannot take it anymore, because if you have, if you live in the life of fairy tales, if you have the eyes of fairy tales, the world is still of beauty and miracles.”</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: And that’s something you carried with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: I carry that with me, yeah.</span> <span id="s565">I had a lot of, how should I say?</span> <span id="s566">You can see, I was alone _____.</span> <span id="s567">I had a little faith.</span> <span id="s568">I had faith, hope.</span> <span id="s569">I was desperate at times, but hopeful, yes.</span> <span id="s570">All these little things, you ask me how I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: And you must have been an optimistic person in some way all the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yes, even as dark as it was, I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Things changed in Vienna in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Years before Hitler becomes…</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: …when Adolphus becomes Chancellor.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Yes, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: How does that change for you?</span> <span id="s580">How do you remember the changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: That to a certain extent, actually, in the university, I felt that you were afraid to say – you were afraid to say certain things, and it changed for me.</span> <span id="s582">I became a Zionist.</span> <span id="s583">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s584">Not like my sister, Berthe.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: But more so?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Yeah, more so.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: More so than you were before.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Before, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: And, that’s in reaction…</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: To that, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Did you feel endangered?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I tell you, yes and no.</span> <span id="s593">Yes and no, really.</span> <span id="s594">When you are very young and you still strongly believed in something.</span> <span id="s595">I believed I wanted to reach; I wanted to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s596">I had a warm family, and I belonged to the blau weiss.</span> <span id="s597">They were all – I was a part of them.</span> <span id="s598">So, you do not feel it.</span> <span id="s599">My mother always said, “Hitler is over in Germany.”</span> <span id="s600">She kept talking about it and scaring us.</span> <span id="s601">It didn’t bother us so much.</span> <span id="s602">Somehow, when you’re young, you don’t dwell on it so much, and you still didn’t think they won’t be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Now, are you going out with Eddie at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Where should I go out?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: No, were you dating Eddie?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Where you boyfriend and girlfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s609">I started – he was already in medical school; he’d just started.</span> <span id="s610">And I started two years under him.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: So, you were at – you came into the school afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: It’s a true story.</span> <span id="s613">I started off medicine, and the kids – my sister’s friend was a little one (ph) – they said, “Do you have a boyfriend, somebody interested in you?”</span> <span id="s614">She just made fun out of me, and one day I came home and I said, “I think he’s the best looking of the students.</span> <span id="s615">I think he likes me.”</span> <span id="s616">And like, “Who is it, Leney?</span> <span id="s617">Who is it?”</span> <span id="s618">Let me tell you this, it wasn’t anatomy, I was dissecting the cadaver.</span> <span id="s619">Here comes Eddie.</span> <span id="s620">I did not know who he was, but I knew he was stunning looking at that time.</span> <span id="s621">He opens up a book, and starts reading it.</span> <span id="s622">He couldn’t read it exactly.</span> <span id="s623">It was Christian ____.</span> <span id="s624">It doesn’t have words, only symbols.</span> <span id="s625">___ they called it, but it was fascinating at that time.</span> <span id="s626">He reads this maybe ten, fifteen minutes.</span> <span id="s627">He looks at me, looks again to me, and says, “You’re not smart enough to hear this.”</span> <span id="s628">And walks away.</span> <span id="s629">So, my sister said, “Did he tell you that he likes you?”</span> <span id="s630">I said, “No, I just described it to you.”</span> <span id="s631">She said, “That’s the reason you think?”</span> <span id="s632">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s633">And that’s the way it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So, after this, how did you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: When we started, he was a friend of – a friend of his I was going out with.</span> <span id="s636">It was very superficial.</span> <span id="s637">I didn’t really care for too much, but he was studying medicine, and so he introduced me to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: And Eddie is this fantasy from your childhood, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: That is true, but I forgot it.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: You forgot?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I didn’t remember this person.</span> <span id="s642">If you are only eight or nine and suddenly you’re seventeen.</span> <span id="s643">I forgot that I ever met him there.</span> <span id="s644">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s645">He said to the one girl, I’m going to- that I said he was so good-looking.</span> <span id="s646">I wanted him.</span> <span id="s647">I will to marry him.</span> <span id="s648">Then years later passed, my friend said, “You got him.”</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: So, you didn’t make the connection at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: How interesting.</span> <span id="s652">So, you were not in the same classes together.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: No, no, but in medicine, you see, they are interwoven Sometimes you didn’t pass Histology.</span> <span id="s654">You have free choices: I want to take exam this, or take this exam, so, you meet again in certain lectures.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: And, did you study together?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: No, I had friends with whom I studied.</span> <span id="s657">I like to study a lot together with people.</span> <span id="s658">No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: So, what else is happening between ’33 – your parents are – your mother is clearly very worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: But, yes, I’ll tell you what happened.</span> <span id="s661">The Nazis marched in.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: But, that’s ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yes, ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: But between ’33 and ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: No, not too much.</span> <span id="s666">No, no, not too much.</span> <span id="s667">Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Now, I understand that –</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Life went on, and you knew that politics were about changing and the family – people coming to prison…</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: The constitution remained everyone is equal, but Adolphus was saying that this was a Christian state.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Yeah, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: And outlawed the left and right…</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: …except for his party.</span> <span id="s675">And that didn’t worry you?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No, because I didn’t belong to this.</span> <span id="s677">It worried me when afterward when we talk about Muriel because actually you were in danger if you were a friend of hers at that time.</span> <span id="s678">They were outlawed.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about Muriel, because Muriel shows up early in your career…</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Very, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: …and then she becomes a very dramatic part.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Let me tell you about.</span> <span id="s683">Muriel, it was like I said, I was very ambitious.</span> <span id="s684">It was during medical school.</span> <span id="s685">There was one professor at that time.</span> <span id="s686">He was famous.</span> <span id="s687">He taught pathology.</span> <span id="s688">He taught outside of Vienna, in Krems.</span> <span id="s689">And he started early.</span> <span id="s690">In order to get to him, you had to get up at five o’clock in the morning to take the streetcar an hour and then you were there.</span> <span id="s691">Because he was so alive, the things that he talked.</span> <span id="s692">I was afraid of pathology, but he made you not afraid.</span> <span id="s693">He showed you a lung – the way he described it that it has to be, or a heart, where the valves are going.</span> <span id="s694">He could do it in such a beautiful way, it stayed with you.</span> <span id="s695">You were not as scared of what you were seeing.</span> <span id="s696">The person is dead.</span> <span id="s697">That’s why he was so popular.</span> <span id="s698">He taught you in a way that it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s699">So, well, I’m going there for the day, I got up early because it was time to take the streetcar.</span> <span id="s700">In the streetcar – like I said, crowded very – in the streetcar there’s a young woman and she asked me where Krems is.</span> <span id="s701">I said, “Oh, I’m going there.</span> <span id="s702">Are you a medical student?”</span> <span id="s703">She said, “Yes” She said, “Yes, I want to hear Dr. Heurthiem (ph).”</span> <span id="s704">I said, “Follow me.”</span> <span id="s705">We get to Doctor Heurthiem.</span> <span id="s706">We sit there, like I have no idea.</span> <span id="s707">I knew she was an American.</span> <span id="s708">I recognized the accent, and after the lecture was over for the whole morning, several hours.</span> <span id="s709">She said, “It was wonderful, but I will not be able to come.</span> <span id="s710">I have a little girl that is ___.”</span> <span id="s711">She didn’t give me the name.</span> <span id="s712">“And I cannot leave so early.</span> <span id="s713">I cannot get help so early.</span> <span id="s714">You will have to-” You didn’t have to go to Heurtheim.</span> <span id="s715">So, I didn’t see her anymore, just once.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Just once?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Just once, and – no, that is not correct.</span> <span id="s718">I saw her.</span> <span id="s719">I didn’t travel with her.</span> <span id="s720">I stayed at her place.</span> <span id="s721">She always comes, came a little later, because I was waiting there an hour, and she came to the lecture.</span> <span id="s722">We had no time actually to talk.</span> <span id="s723">I was not ____ older, I didn’t have time.</span> <span id="s724">She was – very simply, there was no time, because she started right up when she came, then she left.</span> <span id="s725">She had a little child so she left.</span> <span id="s726">She must have passed.</span> <span id="s727">And now, a long time passed.</span> <span id="s728">I did not know who she was.</span> <span id="s729">I did not know her politically.</span> <span id="s730">I wasn’t sure was she Jewish or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s731">I knew nothing.</span> <span id="s732">Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Did you know her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yes, her name, I knew some I think, and I knew Muriel.</span> <span id="s735">Later I found out, all of a sudden, that she was one of the richest people in the United States.</span> <span id="s736">Her father was Armor – what’s the other meat packing company?</span> <span id="s737">The other large one?</span> <span id="s738">She grew up, she describes in the book, with 14 or 15 servants with which she grew up with as a child.</span> <span id="s739">But she hated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: She hated to be so rich.</span> <span id="s742">She was a socialist.</span> <span id="s743">She felt it was not just.</span> <span id="s744">One child has everything and the other one would be hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Did you know her name was Muriel Gardner?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: I didn’t know anything like that, just Muriel.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Just Muriel.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Like I said, we had nothing, we didn’t go out.</span> <span id="s749">I did not know it was coming.</span> <span id="s750">I did not think I would ever meet her again.</span> <span id="s751">She was somebody so much older.</span> <span id="s752">She had a group, she was in the anti-fascist.</span> <span id="s753">You see?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: We’re going to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: The Anschluss is in 1938, but Fanny has left the year before.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: A year before, yes.</span> <span id="s759">Anschluss was March 21st, ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: March 21st.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: I’m going to look it up.</span> <span id="s762">I’m almost for sure.</span> <span id="s763">Yes, Hitler marched into Austria March 21st.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: It’s about time.</span> <span id="s765">So, tell what it was like for you when the Nazis and Hitler marched in.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Well, like I told you before about Vienna, the city Vienna, that you did not worry, not too much.</span> <span id="s767">You – all that I had wanted to become a doctor, to help people, to raise a family.</span> <span id="s768">In front of me, there was, I say, a rainbow, and I wanted to reach that rainbow.</span> <span id="s769">I was almost – I almost had that rainbow.</span> <span id="s770">Just a few more months and I would be a physician, I would be a doctor.</span> <span id="s771">It is a feeling the world is yours, but I learned through experience, the world never is yours.</span> <span id="s772">Anyway, it was March 21st, ’38, Hitler marched in.</span> <span id="s773">It was like the clouds, like the whole world was falling on top of you.</span> <span id="s774">Within hours, you heard screaming in the street, marching and marching, swastika and swastika, Hiel Hitler, Hiel Hitler, even when the windows were closed, even when they had stopped marching or singing – you still had the feeling you hear it.</span> <span id="s775">Suddenly, you were afraid to go out into the street.</span> <span id="s776">You were afraid to stay home.</span> <span id="s777">You were afraid to go into your house, and not only this.</span> <span id="s778">I was alone.</span> <span id="s779">So, alone – my parents remember, I had told you, they had left.</span> <span id="s780">They were forced to leave in a way from my sisters, because the English and not only – I think I mentioned it – for only a short period, parents would be allowed to leave and go to Israel.</span> <span id="s781">There was a deadline.</span> <span id="s782">If they had missed the deadline, that would be the end.</span> <span id="s783">You could not go.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Was this before Hitler, before the Anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: No, the Anschluss, Hitler was already here.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: So, this is after the Anschluss that your parents-</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: That my parents had – everybody wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s788">If they did to America, Israel, be it wherever, the end of the world.</span> <span id="s789">Save your life, get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: So, it was so immediately violent and vicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Vicious, yes.</span> <span id="s792">This is unreal.</span> <span id="s793">In Germany, it took years until it developed.</span> <span id="s794">Even at that time still, you were allowed to take certain things with you when you immigrated.</span> <span id="s795">Overnight it practically came to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Was this very shocking to you?</span> <span id="s797">Or did it seem-</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: No, no, it was more than shocking.</span> <span id="s799">That is why I described to you before.</span> <span id="s800">You are happy.</span> <span id="s801">You have an almost – yes, it was – for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s802">And they came there slower in Germany.</span> <span id="s803">You didn’t expect in such a way.</span> <span id="s804">You didn’t expect – I described you nice people.</span> <span id="s805">There were people who were your friends.</span> <span id="s806">In a night, you lost them; they were not your friends anymore.</span> <span id="s807">I did not know.</span> <span id="s808">I did not know.</span> <span id="s809">I think maybe some would have still been your friends.</span> <span id="s810">They’d be afraid.</span> <span id="s811">People are afraid of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: So, do you think people were moving away from the Jews primarily, not for ideology, but because they were afraid-</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: No, no, they were Nazis.</span> <span id="s814">Don’t forget, because there’s Nazi movement was going in Austria and Vienna for years.</span> <span id="s815">It was suppressed.</span> <span id="s816">___ didn’t allow it to come out.</span> <span id="s817">Suddenly, the Anschluss, they all give in.</span> <span id="s818">There was no fighting.</span> <span id="s819">Suddenly, imagine you’re a little bird and suddenly the doors open, you can fly, and that’s why.</span> <span id="s820">Nobody was a nobody, and practically you didn’t go to school anything because _________ or could say, “Do this and this?”</span> <span id="s821">And, then it came suddenly.</span> <span id="s822">That was a tremendous – it was worse at the time in Austria than it was in Germany because they didn’t develop.</span> <span id="s823">I knew some people I met in Switzerland, they still got things out of there.</span> <span id="s824">I couldn’t get anything out.</span> <span id="s825">We were poor overnight, practically overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Did you lose your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: No, the apartment we didn’t lose.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: No, I didn’t, but there were periods I probably would have lose, but you had to give up.</span> <span id="s830">You had to give up everything you owned – your silver, your gold, your jewelry, even if it wasn’t much, you had to give it up.</span> <span id="s831">You had to go down there to give it up.</span> <span id="s832">Something else why you didn’t – you orders – your shops had to close.</span> <span id="s833">You couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s834">You did not know what to do.</span> <span id="s835">And, I had just a few months to finish my, to become a doctor.</span> <span id="s836">Within days, I got the letter, “Stop studying.</span> <span id="s837">Don’t come.</span> <span id="s838">It’s the end.”</span> <span id="s839">Do you realize what it means?</span> <span id="s840">No money, no job, no work, no work, afraid every day, afraid in your bed, afraid in your house, you wanted to go out, you were afraid, you still went out.</span> <span id="s841">When you went out, you were afraid to come back.</span> <span id="s842">I was fortunate, I never looked Jewish, the reddish hair and bluish eyes, but they could recognized because the Nazis all had a band around here.</span> <span id="s843">You see?</span> <span id="s844">And it said, “Heil Hitler” or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Did Jews have to wear a star?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yes, it was a star, and I had it on my passport.</span> <span id="s847">I’ll show it to you.</span> <span id="s848">I have my passport.</span> <span id="s849">A big “J”, and they gave you the name and the numbers.</span> <span id="s850">“Sara” were the women.</span> <span id="s851">The men were “Israel”.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: And this was very soon?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Very soon you understand, very quick, very quickly.</span> <span id="s854">All the Jews get out of here.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: That’s what they wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: And about how many months do you think were you still with your parents?</span> <span id="s858">How many after the Anschluss?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: No, really, because I told you there was a deadline.</span> <span id="s860">They had to leave.</span> <span id="s861">I was – maybe several months.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Several months?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Yes, they left.</span> <span id="s864">My father didn’t want to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: He didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: He was the type – he loved everybody.</span> <span id="s867">He said, “What do you mean?</span> <span id="s868">They won’t do anything to me?</span> <span id="s869">All my life, I was honest and good.</span> <span id="s870">I helped them.</span> <span id="s871">They’re my friends.</span> <span id="s872">Nobody would dare to touch me.”</span> <span id="s873">And you were even more afraid of him, he would go in the street, nothing.</span> <span id="s874">He had such a face.</span> <span id="s875">God will help him.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: And, how did he, if he did, how did he evaluate all this looting and this beating in the street and making Jews-</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yes, he left relative – he saw it, but left relatively early.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: And was it your mother whom made the final decision to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Both, it was the whole family.</span> <span id="s880">There was no choice.</span> <span id="s881">There was no choice.</span> <span id="s882">It would be the end.</span> <span id="s883">They didn’t have anybody in America, where should they go?</span> <span id="s884">They would drag him to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s885">He was an older man.</span> <span id="s886">He was not too well.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: And where is your brother at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: I was suddenly alone because the moment Hitler came in, at that moment, he tried to get away.</span> <span id="s889">People were running away to ___ illegally, no passport.</span> <span id="s890">They would hide in houses.</span> <span id="s891">You wouldn’t hear from him.</span> <span id="s892">Suddenly, you heard from him from Switzerland, and then once he went there he had no papers.</span> <span id="s893">The Swiss were not too friendly; the French were not too friendly.</span> <span id="s894">They wanted us out again.</span> <span id="s895">So, he ran from one place to another and hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Did you, I don’t know whether your brother thought about this, but there was illegal immigration at a certain point to Palestine.</span> <span id="s897">Did you ever think about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: No, when the parents – you couldn’t – my sister – it was almost impossible.</span> <span id="s899">No, it was illegal.</span> <span id="s900">At that time, you hadn’t heard of it.</span> <span id="s901">And the way he went to Swiss over mountains and hiding in the woods and this and that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: And you had no idea what was happening to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s904">You were so much concerned about yourself, I didn’t no.</span> <span id="s905">I didn’t even see them coming.</span> <span id="s906">From time to time, when there was a telephone, he would get in touch with me, and try to help wherever he could.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: So, within a few months, you’re alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: I am at home, but you do not realize, practically no money, what my parents gave me but it was not much.</span> <span id="s909">No money, no work, the friends I thought I had are not friends anymore.</span> <span id="s910">I was alone, alone, nobody, no profession.</span> <span id="s911">You see, no profession.</span> <span id="s912">I did not know that I had somebody in the United States, you understand?</span> <span id="s913">I was alone.</span> <span id="s914">And here I met – here comes a miracle, one of them that – in the start, you remember, I said there was faith and there was courage, hope and miracles.</span> <span id="s915">Suddenly I get a letter that will get – my husband, too – a very small amount of Jewish medical students who had stopped studying –just a form letter.</span> <span id="s916">“We give you two months’ time, and you can finish up your doctorate.”</span> <span id="s917">Why?</span> <span id="s918">Because the blue sky?</span> <span id="s919">We studied day and night.</span> <span id="s920">I passed it.</span> <span id="s921">And never, never since then was ever a Jew allowed to do that.</span> <span id="s922">I had cousins who were not included in this few in the States.</span> <span id="s923">Suddenly, the world opened up to a certain extent.</span> <span id="s924">I was somebody and hoped I’d go to the United States, maybe I’ll be able to work, maybe without a piece of paper, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Were all the Jewish students in the class – in your class – given this letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Just a certain amount who fell time-wise in that group.</span> <span id="s927">There were not too many, maybe you have to – maybe 30 or 40 students or so.</span> <span id="s928">You ask yourself why.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Maybe 30 or 40 students, maybe why?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: But you don’t know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I did not know.</span> <span id="s933">Maybe____.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: It’s interesting as to why they would do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: I have a cousin she’s brilliant.</span> <span id="s936">She’s still alive.</span> <span id="s937">She left medicine.</span> <span id="s938">She couldn’t finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: She couldn’t – they wouldn’t let her?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: She wasn’t in the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s942">So, you are now taking two months of to study like crazy to pass this exam.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: To do this, and I passed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: You passed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: I passed several exams.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Now, by this time you are involved with Eddie.</span> <span id="s947">Are you engaged?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: No, I was – yes, we can put engaged, but not married.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: So, when did you actually start going out with him in a serious way?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Oh, I was never serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: As soon as you saw him as an adult man.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Not so soon, but yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: So, when you say – it’s interesting because if you were dating Eddie, you say you’re alone.</span> <span id="s954">So, tell me that means.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: I’ll tell you what that means.</span> <span id="s956">I wasn’t married.</span> <span id="s957">He lived far away.</span> <span id="s958">He didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s959">I was here.</span> <span id="s960">I wasn’t sure that he would marry me.</span> <span id="s961">I was alone.</span> <span id="s962">He couldn’t give money because he didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s963">He didn’t have any soap!</span> <span id="s964">He just – I’m alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: So, how did you get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: I’ll tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s967">First of all, some people were nice.</span> <span id="s968">They would invite me.</span> <span id="s969">I was hungry a lot.</span> <span id="s970">Between several months.</span> <span id="s971">I started – these people I didn’t know – giving lessons to students, secretly.</span> <span id="s972">For instance, I mentioned Else Heise Hoidushke, she knew I had nothing.</span> <span id="s973">So, she said she knew something who wants to learn – she needed Latin.</span> <span id="s974">I didn’t know Latin.</span> <span id="s975">She said, “You will.</span> <span id="s976">Prepare yourself for the Latin.</span> <span id="s977">You’re smart.”</span> <span id="s978">I did every time I didn’t have so many, but once a week, I studied the night before for that week to get that to Latin.</span> <span id="s979">I was good in mathematics.</span> <span id="s980">You did it secretly.</span> <span id="s981">I give some lessons, physics.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: And she was a Jewish woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Yes, she was a Jewish woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: She was an older woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: She was an older woman, yeah.</span> <span id="s986">She had a Christian friend who helped her.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: So, there were-</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Yeah, look, it was like, scratch it.</span> <span id="s989">But I was still ______.</span> <span id="s990">People would even – would invite me to a meal.</span> <span id="s991">I had a little money that my parents gave me, but it was very little, coming to an end.</span> <span id="s992">You were afraid.</span> <span id="s993">I gave some lessons.</span> <span id="s994">I survived somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Did you feel sick, physically sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: You feel physically sick.</span> <span id="s997">You feel exhausted.</span> <span id="s998">You were tired.</span> <span id="s999">You’re desperate.</span> <span id="s1000">I was not depressed in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: You were not depressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: No, I was scared, terribly scared, but I don’t think I was.</span> <span id="s1003">I wouldn’t have been able to function.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: So, tell me what was in your head – what were you afraid of at that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: I was afraid every day that they would drag me to a concentration camp, they’d throw me in there.</span> <span id="s1006">I feared death.</span> <span id="s1007">They will hit me.</span> <span id="s1008">They will scrub the floors, do this – afraid.</span> <span id="s1009">He was afraid himself.</span> <span id="s1010">You said, “Was there Eddie there?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Eddie was afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Everybody was afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Everybody was afraid – we had only one desire, get out, find a rescue, somehow get out.</span> <span id="s1015">For instance, we decided before get out we should get married.</span> <span id="s1016">So, he was late to come to the wedding.</span> <span id="s1017">It wasn’t in a synagogue anymore.</span> <span id="s1018">We didn’t send out invitations.</span> <span id="s1019">I had no family anymore.</span> <span id="s1020">I was alone.</span> <span id="s1021">Forget flowers or a nice dress, we couldn’t send out – you were alone.</span> <span id="s1022">You and the rabbi and Eddie.</span> <span id="s1023">He was late.</span> <span id="s1024">I was afraid they got him.</span> <span id="s1025">You see?</span> <span id="s1026">Finally, he appears, and I remember so vividly the rabbi said, “Take the glass and put the glass,” and steps on it.”</span> <span id="s1027">And, he said, “I pronounce you man and wife.”</span> <span id="s1028">And it was the most beautiful moment, I did not hear them shouting “Heil Hitler”.</span> <span id="s1029">I did not hear the marching.</span> <span id="s1030">It was mine and I was his, and that was – and you will see later on in the stories that are coming that we were terribly hitched, that we did not want to leave each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: And when you got married, you then went back to his mother’s apartment and had a little dinner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Yes, she made a little dinner.</span> <span id="s1033">She had nothing for us, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: When, you would walk, would you choose a particular time to go out on the street – or you didn’t know?</span> <span id="s1035">There was no way of knowing?</span> <span id="s1036">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: No, you did not know.</span> <span id="s1038">You did not, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Did you wear the Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: What did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Did you wear the Jewish star or did you try to pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: I tried to pass, yeah, but I didn’t wear the swastika.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Did most people who were not Jewish wear some insignia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Yes, so they were safe, you see, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Did you ever see people being beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1047">That’s right They’ll grab you if you’re washing floors – oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1048">Screaming, and they’d put us all in buses be carried away.</span> <span id="s1049">You never knew what was going to happen to all the different people.</span> <span id="s1050">He lost his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: He lost his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: How do you account for the fact that that didn’t depress you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Let me tell you something, I am a physician, and when I talk depression, you know, it’s different.</span> <span id="s1055">You can be depressed with all these things.</span> <span id="s1056">I was desperate, but depressed – If I would have been really depressed, I would have opened the window and jumped out.</span> <span id="s1057">Do you get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: But how do you account?</span> <span id="s1060">I told you how I accounted.</span> <span id="s1061">It was faith – faith, hope – look at the notes and what did I tell you – faith, hope, and tremendous courage.</span> <span id="s1062">And then, how about circumstances?</span> <span id="s1063">You will hear stories of Muriel, the story of the consul, I told you, circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Okay, then let me ask you another way because now I understand why the word depression is not the right word.</span> <span id="s1065">How did you not become cynical?</span> <span id="s1066">You’re seeing things that are so inhuman to your experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: There’s no time to become cynical.</span> <span id="s1068">You’re always only “I want to get out.</span> <span id="s1069">I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s1070">I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s1071">I’m afraid.”</span> <span id="s1072">That’s all, you keep going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Did you know people who committed suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: Not many, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Not many.</span> <span id="s1076">But you heard about it?</span> <span id="s1077">because there were a lot of suicides.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: I was – you didn’t hear much, but I’m sure…especially I didn’t go so far.</span> <span id="s1079">Probably people who are almost in concentration camps, haven’t been there yet, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Do you – silly, I was going to say, “Do you think if you thought you were going to be sent to a concentration camp, that you might have committed suicide?”</span> <span id="s1081">Or is your spirit-</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: No, you don’t think so far.</span> <span id="s1083">I was just thinking of surviving every day.</span> <span id="s1084">Every day you think all the time in your mind, “Where can I find the person who can” a piece of paper, I needed an affidavit for the United States in order to get out.</span> <span id="s1085">People, not only United, but to go any place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: You and Eddie get married in December of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Now, we’re going from March until December.</span> <span id="s1089">That’s a lot of months.</span> <span id="s1090">So, all this time, you are trying to get out, with or without Eddie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: But, once you’re married, you won’t leave without him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Yeah, it is not the same.</span> <span id="s1094">You will see this story.</span> <span id="s1095">You felt different, like, you can see it in ___, different.</span> <span id="s1096">Yes, I have to bring in some stories.</span> <span id="s1097">Muriel, you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Yes, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Muriel, same as my cousin, and then you will understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: All right let’s talk – your cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: The main thing is to find someone to get out, and I didn’t know, I had a cousin.</span> <span id="s1102">It was a second cousin.</span> <span id="s1103">Somebody mentioned him to me there was a second cousin.</span> <span id="s1104">I never heard of me.</span> <span id="s1105">He hasn’t heard of me.</span> <span id="s1106">It was very hard when I tried to get in touch with him, very hard to get through to the United States.</span> <span id="s1107">I found his address.</span> <span id="s1108">I found his name.</span> <span id="s1109">People said, “Don’t be foolish.</span> <span id="s1110">He won’t send you anything.”</span> <span id="s1111">I wrote him a letter.</span> <span id="s1112">I described to him the situation.</span> <span id="s1113">I described Eddie, who my fiancé, who is, a long letter, as a medical student and so on.</span> <span id="s1114">I was walking very close to the university where I wasn’t allowed to work, but I was walking.</span> <span id="s1115">And I was walking from the Rathaus, the city hall, a gorgeous building in this, all insults.</span> <span id="s1116">Suddenly, somebody put their arm around me, which is strange.</span> <span id="s1117">Christians are afraid to touch you, you understand?</span> <span id="s1118">It’s a Jew.</span> <span id="s1119">I turn around.</span> <span id="s1120">Who was it?</span> <span id="s1121">Muriel.</span> <span id="s1122">And she said, “Leney, I’m glad I saw you.”</span> <span id="s1123">I hadn’t seen her in maybe a year or longer.</span> <span id="s1124">I do not know.</span> <span id="s1125">And, like again, I had no idea who she was, that she was rich or people she ________ nothing.</span> <span id="s1126">“How are you?”</span> <span id="s1127">And I said to her, “Don’t you know the situation?</span> <span id="s1128">I’m desperate.”</span> <span id="s1129">And started to cry.</span> <span id="s1130">And she said, “Yes, I understand it.</span> <span id="s1131">I’m going to leave here.</span> <span id="s1132">I’m going to France because I cannot stand it here either myself.”</span> <span id="s1133">Even though she was not Jewish, and then she said to me, “Leney, I have sent out so many affidavits.”</span> <span id="s1134">You know what an affidavit is.</span> <span id="s1135">“To so many people.</span> <span id="s1136">I don’t think they would accept anything from me anymore, but if I can help you anyway, tell me.”</span> <span id="s1137">Here, again, I had no idea that she was one of the richest people in the country, and I think for a moment and I said, “You know, Muriel, maybe you can help me.”</span> <span id="s1138">She said, “What is it Leney?”</span> <span id="s1139">I said, “I wrote a letter to my cousin, Sam Menczel, in German.</span> <span id="s1140">My English is no good.</span> <span id="s1141">Could you translate it?”</span> <span id="s1142">“Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1143">Come up to my apartment.”</span> <span id="s1144">Next day I come up to Muriel.</span> <span id="s1145">I realize suddenly that she must be very wealthy – not that arrogant or anything, just the neighborhood, where it was.</span> <span id="s1146">Went up to her apartment, and met here that little girl, that Connie, and she sits down and took the long – it was a very long letter writing to Sam Menczel.</span> <span id="s1147">She was – after she was done, she leads to her door and she looks at me.</span> <span id="s1148">She had tears in her eyes, and she says – mind you, she practically did not know me only from that lecture to that time – tears in her eyes, and she says, “Leney, if there’s anything I can help you, please get – I’m leaving for a few days.</span> <span id="s1149">I give you my address.</span> <span id="s1150">It’s American Express in Paris.</span> <span id="s1151">Wherever I go, they will send the mail to me.”</span> <span id="s1152">And, she – I remember that.</span> <span id="s1153">“And I will travel back again.</span> <span id="s1154">I can’t send affidavit, nothing.”</span> <span id="s1155">I sent the letter on – her letter that she translated on to my cousin in New York.</span> <span id="s1156">Weeks passed, I didn’t hear.</span> <span id="s1157">Suddenly, I got a letter.</span> <span id="s1158">I have that letter after so many years.</span> <span id="s1159">I get a letter from him.</span> <span id="s1160">“Dear Leney”, he said, “I read your story.</span> <span id="s1161">I was so touched, what you made from your life.</span> <span id="s1162">I’m going to – I want to help you.</span> <span id="s1163">I’m going to send you an affidavit, and I will – I will be good to you.</span> <span id="s1164">My wife, Rosie, and the children will love you, and forget your boyfriend or fiancé.</span> <span id="s1165">I cannot.</span> <span id="s1166">I’m not rich enough.</span> <span id="s1167">I can’t send him some papers, but looking at your picture and that you are a doctor or become a doctor, you won’t have a hard time, you will find somebody else who will love you.”</span> <span id="s1168">I was so happy with the letter, yes and no because Eddie – at the moment – I mean, from Heaven, such a letter.</span> <span id="s1169">I carry that letter wherever I go, but one thing was clear to me.</span> <span id="s1170">I will not leave without him, without Eddie.</span> <span id="s1171">I’d rather die.</span> <span id="s1172">I don’t care at all.</span> <span id="s1173">So, I got this letter and a few weeks again pass, trying to make some connection for him.</span> <span id="s1174">Impossible, I didn’t find anybody.</span> <span id="s1175">Suddenly, I get a call, who was it?</span> <span id="s1176">Muriel.</span> <span id="s1177">Who was it?</span> <span id="s1178">Muriel.</span> <span id="s1179">And again, I knew really nothing except for that one lecture that I saved her a seat.</span> <span id="s1180">Muriel, she said to me, “Leney, did you hear from your cousin?”</span> <span id="s1181">“Yes.</span> <span id="s1182">But he’s not going to send anything to Eddie, and I’m not leaving without him.”</span> <span id="s1183">She thinks a minute, and she says, “Leney, don’t despair.”</span> <span id="s1184">I was a stranger to her.</span> <span id="s1185">“Don’t despair Even if I sent so many affidavits – wait, wait, help will come.”</span> <span id="s1186">A few days passed, Muriel called again.</span> <span id="s1187">“Leney, Eddie has affidavit.</span> <span id="s1188">I didn’t have to send anything.</span> <span id="s1189">I called up.</span> <span id="s1190">I talked with the ambassador, and an affidavit is there.”</span> <span id="s1191">So, you can imagine.</span> <span id="s1192">The world was ours.</span> <span id="s1193">The world was ours.</span> <span id="s1194">I mean, was it really true that just a few weeks there was nothing?</span> <span id="s1195">And I now had to wait for a certain number.</span> <span id="s1196">Even with the affidavit, you cannot go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1197">Your number has to come up.</span> <span id="s1198">It was a quota.</span> <span id="s1199">There was a quote – from the number way back.</span> <span id="s1200">They were not ready for us yet.</span> <span id="s1201">We had to wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: We’re going to have to wait to because we’re going to have to change the tape.</span> <span id="s1203">So, we will start with this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">End of Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: You know, we forgot to talk about something.</span> <span id="s1207">So, let me go back in time just a little bit.</span> <span id="s1208">You were in Vienna during the Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Yes, I was in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: And we didn’t say it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: I didn’t stay in at home at all.</span> <span id="s1212">I was by coincidence with friends, all the _____, and now I walk and we heard it.</span> <span id="s1213">I did not realize that ____ grabbing and grabbing whatever they can.</span> <span id="s1214">All they synagogues were burning.</span> <span id="s1215">It was a sight in the scared where you couldn’t… I did not know I was alone.</span> <span id="s1216">Should I go back?</span> <span id="s1217">I stayed with them overnight, then I went back, I do not know.</span> <span id="s1218">Do I still have a place to go or…?</span> <span id="s1219">But it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1220">It became the very fast the Kristallnacht, like a flash, and then it was gone.</span> <span id="s1221">Well, it was never gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: So, did that make you even more frightened than you were before or was this a continuation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1224">Even more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Even more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: You saw the concentration, in the form, you see, it was concentrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: All right, when we ended the last tape, you were talking about the fact that your numbers were coming up, but I want you to explain because many people don’t know what an affidavit is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: An affidavit is this.</span> <span id="s1229">You must have somebody in the United States who is willing to send you papers for you to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1230">They are believed to be write out, but you have to show proof of support, that you have the means, that I will not be a burden to the States until I’m a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: No, no, it’s fine.</span> <span id="s1232">Let me ask you again.</span> <span id="s1233">Explain what an affidavit is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: An affidavit is you have to find someone – it does not have to be a relative – who’s willing to send you papers to go to the United States, and the papers has to show what he owns, income tax and so on – that he’s really, if it comes to it, that he’s able to support me, and that I will never be a burden to the United States as long as I’m not a citizen anymore, because if I’m a citizen, it is expected that I support myself if I’m able.</span> <span id="s1235">So, Muriel sent me that affidavit, but – not Muriel, Sam Menczel; Muriel sent it for Eddie – but you had to wait for a quota number.</span> <span id="s1236">There’s only – somebody might send somebody a hundred affidavits and only a certain number are allowed to enter every year to the United States, and there it was important from which country you came from.</span> <span id="s1237">For instance, if you came from Scandinavia, it was very easy to enter.</span> <span id="s1238">They will give you numbers because Scandinavian people had no interest to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1239">So, we had to wait for our numbers.</span> <span id="s1240">And so, it was very hard until you get to it.</span> <span id="s1241">I got right off.</span> <span id="s1242">I got the numbers, but the Germans had to give me all the permission to get that number that I’m clear.</span> <span id="s1243">I have all the – did I tell you the story how I worked as a maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: I did not tell you.</span> <span id="s1246">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Is that before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Before that, yeah.</span> <span id="s1249">It was the largest library in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1250">It was like a beautiful home and beautiful furniture.</span> <span id="s1251">They did not want to give me that number yet, so one man who had looked over the income tax, “I have a mother.</span> <span id="s1252">She’s old.</span> <span id="s1253">She’s sick.</span> <span id="s1254">If you find me, if you arrive, you will work for me as a maid, when she’s all done, maybe I will let you go and your family.”</span> <span id="s1255">So, I took the job and it was a nightmare.</span> <span id="s1256">She was so mean to me.</span> <span id="s1257">I worked day and night.</span> <span id="s1258">She was very sick and didn’t give me practically anything to eat, but God help me she died after three months.</span> <span id="s1259">So, that was fine.</span> <span id="s1260">He went into Eddie’s apartment, took out the nicest furniture he wanted to, and said, “Now you have the numbers, too.”</span> <span id="s1261">And, he also – Eddie, not me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Who was this man?</span> <span id="s1263">Was it a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: A German man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: A Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: A Nazi, sure.</span> <span id="s1267">They were all Nazis.</span> <span id="s1268">They were all Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: So, Eddie had a number, his family had no affidavit, however.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: No, his family – his mother perished, and Eddie had an affidavit for Muriel.</span> <span id="s1271">I told you already the story how she called and she said, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: So, how is it when you got the affidavit from my cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: My cousin Sam Menczel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: And that’s the only affidavit that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Yeah, I didn’t need anymore</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Right, you just needed the one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: You just need one affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: And, was your number a lower number than Eddie’s number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: I’ll tell you – here, I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s1280">I was about the same, two three or four or five, close, but his number came up and he was in Vienna still.</span> <span id="s1281">I was at that time already in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1282">I’d got a temporary – you wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s1283">You had to get out.</span> <span id="s1284">I got a temporary visa from the Swiss, and Muriel helped me do it.</span> <span id="s1285">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s1286">He didn’t have it, but then his number came up.</span> <span id="s1287">He got a letter from the American consul.</span> <span id="s1288">He went right up and he got his visa.</span> <span id="s1289">Do you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: Here I was in Switzerland, my number came up.</span> <span id="s1292">The American Consul in Switzerland, which was the American, was very mean.</span> <span id="s1293">He would say, “If you want your number, go back to Vienna, go back to Austria – which was Germany – and get your number there.”</span> <span id="s1294">I could not go back.</span> <span id="s1295">I had signed that I would never go back.</span> <span id="s1296">That means if I go back they’ll send me to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1297">He didn’t even want to listen.</span> <span id="s1298">In the end, people did not even try to ask me, “Please help us.</span> <span id="s1299">Give us it.”</span> <span id="s1300">Because everything was here.</span> <span id="s1301">But he just didn’t want to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Can I just ask you a question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: Because it had to be clear before the things are interwoven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Why did you go to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: I’ll tell you why I went to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1306">You did not know from one day to another that if you will be alive, do you understand?</span> <span id="s1307">Whoever would help you?</span> <span id="s1308">It was – why did my brother?</span> <span id="s1309">He did not even have a temporary visa.</span> <span id="s1310">It was like sent from Heaven.</span> <span id="s1311">I was safe for several months.</span> <span id="s1312">She must have – she gave me money, Muriel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: And did you see Muriel when you were in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1315">She - from time to time, she would send me the tickets to go to the United States indirectly, but she wired “The tickets are coming”, but it makes it also very hard.</span> <span id="s1316">Do you know what the Joint was?</span> <span id="s1317">The Joint helps people refugees that were there with money to get settled.</span> <span id="s1318">I did not know it in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1319">The Joint didn’t help me because Muriel said, “I didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s1320">I will help them as much as I could.”</span> <span id="s1321">And she did.</span> <span id="s1322">I gave her everything, every penny back in the years to come, but Muriel was always in the background, and when it was needed that people would support you, she would help me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: And did she not want you to be in touch with the Joint?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: No, she didn’t want – she wanted to help to support us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: So, when you-</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: She helped us to go to Switzerland, me.</span> <span id="s1327">Eddie could not go out here.</span> <span id="s1328">It did not have the papers from the Germans until I was married him, remember what I told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: So, you go the papers first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1331">I got the papers first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: And you were willing at that point to separate from Eddie because you thought he was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Oh, yes, and it was not only I, everybody.</span> <span id="s1334">Because every day you would said, “How did you feel to go out in the street?”</span> <span id="s1335">Everyday you were scared.</span> <span id="s1336">I wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s1337">I was alone.</span> <span id="s1338">I had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Did you assume that Eddie would come to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: I hoped so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: So, when you got to Switzerland, you were even more alone because you don’t know Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Where did you go, Zurich or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: What did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Where were you in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: I tell you, I was in different places.</span> <span id="s1347">I was because wherever they would let you in.</span> <span id="s1348">I was in Davos, Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1349">I stayed two days in Zurich.</span> <span id="s1350">I started to hide.</span> <span id="s1351">Then I was in Geneva, I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s1352">The visa came to an end soon, my Swiss visa.</span> <span id="s1353">I promised I would be out of Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1354">Here I was caught.</span> <span id="s1355">I couldn’t go back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1356">The Swiss didn’t let me there because they prolonged it once, and that was the end.</span> <span id="s1357">I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1358">I tried – I started to hide.</span> <span id="s1359">My brother was either in Reins or someplace called me and said, “You have to get out.</span> <span id="s1360">They won’t let you.”</span> <span id="s1361">But I did not know what, so he said, “Look, I will tell you all this on the phone, let me tell you what to do.”</span> <span id="s1362">He said, “Take your belongings.”</span> <span id="s1363">I didn’t have much, “Go to Geneva.</span> <span id="s1364">There is a League of Nations in Geneva.</span> <span id="s1365">There is a very prominent lawyer.</span> <span id="s1366">You go down there.</span> <span id="s1367">He might not want to do a thing for you, but he has it in his power.</span> <span id="s1368">If he wants to, he will help you.”</span> <span id="s1369">I took like my last money.</span> <span id="s1370">I went to Geneva.</span> <span id="s1371">Don’t ask me, I don’t know why I’m there.</span> <span id="s1372">I do not know.</span> <span id="s1373">I come to Geneva.</span> <span id="s1374">I find the telephone number where the prominent lawyer is, had a hard time to get in.</span> <span id="s1375">He didn’t want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s1376">How I did it, I do not know.</span> <span id="s1377">I reached him.</span> <span id="s1378">I talked to him.</span> <span id="s1379">He was very touched.</span> <span id="s1380">I don’t know – people were somehow taken by me.</span> <span id="s1381">It’s just – So, he said, “I will help you.”</span> <span id="s1382">Yeah, my brother said to me, “Look if nobody helps you there, the League of Nations, you have to go illegally.</span> <span id="s1383">You have to go over the border.</span> <span id="s1384">It could take you days until you get there.</span> <span id="s1385">There mountains, mountain passes.</span> <span id="s1386">There are woods.</span> <span id="s1387">You will have to hike.</span> <span id="s1388">If the Swiss find you, there’s no end to it.</span> <span id="s1389">They will send you right back.”</span> <span id="s1390">The idea that I should be as thin as I was and there was nothing but me, all by myself, scared stiff.</span> <span id="s1391">Well, I talked to that lawyer.</span> <span id="s1392">He called up a very prominent, very high official at the League of Nations.</span> <span id="s1393">I understood French some.</span> <span id="s1394">I did not understand quite enough to understand while he was talking, and he said, “You have to help her.</span> <span id="s1395">You have to see her.</span> <span id="s1396">Do what you want, but you have to talk to her.”</span> <span id="s1397">She didn’t want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s1398">He was pleading with her.</span> <span id="s1399">She agreed.</span> <span id="s1400">I think they were probably very close with each other.</span> <span id="s1401">I go over to the League of Nations.</span> <span id="s1402">I have no idea anymore did I walk, I had no money for that.</span> <span id="s1403">I got there.</span> <span id="s1404">I meet her, fantastic building, very elegant woman.</span> <span id="s1405">She was awfully nice to me.</span> <span id="s1406">She took a look at me, and she said to me, “Don’t talk at all.</span> <span id="s1407">Did you eat yet?”</span> <span id="s1408">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1409">She rings a little bell.</span> <span id="s1410">They bring in a fabulous breakfast with orange juice and all this.</span> <span id="s1411">I thought it was not here, it was heaven.</span> <span id="s1412">She said, “Yes, I will help you.</span> <span id="s1413">I will give you a temporary visa you will get to go to France.”</span> <span id="s1414">And she said she will give me to a _____ so I was relatively safe for a short period.</span> <span id="s1415">In the meantime, the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1416">Poland and Germany, the borders were closed, and I did not need to go out right now, but Eddie called me.</span> <span id="s1417">He said, “Leney, I received my – I have my visa.</span> <span id="s1418">I have the number.”</span> <span id="s1419">I told you that before.</span> <span id="s1420">“I have everything.</span> <span id="s1421">What will you do now?</span> <span id="s1422">Your number is up.</span> <span id="s1423">If you don’t come to Vienna in two, three days, your number will be given to somebody else.”</span> <span id="s1424">So, you realize the tremendous problem, not going back to Vienna meant I would never be with Eddie again, because he’s going to the United States and I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1425">I didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s1426">Going to Vienna was a tremendous danger, almost 100 percent.</span> <span id="s1427">They would send me right off into concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1428">“You have signed it.</span> <span id="s1429">You have signed it.”</span> <span id="s1430">I talk my friends, she wouldn’t want to hide me in order to force me not to go back.</span> <span id="s1431">I said, “I have nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s1432">I will try to go back.”</span> <span id="s1433">And here comes the story about going back.</span> <span id="s1434">As far as I knew, I will not be able to make it because the Germans will send me right off into the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1435">Now, I needed in order to go back, I needed a visa, a German visa, to enter Vienna from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1436">Well, I think, “Let me try.”</span> <span id="s1437">I get my stuff together, go to Zurich, and I go to the consulate – a tremendous, big building, a lot of people are waiting there in front to get in, maybe a hundred or more, but this – none of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1438">These were all gentile people who had business, who wanted to go back, everybody needed a visa.</span> <span id="s1439">They were standing.</span> <span id="s1440">It was not open yet.</span> <span id="s1441">They were standing in line for quite a while.</span> <span id="s1442">Suddenly a Gestapo man, an SS man, comes out, but he says first, “Heil Hitler, heil Hitler.”</span> <span id="s1443">Everybody in the group, “Heil Hitler, heil Hitler” and he says, “I have to give you a message.”</span> <span id="s1444">He says, “You all can go home.</span> <span id="s1445">Yesterday they tried to assassinate Hitler.”</span> <span id="s1446">And he called him the Furor.</span> <span id="s1447">If you said the Furor, this is the highest word instead of Hitler.</span> <span id="s1448">“The Furor has given orders nobody’s allowed to enter the border anymore.</span> <span id="s1449">To go out, not ‘til you hear from me at a later date, I do not know when.</span> <span id="s1450">The people all went home.</span> <span id="s1451">Within seconds that tremendous place was empty.</span> <span id="s1452">The only person who was standing there was myself, and two of the Nazis, the higher officials, Gestapos.</span> <span id="s1453">“What do you want?”</span> <span id="s1454">You get like so rigid.</span> <span id="s1455">You do not know what to do, what is happening.</span> <span id="s1456">You act, or you don’t act.</span> <span id="s1457">So, what should I do?</span> <span id="s1458">No gentile, no Christian, nobody can get in.</span> <span id="s1459">I’m frightened to death, but I had only one desire.</span> <span id="s1460">I want to be with Eddie.</span> <span id="s1461">If I can’t be with Eddie, I might as well die.</span> <span id="s1462">And I thought and I thought.</span> <span id="s1463">I had to get in.</span> <span id="s1464">I started march to the door.</span> <span id="s1465">Nobody’s marching with me anymore.</span> <span id="s1466">Everybody left.</span> <span id="s1467">And I see the big door and SS men, Gestapo, all these women screaming “Heil Hitler, heil Hitler.”</span> <span id="s1468">Standing straight.</span> <span id="s1469">I went up to the door that I did almost consciously, I shouldn’t be scared.</span> <span id="s1470">I should walk straight like I would look like I know where I was going to.</span> <span id="s1471">I had no idea where the consul was.</span> <span id="s1472">I had no idea how he looked, nothing.</span> <span id="s1473">And, I was sure that they’d send me back at the door, nobody can get in.</span> <span id="s1474">I mean, I’m on German territory.</span> <span id="s1475">I walk straight to the door, grab the door, and open it.</span> <span id="s1476">I did it so fast that it didn’t occur.</span> <span id="s1477">It probably looked like I am one from them.</span> <span id="s1478">I was just “In I am.</span> <span id="s1479">In I am.”</span> <span id="s1480">Tremendous building, no idea should I go right?</span> <span id="s1481">Should I go left?</span> <span id="s1482">Should I go straight?</span> <span id="s1483">Let’s see, which one could it be?</span> <span id="s1484">I do not know.</span> <span id="s1485">I go straight and I start walking – walk, walk, walk – suddenly I come to a big door, and I thought to myself, “It looks very impressive to enter.</span> <span id="s1486">If I get inside, “Gestapo,” I said in my mind, “might be in.”</span> <span id="s1487">I don’t ask anybody.</span> <span id="s1488">I didn’t talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s1489">I go to the door and open it, and I’m inside.</span> <span id="s1490">In front of me a big beautiful desk and a man sitting there, I am God Almighty.</span> <span id="s1491">I assume right off this is the consul.</span> <span id="s1492">Next to him, Gestapo, and guns, and you name it.</span> <span id="s1493">And he looked at me, didn’t address me, either.</span> <span id="s1494">Who was I?</span> <span id="s1495">You needed permission.</span> <span id="s1496">You need an invitation.</span> <span id="s1497">You just didn’t walk in that way.</span> <span id="s1498">And he said to me, “Well, what would you like?</span> <span id="s1499">Who are you?”</span> <span id="s1500">And I start talking quickly, I said, “I have to have – I have to go back.</span> <span id="s1501">I have to get an American visa in order to go”, and I stop talking.</span> <span id="s1502">He starts screaming, “You’re Jewish!</span> <span id="s1503">You’re Jewish!”</span> <span id="s1504">“Yes, I am Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1505">“You dare.</span> <span id="s1506">You dare to come here.</span> <span id="s1507">How did you get in?”</span> <span id="s1508">I started to say something.</span> <span id="s1509">“Get out of here right away.”</span> <span id="s1510">And I tell him what I want.</span> <span id="s1511">He said, “No Christian, no Jew, nobody is allowed to get in.”</span> <span id="s1512">And he said, “Go!”</span> <span id="s1513">And I looked at him, and he’s furious at all the people who work there.</span> <span id="s1514">I said, “I’m not going.”</span> <span id="s1515">He said, “You’re not?</span> <span id="s1516">We are in Germany,” he said, “You will go to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1517">You will – looking at you, how you look, you won’t survive it.</span> <span id="s1518">You won’t survive it.”</span> <span id="s1519">He said to me, “Go!”</span> <span id="s1520">Then, something in his voice got soft, and he said to me, “Go, go, please go.</span> <span id="s1521">Nothing will happen to you here.</span> <span id="s1522">I will see that you get out, get you again on Swiss territory, but please go.”</span> <span id="s1523">He looked at me.</span> <span id="s1524">“I’m not going.”</span> <span id="s1525">He repeated this two or three times.</span> <span id="s1526">Then, so far, he says, “I wouldn’t want anything should happen to you.</span> <span id="s1527">Go!”</span> <span id="s1528">And I said, “I won’t go because if I go, I will never see my fiancé, and that’s the end.”</span> <span id="s1529">And he said, “I cannot give it to you.”</span> <span id="s1530">And, he started again, “Go,” and then he shows to the men, he said, “Take her and lead her out.”</span> <span id="s1531">I said, “I’m not going to walk.”</span> <span id="s1532">He looked at me with a pierced look.</span> <span id="s1533">His eyes were lethal, but he said, “Lift her up.”</span> <span id="s1534">There was not much to lift.</span> <span id="s1535">“Lift her up and carrying her out, and out the door.”</span> <span id="s1536">Two men, one on the right, the other on the left hand – they carried me to the door.</span> <span id="s1537">He carried me to the door, and a little out already.</span> <span id="s1538">Suddenly, you hear a voice, “Stop!</span> <span id="s1539">Put her down.</span> <span id="s1540">Come here!”</span> <span id="s1541">he calls me.</span> <span id="s1542">I go in.</span> <span id="s1543">He tells all the Gestapo, “Everybody go out!”</span> <span id="s1544">He was only with me alone.</span> <span id="s1545">And he said, “You know, I really would like you to go.”</span> <span id="s1546">Nicely, in nice way.</span> <span id="s1547">“I would not want anything should happen.”</span> <span id="s1548">And I said, “I can’t go.”</span> <span id="s1549">And he said, “You seem like _____ nothing anymore.”</span> <span id="s1550">And he said, “Talk to me.”</span> <span id="s1551">I talked.</span> <span id="s1552">He said – he takes a pen, and he says, “Give me your passport.”</span> <span id="s1553">And he said, “I do not know why I’m doing this.”</span> <span id="s1554">He said, “Do you realize I can lose my position?</span> <span id="s1555">And, I can lose more than that.”</span> <span id="s1556">He means that if he did it, something could happen to him.</span> <span id="s1557">“This is against the wish of the Furor, of Hitler.”</span> <span id="s1558">He takes the passport – I had the passport there – he takes it, writes in his name, and here’s a number.</span> <span id="s1559">I have a visa.</span> <span id="s1560">I walk out.</span> <span id="s1561">I couldn’t believe it because I’m sure never, ever before, and it probably never will happen.</span> <span id="s1562">Why did you do it?</span> <span id="s1563">Why did he…?</span> <span id="s1564">And I said miracles.</span> <span id="s1565">Why did he it to me?</span> <span id="s1566">Why did he endanger his whole life and his family?</span> <span id="s1567">Why?</span> <span id="s1568">And if this happened going to Germany, my life was practically safe.</span> <span id="s1569">It was – here it was the consul himself that he gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1570">Now, I had to go back, you see, I was in Switzerland now with a visa.</span> <span id="s1571">I didn’t dare to tell to anybody.</span> <span id="s1572">When the war with Poland was over, I get a ticket and I get on the train.</span> <span id="s1573">I get on the train going back to Vienna, and the war was over with Poland.</span> <span id="s1574">It didn’t take long, you know.</span> <span id="s1575">It took over – the war was over, and I traveled only with soldiers, German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1576">They were ______ that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1577">I had on me my passport, but I didn’t open it, nobody said – but you can imagine for hours, I was scared silly, but they were nice to me.</span> <span id="s1578">They did not know who I was.</span> <span id="s1579">I come to the border Switzerland and Germany – Austria, and there you had to go through an examination above it because I was not German.</span> <span id="s1580">She saw the passport.</span> <span id="s1581">They examined me.</span> <span id="s1582">I had to undress.</span> <span id="s1583">It was a woman.</span> <span id="s1584">And I had – I still have it, I have to show you.</span> <span id="s1585">When you got married you had nothing yet.</span> <span id="s1586">My husband gave me a little golden chain with a little heart.</span> <span id="s1587">It was worth nothing, but I had it hidden anyway in a little pocket on the side.</span> <span id="s1588">I’m afraid it falls to pieces, and she looks at me.</span> <span id="s1589">She says, “Why didn’t you leave it in Switzerland?”</span> <span id="s1590">I said, “I couldn’t leave it.</span> <span id="s1591">My husband said it would bring me luck.”</span> <span id="s1592">And she looked at it, and she started discussing it with two or three other men, and then I was already dressed.</span> <span id="s1593">A man comes to me and says, “Look, you will hope be able to take the little heart and neck- (ph) out when you come here.</span> <span id="s1594">I’m going to write it in your passport.”</span> <span id="s1595">You see my passport with a little heart and necklace taken in.</span> <span id="s1596">He wrote it in, and there it was.</span> <span id="s1597">So, I keep on going.</span> <span id="s1598">I arrived in Vienna in the evening.</span> <span id="s1599">Eddie picks me up.</span> <span id="s1600">We were not allowed to take a taxi or anything, and he said to me your number might have been gone by now.</span> <span id="s1601">It took me just two days, three days.</span> <span id="s1602">They might have given me to somebody else.</span> <span id="s1603">And, did I talk too fast?</span> <span id="s1604">No.</span> <span id="s1605">And, he said – the next day we rushed to the American Consulate.</span> <span id="s1606">Yes, my number was still there.</span> <span id="s1607">They hadn’t given it away yet.</span> <span id="s1608">They gave me they number.</span> <span id="s1609">They gave me my visa.</span> <span id="s1610">I was the last one after the people had to wait for a long.</span> <span id="s1611">I was the last one.</span> <span id="s1612">You do not know such circumstances at the moment what they’ll be.</span> <span id="s1613">Eddie rushes me to the train again, off go back to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1614">He still stays.</span> <span id="s1615">He didn’t have his numbers yet that he could also cross.</span> <span id="s1616">Rush me all off to Switzerland, and I – no, I take a train to Switzerland, and we come – it’s, of course, a German train – we come to the border.</span> <span id="s1617">The train stops.</span> <span id="s1618">The conductor says, “This train is not going any further, and there is no other train today or tomorrow that goes to Switzerland.”</span> <span id="s1619">You can imagine.</span> <span id="s1620">What now?</span> <span id="s1621">What now?</span> <span id="s1622">I’m in German grounds.</span> <span id="s1623">My time has elapsed.</span> <span id="s1624">I have to be out.</span> <span id="s1625">The one German asked me, she recognized me, “You have a necklace, yah?”</span> <span id="s1626">I didn’t know what they were talking, “Don’t you remember us?</span> <span id="s1627">Don’t you remember?”</span> <span id="s1628">I was so excited, I didn’t, “And now I have no train to go to Switzerland.”</span> <span id="s1629">The one comes to me and says, “Don’t get desperate.</span> <span id="s1630">I will show you how you will go.”</span> <span id="s1631">He said, “Do you see this street?”</span> <span id="s1632">I saw the street, yes.</span> <span id="s1633">It was also evening because it was dark.</span> <span id="s1634">He said, “There is no train, but you have good feet and legs.”</span> <span id="s1635">He said, “It’s two miles from here if you walk.</span> <span id="s1636">Walk, run,” he said, “So nobody can stop you.</span> <span id="s1637">Run.</span> <span id="s1638">After these two miles you will see on the left hand side a little house.</span> <span id="s1639">When you reach that little house, you are on the Swiss border.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: We have to stop the tape right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">End of Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Tape 5</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: You were describing that the border guard was telling where you could run, and he was suggesting that you should run.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: Yes, where to run.</span> <span id="s1646">It was dark.</span> <span id="s1647">I finally found the house he described.</span> <span id="s1648">I cross over, here I am.</span> <span id="s1649">I look at the skies.</span> <span id="s1650">It’s dark.</span> <span id="s1651">I look at the ground.</span> <span id="s1652">I fall on my knees.</span> <span id="s1653">I kiss the ground.</span> <span id="s1654">I start to cry.</span> <span id="s1655">Here I am.</span> <span id="s1656">I have been saved.</span> <span id="s1657">A new life is starting for me.</span> <span id="s1658">Two days later, I was headed for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: And Eddie comes a few days later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: I met him, a few weeks, but I met him on the border.</span> <span id="s1661">To get in Genoa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: In Genoa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Yeah, in Genoa, again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: So, he didn’t go to Switzerland; he went directly to…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s1666">In the meantime, he got his – it wasn’t the next day.</span> <span id="s1667">It was probably a few weeks or so to get the papers and all together.</span> <span id="s1668">We went together to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: Let me ask you a couple of small details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Sure, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: How come you were allowed to go back into Switzerland?</span> <span id="s1672">You didn’t have a visa anymore.</span> <span id="s1673">Was the American visa enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: That’s a good question.</span> <span id="s1675">I do not know because, you remember, I arrived on the brother and I had permission – I actually didn’t immigrate, leave Switzerland, completely.</span> <span id="s1676">I had only permission to go for 48 hours to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1677">That’s an excursion, and so I was back.</span> <span id="s1678">Not only this.</span> <span id="s1679">In the meantime, the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1680">The Swiss could not throw anybody out anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: They couldn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: No, not now.</span> <span id="s1683">The Swiss borders, all of them, were closed.</span> <span id="s1684">It was the war between Germany and Poland.</span> <span id="s1685">Even the Swiss were _____, but they themselves did not allow anybody in or out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: So, even for these few days when you came back, do you recall where you stayed, who you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: What did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: When you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: Once you had the number and you ran across the border…</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: So, you kissed the ground.</span> <span id="s1693">Now, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: I’ll tell you one thing: at the time, I didn’t know it exactly.</span> <span id="s1695">I stayed a time with a friend or somebody else.</span> <span id="s1696">I was hiding; I was used to that kind of life.</span> <span id="s1697">I knew some people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: So, were you hiding, in a way?</span> <span id="s1699">Or did you feel safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: I didn’t even give it a thought.</span> <span id="s1701">With an affidavit in my hand, “Here I come!</span> <span id="s1702">A new life, here I come!”</span> <span id="s1703">______________.</span> <span id="s1704">I had already my passport, my visa, everything, I was waiting for my boat to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Now, one other question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: It’s not clear to me how your brother finds you on the telephone, how Muriel finds you, and Edward.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Muriel found me because I was in contact with the American Express, and from time to time, the bank would call me.</span> <span id="s1709">She knew how to get to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: How did your brother know to get to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: I think when I came to Switzerland that I called him and told him.</span> <span id="s1712">Then, when I tried several times to catch him somewhere where he was – maybe yes, maybe no.</span> <span id="s1713">Sometimes I was lucky; I would get him.</span> <span id="s1714">I would try different ways until I found him.</span> <span id="s1715">Any your friends with whom I might have stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: So, when your brother left Vienna, he would call you at home in Vienna, when you were still there…</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: When I was still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: So, you had some idea, vague ideas, about where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: No, no, it maybe – he didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s1720">He was afraid.</span> <span id="s1721">No, that was from week to week, but that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: So-</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: I did not know when I would ever hear from him.</span> <span id="s1724">He himself was in tremendous danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: And so his finding you in Switzerland was a matter of his trying people you knew in common?</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1727">Maybe he tried Muriel or something, I don’t recall the details.</span> <span id="s1728">I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: And how come you were going to take a boat from Genoa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: I bought, I got a ticket.</span> <span id="s1731">I paid for it.</span> <span id="s1732">Muriel helped me, for me and for Eddie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: For both?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: For both, sure.</span> <span id="s1735">Like I said, we have given back – Don’t you see, we lived for a long time in the middle-west.</span> <span id="s1736">I would have liked to New York and Albany.</span> <span id="s1737">The Joint would help the people, but they didn’t want to help me.</span> <span id="s1738">I did not know.</span> <span id="s1739">The social worker told me why they didn’t want.</span> <span id="s1740">Muriel said, “I’m going to pay her anything she needs.</span> <span id="s1741">I will pay for her.”</span> <span id="s1742">When we found out, I said, “I don’t want to keep taking money from her.</span> <span id="s1743">I will take a job wherever I can.”</span> <span id="s1744">So, we landed in the middle-west.</span> <span id="s1745">It was easier that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: But, you were – was Eddie a practicing physician at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: I tell you, look, he just came from __________.</span> <span id="s1748">You need an internship, you need a residency, but to find it – you don’t find it right off either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: But going to the Midwest is going to something foreign in comparison with Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: It was so foreign.</span> <span id="s1751">Lincoln, Nebraska, Peoria, Illinois, you just don’t realize I could have stayed in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1752">They didn’t allow us for a few years to take state board, and they didn’t grasp the whole story, but I did not want to keep on taking from Muriel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: She was willing to keep-</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: I think didn’t even tell me that it would come this way, but it was sent through the bank or whatever.</span> <span id="s1755">I didn’t see her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: Maybe the tickets came.</span> <span id="s1758">She helped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q: And she was living in the United States now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: Well, she was traveling all over.</span> <span id="s1761">Like I said, she grew up in a home with fourteen servants in her home.</span> <span id="s1762">One of the richest people here.</span> <span id="s1763">She skied.</span> <span id="s1764">She knew the whole world.</span> <span id="s1765">She was married.</span> <span id="s1766">She __ the book.</span> <span id="s1767">She was in the underground.</span> <span id="s1768">She was in danger all her life.</span> <span id="s1769">She was an American and English passports she had, because she was first married to an Englishman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: But she was very politically active, obviously; she was anti-fascist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: Very politically.</span> <span id="s1772">Her husband was a leader of the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1774">So, in spite of the fact that where you arrived in the United States was very foreign, you are now a free person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Free person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: And you do not have to be afraid anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1778">It was like going to the moon.</span> <span id="s1779">And it was tough times here, too, at that time to get jobs.</span> <span id="s1780">__________ and worked in Lincoln, Nebraska.</span> <span id="s1781">People would say, “I didn’t get any money.</span> <span id="s1782">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1783">I just worked.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: As a physician?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: As a physician, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: But no money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: No money.</span> <span id="s1788">You didn’t have a room, nothing.</span> <span id="s1789">Eddie made probably $25, and lived on the… And you were too proud.</span> <span id="s1790">They didn’t let me eat dinner with the other doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: Because you’re a woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: No, it was just, you don’t ask, you see, at that time.</span> <span id="s1793">It was tough.</span> <span id="s1794">I didn’t ask give myself out of this.</span> <span id="s1795">I didn’t say that I needed that at that time.</span> <span id="s1796">I didn’t I tell them.</span> <span id="s1797">I said, “I would like.”</span> <span id="s1798">They said, “___.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Were people suspicious of you because you were Austrian, even though you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1801">No, no.</span> <span id="s1802">Not in the United States, no.</span> <span id="s1803">___ with the ___ no, absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: How long did it take you before you got certified in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Because I had to become – I had to become a citizen.</span> <span id="s1806">They would expect both of us to take the exams.</span> <span id="s1807">It took me about – first the primary and then the - it took me four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: And Eddie was a bit sooner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: Eddie was a little sooner, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: And, you stayed in the Midwest for two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: I stayed there in Lincoln, Nebraska and Peoria, Illinois.</span> <span id="s1812">I had got first got first an internship.</span> <span id="s1813">First, I was just in orthopedics.</span> <span id="s1814">Then I had an internship in Peoria, Illinois, in the Methodist Hospital here, and then I got mixed residency again in Peoria, Illinois, but then I felt so rich like the richest person in the world.</span> <span id="s1815">The second year as residence, I made a hundred dollars a month; the world was mine.</span> <span id="s1816">Then in the same city, I got – in Peoria, Illinois, I got the residence in medicine.</span> <span id="s1817">Here it was in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics.</span> <span id="s1818">And after they promised us, in order to open up a practice, you had to take an exam.</span> <span id="s1819">They said, “Yes, next year, next year, next year.”</span> <span id="s1820">I never ______ so long, but then they still didn’t let us take it.</span> <span id="s1821">Finally they let me, and I passed it.</span> <span id="s1822">Then we came to Maine.</span> <span id="s1823">I opened up here first and owned my own practice.</span> <span id="s1824">And then I got a position, a high position here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: So, you have had a long career?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Yes, that’s right a long career.</span> <span id="s1827">I was here for 20 years as a district health office.</span> <span id="s1828">I had three counties: Oxford, Franklin and Muskogee County.</span> <span id="s1829">And I traveled all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: And, you were working for the state.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: For the state, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: When you first came, the war’s going on in Europe.</span> <span id="s1833">Eddie still has family there.</span> <span id="s1834">You were able to closely follow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: I had – if I was able to, what did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: Follow the war-</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: Yeah, I was in contract with them.</span> <span id="s1838">________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: Where was Eddie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: In Vienna.</span> <span id="s1841">He was still in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1842">He couldn’t get the numbers.</span> <span id="s1843">So, remember, they didn’t let him out.</span> <span id="s1844">He had the visa and everything.</span> <span id="s1845">The Germans wouldn’t let – wouldn’t allow him to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: So, wait a minute, how long did it take Eddie – I thought you got on the boat- I thought you go on the boat together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: Yes, but since I was still sometimes in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1848">Then, we met on the border.</span> <span id="s1849">I cannot tell you the time difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: But I mean, when both of you are in
