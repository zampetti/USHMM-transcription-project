me.</span> <span id="s13">There was a big scar across, it was blood all over.</span> <span id="s14">And my friend got hit, apparently the same set of bullets hit him right here and took a top of his head.</span> <span id="s15">So I grabbed him and I ran with him for about 400 feet.</span> <span id="s16">And I could never lift him because he was a big boy, about his size – your size.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And you lifted him that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I lifted him, I grabbed him, I had his gun – his rifle and my rifle and some other items, and him.</span> <span id="s19">I must have – I must have run about three or 400 feet before I ran into my own boys and we put him down and tried to get help and of course he was beyond help because his top of a head was gone.</span> <span id="s20">So I had my head fixed and then after war in Germany, I got a good German surgeon and he cut it open again and left only a little, tiny – I mean, it was a scar, I’m – it was enormous scar.</span> <span id="s21">So he left only a little, tiny scar there.</span> <span id="s22">But I still – when I take my hat off, I kind of remember that blood running and the whole, horrible, open thing there, just like my top of a head was completely open down to the brains.</span> <span id="s23">But it wasn’t, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: But it was also seeing him, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: It was, yes.</span> <span id="s26">So I keep my hat on, just about everywhere.</span> <span id="s27">I take it off in church and I – I take it off when I go to

<p><span id="s31">A: There was – went to Miss Batchelor’s wedding.</span> <span id="s32">I had my hat on, and they had skullcaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">And I was going to have a special

and then “Z” has that dot above it, which makes it into “Ż.”</span> <span id="s40">Polish language has three “Z’s.”</span> <span id="s41">It has “Z,” “Ź” and “Ż.”</span> <span id="s42">The “Ź” has an apostrophe, the “Ż” has a – a dot above it.</span> <span id="s43">It’s a funny language.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">01:03:02</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: I see, that’s why the dots are above it.</span> <span id="s46">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: And we have seven extra letters in our alphabet.</span> <span id="s49">Q: Oh, you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Because “Ź,” “Ż,” “Z” – is as “C” and “Ć” and there’s “S” and Ś and it has “L,” “T” and “Ł.”</span> <span id="s51">“Ł” has a crossbar slanted on the top of it.</span> <span

interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s58">It’s April 8, 1998.</span> <span id="s59">We’re in Minneapolis, Minnesota, or nearby.</span> <span id="s60">This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and it’s tape one.</span> <span id="s61">And if we could just begin by having you introduce yourself and then also tell us where you were born and when.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Very well.</span> <span id="s63">My name is Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s64">I was born in 1922, in a little town of Lesnogóra, Poland.</span> <span id="s65">Lesnogóra is in central Poland, about 45 kilometers east of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s66">It’s a small hamlet, you cannot even find it on a map, but it’s still there.</span> <span id="s67">Last time I wrote to somebody there, it still was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Tell us what it looked like.</span> <span id="s69">What it was like to grow up there?</span> <span id="s70">A: To live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: To – in, in Lesnogóra.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Oh, it was a farm – a farming community.</span> <span id="s73">There was no industry of any kind, just farms.</span> <span id="s74">There was one little store, kind of a general store, one room little store, ran by a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s75">The rest of the people were all Polish peasants working on a farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: And what did your parents do?</span> <span id="s77">Maybe tell us their names and what did they do, were you farmers?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s79">My father was Jan Czyzewski, he was a farmer.</span> <span id="s80">My mother was Bogumila Czyzewski, nee Boruc.</span> <span id="s81">My mother was an – was a schoolteacher.</span> <span id="s82">And she was a frustrated schoolteacher.</span> <span id="s83">When she married and had a first child, which was me, she would not be hired to work any more.</span> <span id="s84">So she was really frustrated.</span> <span id="s85">By a time I was three, she taught me how to read and I never stopped.</span> <span id="s86">I fell in love with books and I have been reading ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">01:06:05</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: What was your family home like?</span> <span id="s89">Did you have land?</span> <span id="s90">What did your – just tell us a little bit about that, what did your father farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes, we – the farms in that part of Poland were a kind of a variety farm.</span> <span id="s92">The land was rather poor, so they planted just about everything that they needed and in – everything they could sell.</span> <span id="s93">They planted a lot of cabbage and a plenty of potatoes and some wheat and also a lot of rye.</span> <span id="s94">Our land was in many little pieces, so we had to travel from a village to work on, on the land.</span> <span id="s95">My father – just about like me – spent a lot of time in strange places.</span> <span id="s96">The part of Poland that we lived in before 19 – in – before 1900’s, were occupied by Russia, Czarist Russia.</span> <span id="s97">My father was conscripted, or drew a lot and spent 12 and a half years in Czar’s imperial army.</span> <span id="s98">He came back home for six months and the first war – world war started.</span> <span id="s99">He was called again and did fight on the western front against – against Germans.</span> <span id="s100">And of course he heard some Polish people speaking across the front lines, so he walked across one night and thought he would join them.</span> <span id="s101">Instead of that, they put him in a prisoners of war came – camp.</span> <span id="s102">And they sent him way, way out west, close to the western front line betw – a li – a front line between France and Germany.</span> <span id="s103">And again, well he was – at that time he was a sapper.</span> <span id="s104">He was a fortification specialist.</span> <span id="s105">So the Germans gave him a group of people, group of prisoners and they built fortifications – a kind of a front line fortification system at Verdun.</span> <span id="s106">And probably everybody heard of that horrible battle at Verdun, where more than half a million people were killed.</span> <span id="s107">So he did, and the Germans of course, were very appreciative, so he put him in a fr – one morning they put him in a front of a squad that he was in and gave him German Ritterkreuzor, or Eisern—Eisernekreuz– German, German decoration, because the part that he built there – the French could not overrun it.</span> <span id="s108">They tried several time, they couldn’t overrun it.</span> <span id="s109">Anyway, a few days later, he heard Polish people speaking across the line on the French side.</span> <span id="s110">So he walked across.</span> <span id="s111">And the Po – he joined Polish Legion that was fighting on the French side.</span> <span id="s112">Couple nights later he led the French into the part of the fortification that he built.</span> <span id="s113">They overran it, they kicked the Germans out 2 Knight’s Cross (German) 3 Iron Cross (German) and the French gave him the Croix de GuerreSo he had German decoration, he had French decoration.</span> <span id="s114">Later on, the Polish Legion gave him Virtuti Militari,Polish cross.</span> <span id="s115">So when my father came back home after the wars, he didn’t brag much about it.</span> <span id="s116">As a matter of fact, my family didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s117">I was the only one that he showed the crosses to and he told little about what happened.</span> <span id="s118">When he came home, he brought some things.</span> <span id="s119">He brought a French army coat and he brought a pair of American army boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">And he had those boots until 1940’s.</span> <span id="s121">They were pair of clodhoppers.</span> <span id="s122">They had a big, round toes, but he said, “Those are the best boots I ever had.”</span> <span id="s123">They were ugly, but he said, “They are sewed, they are glued and nailed.</span> <span id="s124">You can never wear them out.”</span> <span id="s125">Occasionally on – on a big holiday, he would put those boots on and para– shine them and parade around it.</span> <span id="s126">And everybody was look and said, “Jan, where do you get those ugly boots?”</span> <span id="s127">He said, “You better shut up, those are American boots, those are the best boots I ever had.”</span></p> <p><span id="s128">01:10:54</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: So your father, when you were growing up, would – would talk with you about his military experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: He talked a blue streak to me, but he would not talk to anybody else.</span> <span id="s131">And of course he talked about all the girlfriends he had.</span> <span id="s132">The great Russian girlfriend he had.</span> <span id="s133">And the great German girlfriend he had.</span> <span id="s134">And of course, he had a great French girlfriend.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Tell us about your siblings.</span> <span id="s136">You’re – you’re not an only child.</span> <span id="s137">Who else was in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yes, I had two sist– I had – have two sister, who are in their late 60’s or early 70’s.</span> <span id="s139">When I was arrested, they were a –</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Their names, can you tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yes, the older one is Henryka.</span> <span id="s142">She is about 71.</span> <span id="s143">The younger one is – or was – is Eleanor or Eleonora.</span> <span id="s144">She’s about 68 or 69.</span> <span id="s145">When I was arrested, they were like 12 and 14.</span> <span id="s146">And two years ago, they came to visit me.</span> <span id="s147">And I said, “Well gee!</span> <span id="s148">I left two pretty little girls, what do I see now?</span> <span id="s149">Two old, little woman.”</span> <span id="s150">And my sister Eleonora is outspoken, she said, “Who do you think you are?</span> <span id="s151">You’re a old, little man.”</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: What was a regular day like?</span> <span id="s153">Did you work with your father?</span> <span id="s154">Just describe a regular day at your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">4 War Cross (French) 5 Courageous Soldiers (Latin); Polish medal awarded for courage in the battlefield.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: We did get up at the sun raise, or before.</span> <span id="s157">And we did little work, like taking care of the livestock, feeding the cows, feeding the pigs and watering the horses and preparing.</span> <span id="s158">And then of course – then after that I went to school.</span> <span id="s159">And first three years, we had a village school, was a one room village school.</span> <span id="s160">Later on I had to walk to the town of Grebków, which was our district, little village, which had seven grade school.</span> <span id="s161">So my time was spent mostly in school.</span> <span id="s162">I would walk at seven in morning to get to be – to be in school by eight and I didn’t come home until about three.</span> <span id="s163">So then I helped around the farm.</span> <span id="s164">And on weekend, on Saturday, I would work with father in a field, but on a weekday, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: And what – what kinds of things did your family do in the community?</span> <span id="s166">Wh–Were there political parties or any kind of small organizations in the village that they took part in?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">01:13:43</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: There were political parties, but they were just practically two.</span> <span id="s169">There was the Nationalist party, which was very small and hardly anybody joined it because they were kind of chauvinistic and there was the so-called “non-party” party, which was the government party.</span> <span id="s170">And most people were kind of – not exactly joining it, but supporting it, because all the politicians and all the representatives were members of that party.</span> <span id="s171">There was quite a lively social life.</span> <span id="s172">There were mostly – mostly religious holidays and feasts that people took part in it.</span> <span id="s173">Like for instance, when the month of May came, every night after supper, everybody went to a little shrine and they would be singing lot of hymns and they would sing a litany to all the saints and then you would walk home and sing loudly.</span> <span id="s174">There was a fair, one or two or three religious fairs, that special preachers would come to the church and we would walk to church and listen to the preachers and there were booths and souvenirs toe – tables.</span> <span id="s175">And food tables, where you would spend little money to get some food that you normally did not eat at home.</span> <span id="s176">Well, every Tuesday there was a marketplace, market day.</span> <span id="s177">You would – father would hitch a horse and we’d take some butter and eggs and some grain and some potatoes and drive to Kaluszyn, where the market took place and the people from a city would – housewife would come and buy your butter and buy your eggs.</span> <span id="s178">And Kaluszyn was a town of about 12,000 people, of whom about 10,000 were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s179">Jewish people were merchants, they were professional, they were attorneys, they were doctors.</span> <span id="s180">They were tailors and shoemakers.</span> <span id="s181">And we traded with them throughout our lives.</span> <span id="s182">We always had a family or two or three that we’re very friendly with and visited when we went there.</span> <span id="s183">We would start their place and maybe get a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s184">When they came to see us, we would give them a dozen of eggs and when they came to visit on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">01:16:25</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Well, how would you describe the relations in general between Jews and Poles at that time?</span> <span id="s187">First maybe think about your village.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: In our village, there was one Jewish family.</span> <span id="s189">It was actually first a Jewish man, only, who opened a little – like a grocery and needles and thimble store.</span> <span id="s190">Later on he had a wife and two children.</span> <span id="s191">And relations were not strained.</span> <span id="s192">We kind of tolerated one another.</span> <span id="s193">All Polish Jewish people were Orthodox people.</span> <span id="s194">They wore special dress, they had sideburns, they had peysethe long side hair.</span> <span id="s195">They wore gabardine coats, they wore little hats, with a – little tiny, black hats with a tot – little tiny visor.</span> <span id="s196">And they spoke very broken Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: For instance, did the children go to the school that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: The Jewish children would go to public schools that all of us had to go.</span> <span id="s199">But, they would spend little time there, but most of the time they spent was in a cheder.</span> <span id="s200">There was a Jewish cheder, they went and they learned to – how to write Yiddish and some of them would learn Hebrew.</span> <span id="s201">And socially we did not have much to do together.</span> <span id="s202">Socially, we kept completely apart.</span> <span id="s203">We did not mix, or if they did, it was very little mixing between the Jewish people and Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Did you understand why?</span> <span id="s205">Was that ever sort of spoken, or was that just how things were?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: That’s was how the things were.</span> <span id="s207">It was not a – because one hated one another, but was simply because the things were.</span> <span id="s208">People gravitated to their own and they did little association business-wise and also occasionally visited.</span> <span id="s209">For instance, we had had a – a Jewish peddlers come.</span> <span id="s210">There was a Jewish lady, whose name was Golda, who came carrying a big bag and she was trading.</span> <span id="s211">She brought sacharynato sell, she brought needles, she brought thread, she brought little pieces of material.</span> <span id="s212">She brought occasionally a dress or two.</span> <span id="s213">And she would take in – in exchange, she would take eggs and butter and some potatoes and maybe some grain.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">01:19:20</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Tell us a little bit more about your family and it’s religious beliefs.</span> <span id="s216">When you were growing up, how did your parents explain those to you?</span> <span id="s217">Wi-Wi – you know, in church and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: We took the church for granted.</span> <span id="s219">We just went to church on Sundays.</span> <span id="s220">We went to religious instructions, which were taking place in public school.</span> <span id="s221">Once a week, a priest or a nun would come and take a – actually the priest or nun came every day, but took one class, for one hour we received our religious instruction.</span> <span id="s222">And we went to special preparation like for first communion or confirmation.</span> <span id="s223">We would go to church in groups that – which reached certain age and were prepared.</span> <span id="s224">We prayed at home frequently, we would say a rosary.</span> <span id="s225">Probably not every day, but at least once a week.</span> <span id="s226">And we kids hated 6 Earlocks worn by Hasidic Jews (Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s227">7 Saccharine (Polish) it because we had to kneel for about 45 minutes on a hard floor, so we squirmed and we complained, but quietly, because father did not take any guff from any kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: So it was a part of your home life and it was certainly a part of your parents beliefs?</span> <span id="s229">A: Very much so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Was there a time, as you started to get older, that it became more something that you believed in and it wasn’t that your parents were kind of asking you to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: No, it became – it was given – it was given.</span> <span id="s232">We did not question.</span> <span id="s233">We knew that if you went to college later on, if you went to university, you lost your faith, in parenthesis.</span> <span id="s234">You lost your faith, because you started questioning.</span> <span id="s235">And you started not really believing the stories.</span> <span id="s236">“Well, those are just stories, you know, Bible is a story and religious stories is a story and life’s of saints, oh, just nice little stories.</span> <span id="s237">And the Christians and the lion s, of course, were also just stories.</span> <span id="s238">Maybe true, maybe not.</span> <span id="s239">So you don’t have to believe any more, huh?”</span> <span id="s240">But there were not many people who went to college and there not many of those who went there, who lost their faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">01:22:04</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: You say you were in school, were you thinking about going to college, were your parents talking to you about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yes, they were talking about going not to college, but to go into middle school, which back there, it was a gimnazjum,it was equivalent of American college.</span> <span id="s244">And I was one of the students who was halfway bright and I di– gi– did get grant.</span> <span id="s245">They call it stypendium.</span> <span id="s246">I went to – for two years to the city of Wegrów, which was about 15, 18 miles, it was our county seat.</span> <span id="s247">I went to this – I call it gimnazjum, before the war came and ended it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: So how old were you when you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: I started at – I was 15 and I ended when I was 17, when the war came, I was almost 17 when the war came.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: And was it obviously – how did your parents feel about you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Well, they wanted badly to go – to let me go, but they could not afford it.</span> <span id="s252">The fees were steep.</span> <span id="s253">So I did get a so-called stypendium from the county.</span> <span id="s254">There were two kids from the county who passed the examination and I was the second one.</span> <span id="s255">The first one was a girl 8 Grammar school (Polish)</span></p> <p><span id="s256">9 Scholarship (Polish) who was bright and I hated her.</span> <span id="s257">Competed with her all – all my grade four, five and six and seven.</span> <span id="s258">And she just almost always beat me to it, except in the literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: So, was it hard for your parents to let you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s261">They were so proud, they were so damn proud, I was ashamed sometime when they bragged about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">01:24:03</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Tell us what they said, what would they say about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: “Well, he’s bright.</span> <span id="s265">See, he can read.</span> <span id="s266">He could read when he was four.”</span> <span id="s267">To take it back, when I was about eight or nine, my uncle Bronislaus got married.</span> <span id="s268">They lived in a big, ramshackle house.</span> <span id="s269">His wife brought a bunch of books.</span> <span id="s270">Those were th– those were the books I was not supposed to read.</span> <span id="s271">They’re called in the French Romances.</span> <span id="s272">Of course I did, I sneaked out and read them, I mean I just read them day and night.</span> <span id="s273">And of course I got caught.</span> <span id="s274">My mother said, “Aha.</span> <span id="s275">Those books you are not supposed to read, but I guess I won’t prevent you from reading it, so to counter with, every night after supper, after you eat supper, you are going to read the Bible, aloud.”</span> <span id="s276">“Bible?</span> <span id="s277">What do I want to read the Bible for?”</span> <span id="s278">“Well, you are going to read it if you want to or not.”</span> <span id="s279">So I did, for half an hour, then 45 minutes, then one hour.</span> <span id="s280">The neighbor’s kids were laughing, “Hoo, he is reading Bible.”</span> <span id="s281">Pretty soon the neighbors kids started coming in to listen, because the Old Testament stories are fascinating, bloody and murder at times.</span> <span id="s282">Especially if you come to the Book of Judith, I mean that was a real story.</span> <span id="s283">So, after supper, there’d be a bunch of kids sitting, later on, in winter, I mean and we had no electricity, just a ga– a kerosene lamp there.</span> <span id="s284">Adult neighbors would be coming and listening to those stories of Old Testament, especially the Book of Judith when she – she went to sleep with him and got up in a middle of a night, I mean the leader, the whole affair and this leader of the Philistines – got up in a middle of a night, chopped off his head and took it with her.</span> <span id="s285">I mean, those were great stories.</span> <span id="s286">By the time I was 14, I read the Bible aloud twice.</span> <span id="s287">So I pretend to know something about Bible.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: What – at that point, what were you thinking your future might hold?</span> <span id="s289">Were you think – did you have any idea of what you might do?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Well, it was a given that I was going to be a farmer.</span> <span id="s291">I would inherit most of my father’s farm, pay off my sisters.</span> <span id="s292">I had different ideas, I wanted to live in a city and get a job in a city, especially af– I, after I went for two years to gimnazjum, I was – I knew everything.</span> <span id="s293">But I didn’t – we didn’t talk much about it because my father was a choleryk.He had a short temper.</span> <span id="s294">If you said anything that he didn’t like, you got walloped.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">10 Spitfire (Polish)</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: It sounds though like a very unified family.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s298">Kind of, but not exactly on a defensive, but very close-knit family.</span> <span id="s299">01:27:03</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Think back to maybe six months or a year before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s301">Did – do you remember a time when you noticed a shift in the tone?</span> <span id="s302">That you began to be aware that something might be happening, and how – how did you become aware of a change – possible change in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: We were very much aware that the war was coming.</span> <span id="s304">I mean, we – we just – we just felt it in our bones.</span> <span id="s305">And the political shenanigans, negotiations and so on and so forth, we knew we were going to fight Germany.</span> <span id="s306">We never expected to find the Soviets.</span> <span id="s307">We had, of course, Non-aggression Pact with the So – pact with the Soviets.</span> <span id="s308">We did not expect to fight them, but we knew we were going to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s309">There’s a Polish joke, later on developed, you know, when times were the hardest, the most difficult, people were being killed, mutilated, arrested, sent to camps, gassed – the Poles made the best jokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">We made the best jokes ever.</span> <span id="s311">Scenario – the Germans come from the west, the Russians come to – from the we – east, who do we shoot first?</span> <span id="s312">Russians.</span> <span id="s313">Pleasure before duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: On that note, let’s change tapes.</span> <span id="s315">01:28:32</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: You have to have a Catholic Bible.</span> <span id="s317">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s318">My mom does.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Does she?</span> <span id="s320">Okay, look in a – Q: Yeah, she’s Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: – the Book of – of Judith does not exist in a Patterson Bible.</span> <span id="s322">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: See, when the Bible was being translated – Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: – the group of Anglican scholars appointed by Hen – King Henry, looked at it and they say, “this, this, this and that and that–“</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: – are not necessarily inspired, so we will leave them out.</span> <span id="s327">There’s Belgium and Reims, France, they translated the Bible, the so-called Douai-Reims translation and they said, “Whatever was good for Saint Jerome is good for us.”</span> <span id="s328">So they translated the whole kit and caboodle.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Endo of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s331">02:00:13</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Consequently –</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: No, I’m sure she has that.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Consequently, 11 parts of Old Testament do not exist in a – Q: Eleven?</span> <span id="s336">Eleven books?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Eleven parts, ele– not, not complete books.</span> <span id="s338">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s339">Parts, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: But the Book of Judith – Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: And the Book of Daniel in lion’s den and few others don’t exist.</span> <span id="s342">Part of a –</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s344">This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s345">It is April 8, 1998.</span> <span id="s346">We are outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s347">This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape two.</span> <span id="s348">Think – if you can think back to – you were saying that you knew that war was coming.</span> <span id="s349">To think back to – you know, place yourself and how did you know?</span> <span id="s350">Did you hear things on the radio?</span> <span id="s351">Were there conversations that you had or heard?</span> <span id="s352">If you could tell us some of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: It was mostly news on the radio and also newspapers, also newspapers.</span> <span id="s354">We kind of watched closely, all the political shenanigans.</span> <span id="s355">You know, our Ministers of – of Foreign Affairs was going back and forth, was going to France, was going to Germany, was going to England, negotiating and negotiating and Germans having more and more power and asking for more and more of – of Poland.</span> <span id="s356">We knew that time was coming and of course we knew we’re going to beat the bejesus out of the Germans, turned out differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: What did your father and mother say about it?</span> <span id="s358">What was the feeling back home in Lesnogóra, you were in school nearby, what wa– when you went home, what were people saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: It was a vacation time when those things went on, so I was at home.</span> <span id="s360">I was back in June and there was June, July and it started at the end of August or first of September.</span> <span id="s361">So we talked about a lot of it and father said, “Well, we can beat them easily.”</span> <span id="s362">And he wanted to join – he wanted to join, but they wouldn’t take him.</span> <span id="s363">Said, “You old man, go back home.”</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: So, was there any fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: There was apprehension, but not real fear.</span> <span id="s366">We kind of felt that, “Well, regardless how bad it is, it’s going to be on the Western border.</span> <span id="s367">There may be a stalemate, they may be going for some time, but most likely they won’t come here.”</span> <span id="s368">Of course, later on we, we learned better.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">02:03:14</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: How did you understand what Germany was doing?</span> <span id="s371">I mean, how did you understand Hitler and Nazism?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Well, first of all, we heard a lot of that perse-persecute-persecution in Germany.</span> <span id="s373">We had some Jewish people who came and lived with our Jewish friends in Kaluszyn, who came from Germany and told a lot how they were being “kicked around,” as – as they said.</span> <span id="s374">The Germans had demands – wanted to have the northern part of Poland, the Polish corridor that we had, going to the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s375">First they asked for free passage back and forth between East Prussia and Germany.</span> <span id="s376">Later on, they asked for the corridor, they just wanted there – they wanted Gdynia, they wanted Danzig, they wanted the whole territory.</span> <span id="s377">And of course, Poland was not about to give it to them, so we knew that a war was on-coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: When you say you heard about how the Jews were being treated in Germany and that you heard from people that had been kicked – kicked around, how did you make sense of that?</span> <span id="s379">Did you have any idea that this was a – a policy in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s381">We knew it was a policy of the German government.</span> <span id="s382">We knew – our press – Pola-Poland had quite a free press.</span> <span id="s383">I mean there were Socialist papers, there were extreme Rightist papers and the general press was kind of in between.</span> <span id="s384">So there was a lot about the persecution of minorities in Germany.</span> <span id="s385">And also, we knew a lot about the hoodlums who came to rule Germany.</span> <span id="s386">And we kind of wondered, especially in school, when I was still in school, that winter and spring before the hostilities started.</span> <span id="s387">We talked a lot with professors and we were greatly impressed always by the German scholarship, by the German philosophy, by the German literature.</span> <span id="s388">And then we thought, how could that ever happen, that the Germans let themselves be led – those intelligent, those bright, those advanced Germans can be led by a group of hoodlums of that kind – of that sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">02:06:10</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: So think back to that summer of 1939 and tell us where you are, what you’re doing every day and as we get closer to September, 1939, what’s going on?</span> <span id="s391">Are – are you being recruited, are you talking with your friends about fighting, what’s going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: That summer, we work on farm.</span> <span id="s393">I work – help my father on the farm, we – we it was – everything was almost planted when I came home from school in June, but the harvest came soon, first the hay.</span> <span id="s394">And the haying was done all by hand, even the mowing of the hay was done by hand.</span> <span id="s395">And the first day of haying – of mowing the hay, when you came home at night, you didn’t feel like eating, you could not sleep, your bone ached, every muscle your body ached.</span> <span id="s396">You were pulling the scythe, mowing the hay all day.</span> <span id="s397">Second day was better, the third day was nothing to it.</span> <span id="s398">Then the harvest came, of course and it was a hot, dry summer.</span> <span id="s399">The harvest was quite good, so we harvested first the rye, then the wheat, then the potato picking did not come until September.</span> <span id="s400">By that time, the war was over, when we picked the potatoes, so it wa– else, was just about ending.</span> <span id="s401">It was a summer of apprehension, a summer of some fear – what is going to happen?</span> <span id="s402">And of course, when the war started, things started happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: What did you think was – was going to happen with you?</span> <span id="s404">What were your plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: My plans were just about broken.</span> <span id="s406">I knew that I probably wouldn’t go to school any more.</span> <span id="s407">And I was very reluctant to stay and work on the farm.</span> <span id="s408">And when the war came and we – when we lost the war to Germans and the Soviets, I knew I was going to be stuck and work on a farm with my father, which – I was quite resigned to it.</span> <span id="s409">Said, “Well, hopefully the war will end and maybe I wi– I can go back to school and perhaps live – even live in a city.</span> <span id="s410">But for now, I’m stuck here, so I better make the best of it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s411">02:08:53</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Tell us where, where you were in those early days of September, in 1939 and when you first felt the presence of the invading army?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: It was – we knew that it was going to start soon, like in August.</span> <span id="s414">And we knew that Germany was going to attack soon.</span> <span id="s415">And then we heard the news about the Polish – a small group attacking Germany, in Silesia – it was a little town of Glewice, where a German dressed up a group of their own soldiers in Polish uniforms and attacked their radio station, took it over.</span> <span id="s416">And of course they had brought bodies from concentration camps, dead bodies and dressed them in Polish uniform – uniforms and had some casualties there.</span> <span id="s417">So we heard about that and of course, few days later, September first, they attacked.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: I’m not sure I really understood what happened in that little town in Silesia?</span> <span id="s419">A: In Glewice?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Yeah, in Gle-Gle–</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Ah, it was a p – a put up affair by the Germans.</span> <span id="s422">They dressed up Wehrmachtpeople in Polish uniforms and attacked their own radio station.</span> <span id="s423">It was the incident that created the war.</span> <span id="s424">They had the pretext, “The Polish – Poles attacked us and now we have to, of course, defend ourselves.”</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: How did you hear about it and how did you know exactly what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: It was on a Polish radio, it was in – was in Polish papers.</span> <span id="s427">Polish intelligence at that time apparently, was quite keen.</span> <span id="s428">And they knew all about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: So where were you – where were you when you first heard about that and what were your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: I was in my village, listening to a crystal radio and I thought, “Well, it’s inevitable, the war is co – war is coming and we’ll have to fight.”</span> <span id="s431">I was too young to – to be conscripted.</span> <span id="s432">My father was too old.</span> <span id="s433">He, of course, wanted to go and join.</span> <span id="s434">They said, “Go – old man, go back home.</span> <span id="s435">You had yours.”</span> <span id="s436">02:11:20</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: And when – how quickly did you feel the presence of Germans in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Within about three weeks, they were, in our neighborhood, the – kind of a pincer movement went around Warsaw.</span> <span id="s439">The – Warsaw was still fighting, but they went around and approached our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s440">There was quite a sharp firefight in my village.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Started early morning – the Polish cavalry came in and some infantry came in.</span> <span id="s442">The cavalry dismounted and sent horses back and they dug in on the periphery of my village.</span> <span id="s443">They had a whole bunch of little, anti-tank artillery.</span> <span id="s444">Was two fat wheels, and a horse and they could pull it like the dickens.</span> <span id="s445">Two men could pull that little thing.</span> <span id="s446">It was very effective against German tanks.</span> <span id="s447">So they dug in and they were waiting, and of course, the Germans attacked.</span> <span id="s448">And it’s kind of strange, my father said, “Well, why don’t you take the cows to the pasture?”</span> <span id="s449">And my father dug a dugout for the family, in a garden in the orchard, so they were – went all there and I took their horses and the cows to the pasture in the back – way back, beyond the village – it was a communal pasture.</span> <span id="s450">By the time I – I did get there, I couldn’t come back because there was a – I mean, was honest to goodness firefight.</span> <span id="s451">It was long distance artillery German – German artillery shooting.</span> <span id="s452">And a – a kind of bombarding the neighborhood, there was a – more machine guns going all over, so I just stayed behind the village, there, for about two hours.</span> <span id="s453">In about two hours, the Poles retreated and went and then came two cavalry men, who said, “Hey, little boy, do you know that little wood across the hill, there?”</span> <span id="s454">“Of course I know it.”</span> <span id="s455">“We have horses 11 Armed forces (German) there, about 15 horses, can you go and get the horses here?”</span> <span id="s456">“Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s457">Why not?”</span> <span id="s458">So I started running, kind of over the hill – I run over the hill and there was lot of firing and going and then I see – all of a sudden, I was kind of running on the border of a hi – of a – of a field.</span> <span id="s459">The border was kind of a strip of grass, it was higher than a field and I see right by my feet there, dust flying.</span> <span id="s460">And I didn’t think – think much of it, but it was somebody shooting machine gun from a way, way distance there – German machine gun and hitting right where I was running, below my feet.</span> <span id="s461">It was several times, right below my feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Apparently, whoever was shooting, was shooting little too low, thank goodness.</span> <span id="s463">When I ran to – I ran over the hill, the horses were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">02:14:34 So I laid down behind a bunch of trees, big Olszynatrees.</span> <span id="s465">There were such trees here.</span> <span id="s466">And artillery was shooting and hitting in – in transit was hitting a top of a trees and branches were falling down.</span> <span id="s467">So I just laid there for about half an hour, then it slowed down, I went back to the village, village was on fire and about two-thirds of the village was burned.</span> <span id="s468">There were nobody – no civilian casualties.</span> <span id="s469">There were about 35 Polish soldiers, who were killed.</span> <span id="s470">There were about 100 of Germans who were killed, back in approach the village.</span> <span id="s471">There were about 11 tanks that were mashed to smithereens by those little ca – Polish cannons.</span> <span id="s472">And of course the Poles ran away and the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s473">We were taking – getting water in pails, out of a – out of a well and I was – I climbed up on a top of a roof to prevent our house from being burned, because the neighbors house were burning, so I was handed the pails of water, I was pouring on the – on the roof of the house to prevent it from burning on.</span> <span id="s474">And the refugees who are running around the Warsaw, the bunch – were a group of people from Warsaw who were running around, “What will happen to us, what will happen to us?</span> <span id="s475">The Germans are going to kill us.”</span> <span id="s476">Well, the German patrol came down the village and they just came, they didn’t bother anybody, went across the village and went into the woods beyond the village, where the Polish army escaped.</span> <span id="s477">And more patrols came and more patrols came.</span> <span id="s478">But they were very correct, they did not bother anybody.</span> <span id="s479">They questioned a few men and they took document – asked for documents and they did not bother anybody.</span> <span id="s480">In – in other places, they would take young men and – and kill them.</span> <span id="s481">In our village, they were quite correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: So, almost your first – well, your first interaction with this war.</span> <span id="s483">You were essentially involved in it.</span> <span id="s484">You got asked to come into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Well, kind of, but I was almost a bystander, but I was little foolhardy running over the top of a hill where the shooting is going on.</span> <span id="s486">Of course I can – I could run.</span> <span id="s487">I said, “I can run – outrun anything.</span> <span id="s488">Nobody can hit me – aim and hit.”</span> <span id="s489">And they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">02:17:17 12 Alder tree (Polish)</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Did you tell your father this story?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Well, yeah, sure, of course I told him, I bragged about it.</span> <span id="s493">And he said, “Good for you.”</span> <span id="s494">Because my father went with horses to the forefront, where the Polish soldiers were dug in, he was doing some field work.</span> <span id="s495">And when there started shooting, he just stayed with them.</span> <span id="s496">And he went to talk to them in a – in the – in foxholes, said, “You better go there.</span> <span id="s497">Get on this side, get on this side.”</span> <span id="s498">“What do you know, old man?”</span> <span id="s499">“What do you mean old man?</span> <span id="s500">I’m an old soldier.</span> <span id="s501">Right here get mutilated, get behind that bush.</span> <span id="s502">Dig – dig a little foxhole there.”</span> <span id="s503">So they did and sure enough, long distance artillery shell came right where they were and made a hole you can drive – ride horses in it.</span> <span id="s504">So they turn and said, “Well, you old man, you – you knew what you were doing.”</span> <span id="s505">Well, they retreated.</span> <span id="s506">So he went back with them and he wanted a rifle, but they said, “Why, we don’t give rifles to civilians.”</span> <span id="s507">So of course he came home and my sisters and my mother and some of the refugee from Warsaw women were in our dugout there.</span> <span id="s508">Of course, everything was burning.</span> <span id="s509">The pigs were burning and squealing and – it was kind of a bedlam.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: That the animals were burning and dying?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s512">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s513">Our house and our barn – animal barn – I mean cow barn and our grain barn were not burned, so.</span> <span id="s514">We had a lot of people living with us for – after then.</span> <span id="s515">Some were relatives who were burnt out, some were neighbors who got burnt out.</span> <span id="s516">We had probably 35 people living with us.</span> <span id="s517">Was a three room part of a house.</span> <span id="s518">We cooked a lot.</span> <span id="s519">We rescued some of the pigs that were burned and we lived high on the hog for several weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: What were those few weeks like right after that first firefight?</span> <span id="s521">Were, were the Germans a presence in the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: The Germans were not around at all.</span> <span id="s523">There was some German police, that went and stayed with the Polish Blue Police in the Grebków by middle, my school village where I went to grade fourth and up.</span> <span id="s524">And there were Germans in Wegrów , the county town.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">There was a – a small army detachment.</span> <span id="s526">And later on – later, later on, there were Germans – German cavalry standing in neighb– sitting – staying in neighboring village, but to my village, it came only for a visit.</span> <span id="s527">It was a time when they were apparently preparing for the eastern front, but of course I wasn’t there then.</span> <span id="s528">I was way out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">02:20:29</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Well, what, what happened in those weeks that you – there were refugees living with you, what was going on around you and what were people talking about?</span> <span id="s531">How were they preparing to cope with their situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: People were quite bewildered.</span> <span id="s533">They didn’t know exactly what was going to go on.</span> <span id="s534">The civil administration was left intact, as it was.</span> <span id="s535">They had German supervisors, but on our little district, there was not even a German supervisor.</span> <span id="s536">There was a count and there was a district secretary and couple helpers, couple typists.</span> <span id="s537">There were a three man police force, which was staying there and they got orders from a Germans, but not really any orders to do anything unusual, just to keep peace.</span> <span id="s538">And of course, bunch of little boys – I joined the underground organization immediately.</span> <span id="s539">I think it was in early – late September or early October.</span> <span id="s540">We had a swearing in ceremony, one by one, in a cemetery.</span> <span id="s541">I can still remember it by heart.</span> <span id="s542">That was the – that was the O.P., Obroncy Polski,the Defenders of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Describe that and what – what – how did they swear you in?</span> <span id="s544">What –</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Well, you swore in that you are joining the defenders of Poland and, “I’m going to obey all orders by the organization.</span> <span id="s546">I will not disclosed any secrets to the enemy, regardless of whatever happens and I will fight to the end for the freedom of my country.”</span> <span id="s547">That was about it.</span> <span id="s548">I still remember it in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Can you say it in Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s551">And we did – not much, but we did get together once or twice a week and we talked and we collected arms and ammunition that was dropped by the Polish army, or by the Germans.</span> <span id="s552">We had a German light machine gun.</span> <span id="s553">We had a Polish light machine gun and we had a lot of rifles.</span> <span id="s554">I even found a six-shooter.</span> <span id="s555">It just – looked almost like a American six-shooter.</span> <span id="s556">Of course I gave it away to my commander later on, because he had to have a side-arms and I didn’t need to.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: How many people were in this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: There were 12 of us.</span> <span id="s559">Just a litt– from two small villages, from Lesnogóra and Zarnówka.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">And of course, the swearing ceremony was very young and moving, you know, in a cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">02:23:32</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Could you describe it?</span> <span id="s563">Was, was it at night?</span> <span id="s564">A: It was in the evening, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: What, what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Well, the commander came from somewhere, I don’t know where, we’re not supposed to know.</span> <span id="s567">And he administered the oath.</span> <span id="s568">You would swear upon your grandfather grave.</span> <span id="s569">And of course I wasn’t with it for too long, because I took a little side trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">13 Guardians of Poland (Polish)</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: So 12 young men got together and decided that they would fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s573">Just a bunch of kids shooting off their mouth.</span> <span id="s574">I have glaucoma on my eyes on occasionally.</span> <span id="s575">But it’s under control and my doctor says, “I’m going to make you see until you die.”</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Do you have any particular friends from that group of 12?</span> <span id="s577">Were they your – were they your–</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: All dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: All dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: None alive.</span> <span id="s581">Mostly were killed.</span> <span id="s582">Most of them were dead by 1943.</span> <span id="s583">Q: So what did you do?</span> <span id="s584">I mean, did you get into any –</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Well, see when I – when I took my little side trip, they were in their organization.</span> <span id="s586">They became an active, so-called active group.</span> <span id="s587">And they went on so-called wet works, attacking German patrols, German moving troops, German riding on a freeway toward the eastern front.</span> <span id="s588">And they did get mutilated.</span> <span id="s589">They got shot and killed and apprehended and killed in prisons and – out of those, I don’t think anybody is still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So, very quickly you formed a sort of a secret underground resistance group and then you awaited orders?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: We awaited orders.</span> <span id="s592">There were group in almost every small village.</span> <span id="s593">Every two villages they had a group.</span> <span id="s594">There was a overall command.</span> <span id="s595">We don’t know who they – we didn’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s596">They came for a visit, they announced, by runner they would come for a visit, we’ll talk to you and they came and talked and gave us instruction and send us trainers, who trained us for the things to come.</span> <span id="s597">But I took very little part in that, because I went on a trip east.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">02:26:39</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: We had relatives and – who were in the Soviet zone, so-called, and it was – well I called the, the man uncle, but he was just a distant relative, he was not an uncle.</span> <span id="s601">We had some family things to do.</span> <span id="s602">I brought some documents to him that he needed.</span> <span id="s603">And when I came, it was the night where they came.</span> <span id="s604">The Soviets NKWDcame with lists and took everybody who was anybody in the Polish administration, with their family.</span> <span id="s605">There was a</span></p> <p><span id="s606">14 NKVD judgment night in a marketplace.</span> <span id="s607">There was a town of about 18-20,000 people.</span> <span id="s608">They took 1,800 people.</span> <span id="s609">Men who were in administration, who were teachers or preachers or policemen or anybody who were representatives to Polish legislation.</span> <span id="s610">And the judgment time took about four and a half hours.</span> <span id="s611">It was about like 37 seconds per person.</span> <span id="s612">There were three men.</span> <span id="s613">There was a man sitting behind a table with a long list, civilian, kind of weasely little person.</span> <span id="s614">There was a man sitting in a middle and a big, Russian officer overcoat and a big hat, with a face, with a face – there’s a little Russian saying, “Morda kirpicha prosit.”</span> <span id="s615">“A face that asks for a brick.”</span> <span id="s616">He had a face like that.</span> <span id="s617">On the right hand of his, sat another civilian with a list, writing sentences.</span> <span id="s618">The person on the left, the group of people, or a family, or a person would came that he would look up his name on the list and he would tell – the person in middle that one looked up – and then he would said – would say, “Twelve and a half, five and five.</span> <span id="s619">Next.</span> <span id="s620">Fifteen, five and five.</span> <span id="s621">Next.”</span> <span id="s622">The one on the right would write a sentence.</span> <span id="s623">Twelve and a half or 15 or 20, means 12 and a half, 15 or 20 years of hard labor in a prison camp, in gulag, in most cases, in Siberia or Outer Mongolia or Kazakhstan.</span> <span id="s624">Five years of external exile, you could not come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Five more years of a loss of citizenship.</span> <span id="s626">“Next.”</span> <span id="s627">Some people questioned it.</span> <span id="s628">I said, “Sir, but I haven’t done anything.</span> <span id="s629">Why?”</span> <span id="s630">He said, “This is Soviet justice, you don’t question it, you questioned it.”</span> <span id="s631">“I haven’t done anything.”</span> <span id="s632">So, he said, “Well take him out and shoot him.”</span> <span id="s633">“Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s634">It’s all right, it’s all right, I’ll stay 15 years.</span> <span id="s635">I’ll se– I’ll serve 20 years.”</span></p> <p><span id="s636">02:30:06</span></p> <p><span id="s637">End of Tape#2 15 A mug that asks for a brick (Russian)</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Tape

<p><span id="s647">A: S-z-c-z-u-c-z-y-n.</span> <span id="s648">It was in eastern Poland and a little town.</span> <span id="s649">Q: And at that time controlled by the Soviets?</span></p> <p><span

mean when they came to my uncle’s pla– I mean to my relative place, said, “You are ready in 15 minutes, take whatever you can carry.</span> <span id="s654">Your wife, your daughter, your son and who is this?”</span> <span id="s655">I said, “Well, I am a distant relative, I am just visiting here.</span> <span id="s656">So my suitcase is still un– not unpacked, so I will just go.”</span> <span id="s657">“Where do you think you are going?”</span> <span id="s658">I said, “Well, I go back to a German – into German zone where I belong, where my family is.”</span> <span id="s659">“Oh no, you are relative?</span> <span id="s660">This is Soviet justice, you go with him.”</span> <span id="s661">“No, I’m not going.</span> <span id="s662">I’m going back home.”</span> <span id="s663">“Oh, you are

five and a half weeks.</span> <span id="s676">We went across the Soviet Union, we went across the Ural Mountains.</span> <span id="s677">We went at far – as far as the River Lena.</span> <span id="s678">It goes – I think it starts in a Balker – Bikal Seaand goes up into the North Sea.</span> <span id="s679">And then we went up the River Lena, some in a train, some in boats.</span> <span id="s680">We got to within a short distance from the Arctic Circle.</span> <span id="s681">We’re put in a camp and we felled trees.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">03:03:17</span></p> <p><span

that bunks were built.</span> <span id="s686">There was a pot-bellied stove that you could feed as much as you wanted to.</span> <span id="s687">And there were triple bunks and I don’t remember how many people, about 50 people in each car.</span> <span id="s688">You know, like that 18 men and fo– and – and six horses, or six horses.</span> <span id="s689">There were about 50 of us, I think about

then?</span> <span id="s693">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Were you scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s696">We stopped places, they gave us food sometime, there were Russian people who were a – on little stations looking and talking to us.</span> <span id="s697">And if we – some of us had some money, they wanted Polish money or they wanted goods.</span> <span id="s698">They figured a piece of clothes, they could get some good food.</span> <span id="s699">We bantered, we laughed, we sang a lot.</span> <span id="s700">It was just accomplished fact, nothing to do – you can do about it.</span> <span id="s701">The guards were not very bad.</span> <span id="s702">If you wanted to run away – if you tried to run away, they shot you.</span> <span id="s703">That’s about all they could do.</span> <span id="s704">They did not mistreat us.</span> <span id="s705">We just went like on a nice vacation.</span> <span id="s706">Slightly apprehensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Where – what did you think was going to happen?</span> <span id="s708">Where – did they tell you where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: We didn’t know a thing.</span> <span id="s710">We didn’t know a thing.</span> <span id="s711">They told us “Idyosh na poselenie.”</span> <span id="s712">You are being exiled.</span> <span id="s713">“Na poselenie.”</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Your parents didn’t know where you were?</span> <span id="s715">A: No.</span> <span id="s716">My parents knew I disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">16 Lake Bikal 17 You are going for settlement (Russian) 18 For settlement (Russian)</span></p> <p><span id="s718">03:05:56</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: So tell us what it was like when you did get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: We put in a – in a barracks.</span> <span id="s721">Some people were put in a tent, I was luc– because there were not enough cabins.</span> <span id="s722">They were log cabins like barracks.</span> <span id="s723">But we kept building more of these log cabins.</span> <span id="s724">There were two, big pot-bullied – bellied – pot-bellied stoves that we fed as much wood as we wanted to.</span> <span id="s725">If you were close to it, you were sizzling.</span> <span id="s726">If you got little away from it, you are freezing.</span> <span id="s727">You know it’s a nice cool place there, huh?</span> <span id="s728">Forty- five below zero, is nothing to it.</span> <span id="s729">It used to get to 72 below zero.</span> <span id="s730">We – it was 72 below zero and heavy wind, we did not have to go to work.</span> <span id="s731">So every night we would kneel down and say, “Good Lord, let it be 72 below zero tomorrow and heavy winds, so we stay in.”</span> <span id="s732">Well, if it was 71, nothing doing.</span> <span id="s733">If it was 72 and – and wind, you went anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Did you have warm clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: We had clothes that we came with and also they had the prison clothes, which is quilted kind of a gaber– I mean, kind of a poor material, like a – like a lining on a poor jacket, quilted, with a cotton in between.</span> <span id="s736">The down stuff is quite warm.</span> <span id="s737">And we had walonki, which were felt boots, which were issued to some of us.</span> <span id="s738">So you could survive.</span> <span id="s739">You could survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: So what did you think when you got there?</span> <span id="s741">I mean, what did you think was – was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: We thought that we will try to survive.</span> <span id="s743">Since they are not taking it – us out and shooting us offhand, as they frequently used to do, that we knew of.</span> <span id="s744">The damn Communists used to do that to people frequently.</span> <span id="s745">We thought that we would try to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">03:08:05</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: So what – what was a re – describe a regular day.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Waked up in su– before sunrise, counting – Appellcounting.</span> <span id="s749">You got a pot of tea, which was made out of birch leaves.</span> <span id="s750">You got a little, tiny piece of bread, maybe half an ounce or so.</span> <span id="s751">You ate it.</span> <span id="s752">Then you dressed up and you went walking.</span> <span id="s753">If you remember, about four or five years ago, where there was a Olympics in Sarajevo, they showed the Russian Siberian man, who was a weightlifter and a wrestler, how he ran a mile in the snow that deep?</span> <span id="s754">This is the snow we walked in.</span> <span id="s755">It was two guards and about 50 of us and we walked.</span> <span id="s756">And the person who walked ahead was changed every hundred feet or so.</span> <span id="s757">If, for – sometime for punishment, if they made one person walk all way, a mile or two or 19 Felt boots (Polish) 20 Roll call (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s758">three miles to the place of work.</span> <span id="s759">He – by the time he got there, he was dead – breaking the snow.</span> <span id="s760">So we went – we cut trees for about five hours, then came soup at noon.</span> <span id="s761">People came with sleds from a camp, with big kettles of fish and cabbage soup.</span> <span id="s762">It was mostly water.</span> <span id="s763">We sat down and ate the soup, then we cut tree – trees again and stacked them and came back.</span> <span id="s764">Six p.m., we started on the way home, we got there by seven or so.</span> <span id="s765">Were counted again, got another pot of tea and a little slice of bread and of course to sleep.</span> <span id="s766">We had a good guard.</span> <span id="s767">I mean he was a damn Soviet, but he was a good guy, the guard.</span> <span id="s768">I mean, he was just out of this world.</span> <span id="s769">When we did get there, said, “Tea.</span> <span id="s770">Make fire.”</span> <span id="s771">So we made fire.</span> <span id="s772">“Make big fire.</span> <span id="s773">Sit and rest.”</span> <span id="s774">So we sat around and rest.</span> <span id="s775">And he looked at his watch, he had a Polish watch that he stole during 1939 campaign, said “polsky chasy.”</span> <span id="s776">Polish watch runs well.</span> <span id="s777">“Go and cut.”</span> <span id="s778">So we went and cut for about, oh probably one hour.</span> <span id="s779">So then, “Hey, come on back.”</span> <span id="s780">So we came back.</span> <span id="s781">“Sit and rest.</span> <span id="s782">Soup coming.”</span> <span id="s783">Oh, in about one hour, soup came.</span> <span id="s784">“Eat.”</span> <span id="s785">We ate.</span> <span id="s786">“Sit and rest.”</span> <span id="s787">We sat and rest.</span> <span id="s788">“Go and cut.”</span> <span id="s789">So went and cut for about one hour.</span> <span id="s790">And he – then he went – came to us there where we were.</span> <span id="s791">“Now, go and steal.”</span> <span id="s792">So we went stealing.</span> <span id="s793">A prisoner had to cut a cubic yard of wood a day.</span> <span id="s794">And regardless how young, how strong, how big you were, you could never do it.</span> <span id="s795">If you didn’t cut a square yard per person, your group didn’t, at night your soup was cut, your bread was cut accordingly.</span> <span id="s796">Next day you were weaker.</span> <span id="s797">In a week you were gone.</span> <span id="s798">So we would go and steal the wood that we cut day before and day before and day before stack it up, he would measure it.</span> <span id="s799">“Okay, now we sit down and rest, we go home soon.</span> <span id="s800">Make bigger fire.”</span> <span id="s801">So we went home.</span> <span id="s802">That Ivan Ivanovich was a damn good man.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">03:11:47 Also, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s804">I spoke some English, I spoke some German.</span> <span id="s805">I spoke Russian quite well.</span> <span id="s806">When my father and mother wanted us kid not to know what was going on, they spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s807">My mother was a Russian teacher in middle school before she got married.</span> <span id="s808">My father was of course, Russian speaking person.</span> <span id="s809">So we kids learned it in a hurry.</span> <span id="s810">We knew exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s811">On the train for six weeks, by the time we got to Siberia, my Russian was almost as good as my English.</span> <span id="s812">Much more colorful because I knew a lot of swear words.</span> <span id="s813">So they found out and I was called to the commanders office and he said, “You stay here, you translate.”</span> <span id="s814">And he got the German word, “You dolmetscher.”</span> <span id="s815">“You interpreter.”</span> <span id="s816">I don’t know how he got that German word, I knew what it was, but “You dolmetscher.”</span> <span id="s817">When new prisoners came, I would get up on that barrel and I would shout, “His Excellency, Commander so and so says this and says that and says that.</span> <span id="s818">You don’t do this, you don’t do that.</span> <span id="s819">You get shot for this, you get in solitary for that.</span> <span id="s820">You get hunged up for this.</span> <span id="s821">So remember.”</span> <span id="s822">And of course, after a few days, I – one time a group of Czechs came and I got up on the barrel and I became kind of – took it for granted, became rambunctious – young, stupid kid.</span> <span id="s823">And I said, “Commander Mika-Mikhail Ivishenerovich, that son of a dog says this and this and 21 Polish watch (Russian)</span></p> <p><span id="s824">22 Interpreter (German) this.”</span> <span id="s825">And in Polish it’s skurwysyn,in Russian, it’s sukin-syn.</span> <span id="s826">In English, of course, you know what it is.</span> <span id="s827">So he came and he knocked me down and he kicked me.</span> <span id="s828">Said, “You little so and so, you called me sukin-syn.”</span> <span id="s829">Said, “I called you Excellency, and Excellency in Polish – in Czech, and sukin-syn sounds almost close together.</span> <span id="s830">I call you Excellency.”</span> <span id="s831">“Oh no, I know Polish and I know Czech, you call me sukin-syn.</span> <span id="s832">If you say that again, I’ll shoot you, you little so and so.”</span> <span id="s833">Said, “Commander, I did not say it, but I will not sa– ever say it again if I did.”</span> <span id="s834">I thought my goose was cooked, but it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s835">So I stayed in barrack, I peeled potatoes, I swept the barracks.</span> <span id="s836">I had a norm man, a man who wrote the norms for the people, what people did during the day.</span> <span id="s837">I helped him do the norms.</span> <span id="s838">The classification, how much soup at night everybody gets.</span> <span id="s839">And I learn how to cheat, how to write up – how to cheat so that people made more than they did.</span> <span id="s840">Anyway, I made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">03:15:12</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: You were with your family still, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: I was with – I was with my family still.</span> <span id="s844">About 11 months later, when Hitler attacked the Soviets, Polish und– government in exile in London, negotiated with Stalin and those of us who received less than 50 years were – 15 years, were released.</span> <span id="s845">So my little cousin girl and I were released.</span> <span id="s846">It did not make any difference to my uncle, because he was dead.</span> <span id="s847">My aunt was dead.</span> <span id="s848">Their son – who was as big as this young man, and strong and sportsman, he was dead.</span> <span id="s849">Two little weasel-y thing, that little girl and I were still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: How did they die?</span> <span id="s851">Did they die in – in the work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Died hard – hard work.</span> <span id="s853">Mistreatment, beating occasionally.</span> <span id="s854">Some guards were vicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Some guards were not as good as Ivan Ivanovich.</span> <span id="s856">I still say a prayer for him occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: For him?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: For him.</span> <span id="s859">We did get out.</span> <span id="s860">We were allowed to go to southern part of Russia, where Poles are being collected and Polish army, to fight with the Soviets against the Germans, was formed.</span> <span id="s861">Some of us crossed into Iran.</span> <span id="s862">The Soviets had a hard time taking care of all of us.</span> <span id="s863">Iran was run by the Russians and the British.</span> <span id="s864">We did sneak into the British part.</span> <span id="s865">The British trained us, armed us, fed us – formed Polish second corps under Polish General Anders.They went to fight in North Africa.</span> <span id="s866">In Egypt, North Africa, all way to Tripoli.</span> <span id="s867">Later on they went fighting in Italy, all way to Monte Cassino.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: At this point were you still with your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">23 Son of a whore (Polish) 24 Son of a bitch (Russian) 25 Gen. Wladyslaw Anders</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: My cousin – women and – and children were bundled up and sent to India and South Africa.</span> <span id="s871">They build camps for them to stay for duration.</span> <span id="s872">After the war, they were all sent back to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">03:17:42</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: How was your strength after 11 months?</span> <span id="s875">Your strength?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Mine was all right.</span> <span id="s877">I had enough to eat.</span> <span id="s878">I had a sideline.</span> <span id="s879">After about seven weeks there, I was allowed to go out.</span> <span id="s880">There was a little settlement, winter settlement.</span> <span id="s881">They wer– they were the Samoyed people.</span> <span id="s882">Siberian people like American Eskimos.</span> <span id="s883">Samoyed people raised reindeer and fished.</span> <span id="s884">So I went and wandered around and a young boy came and talked to me, he said, “Who you are?”</span> <span id="s885">“Kto vy takoy?”</span> <span id="s886">So I said, “Well, I am Polish.”</span> <span id="s887">And, “Chto eto takoy?”</span> <span id="s888">“What is that?”</span> <span id="s889">Said, “Well, I am from a country way, way west.</span> <span id="s890">Just like your Samoyed country, the damn Soviets took us over, they took you over and beat the bejesus out of us and sent us here to work in a camp.”</span> <span id="s891">“Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s892">You hungry?”</span> <span id="s893">“Of course I’m hungry.”</span> <span id="s894">“Come and eat.”</span> <span id="s895">And Samoyed build, build – live-in yurtas.</span> <span id="s896">Yurta is a kind of a conical tent made of bearskins, double bearskin – four out and four in.</span> <span id="s897">And it’s kind of a good size, about the size of this living room here, about 12, 15 feet in diameter.</span> <span id="s898">But if you get into the yurta, if you – they use a – long handed hatchets, like American Indian tomahawks.</span> <span id="s899">If you pick up the hatchet and put it like this and take your hand off, the hatchet will stay there, the air is so thick.</span> <span id="s900">The Samoyed had people wash twice a year, if they have to or not.</span> <span id="s901">And they cook, they sleep, they make babies, they do everything in the yurta.</span> <span id="s902">I mean the smell is overpowering.</span> <span id="s903">But they say, “Never mind, pribyknyesh– you get used to it.”</span> <span id="s904">So I ate a lot of fish and the young man said, “You come tomorrow?”</span> <span id="s905">“If I can, I come tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s906">So he gave me some fish, I took the fish to the camp.</span> <span id="s907">I shared some with the guards, I shared some with fellow prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">03:20:16 Next day I couldn’t go, so third day I went and, “What is your name?”</span> <span id="s909">“Stefan.”</span> <span id="s910">“We call you Stepka.</span> <span id="s911">Khorosho, kak Vas velichat’?”</span> <span id="s912">“How do we call you?”</span> <span id="s913">Velichat’it means, you use you name, your father’s name.</span> <span id="s914">So I said my father was Jana.</span> <span id="s915">“Okay, Stepka Ivanovich, come on and eat.”</span> <span id="s916">So we ate.</span> <span id="s917">“Yi– How much time do you have?”</span> <span id="s918">“Oh, some time.”</span> <span id="s919">“We’ll go fishing.”</span> <span id="s920">So we went fishing.</span> <span id="s921">So they gave me – gave me harpoon and we walked, on the River Lena.</span> <span id="s922">And I fell in.</span> <span id="s923">I didn’t know what was what.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">River Lena is a very brisk river.</span> <span id="s925">The ice that time was probably 20 feet thick, but there 26 Who are you such?</span> <span id="s926">(Russian) 27 What is that such?</span> <span id="s927">(Russian) 28 You get accustomed (Russian) 29 Good, what are you called?</span> <span id="s928">(Russian) 30 To be called by name (Russian) were wash-outs, little bubbles.</span> <span id="s929">If you step on the bubble, you go in.</span> <span id="s930">I was lucky, I had the harpoon.</span> <span id="s931">So I fell only in – that way I got wet.</span> <span id="s932">It was not very cold, just about maybe 25 below zero.</span> <span id="s933">So two of them grabbed me and ran back – ran to the – back to the yurta where I s – I stripped.</span> <span id="s934">And he said, “Well, I loan you my suit.”</span> <span id="s935">His suit was made of silver foxes.</span> <span id="s936">Big pants up to here and a big parka, with a big, huge hood – silver fox outfit, and reindeer.</span> <span id="s937">It was soft as silk.</span> <span id="s938">Because this man had three suits and he had three wives.</span> <span id="s939">Good Siberian women can make only one suit at a time.</span> <span id="s940">She has to chew the skin.</span> <span id="s941">Siberian wives has teeth just about three millimeters long, where they constantly chew the skin.</span> <span id="s942">You – you tan it and then you invert it and you chew the inside of it to make it soft, and becomes – either the chewing process or the saliva makes it as soft as silk.</span> <span id="s943">So I wore his suit.</span> <span id="s944">Went fishing again, we caught some sturgeon.</span> <span id="s945">They made a hole in a bubble, we got some sturgeon, we came back.</span> <span id="s946">We cooked some fish, we ate some fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">My suit was still wet so he said, “You wear my suit.”</span> <span id="s948">So I went.</span> <span id="s949">I was the best dressed prisoner in the whole damn Soviet system.</span> <span id="s950">I came, everybody’s oh-ing and oo-ing and the guards and especially the chachainsis.There were bunch of chachainsis.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Chachainsis is a bunch – a bunch of son of a guns.</span> <span id="s952">They are cutthroats, they are thieves, they are murderers, everything.</span> <span id="s953">They kept looking.</span> <span id="s954">“Oh, too bad he is so small.</span> <span id="s955">Oh, too bad he is so small.</span> <span id="s956">We would take it off you.”</span> <span id="s957">“You wouldn’t take it off me.”</span> <span id="s958">“I wouldn’t?”</span> <span id="s959">I said that, “What would you do to me?”</span> <span id="s960">“Cut your head off, you stupid so and so.”</span> <span id="s961">“You little so and so, you would cut my head off?</span> <span id="s962">We cut your head off.”</span> <span id="s963">They frequently would – if somebody wa– had something they didn’t– didn’t want to give, they would come and cut his head off at night and took whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s964">Anyway, they became my friends and protectors.</span> <span id="s965">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s966">I was just like a, like a little to– a flea, in comparison with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">03:23:50</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Did you get to keep the suit?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Of co – oh I kept it for duration.</span> <span id="s970">Later on, that man said – well he was a chief’s son, he had three suits and three wives and 700 reindeer.</span> <span id="s971">So he said, “Well, I got enough, two suits, you can – Stepka, you’re my brother, you wear my suit.”</span> <span id="s972">So I wore his suit for the duration.</span> <span id="s973">And when I – I was ready to leave, I went to visit him and he said, “Well, you’re going to stay with us – I mean all the time, stay with us.</span> <span id="s974">You can marry one my sister, you can marry two my sisters.</span> <span id="s975">You can marry three of my sisters if you want to.</span> <span id="s976">You my brother, you stay with us.”</span> <span id="s977">So when I went to say goodbye, I brought his suit back.</span> <span id="s978">I said, “I’m sorry, I have to leave.</span> <span id="s979">I want to go and fight for my country.”</span> <span id="s980">So we had a good cry and I went away.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: What was his name?</span> <span id="s982">A: Was –</span></p> <p><span id="s983">31 Chechens (Russian)</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: His name?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Krugly.That means the round one, Krugly.</span> <span id="s986">I could not pronounce his Samoyed name, but he was Krugly, the round one.</span> <span id="s987">He was a tough, young Samoyed, with three wives.</span> <span id="s988">He didn’t have any children yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: So you knew when you left that you would probably go back to your country and try to fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: I hoped so, I hoped so.</span> <span id="s991">Well, we’re told by the political officer, by the politrukin a camp that, “You are going to join Polish forces, you are going to join our victorious Red Army – are going to fight the damn Germans.”</span></p> <p><span id="s992">03:25:59 [Technical conversation] End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s993">32 Round (Russian) 33 Political instructor (Russian)</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s995">[Technical conversation] 04:02:54</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s997">It is April 8, 1998.</span> <span id="s998">We are outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s999">This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape number four.</span> <span id="s1000">If we could start with the last day or two before you left the Soviet work camp, how did you find out you were leaving?</span> <span id="s1001">How did you leave?</span> <span id="s1002">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: It took about say a we – about a week before we could leave.</span> <span id="s1004">We were – there was an announcement, you know, in a square, very official – lot of high rank officers came and said, “We did not want to hurt you – you – we knew that you are our friends and now – from now on we will be allies and you are going to fight the – fight the German aggressor, so and so and so.</span> <span id="s1005">And those of you who are not really criminals, traitors and all – all of us were tr– tried under clause of high treason, paragraph 150.</span> <span id="s1006">Even I was under high treason – 150, 150 sub-paragraph – subparagraph 12, subparagraph 17 – high treason.</span> <span id="s1007">What for?</span> <span id="s1008">Anyway, it took us about a week before they went – we went down the Lena river.</span> <span id="s1009">We were up the ri– Lena river.</span> <span id="s1010">And then we got on the train and we got collected – assembled on – close to Iranian border.</span> <span id="s1011">And there was such a multitude of us, they couldn’t take care of us.</span> <span id="s1012">So they said, “If you want to volunteer and go across there, we have our people there, too.”</span> <span id="s1013">So we sneaked – we went across and then we sneaked into the British part.</span> <span id="s1014">And of course, British were forming Polish army and everybody who was anybody wanted to join it.</span> <span id="s1015">Instead of joining those damn Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Did you say goodbye to your cousin?</span> <span id="s1017">Did you realize you might not see her for awhile?</span> <span id="s1018">A: Yes, we said goodbye and she was whisked away.</span> <span id="s1019">In about – after we moved to the British zone there, we were together for about a week.</span> <span id="s1020">And we – they collected all women and children and she went to India.</span> <span id="s1021">Some went to South Africa, but she stayed in India for the duration of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: And when you say – tell us a little bit more about sneaking into the British side.</span> <span id="s1023">Who did you do it with, was it a – a night that you did it?</span> <span id="s1024">And how did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Well, we just – actually, we just walked.</span> <span id="s1026">And the Soviets stopped some groups.</span> <span id="s1027">Some groups were not even bothered with.</span> <span id="s1028">Especially groups that had women and children and they didn’t want to bother with.</span> <span id="s1029">We just walked and hoped for the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">04:05:50</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: So if you – if you could just describe it for us.</span> <span id="s1032">Where did you walk to and – and when – I mean, where did you spend the night, how did you find the British officials?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yeah, it was close to – it were close to Teheran, it was west of Teheran.</span> <span id="s1034">It was kind of a desert area and there was some local people who traveled with herds of sheep and such, from place to place, so we would stay overnight with them.</span> <span id="s1035">We just sleep outside, it was – you know, subtropics, it was warm and the – the British built camps already, so we went to the camp that was built for the refugees, by the British.</span> <span id="s1036">And of course, pretty soon they started asking young men to come to lectures and come to training and, “Do you want to fight?”</span> <span id="s1037">“Of course, what do you think?</span> <span id="s1038">I’m going – I came here for it.”</span> <span id="s1039">And many people joined.</span> <span id="s1040">And then I don’t know if I want to divert.</span> <span id="s1041">I think I will have to divert back, before I – I left Siberia.</span> <span id="s1042">About six months after we be – were there, they fished out 17 young boys, between 16 and 19.</span> <span id="s1043">And I was one of them and we went through a heavy indoctrination course.</span> <span id="s1044">Eight, 10, 12 weeks, eight hours a day.</span> <span id="s1045">Heavy indoctrination course.</span> <span id="s1046">And if you – if I get the three of you in a secluded place, that you are not allowed to leave, in about two weeks, you’ll believe any – everything that I will tell you.</span> <span id="s1047">They – there’s nothing better than Communism.</span> <span id="s1048">Dialectical materialism is the only doctrine that works among peoples.</span> <span id="s1049">Soviet Russia is the most powerful, most wise, most – the best of all, the richest.</span> <span id="s1050">We have the riches in Siberia that you never heard of.</span> <span id="s1051">We have enormous Ukrainian plains that we can – if we – planting our grain, we can s – we can feed the whole world.</span> <span id="s1052">This is the best.</span> <span id="s1053">You had to listen closely, you have to listen attentively.</span> <span id="s1054">If you smirked, if you made a face, if you make a funny remark, you were thrown – your shoes were taken, your jacket was taken, you were thrown into solitary, which was six – what – four by four feet.</span> <span id="s1055">Your shoes were taken, too, overnight.</span> <span id="s1056">You had to dance, jump, run all night.</span> <span id="s1057">If you sat down, you never waked up.</span> <span id="s1058">Well, I was lucky, I spent only three nights.</span> <span id="s1059">I couldn’t keep my tongue.</span> <span id="s1060">I mean I couldn’t keep my mouth shut.</span> <span id="s1061">I had to make remarks.</span> <span id="s1062">I made faces, I laughed in his face, the politruk was a big man, had a face that was asking for a brick, too.</span> <span id="s1063">I just sm– laughed in his face.</span> <span id="s1064">And I told him once, “How little you know.”</span> <span id="s1065">So he was lenient with me, but still he, still he throw me in, in the solitary, one night at a time.</span> <span id="s1066">If you spent two nights, you didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1067">Some people – there were a few people who made it for two nights.</span> <span id="s1068">Three nights nobody made, in a row.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">04:09:33 Anyway, by the time we graduated, we had a talk, 45 minute talk.</span> <span id="s1070">And if you missed two words, you were thrown into solitary, had to repeat it.</span> <span id="s1071">You had to give a lecture that told everything about the dialect – dialectical materialism.</span> <span id="s1072">You knew all about Engels you knew all about Marx.You knew everything about Lenin.And you most about Stalin.I mean those were the holy – not a trinity, but a quadruplinity.</span> <span id="s1073">And you had to talk about them in glowing terms.</span> <span id="s1074">Your tone of your voice had to be just like a great</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">34 Friedrich Engels</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">35 Karl Marx 36 Vladimir Ilich Lenin</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">37 Joseph Stalin sermon on a mount.</span> <span id="s1078">And you know, by the – by the end of it, I believed, strongly.</span> <span id="s1079">I became a honest to goodness believer.</span> <span id="s1080">So when we were later let go and I think it was somewhat with premeditation that this little group was let go into the British part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Because we going to be the avant-garde of Communism.</span> <span id="s1082">We are going to get introduced into armed forces or whatever groups there were and we’re going to propagate it by going – we are going to be the true believers.</span> <span id="s1083">And there – for some way or another, the British knew it.</span> <span id="s1084">They collected us again.</span> <span id="s1085">We went through a heavy indoctrination by the Polish political officers, by the British, who some spoke Polish, some worked with the translators.</span> <span id="s1086">In about three weeks we lost the faith.</span> <span id="s1087">We lost the true faith.</span> <span id="s1088">And then they formed the armed forces.</span> <span id="s1089">Yes, let’s say they went to fight, they fought, fought all way to Monte Cassino.</span> <span id="s1090">By Monte Cassino – when they took Monte Cassino, the second Polish corps – after British and the Australians and the Americans couldn’t take it, they were so bloodied, they were sent to recuperation–</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">04:11:40</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Remind me where we are at this point.</span> <span id="s1093">I know where we are, but I mean, what year is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">You’re now – it’s–</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: It was 1941.</span> <span id="s1096">1941 summer–</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: And you’re outside of Teheran?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Out of Teheran, last – late summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: And you’re getting – you’re getting training from British and from Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: …and from Polish, we’re getting training.</span> <span id="s1101">So my 17 were re-indoctrinated, re- brainwashed and trained in sabotage and demolition.</span> <span id="s1102">The whole 17.</span> <span id="s1103">They were bright ki– I mean, of course we were bright kids.</span> <span id="s1104">We got to brag about it a lot, I mean we used to brag a lot about it.</span> <span id="s1105">“We are the best of the best.”</span> <span id="s1106">Were trained in sabotage and demolition and the underground work.</span> <span id="s1107">We were put in small groups.</span> <span id="s1108">We went back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Before we go back to Poland, I want to know a little bit more about what the training was like.</span> <span id="s1110">Take us through a day of training.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: The training was in the morning, was calisthenics.</span> <span id="s1112">There was a five mile run.</span> <span id="s1113">There were four hours of lectures, in – mostly about small arms training and the firefights.</span> <span id="s1114">Mostly firefights, being surrounded – being surrounded by a superior group and getting out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Constantly, constantly, constantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">04:13:10</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: You mean how to escape when you’re surrounded?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: How, how to fight your way out.</span> <span id="s1119">How to fight your way out.</span> <span id="s1120">Then in afternoon was another lecture, which was a political lecture, whom we have to fight.</span> <span id="s1121">Then of course, kind of a – the lecture would, would tell about how we do fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s1122">“But, if you want to, you can fight the damn Russians, too.”</span> <span id="s1123">And by nightfall, you fell sleepy, you fell off your feet, you slept.</span> <span id="s1124">And the same and the same.</span> <span id="s1125">And then sabotage, blowing up bridges, blowing up trains, blowing up buildings.</span> <span id="s1126">Demolishing rail – train tracks, if you did not have explosives.</span> <span id="s1127">And a lot – a lot of training with semi and automatic weapons.</span> <span id="s1128">It was a time when the British introduced a sten gun and we trained a lot with the sten guns.</span> <span id="s1129">We trained little with regular rifles, but they said, “When you get there, we will provide you with sten guns, you will have a lot of firepower.”</span> <span id="s1130">And a sten gun is similar to American Thompson submachine gun.</span> <span id="s1131">But it’s a piece of junk, actually.</span> <span id="s1132">You shoot about 1700 rounds and you throw it away, because after 1700 rounds, becomes more dangerous to you than to your pos– opponent.</span> <span id="s1133">Anyway, seven of us went on a trip.</span> <span id="s1134">We walked, we rode trains, we hitched up rides on the tracks.</span> <span id="s1135">We rode donkeys most of the time.</span> <span id="s1136">We went through the western Iran, into northern Iraq.</span> <span id="s1137">We went through the Kurdistan.</span> <span id="s1138">By the way, the Kurdish people are the greatest people ever.</span> <span id="s1139">They can cut your head off, if you have – if you have something they like, but if you come in, it is so much like in – in Poland, “Guest in, God in.”</span> <span id="s1140">They treat you like you were a god visit-visiting them.</span> <span id="s1141">They give you food.</span> <span id="s1142">They give you – what they have, they share with you.</span> <span id="s1143">If you are ragged, they will give you shirt or pair of pants.</span> <span id="s1144">But don’t look at anything good they have, because they will give it to you.</span> <span id="s1145">If you look at something, “Oh gee, this is so neat.”</span> <span id="s1146">They will let you sleep with his – with his wife if you like her.</span> <span id="s1147">But you get out of a tent, they will follow you, cut your head off and take the stuff back.</span> <span id="s1148">So we’re told, “Be careful with the Kurds.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">04:16:00 Anyway, we walked through part of Turkey, we diverted into Syria and backed in Anatolia, Turkey, Anatolia.</span> <span id="s1150">We did come to Bosporus Straits and we were kind of pursued at that time, we knew something was happening.</span> <span id="s1151">We were being hunted.</span> <span id="s1152">So we met a old fisherman on the Bosporus and he spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s1153">He was an old Turk who spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s1154">And said, “Grandpa, please take us across.”</span> <span id="s1155">And he said, “Lords, night is falling, there’s going to be storm tonight, we cannot get a – go across.”</span> <span id="s1156">“Grandpa, please take us across, because we – if we don’t leave here tonight, we may not be alive tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1157">We know something is happening.”</span> <span id="s1158">The German had a Intelligence pe– Intelligence people in Turkey and they organized pursuit parties, we overheard before then.</span> <span id="s1159">So he said, “Well, Lords, I’m old, my boat is leaky and if you want to risk, what am I to say?”</span> <span id="s1160">So we said, “Grandpa, we’ll pay you.”</span> <span id="s1161">“I don’t want to be paid.”</span> <span id="s1162">So we said, “Grandpa, we’ll give you the donkeys.”</span> <span id="s1163">“Donkeys, they’re not worth anything.</span> <span id="s1164">They are worn up completely.”</span> <span id="s1165">Said, “Grandpa, you give them on a p – good grass, they’ll be as good as new in two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s1166">Leave them here.”</span> <span id="s1167">We got in the boat, he gave each a – each one of us a piece of rope.</span> <span id="s1168">“Tie yourself ti– s – well.”</span> <span id="s1169">Storm came.</span> <span id="s1170">It was the scariest five hours I lived in my life – scariest.</span> <span id="s1171">I was in dark places, but this was the worst.</span> <span id="s1172">I think I fell out about four times.</span> <span id="s1173">If it wasn’t for rope, I wouldn’t be talking to you tonight.</span> <span id="s1174">The Mediterranean fish would have eaten me up.</span> <span id="s1175">Anyway, we did get to the Turkish side on the north side of – it was almost morning.</span> <span id="s1176">Beautiful, quiet, sun was coming up.</span> <span id="s1177">And the old Ismael said, “Lords, the Allah was with you.</span> <span id="s1178">I don’t want to be paid.”</span> <span id="s1179">But before we left, the British gave us some gold pieces.</span> <span id="s1180">“Case you’re in a tight spot, trading, whatever.”</span> <span id="s1181">So we said, “Grandpa, we don’t want to pay you, we just want to give you baksheesh, a gift from the heart.”</span> <span id="s1182">And each one of us gave him a gold piece.</span> <span id="s1183">He looked, said, “Oh my Allah.</span> <span id="s1184">My granddaughter will get married, my younger daughter will get married, my grandson get married, I can pay dowry to every one of them and I’m going to live high on the hog for the rest of my days.”</span> <span id="s1185">He got in his boat and a little breeze came, he just zoomed out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">04:19:05 And we walked across a part of Turkey, went into Bulgaria, we caught rides on trains – tracks, we head into Romania.</span> <span id="s1187">We sneaked into Nazi occupied Poland.</span> <span id="s1188">You know, the front li– eastern front was way, way out.</span> <span id="s1189">By that time, on Polish territory, the Germans developed Einsatzgruppen,special forces.</span> <span id="s1190">They call them Einsatzgruppen or Vernichtungsgruppen,the exterminators.</span> <span id="s1191">So they were killing lot of Jewish people and they were killing all the Jewish people they could find.</span> <span id="s1192">And they were killing a lot of Polish people.</span> <span id="s1193">So the Polish underground suffered for a time.</span> <span id="s1194">But then, when we came, they provided us with arms and ammunition and some unstable Polish dynamite.</span> <span id="s1195">And we each one of us – I was given 17 people.</span> <span id="s1196">Seventeen plus two, plus – plus me.</span> <span id="s1197">That were 20 people.</span> <span id="s1198">And we became the exterminators of exterminators.</span> <span id="s1199">We would create false alarms.</span> <span id="s1200">Because when something happen in certain village or little town, they would just swoop upon it.</span> <span id="s1201">They – those groups were about 100, 75 to 125 in each group.</span> <span id="s1202">They would swoop around, swoop in, surround it, burn it down, kill everybody.</span> <span id="s1203">That was their standard procedure.</span> <span id="s1204">And when they went to a ghetto, they would just kill all the Jewish people in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1205">Of course, ghettos were already fenced in – barbed wired in.</span> <span id="s1206">So we did few things with them and we blew up – we could not blow up – blow up complete bridge, but we blew up parts of a bridge.</span> <span id="s1207">We demolished a lot of railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s1208">We blew up some trains when we had explosives.</span> <span id="s1209">And I was – oh, my gosh, my commander was a I still don’t know his name.</span> <span id="s1210">His name was, was “B. Dab” – “B. the Old Oak.”</span> <span id="s1211">He said, “You little shit, I’m going to shoot you, I’m going to court martial you, you missed it.”</span> <span id="s1212">I would sit in a field with the two wires and a battery, holding here and I would touch it and the damn thing would not explode and the train would go by.</span> <span id="s1213">Or sometime I would blow it up before the train came.</span> <span id="s1214">So after each incident – mishap like this, he would gave me a dressing and threaten me with, with an execution and court martial and God knows what.</span> <span id="s1215">He was a big, fat man with a very sharp temper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">38 Task forces (German); mobile killing units, employed especially in the destruction of the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">39 Annihilation group (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">04:22:03 And we slept in bunks.</span> <span id="s1219">We slept on farms that were far away from habitations.</span> <span id="s1220">We had dugouts in half a dozen different forests.</span> <span id="s1221">Run around constantly.</span> <span id="s1222">We did get surrounded a lot of times.</span> <span id="s1223">We had to fight – were in lot of firefights with those groups.</span> <span id="s1224">Were surrounded frequently by them and had to fight our way out.</span> <span id="s1225">And about – in 1943, it was ‘42, fall and winter when we started.</span> <span id="s1226">Forty-three, in late spring, we hijacked German army bank on a street of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1227">We lost three people out of about 25 or 30 that were – but we got a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1228">We got about 15 million marks.</span> <span id="s1229">Each one was – one of us was given a bonus, and you were given operating expenses.</span> <span id="s1230">I think we – my group got about half a million marks.</span> <span id="s1231">And I had a drinking buddy, who was a young, German soldier, supply officer.</span> <span id="s1232">So we had drinks, we met few times.</span> <span id="s1233">I introduced him to some Polish girls.</span> <span id="s1234">And we talked and he sold me about over 100 Schmeissers.</span> <span id="s1235">Schmeisser is a light, automatic weapon, similar to American Thompson submachine gun, but much, much more effective.</span> <span id="s1236">Much more effective.</span> <span id="s1237">And I don’t know how many, probably about 12, 15 million rounds of ammunition.</span> <span id="s1238">So from then on, my little group of 17 plus three were carrying 27 Schmeissers, because some of the boys said, “I don’t trust that damn German weapon, I want to carry two.”</span> <span id="s1239">So I said, “Well, you know, we have a – we join – we shared those with some other groups, but we have plenty of it in places, hidden places.</span> <span id="s1240">If you want to carry 17 extra pounds, what am I to say?</span> <span id="s1241">Go ahead, be my guest.”</span> <span id="s1242">The German groups – ordinarily each squad had one Schmeisser and the rest of them had manual Mauser rifles.</span> <span id="s1243">So when we – from then on, we – on purpose, did – when it cato– came to firefight, let ourselves be surrounded.</span> <span id="s1244">And then when we opened up, we went just like a hot knife through a piece of butter.</span> <span id="s1245">They had to keep their heads down, or they lost them.</span> <span id="s1246">And anybody who stuck their head up did not get up again.</span> <span id="s1247">So we went out and went out and went out and – course we were losing people.</span> <span id="s1248">At the start we lost like 11 people in two months.</span> <span id="s1249">So the boys who were in my group said, “What do we do?”</span> <span id="s1250">I said, “Well, I tried to train you, you refused to be trained.</span> <span id="s1251">You think you know everything.</span> <span id="s1252">You were as full of beans, you want to fight, well do – surely we fight, but are going to lose people constantly if you don’t want to train.”</span> <span id="s1253">So they said, “Do anything that – to train us.”</span> <span id="s1254">So we did.</span> <span id="s1255">For about four weeks, we got the guts out of ourselves.</span> <span id="s1256">We did it the British way.</span> <span id="s1257">The way the British Major Thompson did to us, we did to ourselves.</span> <span id="s1258">From then on we became almost invincible.</span> <span id="s1259">We would lose a person from time to time, but very, very seldom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">04:26:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: You took some time and sort of dropped back in the countryside and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: We drop back to countryside, we took a week or two off, then we – most of the time we found the places we wanted to take care of ourselves.</span> <span id="s1263">Sometime our commander would contact us and gave us – gave us an order to do this or to do that.</span> <span id="s1264">And there was a – one of the Eisengrupp – Eisens – Eis – Einsatzgruppen in neighborhood where my – not exactly my own family neighborhood, but close by.</span> <span id="s1265">It was in a town called Biala Podlaska.</span> <span id="s1266">It was about 100 kilometers east of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1267">There was the group that was large, it was very well entrenched.</span> <span id="s1268">Very, very foxy, we just couldn’t do anything to them.</span> <span id="s1269">So he called me the carpet and he said, “You are supposed to take care of that group.</span> <span id="s1270">You don’t sa– you don’t have to kill all of them, but really give them a good thrashing.”</span> <span id="s1271">I said, “Commander, I tried – we tried everything, I tried everything, nothing works.”</span> <span id="s1272">Said, “You have to do something.”</span> <span id="s1273">“They are entrenched.</span> <span id="s1274">They stay in a solid building, which used to be monastery, with a great gate.</span> <span id="s1275">They built a wall around, there’s some barbed wire on the top of it.</span> <span id="s1276">There’s electricity in the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1277">We just can’t touch them.”</span> <span id="s1278">So he said, “Well, we can, come on here.”</span> <span id="s1279">Led me to the next room, open a wardrobe and he said, “Look at this.</span> <span id="s1280">You see this nice, little Hitlerjugenduniform?”</span> <span id="s1281">And I said, “Oh, no you don’t.”</span> <span id="s1282">Said, “Oh yes, I do.”</span> <span id="s1283">And as you can see, I was a little blonde boy – little blonde boy, this one on the right.</span> <span id="s1284">This one here, with blue eyes and very, very bleached, bleached hair.</span> <span id="s1285">So he said, “Put it on.”</span> <span id="s1286">So I put the thing, fitted me just right and a little – little – little jacket, shorts, you know.</span> <span id="s1287">High socks, hobnail boots, little dagger, little hat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Said, “There, you look like a damn German Hitlerjugend.”</span> <span id="s1289">So I didn’t have much choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">04:28:40 In the afternoon, the boys brought me within about two or three blocks from that monastery.</span> <span id="s1291">I just walked toward the gates, there were two burly SS men with the Schmeissers standing by the gate.</span> <span id="s1292">And I said, “Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler.Wie geht’s denn, Junge” “Ganz gut.</span> <span id="s1293">“How are you young man?”</span> <span id="s1294">“Very well.”</span> <span id="s1295">“Wie geht’s denn, Herr Oberst.”</span> <span id="s1296">How about you, Commander?</span> <span id="s1297">“Ganz gut.”</span> <span id="s1298">So I said, “I - Ich wünschte mit ihre officer gesprochen.”</span> <span id="s1299">I want to speak to your officer, your commander here.</span> <span id="s1300">“Weiter- weitermachen.”</span> <span id="s1301">“Go right in.”</span> <span id="s1302">So I went in, I went through the corridors, I went up the steps, I went to the back there and there was an outside window, I unlatched the window.</span> <span id="s1303">I went downstairs again, I went to the back and I notice there’s a gate there with a bolt, so I pulled the bolt slowly out.</span> <span id="s1304">Then I went to the corr– second floor again – again had to go to second floor to go to the front, so I walked.</span> <span id="s1305">There was some secretaries running out and some officers running back and forth.</span> <span id="s1306">“Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler, Junge.Wie geht’s.”</span> <span id="s1307">I walked out.</span> <span id="s1308">Said, “Auf wiedersehen,” to those nice, two, big son of a so and so in the front.</span> <span id="s1309">Walked out to the corner, walked beyond – about a block away, the boys are waiting with the car, they grabbed me, we ran away.</span> <span id="s1310">I was so mad at myself.</span> <span id="s1311">I wet my 40 Hitler youth (German); Nazi youth organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">41 Hail Hitler (German) 42 How are you then, young man?</span> <span id="s1313">(German) 43 Very good (German) 44 How are you then, Mr. Colonel?</span> <span id="s1314">(German) 45 I wish to spoke [sic] with your officer.</span> <span id="s1315">(German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">46 Continue (German) 47 Young man (German) 48 How are you?</span> <span id="s1317">(German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">49 Good-bye (German) pants.</span> <span id="s1319">My pants were wet, my socks were wet, my shoes were squelching.</span> <span id="s1320">I must have been afraid.</span> <span id="s1321">And strange enough, I was in tougher places.</span> <span id="s1322">I was being shot at, I was being hit, I was being mutilated, practically, but this must have been scary time that I had had.</span> <span id="s1323">Was first and the last time that I wetted my pants.</span> <span id="s1324">That night we came in and the commander came with us.</span> <span id="s1325">B. Dab came with us.</span> <span id="s1326">He said, “You know where everything is, so you go in.”</span> <span id="s1327">So I went with my big rucksack.</span> <span id="s1328">And then we came with a ladder, we’re going to climb to that window there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">04:31:05 End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">05:00:06</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s1333">It is April 8, 1998.</span> <span id="s1334">We’re outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s1335">This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape five.</span> <span id="s1336">So you were going into the–?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Yes, lucky enough, they did not board the back door.</span> <span id="s1338">But we came with big oil cans and we oiled all the hinges, you know, and – and my commander said, “Well, you know where everything is, you will go in.”</span> <span id="s1339">Said, “Me?</span> <span id="s1340">Was supposed to be somebody else going in.”</span> <span id="s1341">“Oh, shut up and go in.”</span> <span id="s1342">So I went in, I set sev– set up 17 charges, one for each boy in the outfit and we blew the place sky high.</span> <span id="s1343">It just blew up.</span> <span id="s1344">There was a armory, and I notice where it was, I put a charge on the door to the armory.</span> <span id="s1345">Whatever they had there – it must have been a lot of explosives – blew up.</span> <span id="s1346">And of course, some of them were running out of the front gate and the back gate and we met them in the street, too.</span> <span id="s1347">And I don’t know how many were left, but there were some left, I presume.</span> <span id="s1348">And of course, then we took off and – and got the hell out of there.</span> <span id="s1349">That was a feather in my hat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: Where would you go after something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: We just went out for – far away from it, as far as we could from the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Sometime we had horses, sometime we had horse-wagons.</span> <span id="s1353">Occasionally we would have a truck, produce truck that we “borrowed” from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1354">Well, we would just stop a driver and take him away and appropriate the truck.</span> <span id="s1355">Take his uniform and one of us would dress in it and we would have it ready after a job like this.</span> <span id="s1356">And actually, this thing, strange enough, did not have many repercussions.</span> <span id="s1357">“The armory blew up.</span> <span id="s1358">There’s – something happen, the armory blew up.”</span> <span id="s1359">The German papers were saying, “the armory blew up and some of our people were hurt.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Maybe they didn’t want to acknowledge that there was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: They did not want to acknowledge, apparently.</span> <span id="s1362">So then we had a week of rest.</span> <span id="s1363">My commander said, “Now you deserve a rest.”</span> <span id="s1364">And I said, “Are you going to gift me with that Hitlerjugend uniform?”</span> <span id="s1365">“Oh no, that is useful – that will be for somebody else.</span> <span id="s1366">You pissed it, you so and so.”</span> <span id="s1367">I said, “Listen Dab, I was scared.”</span> <span id="s1368">“Well, I think you were scared, but you should have been scared before hand, not when you were right there.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">05:03:10</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: What did you do when you had a week off?</span> <span id="s1371">A week of rest, as you put it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Occasionally, I would visit my family, but very seldom.</span> <span id="s1373">But most of the time I would stay in the forest and enjoy it and bring some good food and have a drinking party.</span> <span id="s1374">And occasionally we’d have a drinking party with the Mongol people.</span> <span id="s1375">Wanted –wanted to demolish a track, or a trail, demolish a train.</span> <span id="s1376">And the Germans had the Mongolians, from outer Mongolia, who volunteered to serve the Germans.</span> <span id="s1377">They placed them along the railroad tracks to guard it.</span> <span id="s1378">So, when we wanted to blow up a train, we just go for about two or three kilometers and collect bunch of those people and invite them to a party.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Course they had to come if they wanted or not.</span> <span id="s1380">They didn’t want to get shot.</span> <span id="s1381">So we would provide a few gallons of moonshine and some smoked meat and a lot of bread, we’d have a party with them, get them roaring drunk and then we would wait for the – we knew when the train that – in question was coming in there, with armament or with a group of soldiers going to the eastern front.</span> <span id="s1382">And we would try to blow it up.</span> <span id="s1383">Sometimes succeeded, sometime not.</span> <span id="s1384">After we – after not, my commander would call on me and said, “You little so and so, what’s the matter with you?</span> <span id="s1385">Losing your touch?”</span> <span id="s1386">I said, “Yes, sir, I am losing my touch.”</span> <span id="s1387">“Let that not happen again.”</span> <span id="s1388">“Yes sir, it will never happen again.”</span> <span id="s1389">If it happened next time, he said, “You forgot you said never again.”</span> <span id="s1390">“Well”, said, “well, I thought I – maybe I would be dead before next time.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Were you wearing uniforms at all, or were you – A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: – just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: You were in – how – how did that work?</span> <span id="s1395">Were you – and then in civilian clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: We had civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1397">We had kind of a sports – like a sweatsuit set, something similar to it.</span> <span id="s1398">Somebody of a got hold of German overalls.</span> <span id="s1399">Occasionally – later – later on, after we appropriated a lot of German uniforms, those that were not very bloody, we would – we would wear.</span> <span id="s1400">Matter of fact, we had them tailored, beautiful tailored.</span> <span id="s1401">We had a Jewish tailor, Mr. – Mr. Grzebien, who could make a beautiful fitting outfit, regardless what it was.</span> <span id="s1402">And poor Mr. Grzebien did not make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: So – so if you – I guess what I’m trying to get a sense of is, were you openly an army unit in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: No, we were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Or were you – you were passing as civilians and then at certain times you’d go– A: We were passing a – we were passing as civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">05:06:02</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: But most of the time we stayed a unit – we stayed as unit and went constantly from – we did not stay in one place for more than two nights, went from place to place and found the places to hit and found the places to demolish or got orders to move here or to move there.</span> <span id="s1409">And then, after we felt that we were too unnerved, we would st– we would take a few days rest.</span> <span id="s1410">Occa-occasionally some of us would go for a short visit, but very seldom because Germans had also quite good Intelligence.</span> <span id="s1411">And they had a lot of local people who were reporting to them.</span> <span id="s1412">So you had to be careful where you go, when you go.</span> <span id="s1413">Like, for instance, I don’t know if I was that religious, but frequently on Sunday I would sneak into the church, to my pastor.</span> <span id="s1414">And he was friend of mine, I read all his books.</span> <span id="s1415">I read all the books in the public library and school library and I discovered he had a big library, so I read all of his books and I served Mass.</span> <span id="s1416">Oh my God, I served Mass forever, I was 19 and 20, I still served Mass.</span> <span id="s1417">So he would say, “Oh Stefan, come on, serve the Mass.” “Father, I can’t.</span> <span id="s1418">I messed up last night, I blew up a train.</span> <span id="s1419">There were people on that train –,” or else I did something.</span> <span id="s1420">“Come on, I’ll listen to your confe– I’ll hear your confession.</span> <span id="s1421">Come on, serve the Mass.” “But I’m too old.”</span> <span id="s1422">“Oh, you’re so little, nobody will know.”</span> <span id="s1423">So he gave me key to the wardrobe, he kept, “Put your – put your items in a ke–” I put – put my trench coat and my Schmeisser and a bunch of boxes of my magazines of ammunition in his wardrobe, lock it up, serve the Mass.</span> <span id="s1424">And then he said, “Okay, now you can go.”</span> <span id="s1425">So before he walked out, I would go into sacristy, unlock, jump out of a window and disappear.</span> <span id="s1426">He was a good old man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Do you remember his name?</span> <span id="s1428">A: Yeah, KsiadzMiazga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">05:08:22</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: This was your parish priest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: My parish priest, Ksiadz Miazga.</span> <span id="s1432">He was older.</span> <span id="s1433">He was patriotic.</span> <span id="s1434">And I would tell him that I really can’t serve Mass, nor can I go to communion – what I did.</span> <span id="s1435">“I can’t sleep nights, my conscience bothers me, cause some of the people that we exterminated were not really willingly going there.”</span> <span id="s1436">Said, “Everybody who is Ein– in Einsatzgruppe went willingly.</span> <span id="s1437">And if you did kill some soldiers on the train, some officers, this is a war.”</span> <span id="s1438">Anyways, I still occasionally spend sleepless night.</span> <span id="s1439">So, it lasted – it was good when it lasted.</span> <span id="s1440">And then in spring, early spring of 1944, I was caught in a lapanka.</span> <span id="s1441">Lapanka is a round-up, like they caught slaves in Africa, like they go hunting and have a – surround meters and hunters.</span> <span id="s1442">In Poland, the lapanka was an institution.</span> <span id="s1443">The group of German Schutzpolizeiwould stop a train or a bus, mostly train, get everybody out, fish out all</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">50 Priest (Polish) 51 Conventional police (German) the young people, put them in trucks, take them to process, processing, transit, camp building.</span> <span id="s1445">And in our district, was the Skaryszewska, it was an – name after the – after the street in Warsaw, “Skaryszewska” – processed you and sent you to compulsory labor in Germany.</span> <span id="s1446">It was called the “free labor.”</span> <span id="s1447">So I left what I was carrying – I was carrying a suitcase of dynamite and some wiring, so I left it on the train.</span> <span id="s1448">It was – I was a little boy, caught on a train traveling between Warsaw and – and whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">05:11:03 And of course I was sent to western part – I’m sorry, eastern part of Germany, Silesia.</span> <span id="s1450">Then there was almost like a – like a slave market.</span> <span id="s1451">They took us to that Kreuzburg town, small town like a county town, Kreuzburg.</span> <span id="s1452">We were kept – put in a – in a building next to a square – there we be walked out to the square and then farmers and people from different little factories, shops and so on, would come.</span> <span id="s1453">“I’ll take this one, I’ll take that one, I’ll take that one.”</span> <span id="s1454">“Okay.</span> <span id="s1455">Here’s your ai–,” they filled out an arbeitbuch,a little work book for you – your name and your employers name and you went and you were servant to that person.</span> <span id="s1456">If you got to be on a farm, it wasn’t too bad, because you had enough to eat.</span> <span id="s1457">A group of us – the group of us, about 25 boys and 23 girls, between like 13 and 19 or so, were put in a village called Schorka and we worked in a forest, natching out the trees, pine trees and collecting the resin.</span> <span id="s1458">Resin was used by German industry for making synthetic rubber.</span> <span id="s1459">So we worked there about eight hours a day, worked in a group with a supervisor.</span> <span id="s1460">And sometime the Stadtpolizeiworked with us, they try and they did not.</span> <span id="s1461">So, some of us would be escaping now and then, of course, they would be apprehended and brought back and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1462">And I worked there for, oh, probably three or four weeks.</span> <span id="s1463">So a small group of us took off and went away.</span> <span id="s1464">So, “I would – won’t work for the damn Germans here.</span> <span id="s1465">Let us go home.”</span> <span id="s1466">And the home was a general government the center of Poland, which was so called “Free Poland,” it was under – it was a protectorate, Hans Frank was the gover-governor and it was run by the Germans, for the Germans, by the Germans and the Poles who were there had to give everything that they produced, they raised on the farm and so on, to the German war effort.</span> <span id="s1467">But you were kind of semi-free.</span> <span id="s1468">Anyway, those of us who were in the underground were free because we could go anyplace we want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">05:13:47</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: So you just walked away from Schorka – from the resin work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1472">I w – just walked away.</span> <span id="s1473">Partway home, close to town called Lubliniec and closer to little town called Blachownia, we split – we got chased by some Volksdeutschepeople with shotguns.</span> <span id="s1474">And I ran into couple young boys and they were 52 Work log (German) 53 City police (German) 54 Ethnic German (German) the chlopcy z lasu,the boys from the forest, who were in the same part of Polish underground that I was.</span> <span id="s1475">So we talked, we introduced ourselves.</span> <span id="s1476">And he says, “How come –,” asked, “where are you from?”</span> <span id="s1477">“Oh, I am from Warsaw district.”</span> <span id="s1478">“How come you’re here?”</span> <span id="s1479">“Well, I got caught, spend time in Germany, now I’m escaping.”</span> <span id="s1480">“Okay, come with us, we have a job to do.</span> <span id="s1481">Are you – do you know anything about wet works?”</span> <span id="s1482">“Oh, a little.”</span> <span id="s1483">“Well, you know, there is a Gestapo man who is such a son of a bitch, he mistreats people, he beats people, he shot some people, he killed some people during interrogation.</span> <span id="s1484">And we want to do something willa– with him, but we are not – we got the sentence, death sentence for him from the – our underground authorities, the NSZ.”</span> <span id="s1485">The National – NSZ, which was the National Armed Forces.</span> <span id="s1486">Narodowe Sily Zbrojne,in Polish.</span> <span id="s1487">That was the – kind of a rightish wing of the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s1488">The Armia Krajowa– the Home Army was kind of a middle – the A.L., A.L. – Armia Ludowawere the Communists and we were the – toward the right somewhat.</span> <span id="s1489">“Well, we are NSZ – we are NSZ and we have problems, we don’t know how to proceed, so we –,” I stayed with them for a few days and got some arms from them and instructed them and they were still afraid, so we did – we went and we did the job, according to the rules.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">05:16:18 We met him in a park, with a wife and two children, one was in a carriage, one was walking.</span> <span id="s1491">So we ask him to excuse himself and we excuse the lady and we walk him a short distance, we read him the sentence.</span> <span id="s1492">And of course after we left, he – he was dead.</span> <span id="s1493">And I should have known better, I should have gotten the hell out of there, but I stayed for a few more days and there was somebody who reported.</span> <span id="s1494">And they came and I was so well trained and I became sloppy.</span> <span id="s1495">I was too lucky for too long.</span> <span id="s1496">I survived too long.</span> <span id="s1497">I became sloppy and careless and my goose was cooked.</span> <span id="s1498">I stayed with a family in a Blachownia – Blachstadt(ph) in German.</span> <span id="s1499">And it was kind of a storage room in a backyard, I stayed there.</span> <span id="s1500">And they came at about one a.m.</span> <span id="s1501">We had a shootout.</span> <span id="s1502">Two of those two who first came in, one was dead and one was badly wounded.</span> <span id="s1503">And they shot across and they killed another one of their own.</span> <span id="s1504">And I jumped out of a window, I thought I would – I was free to get out.</span> <span id="s1505">And then I got hit from behind.</span> <span id="s1506">I don’t know what happened after that.</span> <span id="s1507">When I was up to – I had a few broken ribs.</span> <span id="s1508">I was badly kicked and mutilated, practically trampled into the soil in that little garden there.</span> <span id="s1509">And then – that my my gar – goose got cooked.</span> <span id="s1510">They transported me to Lubliniec, which was a district town and a investigator came from my neighborhood, east of Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">05:18:24</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">55 Boys from the woods (Polish) 56 National Armed Forces (Polish) 57 Home Army (Polish) 58 People’s Army (Polish)</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: German, yeah.</span> <span id="s1515">Gestapo officer came from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1516">He was Ph.D. from Heidelberg University.</span> <span id="s1517">He was highly educated person.</span> <span id="s1518">And he joined the Nazi party, of course.</span> <span id="s1519">He didn’t know any better.</span> <span id="s1520">And he became special investigator for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1521">He introduced himself and when he came in, the people who led him in, they said, “Where you from?”</span> <span id="s1522">So he told them.</span> <span id="s1523">And said, “You know, wir hat die schlange, wir hat die schlange.”</span> <span id="s1524">“We have the snake.”</span> <span id="s1525">Because where I came from, they call me the schlange– the schlange, yeah the Germans.</span> <span id="s1526">Because I lived forever and lasted foreve- forever, so they called me the snake.</span> <span id="s1527">“Wir hat die schlange.”</span> <span id="s1528">We talked for five days and for five nights.</span> <span id="s1529">He would not let me sleep.</span> <span id="s1530">He would go and take a nap now and then, somebody else talked to me.</span> <span id="s1531">After five 24 hour talks, he said, “You know, I think we became friends and I th– and I thought you were going to tell me everything that you know.</span> <span id="s1532">Really, I’m your friend.</span> <span id="s1533">I don’t want to hurt you, I want to do anything.</span> <span id="s1534">But you didn’t tell me a damn thing.</span> <span id="s1535">So we’ll try something else.”</span> <span id="s1536">And I was just out of my – completely out of myself.</span> <span id="s1537">I was sleepy, I was hungry, I was thirsty.</span> <span id="s1538">So the first thing he did – he would – they would give me a little water now and then, but I don’t think I ate anything for those five days and five nights.</span> <span id="s1539">So then the first thing he did, he brought a big dish of ice water and gave me a big spoon.</span> <span id="s1540">He said, “Sit and eat.</span> <span id="s1541">If you don’t finish it off, I’m going to shoot you right here.”</span> <span id="s1542">The most horrible thing in you life can be eating ice water with a spoon.</span> <span id="s1543">What – it was probably a gallon and a half, maybe two gallons.</span> <span id="s1544">If you try sometime, this is almost like a Chinese torture, maybe even worse.</span> <span id="s1545">I ate the whole darn thing.</span> <span id="s1546">And I was just getting out of my mind.</span> <span id="s1547">So he would not let me go to the bathroom, so I just sat in a chair and made a big puddle on the floor, several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">05:21:17 And then he called two men – two big, strong men and they gave me hell for about two hours.</span> <span id="s1549">I was in and out several times.</span> <span id="s1550">I didn’t know what was happening to me.</span> <span id="s1551">Then they would pour a pile of water on me, I would come back to it and they gave me – and beat me again.</span> <span id="s1552">So then he asked questions and I apparently didn’t tell him very much, so he said, “Okay, take him in a swing.”</span> <span id="s1553">So they took my clothes off, they tied my hands on and – my hands like this, put a broomstick here, put it on the top of the stools and I was swinging back and forth.</span> <span id="s1554">And one of them was swinging hose, rubber hose, hitting my behind.</span> <span id="s1555">“And talk and tell me this and tell me that.</span> <span id="s1556">Well, you know about si– something about this?”</span> <span id="s1557">So I was prepared, I told him blue streak.</span> <span id="s1558">I told him – oh, I told him tall stories.</span> <span id="s1559">All the people, all the names, who were dead.</span> <span id="s1560">So then he left me – left me alone and he went and checked and he came back.</span> <span id="s1561">He said, “You didn’t tell me a thing.”</span> <span id="s1562">So they gave me beating again and beating again and beating again.</span> <span id="s1563">And then he said, “Well, that’s enough, we are ready.”</span> <span id="s1564">So I had a – and normally, I mean, they just took out – they shoot you.</span> <span id="s1565">They shoot everybody in the neighborhood and this case, they wanted to be so legalistic, they wanted to be so exact, that I had a case in court.</span> <span id="s1566">I had a defense attorney, 59 We has [sic] the snake (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">60 Snake (German) Mr. Heinrich Schmidt.</span> <span id="s1568">Yeah, Heinrich Schmidt.</span> <span id="s1569">And he was telling – he was talk to the court – it was the Volksgericht.People who did not have any training in law, appointed by the German authorities to deal punishment sentences.</span> <span id="s1570">So, my attorney was asking for three death sentences.</span> <span id="s1571">And the – I don’t remember – or did – I don’t know if I ever knew the name of the judge.</span> <span id="s1572">He said, “Two, enough.</span> <span id="s1573">Zwei ganz genug.</span> <span id="s1574">Zwei ganz genug.”</span> <span id="s1575">So he gave me two death sentences.</span> <span id="s1576">And then he stamped “N and N” on my document.</span> <span id="s1577">“N and N” is, is “Nacht und Nebel.”</span> <span id="s1578">“Night and fog.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">05:24:05 A person who got a sentence – who even did not get a sentence, but had an N and N on his documents, he was sent to concentration camp, he was finished off – taken to the gas chamber or given an injection – phenol injection.</span> <span id="s1580">Or went to the bunker to starve to death, or got mutilated or got hung in a – in a camp square.</span> <span id="s1581">His documents were destroyed.</span> <span id="s1582">His ashes were – his family was not notified to send seven marks for the ashes.</span> <span id="s1583">You disappeared just like in a night and fog.</span> <span id="s1584">So I was the Nacht und Nebel baby.</span> <span id="s1585">I stayed in prison, in Lubliniec for two, three weeks.</span> <span id="s1586">I healed.</span> <span id="s1587">I could sleep on my back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">When I got there, I could sleep only on my stomach.</span> <span id="s1589">There were 17 of us in a two person cell.</span> <span id="s1590">We slept like sardines in a can on the floor.</span> <span id="s1591">And the one who was the latest, had to sleep next to kübel.And kübel was a garbage pail that everybody emptied themselves.</span> <span id="s1592">So I slept next to the kübel for about a week.</span> <span id="s1593">And of course I advanced, later on.</span> <span id="s1594">But after about two or three nights, they looked at me, at my back and they said, “Well, maybe you should move little here.</span> <span id="s1595">Maybe we can put you in that corner, there,” ‘cause I, “you don’t look so great.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: What do you think gave you strength to endure that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1598">I was ornery.</span> <span id="s1599">I was so damn patriotic.</span> <span id="s1600">And I was very strongly religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">And I was very ornery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Good combination.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1604">It was a good combination.</span> <span id="s1605">05:26:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Did you pray during those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">61 People’s court (German); treason court instituted for the prosecution of enemies of the Third Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">62 Two total, enough.</span> <span id="s1609">(German) 63 Night and Fog (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">64 Pail (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1612">I prayed a lot.</span> <span id="s1613">And I – actually I never prayed for anything.</span> <span id="s1614">I prayed – I still have a ta– hard time praying for anything.</span> <span id="s1615">Like for instance, presently I pray in thanksgiving that I’m still alive, can take nourishment, I can run a mile, I can skate, I can do some skiing.</span> <span id="s1616">And I’m 75 and counting.</span> <span id="s1617">So I never prayed for something, not even for release, not even for a longer life.</span> <span id="s1618">I knew I wouldn’t live to be 20.</span> <span id="s1619">I was sure I would never live to be, to, to, to be ninet– 19 and a half or 20.</span> <span id="s1620">I was – by that time I was almost 19.</span> <span id="s1621">I never – I knew I was not going to live.</span> <span id="s1622">But I prayed and I was so thankful that I was still alive.</span> <span id="s1623">Anyway, after the sentence, I stayed there in a prison for a short time, then I went on a transport to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, which is in western Poland presently.</span> <span id="s1624">At that time it was in eastern East Germany, close to Opole, German Oppeln.</span> <span id="s1625">I was there in transit, in the block number 12, which was a subterranean block.</span> <span id="s1626">It was a time – it was just a time when Polish Prince Radziwillwas sent to Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s1627">The Germans wanted him to from Polish government under German auspices and he refused.</span> <span id="s1628">So they sent him to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1629">He was a brother-in-law of Mrs. Kennedy.</span> <span id="s1630">Kennedy’s – Mrs. Kennedy’s sister married one of the – his – that Polish Prince Radziwill, who was in Great Britain then.</span> <span id="s1631">Anyway, Prince Radziwill came with a servant.</span> <span id="s1632">And after they were told that sup – they took him – the ser– took the servant away.</span> <span id="s1633">They gave a black number, black triangle and sent him to the stone quarry.</span> <span id="s1634">And the person who received black triangle was – went to sa– to stone quarry, was not to survive.</span> <span id="s1635">So his Kapo told him, “Prince, I’m going to kill you, over the next week or two, so if you want to jump, go ahead.”</span> <span id="s1636">So he jumped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">05:29:12 End of Tape #5 65 Krysztof Mikolaj Radziwill</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Tape #6</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">06:00:16</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s1643">It is April 8, 1998.</span> <span id="s1644">We’re outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s1645">It’s conducted – this interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape number six.</span> <span id="s1646">First of all, I just want to say that this is May 1994, about and you were just telling the story of the prince.</span> <span id="s1647">How, how – you didn’t witness that, but–</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: No, I didn’t have to witness, but I spoke to one people who had a black number and was in the quarry.</span> <span id="s1649">He came and by that time I developed a friendship with a Blockältester, who was a Polish young boy, who was killing people right and left, to survive.</span> <span id="s1650">Killing prisoners right and left, to survive.</span> <span id="s1651">When I first came, we got into that barrack, we were put three people to the bunk and a bunk was about two and a half foot wide.</span> <span id="s1652">Three people to a bunk and bunks were three piles high.</span> <span id="s1653">So I went in the corner between the bunk and I stood against the wall, because my back, my seat, my – was kind of awful.</span> <span id="s1654">And the Blockältester was a young Warsaw boy who became a killer to survive.</span> <span id="s1655">He came and he said, “What do you think you are doing, you stupid so and so?”</span> <span id="s1656">I said, “Well, I am resting.”</span> <span id="s1657">“Get in the bunk.”</span> <span id="s1658">I said, “Blockältester, I cannot get in a bunk.”</span> <span id="s1659">“Why not?”</span> <span id="s1660">So, I turned around and lifted my clothes.</span> <span id="s1661">“Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1662">Come on.”</span> <span id="s1663">So normally, when you said, ‘come on’, you were going to get 25 with a ax handle or – or a – or a rubber truncheon.</span> <span id="s1664">So he led me to his little room and he said, “Take your clothes and lay down.”</span> <span id="s1665">So – “This is my bunk, lay down.”</span> <span id="s1666">So I lay down and he brought a – a towel, he brought a pail of water.</span> <span id="s1667">He washed my back.</span> <span id="s1668">He had some kind of an ointment that he put on me.</span> <span id="s1669">And he said, “You cannot turn, can you?”</span> <span id="s1670">I said, “No, I cannot turn.”</span> <span id="s1671">“Okay, you can sleep on my stomach.</span> <span id="s1672">I can go and get my – see my girlfriend.”</span> <span id="s1673">So he went.</span> <span id="s1674">Before morning he came back and said, “Now you can go back there and be one of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1675">And don’t let me catch you again standing there.</span> <span id="s1676">Go to bed.</span> <span id="s1677">Cause if you don’t, I’ll kill you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">06:03:03</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: Did he mean it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s1681">There were some people who were in position, occasionally they would give you – do you a favor.</span> <span id="s1682">But don’t ever ask them for a second favor, because that was the end of you.</span> <span id="s1683">I met many people like that later – later on in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1684">Anyway, I stayed there for a short duration and just about the same time, a bishop from my archdiocese – I can’t ever remember his name, from Siedlce, came.</span> <span id="s1685">He lasted only four days.</span> <span id="s1686">They put him into Strafkommando.People who were carrying big loads of stone with a wheelbarrow.</span> <span id="s1687">So he was pushing a wheelbarrow, he was an old man – I mean he was old, 66 Block elder (German) 67 Punishment commando (German) he was in his 40’s or 50’s.</span> <span id="s1688">And he – the Kapobeat him constantly.</span> <span id="s1689">He survived either four or five days.</span> <span id="s1690">They beat him to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">06:04:13</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: Were you working at that time?</span> <span id="s1693">A: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Were they having you work at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: No, we stayed in the barrack.</span> <span id="s1696">We were a kind of a zugangpeople – new prisoners in transit.</span> <span id="s1697">So about – I can’t even remember how many it was – eight or nine days, we put – were put on a transport and went, and went, and went all the way to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1698">Came to Mauthausen, got shaved, got disinfected, went to the showers, were given a pair of clodhoppers, wooden shoes and a prison uniform and went to a barrack.</span> <span id="s1699">Barracks zwei und zwanzig– the first quarantine.</span> <span id="s1700">There was a main camp and a first quarantine.</span> <span id="s1701">First quarantine they had barracks 21, 22, 23.</span> <span id="s1702">After that there was a wall, there was 24 and 25, but those were the bunker barracks, where people went, never to get out.</span> <span id="s1703">Anyway, barrack 22 was the barrack of the people with “N and N.” So we went to a little chamber where they gave shots, phenol, derivative of gasoline.</span> <span id="s1704">It is the most horrible death you can ever have.</span> <span id="s1705">You die for about 45 minutes.</span> <span id="s1706">That courses through your veins, gets into your heart several times, and you just die in a horrible torment.</span> <span id="s1707">Just the worse thing ever.</span> <span id="s1708">I saw dead people who died that way.</span> <span id="s1709">They looked like the gargoyles on Notre-Dame Cathedral.</span> <span id="s1710">Or they went on a transport, or went to Gusen Zwei,never to come out.</span> <span id="s1711">Or they went to gas chamber, or they went on special transport behind the front line.</span> <span id="s1712">If something happened behind the front line, in a town or village, they would hang 10, 15, 20 local hostages and let them hang there for – sometime for weeks.</span> <span id="s1713">If they did not have local people, they would bring people from concentration camp and execute them there.</span> <span id="s1714">But for some strange reason, after a very short time, I was whisked out, my number was read, I was put by the gate with 500 people.</span> <span id="s1715">We marched again to the train depot, which was about like three, four kilometers, through the little town of Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1716">Put on a train and went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1717">And put in a concentration camp which was a sub-camp of Mauthausen, 11th Bezirkkolo Wiednia.And we’re put to work in an armament factory.</span> <span id="s1718">It was an Ostermann-Sauer Werke, which built tractors and cars.</span> <span id="s1719">It was a Swiss- Austrian-American company, built cars and trucks.</span> <span id="s1720">At that time, they built Tiger tanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">68 Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor Kommando of prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">69 Arrival (German); term used for newly arrived concentration camp prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">70 Twenty-two (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">71 Gusen II</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">72 District (German) 73 In the vicinity of Vienna (Polish) And I became a great machine operator.</span> <span id="s1726">I mean, I learned in a hurry.</span> <span id="s1727">I had a good master.</span> <span id="s1728">He was a German engineer, a civilian.</span> <span id="s1729">He put me on machine, he showed me how to do things.</span> <span id="s1730">I was turning openings and grinding the huge blocks for the big, big heavy motor for the – was a horrible work, it was 12 hours a day.</span> <span id="s1731">The food was bad.</span> <span id="s1732">Most of what we were supposed to get, the people who handled it stole and ate and gorged themselves on.</span> <span id="s1733">It wasn’t too bad, actually.</span> <span id="s1734">When I think back, it wasn’t too bad.</span> <span id="s1735">I got beaten a few times by the SS men, but it wasn’t too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">06:08:42</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s1738">What would you do that bothered them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: Well, I think it’s – you – you looked wrong way, he came and slugged you.</span> <span id="s1740">And one time oh, my gosh, I never forget that.</span> <span id="s1741">There was a little SS man, my size – big, fat thing.</span> <span id="s1742">He was just kind of a, a roly-poly thing and he walked with a rifle.</span> <span id="s1743">The rifle was three times as big as he is.</span> <span id="s1744">And we walked the factory in a fives – you know, row – I mean fives – in kind of marching.</span> <span id="s1745">And I look and I said, “Look at that little son of a bitch.</span> <span id="s1746">He is my size and he is so damn fat.</span> <span id="s1747">If he falls over, he is going to roll forever.”</span> <span id="s1748">And he understood Polish.</span> <span id="s1749">And he got after me.</span> <span id="s1750">And the boys hid me and we were just in the gate, so I ran quickly into the factory and got to my machine.</span> <span id="s1751">And he was walking back and forth and watching and walking, looking for me.</span> <span id="s1752">And every time he walked, I would duck behind the machine.</span> <span id="s1753">I had a young Russian boy working with me, I would duck behind the machine.</span> <span id="s1754">And he never found me.</span> <span id="s1755">He would have probably finished me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: Your mouth, your mouth did get away with you, didn’t it?</span> <span id="s1757">Get away from you sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: I couldn’t escape that.</span> <span id="s1759">Many times my mouth ran away from me.</span> <span id="s1760">Q: So how long did you stay at this armament factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: It was a chore for the authorities.</span> <span id="s1762">I stayed there from – oh my gosh, from October, November, until the second part of January, I think.</span> <span id="s1763">I think so – does it say so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1766">Because – because every… [Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: Yes, the situation was such, they had a – I was a, I was a bloody headache for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Because every four weeks, two big, burly SS people would bundle me up, take me on the train, we would go to Mauthausen, 120 kilometers in the train and I would be taken out to the Politische AbteilungGestapo office outside of camp.</span> <span id="s1769">I would be asked some questions and I would get the treatment that I couldn’t sit for next two weeks, and back to work.</span> <span id="s1770">Every four weeks, every four weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: They continued these interrogations and beatings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: Interrogate my case.</span> <span id="s1773">The reason why they didn’t finish me off was because, “You’re case –Du kleine Schlange,your, your case is not yet finished.</span> <span id="s1774">Your case is not yet finished, so we have to ask you a few more questions.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: But what were they asking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: “Well, what happened then?</span> <span id="s1777">Did you blow the train?</span> <span id="s1778">How many people in your group?</span> <span id="s1779">Give me their names.</span> <span id="s1780">Who was your commander?</span> <span id="s1781">What are the other groups around?</span> <span id="s1782">What did you go this place?</span> <span id="s1783">When you go that place?</span> <span id="s1784">How come – how come at one time, you were by Smolensk?</span> <span id="s1785">How come at one time you were by Minsk – the Soviet Minsk?</span> <span id="s1786">Can you explain?</span> <span id="s1787">Can you tell?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">06:12:44</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: And what would you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: Well, I made the tall stories, I talk blue streak.</span> <span id="s1791">I tried not to repeat myself, I tried not to change what I told before.</span> <span id="s1792">As I said, I do – I did have a good memory.</span> <span id="s1793">I could memorize pages and pages of – I could memorize the 45 minutes of a propaganda talk.</span> <span id="s1794">I didn’t miss a word the second time.</span> <span id="s1795">Anyway, and they would let me go.</span> <span id="s1796">“Well, that’s enough for now.</span> <span id="s1797">We’ll see you in four weeks.”</span> <span id="s1798">So the authorities in Vienna apparently got sick and tired of it, so for a time, they put me on a bomb squad.</span> <span id="s1799">There were fifee– 50 people and after Americans started bombing Vienna – they came first in All Saint’s Day, in 1944 and bombed the bejesus out of Vienna.</span> <span id="s1800">They say there about 1200 American super fortress came.</span> <span id="s1801">You couldn’t see sun, you couldn’t see anything for three days – fires.</span> <span id="s1802">And they kept burning – Bezirk, district, 21, 22 and 23.</span> <span id="s1803">All those three days.</span> <span id="s1804">And finally they hit – there was a Tiergarten,there was a park there and under the park there were enormous tanks – buried tanks of aviation gasoline.</span> <span id="s1805">And they finally – the third night they hit, and the thing was boiling horribly.</span> <span id="s1806">Because my factory lost all the roof too and we worked, you know, January – worked practically outside.</span> <span id="s1807">We danced, we jumped.</span> <span id="s1808">We tried to put cardboard in our jackets.</span> <span id="s1809">If you got caught with a cardboard, you were beaten severely, sometimes shot.</span> <span id="s1810">So finally they got tired of it, they took me back to Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">74 Political division (German) 75 You little snake (German) 76 Zoological garden (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: I want to ask you a question about the interrogations, though.</span> <span id="s1813">They – they went on for a long time and they were brutal.</span> <span id="s1814">Was there ever a point that you said, “You know, I can’t do this any more?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: Forget it.</span> <span id="s1816">You do it.</span> <span id="s1817">You do it.</span> <span id="s1818">I tell him, “I don’t remember any more.”</span> <span id="s1819">“Oh, you remember a lot.</span> <span id="s1820">We will try something else.”</span> <span id="s1821">So then something else, when I came back to Mauthausen, the first two days – I was on block 22 again.</span> <span id="s1822">Block where people got – who were not supposed to leave.</span> <span id="s1823">And two days later I was called in and there said, “Well, we’ll try something else.”</span> <span id="s1824">So they made me take my shoes off and I – leaned me on a chair and beat my heels.</span> <span id="s1825">And this is the most horrible feeling.</span> <span id="s1826">When they hit your heel, it feels like your brain wants to jump out.</span> <span id="s1827">And – it was part of it – one of the stupid, untrained henchmen hit my foot and broke a m – broke my – my – some bones in my feet.</span> <span id="s1828">Now I am a walking barometer.</span> <span id="s1829">If – if the rain is coming tomorrow, I know there is going to be rain, because my foot bothers me.</span> <span id="s1830">My heels were just like balloons.</span> <span id="s1831">So I talked to some prisoners there, they said, “We just yell a lot.”</span> <span id="s1832">So, as from then on, whenever they took me there, before they hit me, I would scream bloody murder.</span> <span id="s1833">I would yell, I would swear up and down.</span> <span id="s1834">I would talk in Russian, I would talk in Polish.</span> <span id="s1835">So they brought Russian and Polish interpreter, thinking that I was going to spill something.</span> <span id="s1836">I would just talk blue streak.</span> <span id="s1837">And I knew little Samoyed language, I would talk some Samoyed, cause then they would – later I’m sitting down, “What did you say then?</span> <span id="s1838">What did you say?</span> <span id="s1839">What did you say then?”</span> <span id="s1840">I said, “I was just complaining.”</span> <span id="s1841">“What was the language you are talking to?”</span> <span id="s1842">I said, “I was talking in a language, probably Latin.”</span> <span id="s1843">Because I – I had several years of Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">06:16:50</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: But when you got back, did anybody take care of you?</span> <span id="s1846">You must have been really hurt when you would get back to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: Oh, you were just dumped a barrack and you took care of yourself.</span> <span id="s1848">I get some friends in the barrack who occasionally would bring me some – like an ointment from the Krankenhaus.Actually the block secretary was a Polish man who took pity upon me frequently and he would bring me something.</span> <span id="s1849">But I had a bunk all to myself, not two or three people, but to myself.</span> <span id="s1850">At least after – for a week or so after I was – I went through a treatment.</span> <span id="s1851">So I was in that barrack and was in a barrack and then of course and, and actually that interrogation and my “N and N” came – I mean it came to pass in late January, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: Was this ‘45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: I went – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">77 Hospital (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Nineteen forty-five?</span> <span id="s1856">06:17:50</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: Forty – ‘45, ‘45.</span> <span id="s1858">My number was list – it was called and a few other numbers were called and were called, we’re taken to the Grosse Tor,the great gate.</span> <span id="s1859">And I said, “Oh-oh.</span> <span id="s1860">I guess my cooked – my goose has been cooked.”</span> <span id="s1861">So we were taken, 12 of us – we were taken to EffektenkammerEffektenkammer was that big warehouse with the best, beautiful thing, that came with people who went directly to gas, were stored.</span> <span id="s1862">Beautiful suit, beautiful boots, silk underwear and so on.</span> <span id="s1863">So we got dressed like a – dressed well.</span> <span id="s1864">I got silken underwear, I had beautiful socks.</span> <span id="s1865">I had beautiful Hungarian boots.</span> <span id="s1866">Woolen suit, tie – silk tie, fur hat, fur coat.</span> <span id="s1867">They would put us by the gate and the prisoners were come in and said, “Man, look at the bunch of Jewish barons.</span> <span id="s1868">What did – where do those come from?”</span> <span id="s1869">And one of my friends came by and I said, “Hey.”</span> <span id="s1870">He said, “Don’t hey me, you so and so civilian.”</span> <span id="s1871">I said, “Didn’t you recognize me?”</span> <span id="s1872">And he says, “No, what are you doing in that stuff?”</span> <span id="s1873">I said, “God knows.</span> <span id="s1874">I was dressed up.”</span> <span id="s1875">He said, “Uh-oh.”</span> <span id="s1876">Anyway, when we’re – when we were in Effektenkammer, I had a friend – a friend who works there because I work part time before then, in a Kanadakommandosorting those goods.</span> <span id="s1877">So he gave me a bundle of jewelry.</span> <span id="s1878">He said, “If you go on a trip, maybe you can buy your way out.”</span> <span id="s1879">And he gave me a Polish marine knife.</span> <span id="s1880">So I tucked it in.</span> <span id="s1881">We’re standing there and pretty soon, SS squad came and we hiked to that depot, about three kilometers to the train and they put us in a prison compartments – went on a trip.</span> <span id="s1882">And on the train, there was one SS man who was coming back and forth – coming back and forth, looking.</span> <span id="s1883">And he came to a window, I, “Herr, Herr Ober– Ober– Herr Oberst, can you tell me where we are going?”</span> <span id="s1884">And he looked, he said, “What is u – what is worth to you?”</span> <span id="s1885">I said, “Two carats?”</span> <span id="s1886">“Ganz gut.</span> <span id="s1887">Hand it over.”</span> <span id="s1888">So I gave him a ring with a big diamond.</span> <span id="s1889">“Well,” he said, “La himmel, la himmel.”</span> <span id="s1890">“To paradise.”</span> <span id="s1891">He said, “There’s a little town east of Oppeln – of Opole.</span> <span id="s1892">Something happened behind the front line, they don’t have local hostages, so you people are it.</span> <span id="s1893">So you – normally, you know, they took you there, they took you finery off, they put – put on you paper suits.</span> <span id="s1894">They filled your mouth with a with gypsum, so you couldn’t yell, took you out and hanged you in a marketplace.</span> <span id="s1895">So that was it.</span> <span id="s1896">Said, “Oh gosh, now I got to watch.</span> <span id="s1897">I have that knife, I have all the jewelry.”</span> <span id="s1898">Nothing do it – doing.</span> <span id="s1899">Went to Vienna, they backed up prison van to the train and two people with truncheons and two people with machine guns – into, into it, they drove into us to the Elizabethpromenade – huge prison, put us in a cell.</span> <span id="s1900">Next morning, likewise.</span> <span id="s1901">Put us in a train.</span> <span id="s1902">We went through Budejovice, we went as far as Brno in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1903">They put us in old Franciscan monastery that was made into prison.</span> <span id="s1904">The walls, they were 12 foot thick walls.</span> <span id="s1905">That was a fortress.</span> <span id="s1906">But I see, in quite a big cell, 78 Great gate (German) 79 Personal effects chamber (German); warehouse for confiscated belongings of prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">80 Canada commando (German); term used to refer to commando of prisoners assigned to work in the camp’s warehouse of looted goods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">81 Heaven (German) there were 12 of us and there were another 15 of others.</span> <span id="s1909">Anyway, there were girls next door.</span> <span id="s1910">So we made a hole in that – well, it wasn’t just the big, it was like a plaster wall, so we made a hole and I laid whole night talking to girls.</span> <span id="s1911">Bunch of Czech, pretty Czech girls.</span> <span id="s1912">They send me a paper, they send me a piece of candy and we talk blue streak all night.</span> <span id="s1913">And the next night and the next night and those people who are with me, those prisoners who are with me said, “My gosh” – those were Bibelforscherpeople, those were Baptist people.</span> <span id="s1914">And he said, “We are supposed to be freed when we get to – to Opole, we’re supposed to be freed.”</span> <span id="s1915">I said, “Well, count your blessings, if you get freed, you’ll get freed.”</span> <span id="s1916">Anyway, the fourth day, we’re put on a train, say goodbye to the pretty girls across the street – across the wall – put us in a train.</span> <span id="s1917">And we keep watching and I see the same views.</span> <span id="s1918">We were going through Vienna and going west again.</span> <span id="s1919">We got back to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1920">The place – later on discovered the place where I was supposed to be disposed of – was overran by the Reds.</span> <span id="s1921">The Soviet army was there already.</span> <span id="s1922">And Germans being so indit– I mean outrigh– Langsam aber Sicher,slow and great and just exactly that way, no other way – took us back to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">06:23:41 We came back with a group – big group of prisoners from prisons in Vienna and elsewhere, probably two or three, 400 of us.</span> <span id="s1924">There were tables ready, the registering tables.</span> <span id="s1925">All the blockschrei—blockschreiberswere there, including my block secretary standing – sitting there at tables, you know they write your data, take your document if you have any and give you a number, give you a bracelet with your number and tell you where to go.</span> <span id="s1926">So he was sitting there, he, “Stefan, come on, come on, come on here.”</span> <span id="s1927">So I went and I said, “Bujwid.”</span> <span id="s1928">And he said, “Well, welcome again.</span> <span id="s1929">Great you made it – great you made it.”</span> <span id="s1930">I said, “What do you mean great you made it?</span> <span id="s1931">I was supposed to be freed.”</span> <span id="s1932">He said, “Yeah, you were going to himmel.”</span> <span id="s1933">And there was a priest, Father Iwanski.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Before I left, he listened to my confession, he gave me absolution and he said, “You are be freed, with the next three or four days, you’ll be free.</span> <span id="s1935">And pray for us.”</span> <span id="s1936">So I ca – later on I talked to Father Iwanski, I said, “You son of a gun, what do you think it was?</span> <span id="s1937">Didn’t you know I was going to by hung?”</span> <span id="s1938">“Well, you know, I wanted to cheer you up.</span> <span id="s1939">But I gave you absolution, so you will go straight to paradise.”</span> <span id="s1940">So I, “I probably will go to the deepest hell, what I – for all what I did so far.”</span> <span id="s1941">Anyway, Mr. Bujwid, “Here’s your number, here’s your bracelet, go to the showers and go to the barrack.</span> <span id="s1942">You got – you got barrack 22, you’re going to my block.”</span> <span id="s1943">And I looked and I said, “I don’t want this damn number, this a zugang numbers, this is a new prisoner number.</span> <span id="s1944">I want my number.</span> <span id="s1945">I am a prominente.”</span> <span id="s1946">By that time I was a prominent prisoner.</span> <span id="s1947">If you survive six months, you become prominent prisoner.</span> <span id="s1948">And out of those 600 that I came with, in six months there were 13 of us left, only.</span> <span id="s1949">So by – by the time – when you became prominente, you have 82 Biblical scholar (German); term used to refer to Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">83 Slow but sure (German) 84 Block clerk (German) 85 Prominent (German); term used in concentration camps for privileged prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">special consideration.</span> <span id="s1952">You can even go to SS kitchen after the SS finish and get a dish of their own soup, with beans and pork in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">06:25:58</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: There was kind of a hierarchy in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: You beca– you became, you became person who counts.</span> <span id="s1956">You became a prominent – a prominent prisoner, because you made it.</span> <span id="s1957">And most of those who became functionaries in a camp, you know, if they didn’t go by killing people, they did it by surviving.</span> <span id="s1958">So he said, “Shut up.</span> <span id="s1959">You want be killed?</span> <span id="s1960">Go to the showers and go to your barrack.”</span> <span id="s1961">So I put my arm in there, tucked my ears in, went in.</span> <span id="s1962">My finery was stripped.</span> <span id="s1963">My shoe – my beautiful boots even were taken.</span> <span id="s1964">I was left with a belt and a pair of holzschuheand my little bundle, which I stuck in a – in a holzschuh.</span> <span id="s1965">Get out of the shower and was thrown prison strip – prisoner garb.</span> <span id="s1966">Went back to the barrack boiling mad and Mr. Bujwid came and he said, “What’s the matter with you, don’t you know any better?</span> <span id="s1967">You could get me killed and yourself killed.”</span> <span id="s1968">Said, “Yes, but I’m not a prominente any more.</span> <span id="s1969">Look at that damn number.”</span> <span id="s1970">My – I – I will never forget my numbers.</span> <span id="s1971">If you wake me up presently, in the middle of the night, I will stand at attention and shout my number.</span> <span id="s1972">“Hundert-vier, zwei hundert zwei zwanzig.”</span> <span id="s1973">“104,222.”</span> <span id="s1974">And the second one was like 40,000 up, it was, “Hundert zwei und zwanzig, zwei hundert drei and sechzig.”</span> <span id="s1975">“122,263.”</span> <span id="s1976">So he said, “You know what you had in your documents?</span> <span id="s1977">You had ‘N and N.’ And you know what else I saw?</span> <span id="s1978">You had ‘F and S.’” “F and S” was “Frühlingwind.”</span> <span id="s1979">It was spring wind.</span> <span id="s1980">It was dub – to make double sure that nobody ever knows that you existed.</span> <span id="s1981">You disperse like in a spring wind.</span> <span id="s1982">So he said, “Now, you are free.”</span> <span id="s1983">Well, I wasn’t free, but my being taken out to the Politische Abteilung ended.</span> <span id="s1984">My seat healed.</span> <span id="s1985">I didn’t get any more a beating from then on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: So this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: I was completely different, new person.</span> <span id="s1988">Q: You sort of assumed a new identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: I assumed new identity.</span> <span id="s1990">Q: Which was no identity?</span> <span id="s1991">A: No, it wa– it was number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">86 Clogs (German) 87 Hundred four, two hundred twenty-two (German) 88 Hundred twenty-two, two hundred sixty-two (German) 89 Spring wind (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: Number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: It was number, but was a different number.</span> <span id="s1995">My “Nacht und Nebel” was gone forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Because you know, toward the end, they were fishing out people with “Nacht und Nebel” and marching them to the gas chamber or behind the crematorium to the little room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Mostly to the little room to get your injection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">Q: In this— [Technical conversation] 06:29:05 End of Tape

it, I’m not sick or anything.</span> <span id="s2003">I’m a tough old son of a gun.</span> <span id="s2004">Q: They didn’t tattoo you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: No.</span> <span id="s2006">They did not tattoo in Mauthausen, no.</span> <span id="s2007">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: Only Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Just Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: Yeah, only Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2012">This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s2013">It is April 8, 1998.</span> <span id="s2014">We’re outside Minneapolis, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s2015">This interview is being conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape number seven.</span> <span id="s2016">I wanted to ask you about the man you were just describing, who sort of had a position at the camp and who was giving you advice on your situation.</span> <span id="s2017">Was he Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: He was Polish.</span> <span id="s2019">His name was Bujwid.</span> <span id="s2020">He was from a territory called Zmudz, which is bi– Lithuania in – in northern Russia.</span> <span id="s2021">It was a holy Polish Zmudz.</span> <span id="s2022">The coat of arms was Saint Michael.</span> <span id="s2023">And they were Poles from 11th century.</span> <span id="s2024">He was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s2025">By surviving the first six months, also by knowing German very well, he became a block secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Each block had a Blockältester, block leader, which was in most cases German criminal and a block secretary who knew German very well, could write and read very well.</span> <span id="s2027">So he was it.</span> <span id="s2028">And it was an important function, even though he didn’t cherish it because he had to lead – he had to call a lot of people to execution or to bunker or to injection or to gas chamber or to a – to go on a transport.</span> <span id="s2029">That was his function – that’s how he survived.</span> <span id="s2030">If he wasn’t there, somebody else would have done it.</span> <span id="s2031">He had to keep the numbers of all people who had to assist the Rapportführer.Every morning you – you lined up outside, the Rapportführer – SS man came and he counted you.</span> <span id="s2032">Secretary wrote it down and gave it to him, he walked out.</span> <span id="s2033">And a tally was made for the whole camp that had to count just right, nobody missing.</span> <span id="s2034">If anybody was missing, they counted 10 times, until they found everybody.</span> <span id="s2035">So this secretary was a – was the secretary of the barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">90 Report leader (German); term used for roll-call officers in concentration camps system.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: And – and what did you think of him or people like that, who essentially were, I guess taking jobs, in a way, in the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: Well, in most cases, we were appreciative, because if they were Polish, they could be of great help to us.</span> <span id="s2039">Also, yo– they were not killers.</span> <span id="s2040">Some Kapos were killers.</span> <span id="s2041">Kapo – Kapos were group – people who led groups of people to work and to exercise and to kill at will.</span> <span id="s2042">But people who – who had functions like block leader, if he didn’t kill, he was all right and block secretary, most of them did not kill, they were all right.</span> <span id="s2043">And there was a secretary over first quarantine, there was a – was a chief secretary of the whole – Führerschreiber,secretary of the whole camp.</span> <span id="s2044">They had positions.</span> <span id="s2045">The camp inside, ran itself.</span> <span id="s2046">Let me have a drink of water.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">07:03:42</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: Well, I’m back from a trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: You were asking about the, the guy who’s – The guy, okay.</span> <span id="s2051">A: The guy, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2053">I think – I think actually, I think you answered that, so– A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2054">So I was – I was back on his – in his barrack–</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: Oh right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: And that was a time that evacuations started coming from the east.</span> <span id="s2057">When the eastern front approached, they would evacuate camps and push the prisoners in, killing most along the way.</span> <span id="s2058">Those who could not walk would be killed and those who could walk.</span> <span id="s2059">So Mauthausen became greatly overcrowded.</span> <span id="s2060">So, like my barrack, instead of having 120 people, had 700.</span> <span id="s2061">Half of the people slept inside, sitting one again – against each other, for half a night and then they would get out of a window and the people who are standing outdoors, would get in at 12 o’clock and sit on the floor to be warm and to sleep until morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">07:05:02</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: You did this too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">91 Chief clerk (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: Oh, of course, yes.</span> <span id="s2066">And it was a time when I – when I met Victor Frankl.</span> <span id="s2067">You heard of Victor Frankl?</span> <span id="s2068">He was a Jew from Vienna.</span> <span id="s2069">He just died about a year ago, he was in his upper 90’s.</span> <span id="s2070">He was a great man, he was a psychoanalyst.</span> <span id="s2071">If you ever see a little book called my – Man’s Search for Meaning, it was translated into English, many of his books were translated, he was a psychoanalyst.</span> <span id="s2072">And he – when he came to Mauthausen, I don’t know if – if he came from Auschwitz or elsewhere, he was just on his last leg.</span> <span id="s2073">He lost his spoon, he lost his dish and with those two, you were dead.</span> <span id="s2074">But he had a big bundle of papers.</span> <span id="s2075">And we met, he somehow plopped next to me and – and he said, “Nu, who are you?”</span> <span id="s2076">“Oh, I am Polish.”</span> <span id="s2077">“Oh, I am Jew from Vienna.</span> <span id="s2078">And what do you do in your life?”</span> <span id="s2079">I said, “I did nothing, I was a student and I was doing some little work after that – before the Germans caught me.</span> <span id="s2080">What did you do?”</span> <span id="s2081">“Well, I was a doctor and I’m a doctor of psychology.”</span> <span id="s2082">And I said, “Where’s your spoon?”</span> <span id="s2083">“Oh, I lost it.”</span> <span id="s2084">“Where’s your dish?”</span> <span id="s2085">“Oh, I lost it.”</span> <span id="s2086">I said, “Man, you dead, because you won’t get your soup, you won’t get anything to eat with.”</span> <span id="s2087">And if you try to catch some – some servers would give it into your hat, but most of them wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s2088">They would just take you aside and kill you.</span> <span id="s2089">Anyway, found him soup spoon and found him dish and we became friends.</span> <span id="s2090">And he was great.</span> <span id="s2091">For next few days we just talked and every time we felt bad, it was just – end was coming, you know, people are being taken to gas chamber and places.</span> <span id="s2092">He’s a – he said, “Oh, sit down here, let’s talk.”</span> <span id="s2093">So we talk blue streak and we got cheered up.</span> <span id="s2094">He developed a – a special kind of psychotherapy call – called logotherapy.</span> <span id="s2095">And he’s went talking on – on – talking tours through United States many times.</span> <span id="s2096">One time he came in 1970’s, late 70’s and we couldn’t get together, but I phoned him at Coffman Union at the University here and he called me back at work and then he talk – we – he phoned at night and we talked for about three hours, from about 12 until 3:30.</span> <span id="s2097">Said, “Well, I got to go, my train is – my plane is leaving shortly.”</span> <span id="s2098">So we said, “Auf wiedersehen” and then – anyway, he survived, but when – I never thought he would make it, but he did.</span> <span id="s2099">He stayed in Mauthausen to the very – time of liberation.</span> <span id="s2100">But, my case, again, I was fished out after a few – in a few days after the great crowds came and I was transported to Gusen Zwei, which was a walking distance.</span> <span id="s2101">Gusen Einswas about two mi– two kilometers, Gusen Zwei was about five kilometers, so we walked.</span> <span id="s2102">There were about 5,000 of us walked that day.</span> <span id="s2103">We were gather at the nightfall.</span> <span id="s2104">We were – our clothes was taken, only belt and shoes were left on us.</span> <span id="s2105">Our clothes was taken to be disinfected.</span> <span id="s2106">We went to showers, which were cold at that time.</span> <span id="s2107">We were put outside and we stayed until about four a.m. I was still quite nimble and quite healthy.</span> <span id="s2108">I got in the middle of a group.</span> <span id="s2109">My head kind of froze, but at morning we found about 500 people who were dead, out of 5,000.</span> <span id="s2110">This is only 10 percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">07:09:16</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: But… tell us what that was like to – to spend the night and have people dropping around you, dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">92 Gusen I</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: Yes, well, you become numb.</span> <span id="s2115">You become cold, you beco– you hurt.</span> <span id="s2116">Then all of a sudden you become numb, you don’t hurt any more.</span> <span id="s2117">You’re not even cold any more.</span> <span id="s2118">You become kind of a frozen stick.</span> <span id="s2119">And Gusen Zwei was the worst camp you ever heard of.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Normally, it had 50,000 prisoners and by the end of a week would be 45,000.</span> <span id="s2121">Every week 5,000 prisoners came, sometime 10,000.</span> <span id="s2122">And it never went above 50.</span> <span id="s2123">Never went about 40.</span> <span id="s2124">In a week would be 40.</span> <span id="s2125">About – attrition ration was about 20 percent a week.</span> <span id="s2126">Was a horrible work, we worked digging tunnels under mountain.</span> <span id="s2127">The tunnels were buil– dug especially to put armament industries in them.</span> <span id="s2128">They already built tanks.</span> <span id="s2129">They built Messerschmitt – Messerschmitt planes.</span> <span id="s2130">And I think they built also rocket planes that they used – I mean, the Vau-Eins,Vau-Eins, Vau-Zwei,to bomb England.</span> <span id="s2131">But I’m not sure of that.</span> <span id="s2132">But I knew they built Messerschmitts.</span> <span id="s2133">But I was on a crew that was digging the tunnel, digging with a – straight ahead of you, in a kind of a softish stone, with a air drill.</span> <span id="s2134">And a person as strong as he is, or he is, could stand about four days.</span> <span id="s2135">After four days you broke down.</span> <span id="s2136">Well, I stood it for about seven days and I was given a shovel to shovel because I couldn’t lift it any more.</span> <span id="s2137">And I had a Yugoslavian friend – Janko – Janko, I can’t remember his last name.</span> <span id="s2138">He lasted 27 days drilling.</span> <span id="s2139">The drill weighed probably 35 - 40, maybe 50 pounds, straight into the wall, drilling.</span> <span id="s2140">Then he dropped dead.</span> <span id="s2141">Just dropped the drill and dropped.</span> <span id="s2142">By the time we turn him over, he was dead.</span> <span id="s2143">Yeah, he was a – Yugoslavians and especially Albanian.</span> <span id="s2144">Albanian people are the tough son of a guns.</span> <span id="s2145">Albanian man can swear for 15 minutes and never repeat himself.</span> <span id="s2146">And if you translate some of the swearing, your hair will stand on end.</span> <span id="s2147">They’re tougher than Polacks, they’re tougher than Russians.</span> <span id="s2148">Even tougher than Yugoslavians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">07:12:10</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: What were they giving you to eat at this point?</span> <span id="s2151">Were you getting–</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: We had cup – we got cup of tea, it was birch leaves, or whatever it was, in the morning, nothing else.</span> <span id="s2153">Sometime there was some milk.</span> <span id="s2154">It was like a – like a cereal, boiled.</span> <span id="s2155">Like maybe a handful of cereal to 10 gallons of water.</span> <span id="s2156">It was slightly sweetish, I think they had some – beet marmalade mixed in it, and a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s2157">At noon, you got a half a gallon of soup that had practically nothing in it and a small slice of bread.</span> <span id="s2158">At night you got a pound of bread for either seven or eight or 10 people and a – another cup of tea.</span> <span id="s2159">It was supposed to be 800 calories, but by the time it did get to you, it was no more than about four or 500.</span> <span id="s2160">One does – if one did not organize, one did not last long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: What – what do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: I was lucky.</span> <span id="s2163">I had a Russian friend who was a thief.</span> <span id="s2164">He can steal anything out of anyplace.</span> <span id="s2165">When the allotment of cigarettes came to a block to be given to the functionaries and it was parceled out, he would always steal of – steal a carton of</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">93 V-1 (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">94 V-2 (German) cigarettes and nobody ever could catch him.</span> <span id="s2168">He was a Rostovskiy urka.He was a specialist from Rostov.</span> <span id="s2169">He said, “When I was 10 years old, Ya khodil po karmenam,I walked in – he walked into people’s pockets.”</span> <span id="s2170">He was a pickpocket.</span> <span id="s2171">He could steal anything off anybody.</span> <span id="s2172">So he shared his cigarettes with me.</span> <span id="s2173">Cigarette were the high, hard currency.</span> <span id="s2174">For one-fourth of a cigarette, you got portion of bread.</span> <span id="s2175">For one-eighth of a cigarette, you got a dish of soup.</span> <span id="s2176">So when I had an access to something, I shared with him.</span> <span id="s2177">To make it short, I had a SS man who didn’t like me, who beat me frequently.</span> <span id="s2178">He was a beautiful, young, tall, blonde beast and he had a German Shepherd, young German Shepherd with him.</span> <span id="s2179">So one time, I got the sh– German Shepherd in a dark tunnel and of course I dispose of him, I skinned him.</span> <span id="s2180">I had him baked in a ba– in the smithy, because I that time was – I was a – a Läufer,I was a runner.</span> <span id="s2181">I was running with the drills to the smithy and back, you know, carrying them back and forth to be sharpened and to be brought back.</span> <span id="s2182">So I gave the smith one-fourth of a dog, he baked it for me.</span> <span id="s2183">Then I shared another quarter with the people who worked with me and a half of the dog, I brought to the camp and that three or four of us lived high on the dog for about a week and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Oh, that was an enormous shot in the arm.</span> <span id="s2185">Course my Russian friend liked the dog so much, he said, “Stepka, get another one.</span> <span id="s2186">Get another one.”</span> <span id="s2187">I said, “Sorry, I cannot catch and old German Shepherd, this was a young, stupid German Shepherd.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">07:15:41</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2190">So, to survive, you couldn’t just accept what they gave you, you had to find that extra–</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">A: You had to organize, you had to trade.</span> <span id="s2192">When I was in Mauthausen, if I worked – when I worked on a Kanadakommando, sorting the goods, I was able to scrounge a lot of jewelry, came to the barrack or – got a bundle of American dollars.</span> <span id="s2193">I could get a beautiful bottle of booze for 500 dollars.</span> <span id="s2194">Or I could get a big, five pound sausage for 500 dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">And my friends and – and – and – and colleagues, we live high on the hog.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">07:16:22</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: Now, at this time, in this camp that you were at, where you were doing the tunnel drilling, were people being taken away and executed or gassed at this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: We had a gas chamber, but I – no, there was a gas chamber in Gusen One, but not Gusen Zwei.</span> <span id="s2199">But the mortality ratio was so enormous that – that nothing else was necessary.</span> <span id="s2200">Of course the Kapos killed their portion of people every day.</span> <span id="s2201">We went to camp, I mean went to work – on the way home we carried five, six, 10 - 15 - 20 people out of a hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Carried them because they were killed at the job.</span> <span id="s2203">Some dropped dead but most of them 95 Crook from Rostov (Russian) 96 I walked in pockets (Russian) 97 Runner (German) were killed by the Kapo.</span> <span id="s2204">Kapo would get a cigarette for every person he killed.</span> <span id="s2205">If he were a heavy smoker, he killed a lot of people.</span> <span id="s2206">Also, there was a Krankenhaus, there was a hospital and if you went to Krankenhaus, never came back, of course – but some people did.</span> <span id="s2207">So from time to time, they would have a – a Krankenhaus had to be disinfected.</span> <span id="s2208">So they would take the people from a Krankenhaus and make them walk across the railroad tracks to another barrack that was empty, kind of a temporary Krankenhaus and keep them there, and there would be a line of Kapos lined up on each side of the group walking.</span> <span id="s2209">Anybody who would walk, they ran a gauntlet.</span> <span id="s2210">They had ax handles on – or two by fours, and anybody who did not run, was killed.</span> <span id="s2211">So I remember once in the first of February, 1945, they killed that night, 400 sick people out of 700, about 300 only made it, could run.</span> <span id="s2212">The rest were killed.</span> <span id="s2213">I had a friend at that time, he was a Polish mountaineer.</span> <span id="s2214">He was a tough son of a – he was just wiry, he was strong.</span> <span id="s2215">He was everything.</span> <span id="s2216">Anyway, he got sick or he – maybe he malinger.</span> <span id="s2217">So he was sent to the hospital.</span> <span id="s2218">He went to hospital, couple nights later comes a Kapo from a hospital and say – calls my number, so I answer him, and said, “You have a friend in the hospital.”</span> <span id="s2219">“Yes, I have a friend in the hospital.”</span> <span id="s2220">“His – his name is Janko the Góral,“John – little Johnny, the mountaineer.”</span> <span id="s2221">“Yes.”</span> <span id="s2222">“Well,” he said, “that window, so he wants you to come and see him at that window.”</span> <span id="s2223">So at night I sneaked in – that was not allowed.</span> <span id="s2224">To get out of a barrack, going get killed.</span> <span id="s2225">So I went and I knocked the window, he opened it up and, “Oh, Stefan, come tomorrow and bring me a big jug of water.</span> <span id="s2226">I’m so thirsty, there’s not enough water here.</span> <span id="s2227">Here.”</span> <span id="s2228">So he gave me a little bundle.</span> <span id="s2229">I came back, there were about seven portions of bread.</span> <span id="s2230">It was a fortune.</span> <span id="s2231">Eating an extra portion a day, keep you alive and up your spirit for at least a week, maybe 14 days.</span> <span id="s2232">So I brought him some water next day and I said, “Janko, where did you get all that bread?”</span> <span id="s2233">“Well, you know, those damn Muselmans.”</span> <span id="s2234">Muselmans was a name for people who were on their last foot.</span> <span id="s2235">You know, they just lay there, they can’t eat, they hold their bread.</span> <span id="s2236">So when the Fliegeralarmcomes, you know, night, when the lights are out and planes are flying – lights are all – all the lights are off, he just went from bed to bed and swiped the bread and lived high on the hog.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">07:20:34 And I said, “Janko, but this is un-Christian.”</span> <span id="s2238">“They are going to die anyway.</span> <span id="s2239">I’m not going to – I – I’m not killing them, but they can’t eat.</span> <span id="s2240">They have bunches of bread sitting there, they just can’t eat.”</span> <span id="s2241">So we both – and all my friends in the barrack, lived high on the hog.</span> <span id="s2242">And Janko came back, got out of a ba– of a hospital, came back to the barrack and he was given three days of convalescence.</span> <span id="s2243">He was staying in the barrack, did not have to go to work.</span> <span id="s2244">And the Kapo, day Kapo in the barrack, ask him to do something and Janko said, “You so and so, get away from me.</span> <span id="s2245">I’m convalescing, I’m sick.”</span> <span id="s2246">So the man 98 Mountaineer, uplander (Polish) 99 Muslim (German); camp term used to refer to prisoners who had lost the will to live and were near death.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">100 Aid-raid alarm (German) took his tool and beat Janko to death.</span> <span id="s2248">I came at night and one of our friends said, “Your friend is there.”</span> <span id="s2249">There was a – you know, there was a big, high stone wall between each barrack and next barrack.</span> <span id="s2250">And we lined up, you know laid down, it was 10 - 20 - 50 people a day who were dying.</span> <span id="s2251">So I went.</span> <span id="s2252">Yes, Janko was still there, laying, his head bashed in.</span> <span id="s2253">So I did have his address.</span> <span id="s2254">I wrote to his family after the war and his sister answered and she said, “Well, my mother feels so bad because Janko was taken because he argued with her, so he volunteered and went to work in Germany and he got himself charge with sabotage and sent to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2255">And please tell me, did he have a nice casket?</span> <span id="s2256">How was he buried, did he have a priest?”</span> <span id="s2257">Janko, with probably 500 others, next day, was dumped into big wagon, that about 50 prisoners pushed and pulled.</span> <span id="s2258">They just had big sides and their wheels were just like the Conestoga wagons in America there, but bigger.</span> <span id="s2259">And they pushed and pulled to the first Gusen Eins, where the crematorium was.</span> <span id="s2260">Gusen Zwei did not have a crematorium, so that the bodies, probably four or 500 a day, sometime maybe 1,000 a day were wheeled to Gusen Eins to be cremated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">07:23:07</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: Were there times when you were afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s2264">Became like – became – it became a normal life.</span> <span id="s2265">It became a very normal life.</span> <span id="s2266">You watched not to cross a line, you watched not to overstep your – your – your territory.</span> <span id="s2267">You watched.</span> <span id="s2268">I mean you had to have eyes back there and side here and forward, even down below.</span> <span id="s2269">If you – if you saw a SS man coming, you didn’t step off the sidewalk, why, he just could kill you.</span> <span id="s2270">If you didn’t step off the sidewalk and take your hat off and clap it again-against your leg and stood at attention, you could get killed.</span> <span id="s2271">If he didn’t like your looks, he could just take a gun and shoot you or else beat you that you would not survive.</span> <span id="s2272">On and on and on, and if you did make it, it’s just good luck, holy providence and a good combination of both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q: So it’s February or March of 1945, are – are what – are you getting any information from the rest of the world?</span> <span id="s2274">Do you have any sense –</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">A: None.</span> <span id="s2276">None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s2277">Well, there were rumors.</span> <span id="s2278">You know rumors, like in American army rumors or any place where a lot of people, rumors.</span> <span id="s2279">There were some people who listened to radios in a camp, but they shared their information very sparingly.</span> <span id="s2280">We knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s2281">The rumors told that Americans landed.</span> <span id="s2282">The Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s2283">Well, of course you know, all those prisoners coming from the east, consequently the front line is coming.</span> <span id="s2284">The Germans are being killed by zillions.</span> <span id="s2285">Well, great.</span> <span id="s2286">We hope they will all ge– will get it.</span> <span id="s2287">The – then we heard, when the Poles landed in Holland, you know the Polish parachuters, whole brigade and couple American brigades landed in Holland, we heard those rumors and it was the gospel truth of course, you could not – I mean, if you said, “No, it’s not true,” somebody could kill you, probably.</span> <span id="s2288">Said, “You defeatist, what do you mean it’s not true?</span> <span id="s2289">Honest, it’s gospel truth.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Q: Did you make good friends there, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: Quite a few.</span> <span id="s2292">But they didn’t last very long.</span> <span id="s2293">Either they got transferred or got killed.</span> <span id="s2294">Most of them got killed.</span> <span id="s2295">Only two people that I know survived Gusen Zwei.</span> <span id="s2296">One was a priest, one was unfinished priest.</span> <span id="s2297">Father Iwanski and Father Bruno.</span> <span id="s2298">Father Iwanski survived.</span> <span id="s2299">He survived Gusen, which was not easy to survive.</span> <span id="s2300">He ended in Canada.</span> <span id="s2301">I corresponded with him.</span> <span id="s2302">He’s dead for last 10 - 15 years.</span> <span id="s2303">He was an old man that time.</span> <span id="s2304">You know, he was in his 40’s, he was old, old man.</span> <span id="s2305">When he came to camp, said “Hey, how are – old are you?”</span> <span id="s2306">“Oh, I’m 29 - 30 - 32.”</span> <span id="s2307">“Oh my God, you old.</span> <span id="s2308">Week, two weeks, you are gone.”</span> <span id="s2309">You were supposed to be 17 - 18 - 19, you had a chance.</span> <span id="s2310">If you were over 30, you were an old man.</span> <span id="s2311">Father Iwanski was over 40.</span> <span id="s2312">He was an old man.</span> <span id="s2313">Father Bruno was an unfinished priest, he was – we call him unfinished priest.</span> <span id="s2314">Nie skonczony ksiadz.He was still in a seminary.</span> <span id="s2315">He eventually became a priest and he went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s2316">I understand he was executed by the Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">07:27:01</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Q: Did the priests hold any kind of religious services, or – A: Very secretly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: – counsel you, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: Very – they talked to us.</span> <span id="s2321">Q: They talked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: When I went on my little trip, Father Iwanski came to talk to me, he was still in Mauthausen and he talked to me and he blessed me and he listened to my confession.</span> <span id="s2323">Later on I – I felt like killing him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: Well, I said, “You should have warned me.”</span> <span id="s2326">“Warned you?</span> <span id="s2327">What do – would it do?</span> <span id="s2328">I have – I wanted you to feel good for next two or three days.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: But you would have liked to have known?</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: I would have liked to have known, yes.</span> <span id="s2331">If I would have known, I – I might have made a greater effort – there wasn’t much chance, but I – I might have tried.</span> <span id="s2332">I probably would have killed mysel– got killed for it, but I would have known I didn’t go meekly.</span> <span id="s2333">And – 101 Not finished priest (Polish)</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">[Technical conversation] 07:28:22 End of Tape #7</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Tape #8</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">08:00:10</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2338">This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s2339">It is April 8, 1998.</span> <span id="s2340">We are outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s2341">This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape number eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: Oh my God, eight?</span> <span id="s2343">He is wasting eight tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">Q: Not wasting.</span> <span id="s2345">This is just – I guess it’s just sort of an observation, that you were saying you would have liked to have known, that one time when you were being taken off, to possibly – well, the plan was to hang you.</span> <span id="s2346">But so much of the war years, you had no idea what was going to happen next.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s2348">As I said, I was resigned.</span> <span id="s2349">I expected not to live to be 18 or 20 or 19 or 20, but I did.</span> <span id="s2350">And I was very prayerfully, thankful for each day that I lived and tomorrow will take care of itself.</span> <span id="s2351">Even at bedtimes, when I expected to be – to be taken to the little room to be injected – I knew it was coming, but still I said, “Well, I’m still alive today.</span> <span id="s2352">Tomorrow will take care of itself.”</span> <span id="s2353">Especially, I mean I felt very bad one time.</span> <span id="s2354">There was a little boy, his name was Henry.</span> <span id="s2355">He said he was 14, but he looked like he was nine.</span> <span id="s2356">He was a – he was a Polish worker, working in Germany, in a factory.</span> <span id="s2357">Somebody put sand in a – in a motor.</span> <span id="s2358">Motor got destroyed, he was blamed for it, sabotage.</span> <span id="s2359">Sent to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s2360">He lived, for a time, in block 22.</span> <span id="s2361">Then he was called.</span> <span id="s2362">And he was – he was just like a tiny, little bird.</span> <span id="s2363">He was so skinny, he was so miserable.</span> <span id="s2364">He just looked like a – like a – like will of a wisp.</span> <span id="s2365">And Mr. Bujwid wanted greatly – to help him.</span> <span id="s2366">So when he – execution time came, Mr. Bujwid went to the – camp secretary went to Gestapo office and begged for him, one day.</span> <span id="s2367">So they postpone it.</span> <span id="s2368">And the next day – next day he came his face was bitten up and swollen.</span> <span id="s2369">He came –</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">08:02:40</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: Who’s this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: Our secretary.</span> <span id="s2373">He went next day again and again he had welts on his back and his face was beaten some more.</span> <span id="s2374">So the fourth day, a list came – Läufer came running.</span> <span id="s2375">Läufer was the runner, you know, as I – pretty young boys were runners, Läufers.</span> <span id="s2376">They ran between the camps and delivered messages.</span> <span id="s2377">So Läufer came with a list and – and said, “Mr.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">Bujwid,” I mean, “Herr Bujwid.Exekution eintreten, Exekution eintreten.Roll up with execution.”</span> <span id="s2379">So Mr. Bujwid came to barrack and read the list and I was sure I was going to be on the list and the little boy was on the list.</span> <span id="s2380">And he walked out into the front</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">102 Mr. Bujwid 103 Fall in for execution (German) and they got lined up and the Blockältester, Max, the German criminal who was the block leader, led them out….</span> <span id="s2382">And it was so, so funny, Mr. Bujwid talked with that little Henry.</span> <span id="s2383">Oh, they talk blue streak.</span> <span id="s2384">“Because we both are from the holy Zmudz.”</span> <span id="s2385">Because the little boy was from the same territory that Mr. Bujwid was.</span> <span id="s2386">They say, “We’re holy people, we believe in God, we hate the damn Communists.</span> <span id="s2387">We hate those Germans even more because they’re ungodly creatures.</span> <span id="s2388">And we are going to survive for ever and ever and ever.”</span> <span id="s2389">And the last day, before Henry went to be killed, he said, “Mr. Bujwid, thank you.”</span> <span id="s2390">Yeah, he, he knew what was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">08:05:06 Anyway, that was still in Mauthausen and that was I wa– then I wa– on our way in – Gusen Zwei and of course, it – I heard it later on, but it was a good story.</span> <span id="s2392">A Swedish Red Cross person, whose name nobody ever found, came to speak to the commander, General Pohl,P-o-h-l.</span> <span id="s2393">And he came to talk to him and General Pohl was complaining, he said, “See here,” was a telegram or was a letter.</span> <span id="s2394">“I have an befehlhere,” I have an order, “to lead all these people I have left here, about 42,000, into the tunnel.</span> <span id="s2395">The ends of the tunnels are already mined to be dynamited and those people will suffocate there, within in probably one, two hours.”</span> <span id="s2396">He said, “If it was only telephone order, I probably could escape not doing it, but is a befehl, it’s a telegram, I had to sign for it.</span> <span id="s2397">What I am going to do?”</span> <span id="s2398">He was not – he was not a very bad person, that man was.</span> <span id="s2399">Matter of fact, he had a case in court later on and some of us testified for him.</span> <span id="s2400">Anyway, when this man left his office, the document disappeared.</span> <span id="s2401">The man – and the general was diverted somewhat – the man swiped it.</span> <span id="s2402">He borrowed a bicycle from a German guard, then he borrowed a horse.</span> <span id="s2403">And the American front line was just beyond Linz.</span> <span id="s2404">It was probably 30 - 35 - 40 miles.</span> <span id="s2405">He went across the whole front line on a horse, then – he in tie and suit.</span> <span id="s2406">Why the German Ges– SS didn’t kill him, I don’t have an idea.</span> <span id="s2407">Did he talked to somebody, I don’t have an idea.</span> <span id="s2408">Did he identify himself, I don’t have an idea.</span> <span id="s2409">He got across, he got as far as General Pattonheadquarters.</span> <span id="s2410">And nobody wanted to talk to him, so he bothered everybody there and eventually somebody did talk to him.</span> <span id="s2411">So he mentioned that, he described it.</span> <span id="s2412">So they said, “Okay, come on in, come on in.”</span> <span id="s2413">They let him talk to assistant to Patton.</span> <span id="s2414">And then Patton came and asked a few questions.</span> <span id="s2415">And Patton sent five American tanks.</span> <span id="s2416">They broke across the front line, they went and went and went.</span> <span id="s2417">They came to Gusen Zwei, they took few potshots at the guard towers.</span> <span id="s2418">The SS people surrendered.</span> <span id="s2419">They left tank, I think about five soldiers, to guard those 800 SS, who are herded into – into – into a big kind of a barn.</span> <span id="s2420">And the rest of us, who were just barely moving, because we haven’t gotten anything to eat about four days and my case, I was flat on my back.</span> <span id="s2421">I couldn’t even turn over.</span> <span id="s2422">Then the four tanks went to Mauthausen, five more miles and sur– and get around, too few – took few potshots at the guard towers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">104 The interviewee later corrected this name to Max Pausch, Kommandant of Gusen II.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">105 Order (German) 106 Gen. George Smith Patton 3,000 SS people surrendered and there was bedlam in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s2425">It was not much of a bedlam in Gusen Zwei because most of us were just about done for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">08:09:07</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: Take us back a little bit – wa– what was going on the last few days that you had stopped getting food?</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: They told us there was no food.</span> <span id="s2429">“We cannot give you anything because there isn’t any.”</span> <span id="s2430">Well, it turned out, that the warehouses were full of bread and the bread was – after we found it after a few days after liberation, it was all moldy by then.</span> <span id="s2431">There was probably two, three, four, five tons of bread.</span> <span id="s2432">They just probably tried to starve us to death.</span> <span id="s2433">And many did.</span> <span id="s2434">Many did.</span> <span id="s2435">We had an enormous ditch dug out between the Gusen Eins and Gusen Zwei by American bulldozers, army bulldozers.</span> <span id="s2436">Just an enormous ditch.</span> <span id="s2437">And they took all the Germans from the countryside, with horses and carts and wheelbarrows and all and they came and picked up all the people, washed up everybody and laid them evenly, not just dumped them, but laid them evenly in a – in that grave.</span> <span id="s2438">There are about 18,000 people buried there.</span> <span id="s2439">And those were the dead for last four or five days, when the crematorium did not work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: 18,000?</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: About 17 - 18,000.</span> <span id="s2442">An enormous, enormous – kind of almost like a – like a – like a riverbank built up high.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Q: Did the Germans know that the Americans were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: Well, they expected – they, they all knew the front was nearby, but they expect it to be still fighting there for quite sometime, but this – they just broke through.</span> <span id="s2445">They said, “Oh my God, the armies are coming.</span> <span id="s2446">“Amerikaner, Amerikaner – run!”</span> <span id="s2447">And the SS of course, just surrendered and the Commander Ziereiswas a horrible man – of Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s2448">He was – people testified and – against him and he was hanged, later on.</span> <span id="s2449">But General Pohl of Mau– of Gusen Zwei, was exonerated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: Think back to that day and – you said you were laying in bed, but did – what did it sound like when the Americans –</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">A: It was kind of a bedlam – it was a bedlam and it was a – Americans really came, you know – really came.</span> <span id="s2452">It was about two days later that the front moved, Americans came.</span> <span id="s2453">They just came in, walking around.</span> <span id="s2454">Taking lot of pictures and they came to my – to my barrack and they looked up and – and one of them spoke German, “Kommen Sie da,</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">107 Franz Ziereis kommen Sie da.”</span> <span id="s2456">And I said, “I can’t move.</span> <span id="s2457">I can’t even turn over.”</span> <span id="s2458">“Ja, wir helfen dich – wir helfen – wir helfen dich.”</span> <span id="s2459">We’ll help you.</span> <span id="s2460">Came with a stretcher and a couple people and they pull me off.</span> <span id="s2461">They lay me in a stretcher and somebody came with a pail of water, they washed me off.</span> <span id="s2462">I was – I was shitty and – and stinking, and all that and they covered me up with a German army overcoat.</span> <span id="s2463">Took me to Gusen Eins and there was a little hospital made there and were given little milk – milk with – mixed with water and kind of a gruel, that you give to babies, for a few days.</span> <span id="s2464">Eventually, we started eating food.</span> <span id="s2465">And people who were in – who got hold of a solid food, like American were tossing cans of Spam – and Spam was the heavenly food.</span> <span id="s2466">Oh my God.</span> <span id="s2467">Spam was it.</span> <span id="s2468">I still can close my eyes and I can taste that beautiful American Spam.</span> <span id="s2469">So somebody would eat it, would not share it with somebody else and he would die, immediately, on the spot.</span> <span id="s2470">Could not – could not take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">08:13:15</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Q: So you were pretty sick.</span> <span id="s2473">What was the reaction of the Americans who saw you – who ca who came by your bunk and saw you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A: Well, there were so many of us, they were just flabbergasted.</span> <span id="s2475">They kept us there and they took us some, on – in trucks, to hospital in Bamberg, which was couple hundred miles west, into West Germany.</span> <span id="s2476">And I was in a Städtischer Hospital,the state hospital for about four, five, six months there.</span> <span id="s2477">I had – well, I was down to 72 pounds, had a – I had a bad case of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s2478">And my lungs were collecting liquid, especially my left lung.</span> <span id="s2479">So I got shots.</span> <span id="s2480">I got shots, it was the 10 cubic centimeters lime – lime shots.</span> <span id="s2481">Know lime, like the – used for building?</span> <span id="s2482">Calcium – calcium shots.</span> <span id="s2483">Calcium shots.</span> <span id="s2484">And when you get the shot, you get hot from your tip of your toe – fingers to tippy toes and to your head, you just get pleasantly hot.</span> <span id="s2485">And that was supposed to sh– to dry up that liquid in your lungs.</span> <span id="s2486">And after a few weeks, when a nurse was coming with a needle, my veins went south.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">She would jab and jab and jab and she could not find a vein.</span> <span id="s2488">She said, “Just don’t look when I come.</span> <span id="s2489">I don’t want you to see, because your veins disappear.”</span> <span id="s2490">My both arms were just like – like I was a heavy addict to God knows what.</span> <span id="s2491">But it didn’t dry it.</span> <span id="s2492">It didn’t dry, they had to make a puncture in the back and pump it out.</span> <span id="s2493">And they couldn’t put me under, because I would never wake up.</span> <span id="s2494">So two big men, just like those two, big clunks held me and the doctor went back and he made – punctured my back and he pumped, oh probably gallon and a half of horrible liquid.</span> <span id="s2495">And he said – the doctor said, “Well, if you’re lucky, this is it.</span> <span id="s2496">If you’re not lucky, you have to pump it every six months for the rest of your days.</span> <span id="s2497">Of course, if are still unlucky, you die of TB, well, you’ll be dead.”</span> <span id="s2498">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s2499">I didn’t die of TB and I did not have to ever have it pumped again, except that I have two big stones on the bottom of my lungs, because the calcium goes all the organism and collects in your lungs and settles on the bottom.</span> <span id="s2500">Occasionally when I have 108 Come there [sic] (German) 109 Yes, we help you, we help you.</span> <span id="s2501">(German) 110 Municipal hospital (German) cold, when I cough, little grainy stuff, I do cough out.</span> <span id="s2502">Doesn’t bother me any.</span> <span id="s2503">Except I go to x-ray.</span> <span id="s2504">When I first came to x-ray, he says, the doctor – technician looked, call the doctor and doctor said, “What is that?”</span> <span id="s2505">And I said, “What is what?”</span> <span id="s2506">“What is that on bottom of your lungs?”</span> <span id="s2507">I said, “Calcium.”</span> <span id="s2508">“Calcium?</span> <span id="s2509">How come calcium?”</span> <span id="s2510">Said, “Well, I was given about 310 cubic centimeters as injections of calcium to dry up my wet pleurisy, they called it, Pleuritism Exudativein Latin – my wet pleurisy.”</span> <span id="s2511">“Oh, they did that?”</span> <span id="s2512">“Yes, they did that.”</span> <span id="s2513">“Did it dry out?”</span> <span id="s2514">“No.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">08:17:00</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: Did you feel – I mean, could you comprehend that the war is over?</span> <span id="s2517">Did you feel safe again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">A: I felt safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Q: Did you feel like it was really over?</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">A: And I felt safe and I felt on the top of a cloud.</span> <span id="s2521">It’s unbelievable, but when you have nothing, you know, you are dirty, you are starving, you have completely nothing and you are in prison, the freedom is so sweet.</span> <span id="s2522">When we went to work, there was a train going over the viaduct and you saw the German people standing in the windows and smiling, you know.</span> <span id="s2523">Well dressed, well-fed, just smiling, you said, “Oh my God, how free those people are.”</span> <span id="s2524">They were not, I mean, they were under Nazis men, all that, but “how free these people are.”</span> <span id="s2525">And frequently when you are in a life, you are quite well off sometimes and oh, my God, you know how many people commit suicide because being unhappy temporarily.</span> <span id="s2526">Nobody ever committed suicide there.</span> <span id="s2527">He was Muselman, he went to gas tomorrow morning, he did not commit sui– suicide today.</span> <span id="s2528">Well, there were incidents where people went against the wire and got themselves elec-electrocuted.</span> <span id="s2529">But you never became despondent.</span> <span id="s2530">You also – you n – you need that – you e – never caught a cold.</span> <span id="s2531">I had never seen a person in Siberia – I have never seen a person in a concentration camp to catch a cold.</span> <span id="s2532">Nobody ever caught the common cold, ever.</span> <span id="s2533">They are just too tough to catch a cold.</span> <span id="s2534">When you get to be a civilian, you become sissy, you catch any cold that comes along.</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q: Now, when you got out, were you able to contact your family at all?</span> <span id="s2536">A: No.</span> <span id="s2537">For about six months I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">A: There was no connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">111 Wet pleurisy

<span id="s2543">About six months later, I registered with the Swedish Red Cross and the Swedish Red Cross notified them and about a year later, we started writing back and forth, so they knew that I was still alive and – alive and kicking and not too bad.</span> <span id="s2544">Of course I was still in a – in a sanatorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">Q: In – the first place you went to the hospital was in – A: In Bamberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: the U.S. –</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: Bamberg</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">Q: – occupied Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">A: I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s2550">It was in U.S. occupied Austria.</span> <span id="s2551">Q: Austria, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">A: In Gusen Eins, there was a kind of a hospital or camp hospital.</span> <span id="s2553">In a few days, only – later on, they took us to Bamberg, to a real hospital.</span> <span id="s2554">It was a good, old German hospital and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: And how did you feel about being treated by Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: Great.</span> <span id="s2557">The Schwesters– I mean all people who took care of you are nuns.</span> <span id="s2558">The Schwesters are all nuns.</span> <span id="s2559">All nurses in Germany at that time were nuns.</span> <span id="s2560">There some nurse helper – nurse helpers who were ladies, women, civilian girls, but all German nurses were Schwesters.</span> <span id="s2561">Oh yeah, then we had some great Schwesters.</span> <span id="s2562">I still have a rosary that one gave me.</span> <span id="s2563">Yeah, Sister Urszula gave me rosary, I still have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">08:20:33</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">Q: So when was it determined that you would need to go for further rest?</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">A: Well, after being in the hospital, they said, “Well, you are not well to go into a camp, you have to go to sanatorium because your tuberculosis – it’s not spreaded – spreading, it’s arresting – it’s arrested, but you have to have rest.”</span> <span id="s2567">So I went to Erholungsheim– rest</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">112 Nurses (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">113 Sanatorium (German) home, which is a beautiful Schloßon a top of a mount – on the top – top of a hill, next to forest, with a big garden.</span> <span id="s2570">And it was a Schloß, it was a castle that belonged to a German Jewish family.</span> <span id="s2571">They had a David – David star in their – in their coat of arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">When the Hitler’s came, they all were arrested and packed to concentration camps and I understand never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">Q: So what was it like when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">A: Well, we were assigned rooms – either one or two people to a room, you stayed a lot in bed.</span> <span id="s2575">The food was quite good, provided by the German – by the Germans and – and Swiss Cross and American army, mostly.</span> <span id="s2576">We’d get American PX packages, with a little canned food and a beautiful piece of chocolate.</span> <span id="s2577">I was crazy about chocolate.</span> <span id="s2578">When I got my package, there was probably about four ounces of chocolate, I inhaled it.</span> <span id="s2579">One time the chocolate was moldy in those packages, so I traded with everybody who want to dispose of it.</span> <span id="s2580">I traded everything I had – I had – oh my God, I don’t know how many blocks of chocolate I had – I ate myself sick.</span> <span id="s2581">For next six weeks, I couldn’t look chocolate in the face.</span> <span id="s2582">It was very moldy.</span> <span id="s2583">The German doctor – actually it was a French lady doctor, she thought I was get blood – I mean food poisoning, she hovered over me constantly.</span> <span id="s2584">It was a beautiful, little French girl.</span> <span id="s2585">I almost, I almost married her.</span> <span id="s2586">Yeah, she we, we became very friendly and she took me to see her family, we drove all the way to Versailles, stay there, came back.</span> <span id="s2587">Of course nothing came out of it, I was just a dilapidated little old prisoner and she was a beautiful young lady, just out of medical school.</span> <span id="s2588">But was great when it lasted.</span> <span id="s2589">Oh, she was fun to be with.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">08:23:09</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">Q: Boy, it sounds like you were starting to begin to take joy in normal things like – A: Well, of course –</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">Q: – chocolate and dating and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A: Of course, I me – I mean every day was a new day and you are free.</span> <span id="s2594">You are not going to get to be – get your – shot or go to a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s2595">In Mauthausen, every 10 days, one block was gassed.</span> <span id="s2596">You went to showers, you went in tiptoe – you went to showers every 10 days.</span> <span id="s2597">You went tiptoeing, your whole block, you know, 400 - 600 people – and there was a deathly silence.</span> <span id="s2598">You could not hear people breathe.</span> <span id="s2599">And everybody was watching the shower heads.</span> <span id="s2600">You got a little piece of soap.</span> <span id="s2601">When the water came, it was a bedlam.</span> <span id="s2602">Jumping, yelling, shouting, laughing, hugging one another, because sometime, instead of the water, those little red flaps came open, Zyklon Bpoured in – those little blue</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">114 Castle (German) 115 Zyclon B (German); hydrogen cyanide.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">granules poured in, by gallons.</span> <span id="s2605">Then your goose was cooked.</span> <span id="s2606">Seventeen minutes, you were done for.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: So you knew what happened in – in – I mean it was no secret at that point?</span> <span id="s2608">A: Oh no, that was no secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s2609">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">A: When you went – and you never know which – you never knew which barrack was going to happen to.</span> <span id="s2611">So you went – you apprehensive, when you got out, you say, “Whee, I’m going to live next 10 days.</span> <span id="s2612">At least next 10 days.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: And you told me before that sometimes you were forced to actually clean up after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2615">Yes, I was under special – special barrack, so when they needed extra help when extra – lot of people came, they took a crew of 10 - 20 - 50 people and we had to go transport the bodies to the cool chamber.</span> <span id="s2616">The cool chamber, it was kind of a underground tunnel and a little push railroad.</span> <span id="s2617">We loaded up the bodies on the top of this little flatcars and got into crematorium – in the cool chamber next to it.</span> <span id="s2618">The cool chamber too – could take about 2,000 people – bodies.</span> <span id="s2619">Because sometime they couldn’t catch up, burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">Q: I mean how do you – what do you say to yourself to make yourself do something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">A: Well, you went willingly, you got an extra bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s2622">You abhorred it, but you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">You got big dish of SS soup.</span> <span id="s2624">Peas or beans with pork in it.</span> <span id="s2625">Oh my God, that was a heaven.</span> <span id="s2626">As I said, your life became every day life – normal, every day life.</span> <span id="s2627">And whatever happened was normal for that time and place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">08:26:15</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">Q: In the first few days of your liberation, think about what were the things that – that were normally normal, but you weren’t used to any more.</span> <span id="s2630">Did you have any experiences, you know that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: It was just – it was just like being a cloud nine.</span> <span id="s2632">Laying in a clean bed and being clean and being – people come and feed you.</span> <span id="s2633">An American would come and stand by my bed.</span> <span id="s2634">And he said, “You cannot eat, can you?”</span> <span id="s2635">“Well, I can, kind of.”</span> <span id="s2636">So he would take a spoon….</span> <span id="s2637">Yes, it was a great feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">[Technical conversation] 08:27:18 End of Tape #8</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s2645">What kind of thoughts are you having about your future?</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: Not much of it.</span> <span id="s2647">By the time I became well, I knew that Poland became Communist and the part of the Polish underground I was in was fighting both the Germans and the Communists.</span> <span id="s2648">As we said, “They are coming, who do you shoot first?”</span> <span id="s2649">We said, “Pleasure before duty, shoot the Russians first.”</span> <span id="s2650">And I knew they were looking for me.</span> <span id="s2651">I felt they were looking for me.</span> <span

id="s2746">Then I go and spit on his grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">Q: Who is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">A: Okay, somebody who is very unsavory, who is a traitor.</span> <span id="s2749">Also, I have a good reason now to go to – to go back.</span> <span id="s2750">I had a friend whose name was Stefan, his last name was Wojtyla and if you know the connotation, you know John Paul Two, his last name is Wojtyla.</span> <span id="s2751">Stefan Wojtyla was my neighbor, was my friend, went to school together.</span> <span id="s2752">He did not want to join.</span> <span id="s2753">When the Soviets came, he joined immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">Q: Are you saying you were friends with the Pope?</span> <span id="s2755">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">A: I was friend with Stefan Wojtyla.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">118 Karol Wojtyla</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q: Sorry.</span> <span id="s2760">Okay, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">A: Stefan Wojtyla has the same name as the Pope.</span> <span id="s2762">Q: Name, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">A: They are from different part of the country, they’re no relation, most likely.</span> <span id="s2764">Stefan Wojtyla joined the Communist party, he was sent for training to Soviet Russia, he came back in 1949 or 1950.</span> <span id="s2765">He joined Polish army.</span> <span id="s2766">He became a law officer.</span> <span id="s2767">He became, last time – he used to write to me, say “Stefan, come back.</span> <span id="s2768">Your were shedding blood, you were fighting.</span> <span id="s2769">You will get your rewards here.”</span> <span id="s2770">So we wrote back and forth and I discovered that Stefan Wojtyla arrested at least dozen of my people and at least eight were put against the wall and shot without trial.</span> <span id="s2771">In 1973, he became a persecutor general of the Polish armed forces and was the last time he wrote to me, because I wrote him that, “You dirty, damn Communist.</span> <span id="s2772">Why did you have to do that?”</span> <span id="s2773">So he wrote back, “I haven’t done anything, I helped a lot of people, I helped a lot of people.”</span> <span id="s2774">And I wrote him, “Do you want a feather in your hat?</span> <span id="s2775">You want me to come back and you put me against the wall?”</span> <span id="s2776">So he wrote, “I would never do that to you, you were my friend always, you always will be my friend.</span> <span id="s2777">But I am becoming the prosecutor general of the Polish armed forces and I cannot write you to – to you any more.</span> <span id="s2778">But I promise you that your folder, that is about three inches thick, is going to disappear when I get my position.</span> <span id="s2779">Nobody’s going to see it again.”</span> <span id="s2780">And my sisters, when they came – they came here, said, “Yes, he came for a visit, many times,” and the times were hard in Poland, so sh– they said that he brought always some very exquisite food.</span> <span id="s2781">He always brought a bottle of champagne and – with a lunch with him and he said, “I never will forget what you did for me.”</span> <span id="s2782">He said, “When I was a kid, and we were dirt poor, when Stefan and I were going to school in the morning, I would sneaked into your house early and your mother always would give me a good breakfast with Stefan.</span> <span id="s2783">And then we walked our three kilometers to school.”</span> <span id="s2784">He said, “I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s2785">And you can write Stefan that I would never hurt him.”</span> <span id="s2786">Anyway, when I go back, I will spit –</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">09:10:30</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">Q: On his grave?</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">A: Well, probably not.</span> <span id="s2790">I should be Christian and forgive him.</span> <span id="s2791">But I can not forget.</span> <span id="s2792">Just like that – there’s a little German saying that says, “Orte und Zeiten der Schrecken die wir niemals vergessen werden.”</span> <span id="s2793">“The times and places of horror, we should never forget.”</span> <span id="s2794">Especially this day and age.</span> <span id="s2795">You know, you talk to young people – I spoke to about 110 young people in a middle school about two weeks ago.</span> <span id="s2796">And they had a course on Holocaust, they wanted to know what was going on.</span> <span id="s2797">They don’t know who Hitler was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">They heard little of Stalin, they don’t remember who Roosevelt was.</span> <span id="s2799">They learn little 119 The places and times of terror should never be forgotten.</span> <span id="s2800">(German) about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2801">They were living – reading Elie Wiesel, the book – little book, Night.</span> <span id="s2802">They were just about few pages gone and they wanted to ask many questions and I told them little story.</span> <span id="s2803">So I frequently go and talk to group – various groups of people, willingly, and few of us that are still alive should not forget.</span> <span id="s2804">And it seems like your people with the museum there and whatever information you impart to people must have some influence, because a lot of schools, even grade schools, have a special course every year on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2805">And as far as I know, almost all the middle schools here, especially the religious schools, Catholic and Lutheran schools, do have it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">Q: So you – you – you didn’t want to go back, because it was Communist and so – A: Well, I – I – I could not go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">Q: You couldn’t go, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">A: Because those people are – my sisters wrote me in 1955, I think and said, “Well, we would like to see you, but if you come, you may end in a piaskowo.”</span> <span id="s2809">Piaskowo is a cemetery – is a sandy hill.</span> <span id="s2810">Said, “Because many people like you are being taken out.”</span> <span id="s2811">I had two little relatives, they were two girls my age.</span> <span id="s2812">They were actually my nieces but I – they were my age.</span> <span id="s2813">In 1947, they were arrested, they were mistreated, they were sent to jai– to prison for 10, 15, 20 years.</span> <span id="s2814">They were exonerated in 1960, released and they even were allowed to live in Warsaw, which was a great privilege.</span> <span id="s2815">They’re both dead.</span> <span id="s2816">They didn’t survive very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">09:13:54</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">Q: Your, your parents survived the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">A: My father survived.</span> <span id="s2820">My – my mother was dead by then.</span> <span id="s2821">My mother was a war, war casualty.</span> <span id="s2822">She had a baby and all doctors were arrested and sent to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2823">She had a very child – difficult childbirth and she died in childbirth at 41.</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">Q: Died?</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2826">But those two girls in question, they were couriers for our underground.</span> <span id="s2827">They carried mostly explosives on the train.</span> <span id="s2828">They’d have two huge suitcases of explosives, get on the train, they spoke little German.</span> <span id="s2829">They’re pretty young girls.</span> <span id="s2830">Well, frequently they would get into a German car – a bunch of German soldiers, officers had a special car, so they’re, “Mädchen, mädchen, kommen Sie hier.”</span> <span id="s2831">So they would came with the big suitcase that the German would pick up the suitcase, put it up on the upper.</span> <span id="s2832">Because there were controls frequently, they would stop a train and search and contraband like food, the 120 Sandy hill (Polish); colloquially “cemetary.”</span> <span id="s2833">121 Girls, girls, come here!</span> <span id="s2834">(German) so-called black market, which was a free market, people training would be stole – taken away from people.</span> <span id="s2835">So if you are pretty girl and you carry that, Germans invited you, took your bundle there and nobody could come and search you.</span> <span id="s2836">And they would come to Warsaw and said, “auf wiedersehen” and “danke schön” and went blissfully their own way with four big suitcases, carrying enough stuff to blow up four – four or five trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">But the Communists got them.</span> <span id="s2838">They said, “But we helped you.”</span> <span id="s2839">“Well, helpers like you we don’t need any more.”</span> <span id="s2840">Just like with my four boys.</span> <span id="s2841">“Helpers like you we don’t need any more.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">09:15:59 And mainly, we were helpers in one aspect.</span> <span id="s2843">In 1943, in summer, a Communist young man, slightly older than I, came and talk – talked.</span> <span id="s2844">He said, “Stefan, we need to blow up something and I know that you can do it.”</span> <span id="s2845">I said, “You’re a dirty Communist.</span> <span id="s2846">I wouldn’t bend my finger to do anything for you.”</span> <span id="s2847">“But you know, you really got to help us.</span> <span id="s2848">You really got to help us.”</span> <span id="s2849">So I talked to my commander and my commander said, “Oh, you stupid so and so.</span> <span id="s2850">Go help them?</span> <span id="s2851">If you go and lose your behind, it will serve you well because you lost your head already.”</span> <span id="s2852">But he reconsidered.</span> <span id="s2853">Few days later he came and said, “Yes, you can go and help them.</span> <span id="s2854">I talked – we talked.”</span> <span id="s2855">So they provided me with two – well, they gave me two of my boys and myself and a load of explosives.</span> <span id="s2856">And provided us with a German chauffeur.</span> <span id="s2857">German chauffeur who was carrying a truckload of arm – war material to a certain spot.</span> <span id="s2858">And we’re going to that spot.</span> <span id="s2859">It was kind of an army filled depot.</span> <span id="s2860">There were a lot of explosives there and then tanks and aircraft bombs and God knows what else.</span> <span id="s2861">So he left us out in the forest.</span> <span id="s2862">He went and delivered the stuff and then came back and he was going to wait for us in the forest.</span> <span id="s2863">And I was told, “You send one boy, if he doesn’t make it, send a second one.</span> <span id="s2864">Don’t go yourself, because if you go, you get court martialed when you get back.”</span> <span id="s2865">So one of my boys went in, he went under the first wire and had a little shovel, dug out.</span> <span id="s2866">Then he went to a second wire and a dog got him.</span> <span id="s2867">And the guards, the SS guards came in and shot him.</span> <span id="s2868">And well, he didn’t suffer because they shot what he had with him and he just gro– got blown up to smithereens.</span> <span id="s2869">So then I said, “Well, your turn.”</span> <span id="s2870">He said, “No, I’m not going.”</span> <span id="s2871">I said, “But you have to, you swore.”</span> <span id="s2872">“You can shoot me, I’m not going.</span> <span id="s2873">I’m not going to help those son of a bitches against those son of a bitches.”</span> <span id="s2874">So I said, “Well, you don’t have much choice, do we?</span> <span id="s2875">I have to shoot you.”</span> <span id="s2876">“Well, go ahead and shoot me.</span> <span id="s2877">You’re my friend.</span> <span id="s2878">I would rather be – be shot by a friend than – then relative.”</span> <span id="s2879">So I said, “Well,” I said, “I’m going to try, but be sure when we come back, don’t you ever tell.”</span> <span id="s2880">Said, “I’ll save my life, I won’t tell.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">09:19:11 So I went – I went to the first place, I went to a second place, there was still stuff around.</span> <span id="s2882">It was muddy also, but was quite muddy from the person who blew up.</span> <span id="s2883">And a dog came and for quite sometime – I don’t know if I had – it’s like I had affinity with dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">Actually when we walked – my group walked to the village and I was with them, not a single dog would bark.</span> <span id="s2885">And a bunch of dogs would fo– I would go – walk behind and a bunch of dogs would follow me and squeal – wanted to be petted.</span> <span id="s2886">So the dog came and he squealed and I petted him and he raised his – his – his leg and sprayed me from head to toe.</span> <span id="s2887">I was so mad at that dog.</span> <span id="s2888">I said, “If that was elsewhere, I would show you what is what.”</span> <span id="s2889">And the guards came by and the dog followed them and I was right at their feet there.</span> <span id="s2890">They never looked.</span> <span id="s2891">So I scrambled in – I walked in.</span> <span id="s2892">I had – I always ruled by 17, I had – my lucky 17.</span> <span id="s2893">So I went for my 17 charges, put them here and there.</span> <span id="s2894">Then I got out the same way, I watched the guards when they just passed.</span> <span id="s2895">I got from – was a kind of a half truck standing nearby, got from behind it.</span> <span id="s2896">Scrambled under one wire and a second wire and ran like hell.</span> <span id="s2897">Got to my boy, grabbed him and we both ran like hell.</span> <span id="s2898">We got to the forest.</span> <span id="s2899">Probably was a good kilometer, was like three-fourths of a mile.</span> <span id="s2900">He started the truck, we drove.</span> <span id="s2901">We drove like hell for about 10 - 15 minutes and it blew up.</span> <span id="s2902">The first explosion blew up all the windows in the truck, back and front.</span> <span id="s2903">And then it blew and it blew and it blew and it blew.</span> <span id="s2904">It was just like an atomic f –bomb fireworks.</span> <span id="s2905">They were preparing pa – putsch on Moscow and the Russians – and the Russian under – Soviet underground wanted badly to demolish this.</span> <span id="s2906">So that’s why my boys, after the war were invited to the big party.</span> <span id="s2907">“You did for us, you did for us, but now we don’t need you any more.</span> <span id="s2908">Also, people like you we don’t need here.</span> <span id="s2909">Out you go.”</span> <span id="s2910">And they asked about me and they said, “The Germans got him, probably killed him.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">09:21:55</span></p> <p><span id="s2912">Q: It’s interesting, I hear more bitterness in your voice about that than I have heard about other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s2914">I think we – I thought we did them, did them a favor.</span> <span id="s2915">I was sorry to have done it, but was fun to blow up that thing.</span> <span id="s2916">Oh my God, it was just like a – like a Easter Monday – like Easter Sunday.</span> <span id="s2917">You should see those explosions, sky high, flying in every direction.</span> <span id="s2918">Oh, it was a blow out.</span> <span id="s2919">I was practically intoxicated watching it.</span> <span id="s2920">But we were repaid and my friend Stefan Wojtyla mentioned it.</span> <span id="s2921">He said, “They would never do anything to you.”</span> <span id="s2922">So later on I wrote to somebody, “Ask Stefan what happened to my four boys.”</span> <span id="s2923">Later on he said, talked to some, “It was an aberration.”</span> <span id="s2924">Anyway, he went to his rewards.</span> <span id="s2925">I don’t know, maybe he – maybe he became a good Christian and is happy in paradise, playing the lyre.</span> <span id="s2926">But I kind of suspect that the good Lucifer is poking him with a fork now, là-bas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">Q: You lived in the – tell us a little bit about the displaced person’s camps.</span> <span id="s2928">When you got better –</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: Yes, when I – when I recei– became better, I was in a – a Hohenfels, then I was in Lohr, which was not really – it was like a hospital, it was called sanatorium.</span> <span id="s2930">Then I became better and I went – was sent to Aschaffenburg, Jäger Kaserne,a displaced person camp.</span> <span id="s2931">And I kind of convalesced there for a short while.</span> <span id="s2932">Then I work in the kitchen for a</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">122 There (French)</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">123 Barrack (German) time and I became an accountant in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2935">Well, the Jäger Kaserne was disbanded, we went to a da – different Kaserne, closer to Aschaffenburg, within a city, stay there for a time.</span> <span id="s2936">Then I worked as a courier there, for a time, between those three camps.</span> <span id="s2937">There was Ukrainian camp and two Polish camps.</span> <span id="s2938">Then we were se – to – moved again to a camp, Wildflecken, which is close to Schweinfurt in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s2939">It was enormous German army camp.</span> <span id="s2940">I think it was the ski troops that were trained there.</span> <span id="s2941">Enormous, there were probably 15 - 20,000 refugees there.</span> <span id="s2942">By that time I was – for a time I was stenographer for the police force and then became a detective and worked there for the duration as a detective until I left in 1949 for America.</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">Q: What did you investigate?</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">A: Local crimes, there were some murders, there were some rapes, there were some so called sui– faked up suicides – murders that looked like suicides.</span> <span id="s2945">There were malpractice, medical malpractice.</span> <span id="s2946">I had one medical malpractice where a lady went to have a appendix taken and the doctor forgot to tie one blood vessel and she bled to death, into her abdomen.</span> <span id="s2947">And some interesting cases.</span> <span id="s2948">Shoot – shoot-outs with gangs occasion, but very seldom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">09:25:21</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">Q: Gangs?</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">A: Well, there were Polish gangs that went – black market operators mostly.</span> <span id="s2952">Well, if for instance, we’d go to a farm and they would need a cow, they put boots on a cow legs and lead the cow to the camp and lead the cow to the fourth floor to the attic and slaughter it and have a lot of meat to sell.</span> <span id="s2953">It was all kind of shenanigans going on.</span> <span id="s2954">And from time to time I would make a document for somebody.</span> <span id="s2955">See, people who escaped from across – from there – behind Iron Curtain, some want – some had a hard time documenting themselves.</span> <span id="s2956">So when I felt that somebody was not guilty of anything and worthy, more or less, I would – I was specialist in sacram– sac– document forging.</span> <span id="s2957">When I was still in Polish underground, I went through a crash course and worked for sometime in the so called “psychological warfare.”</span> <span id="s2958">Kind of got to – little vacation from my group.</span> <span id="s2959">From a fighting group.</span> <span id="s2960">So I could make documents.</span> <span id="s2961">I can make you a document.</span> <span id="s2962">I can make a stamp.</span> <span id="s2963">I can forge your signature or your signature and your signature, if I – if I want to – if I practice long enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">09:26:42</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">Q: There’s a thread here, it’s like you’re very good at investigating and underground work and being, I think probably really analytical in assessing situations and being able to figure out how to handle them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">A: That’s why I’m still alive, I think.</span> <span id="s2967">Of course, holy providence had something to do with it, but most of the time I avoided getting killed.</span> <span id="s2968">I got beaten – I, I got almost finished off one time, when I worked in a tunnel.</span> <span id="s2969">I had a Kapo who was a Czech, he hated Poles and he hated me specially.</span> <span id="s2970">“You shitty little Polack.”</span> <span id="s2971">He would beat me up and do things to me.</span> <span id="s2972">So, one time I was working up – up there and he was passing by and I took the railroad tie and I put – put it down on him.</span> <span id="s2973">Got him hit quite badly.</span> <span id="s2974">Anyway, I was very sympathetic when I later on saw him.</span> <span id="s2975">“Oh, Gabriel you get hurt?</span> <span id="s2976">Oh, you poor thing, what happened to you?”</span> <span id="s2977">He said, “Some son of a bitch tossed a railroad tie on me.”</span> <span id="s2978">Anyway poor Gabriel got so bad that he lost his Kapo job and he got the shits and if you got those, you got loose stomach in a camp, you are done.</span> <span id="s2979">So, I even went and burned my portion of bread for two days and fed it to him.</span> <span id="s2980">Cause if you got very loose stomach, which was a killing thing, three days you are done – if you had enough bread and charred it and ate it, it would stop it.</span> <span id="s2981">So I fed the poor Gabriel with my own bread and every time I turn around, I felt like spitting in my face, helping that old son of a gun.</span> <span id="s2982">I mean he was old, he was 31, but he was old in comparison, I mean he was.</span> <span id="s2983">And I don’t even know if he survived or not because I was transferred to a different barrack and he stayed in the same barrack.</span> <span id="s2984">I don’t know if he made it or not.</span> <span id="s2985">That old Gabriel, Angel Gabriel, he was not.</span> <span id="s2986">I still got a little scar, he one time chopped me with a – with a shovel, just swung the shovel and cut me right over my forehead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">Q: How did you have compassion for him?</span> <span id="s2988">09:29:19 End of Tape #9</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">Tape #10</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">10:00:06</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">Q: This is an interview with Stefan Czyzewski.</span> <span id="s2993">It is April 8, 1998.</span> <span id="s2994">We are outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota.</span> <span id="s2995">This interview is conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape 10.</span> <span id="s2996">How – how did you have compassion for someone like the Czech Kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2998">I felt sorry for that – for that old, shitty son of a gun.</span> <span id="s2999">I kind of forgot what he had been before and didn’t really dwell upon it.</span> <span id="s3000">Things happen and you go.</span> <span id="s3001">And ordinarily we did help one another.</span> <span id="s3002">We did help one another.</span> <span id="s3003">It was kind of a dog eat dog at times, when some people tried to get to the top and become a top dog, they had to kill and steal and do the horrible things.</span> <span id="s3004">But there was cases people did help one another.</span> <span id="s3005">I didn’t – I don’t know if I felt compassion or if I were just – saw him so miserable, I said, “Okay, you dog, eat that bread.</span> <span id="s3006">Maybe – maybe your loose stomach will stop.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">Q: Did he change his attitude towards you, afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">A: He was still grumbling.</span> <span id="s3009">He didn’t call me names any more.</span> <span id="s3010">Because I wa– by that time I was stronger.</span> <span id="s3011">And he lost his job.</span> <span id="s3012">He lost his job.</span> <span id="s3013">He was not a lord almighty any more.</span> <span id="s3014">He could kill all 25 people he had, in one day, if he wanted to.</span> <span id="s3015">He would get 20 – a pack of cigarettes for it.</span> <span id="s3016">He did beat many people, I don – never saw him kill anybody, but he could if he wanted to.</span> <span id="s3017">So maybe he wasn’t very bad.</span> <span id="s3018">But angel Gabriel, he was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3019">Q: How – how do you think that – that – those experiences in the war and then in the camps, how did they shape you as a person?</span></p> <p><span id="s3020">A: I don’t think they made me any better.</span> <span id="s3021">Maybe they made me a little more understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">But they did not deflate my ego.</span> <span id="s3023">And I still talk a blue streak.</span> <span id="s3024">Well, they made me – surviving it made me very thankful, as I previously said.</span> <span id="s3025">I never prayer – had – pray a prayer of petition.</span> <span id="s3026">I always say a small prayer of thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s3027">So it made me appreciate life and the presently, I mean, I wake up every morning and I feel so free.</span> <span id="s3028">And I’m not hungry and I’m not cold.</span> <span id="s3029">And I have a darn good job.</span> <span id="s3030">I love books and I work with books.</span> <span id="s3031">I buy a lot of books, I’ll sell a few books.</span> <span id="s3032">I’ll read.</span> <span id="s3033">I work five and a half days in the bookstore.</span> <span id="s3034">Every second Monday, you go to public library, we get our 10 or 15 books, so we have something to read.</span> <span id="s3035">Sylvia reads too, a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">10:03:31</span></p> <p><span id="s3037">Q: Your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s3038">A: My wife, Sylvia reads a lot, too.</span> <span id="s3039">And every Thursday Sylvia comes downtown on a bus and we have lunch and we talk blue streak.</span> <span id="s3040">Because normally, after supper – when she has supper ready when I come from work.</span> <span id="s3041">I come on a bus and I walk a mile.</span> <span id="s3042">We eat supper, I wash the dishes and we sit with our noses in a book.</span> <span id="s3043">So, to preserve domestic tranquillity, we get together once a wook – once a week and we have a lunch out.</span> <span id="s3044">Just like one person said, I think it was a good saying, “My family – family ate out a lot, but they always went to the cheap places.”</span> <span id="s3045">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3046">Q: You said that you wake up and you think, “I’m not cold, I’m not hungry.”</span> <span id="s3047">A: And I’m free.</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">10:04:29</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">Q: “And I’m free.”</span> <span id="s3050">And that made me wonder, is that feeling of – of having everything taken away from you, of being hungry, or your freedom being taken away, is that a really real feeling sometimes?</span> <span id="s3051">Can you remember it like it’s right there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3052">A: I can – I can’t remember it.</span> <span id="s3053">Occasionally – well mainly, what – I remember it in the – in dreams.</span> <span id="s3054">I used to have nightmares.</span> <span id="s3055">Presently I have them very seldom.</span> <span id="s3056">I probably will have one next couple nights.</span> <span id="s3057">When I saw Schindler’s List – after I saw Schindler’s List, I had a couple real – just almost like – like it really happened there and I was there back – back there.</span> <span id="s3058">But it is so far away.</span> <span id="s3059">One time, St. Paul Cathedral was showing a film, Nacht– Night and Fog.</span> <span id="s3060">The film still exists.</span> <span id="s3061">It was made by the Polish French company and you can still get the video of it.</span> <span id="s3062">Anyway, I was asked to come and watch with them and to talk about it later on.</span> <span id="s3063">Well, it was shortly after I came here and after that went – that went through, I could not talk, mainly because I saw the steps.</span> <span id="s3064">Hundred and eighty-six steps from a stone quarry, leading to the camp in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s3065">And I walked those steps for 11 days, carrying a big stone.</span> <span id="s3066">When you first came into Mauthausen, you went through the introduction, you were put in a Strafkommando, punishment company.</span> <span id="s3067">You went down to the quarry and you went up, you went down.</span> <span id="s3068">Oh, it was about six, seven times a day and you took the biggest stone you could carry, because if you didn’t, when you got to about 100 steps up, the Kapo would look and said, “Hey you and you and you and you, step out there.</span> <span id="s3069">You stupid so and so.</span> <span id="s3070">Look at the rest of them, they are just breaking down, getting ruptures.</span> <span id="s3071">And you took two those little stones?”</span> <span id="s3072">So he give them a push and they would fly down.</span> <span id="s3073">And that happened just about every day.</span> <span id="s3074">Five, 10 - 15 -20 people would be killed a day, in the Strafkommando.</span> <span id="s3075">And sometime, when he had a special order, they would make people run.</span> <span id="s3076">It was Fliegerbrücke,the flying bridge.</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">There was a kind of a little platform and he would run people to the platform and they would fly down, like two or 300 feet.</span> <span id="s3078">And then the quarry supervisor started complaining that they messed – “He is messing up my work, so make him stop.</span> <span id="s3079">That so and so is</span></p> <p><span id="s3080">124 Night (German) 125 Flyer’s bridge (German) messing up my work.</span> <span id="s3081">He had all those – those – all that mess, those smashed prisoners there.</span> <span id="s3082">I have to clean it up every day.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">10:07:37 So it kind of abated, but he was still killing people.</span> <span id="s3084">If he didn’t do that, when you – didn’t like you or you got close up and the upper was kind of a steep road into the gate, front gate of the Grosse Tor – he would take your hat, we had those stripped berets – he would take it and make it fly beyond the post line.</span> <span id="s3085">And you had to put your stone down, everybody waited and you went to retrieve it.</span> <span id="s3086">And that was a no-no, because it was beyond the line, and people up on the tower there would open up and shoot you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3087">Sometimes they would just wound you, most of the time they would kill you.</span> <span id="s3088">And you had to go and retrieve your hat because if you walked to the gate, you had to take your hat and walk at attention, you know, your hat to your leg and walk stiffly and carry your big stone here, you know.</span> <span id="s3089">Straighten up.</span> <span id="s3090">SS at the gate, if you did not have a hat to take off, they would take you – take you aside and beat you – most of the time they would take you aside and shoot you.</span> <span id="s3091">There would be pile of people, dead bodies on the side, people who did not have their hats with them.</span> <span id="s3092">Those little exercises.</span> <span id="s3093">I made it for 11 days and lived to tell.</span> <span id="s3094">Anyway, it was kind of a little introduction to the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">Q: And so when you saw those steps again –</span></p> <p><span id="s3096">A: When I saw those steps, I could not talk.</span> <span id="s3097">Hundred and eighty-six steps – stone steps, quite steep.</span> <span id="s3098">Just try to walk 180 – 80 steep – 86 steps carrying nothing, at a good clip.</span> <span id="s3099">I don’t think I could now.</span> <span id="s3100">I walk up a bunch of steps when you go to state park and you hear, “Oh, let’s stand down for awhile, Steven, let’s take a rest.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">Q: Does it surprise you, what you were able to endure?</span></p> <p><span id="s3102">A: Yes, it does.</span> <span id="s3103">But in that time, it was nothing.</span> <span id="s3104">I just thought I was tough son of a gun.</span> <span id="s3105">I couldn– I could do anything.</span> <span id="s3106">Especially after surviving two and a half, almost – well not exactly three – is about two and a half years in Polish underground with a – with a fighting group.</span> <span id="s3107">That was a survival.</span> <span id="s3108">Later on, camp at times, was almost like a – well, kind of a mild danger.</span> <span id="s3109">You avoid this, you avoid that, you may live forever.</span> <span id="s3110">You are hungry, maybe you can organize something, you can steal something.</span> <span id="s3111">Maybe somebody will give you piece of bread.</span> <span id="s3112">Maybe you’ll catch a dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s3113">10:10:14</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">Q: And so, just tell us a little bit about how you left the displaced person’s camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">A: Yes, I – I stayed and worked most of the time, most of the people didn’t.</span> <span id="s3116">They didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s3117">People who stay in places who don’t have to work, they don’t want to work.</span> <span id="s3118">We talk sometime about our welfare people, they’re paid little and not to have to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s3119">People who don’t work, won’t work.</span> <span id="s3120">There were probably – out of five, eight, 10,000, in Wildflecken, maybe 200 of us who worked.</span> <span id="s3121">The rest of the people didn’t.</span> <span id="s3122">And I knew one person who was a black market operator, he was a rich – one rich young man.</span> <span id="s3123">And each person were living in a camp had to donate half a day work to the camp, like chopping trees for the fuel, sweeping streets or doing something.</span> <span id="s3124">Well, he didn’t.</span> <span id="s3125">So he was called to the camp director and the camp director said, “Mr. So and So, I have a report here you haven’t worked last week.”</span> <span id="s3126">And said, “Mr. Director, that’s a lie.</span> <span id="s3127">I never worked.”</span> <span id="s3128">“You never worked?</span> <span id="s3129">You are supposed to work.”</span> <span id="s3130">“I pay well, people who go and work for me.</span> <span id="s3131">When my time comes, there is a person who goes and works for me hard, for half a day or a day, I pay him well.</span> <span id="s3132">Mr. Director, that’s a lie, I never worked.”</span> <span id="s3133">That was the mentality of – that people developed.</span> <span id="s3134">Later on when they went to various countries, there were some were repatriated to Poland, but very few.</span> <span id="s3135">When Communism took over, they did not want to, as I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s3136">Many went to Canada, many went – many – some – everybody wanted to come to America.</span> <span id="s3137">Some went to Belgium, some went to England.</span> <span id="s3138">Many went to Australia and New Zealand.</span> <span id="s3139">While those people had – at times had a hard time adjusting back and going back to work.</span> <span id="s3140">So I stayed in Wildflecken until 1949 and the U.S. Catholic Conference found a sponsor here and I went through the consul and a doctor and document this and document that – all kind of little documents.</span> <span id="s3141">As the Russians said, “S propiskom vsyë mozhnazrobic.With a little card, you can do almost anything.</span> <span id="s3142">Ru– in Russia, if you had to have a propiskato move from place to place, to visit next village, you have to have a propiska issued by police because you cannot move freely.</span> <span id="s3143">Well, now maybe you can, but that time you could not.</span> <span id="s3144">So all this little documents and you had to go through a doctor and – well, I worked part time with American CIC.</span> <span id="s3145">They came one time when I was still in Aschaffenburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s3146">10:13:30</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">Q: CIC?</span></p> <p><span id="s3148">A: The American CIC people came and talked to me and said, “We are catching some of the German criminals and we kind of feel that you may some – have something against it, would you want to help us?”</span> <span id="s3149">“Sure.”</span> <span id="s3150">“How much you want to paid?”</span> <span id="s3151">“Paid?</span> <span id="s3152">If I had money, I would pay you.”</span> <span id="s3153">CIC was the counter-intelligent corps, U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s3154">There were two captains who worked there and I worked with them until full maturation.</span> <span id="s3155">One or two days a week I would get release from the police force and work with them.</span> <span id="s3156">We went across the green border into East Germany and occasionally apprehended somebody who was being searched for and brought him back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">Q: War criminals?</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">126 With a visa one can…anything (Russian)</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">127 Do (Polish)</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">128 Visa (Russian) 129 Counter Intelligence Corps</span></p> <p><span id="s3161">A: Nazis – war criminals, yes.</span> <span id="s3162">Q: The Nazis, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">A: And then questioned them.</span> <span id="s3164">Then when they had Polish Nazis questioned, I would help them question.</span> <span id="s3165">Then when he had Polish Communists sneaking in, I would help them question those.</span> <span id="s3166">So then they helped me a lot, too – to go through and get in.</span> <span id="s3167">Yes, but was mostly the Catholic organization who found me sponsor here.</span> <span id="s3168">I came to St. Paul, I lived with a old couple – old, ancient couple for quite some time, paid room and board.</span> <span id="s3169">Then I moved out and leaded my little – one little single room overlooking the whole city.</span> <span id="s3170">I had a beautiful view, it was up on a hill.</span> <span id="s3171">Old house with little rooms and a landlady who charged us very little rent.</span> <span id="s3172">It was a very carefree life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">Q: Is there something that I haven’t asked you that you’d like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">A: Not really, I think we just did almost everything.</span> <span id="s3175">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s3176">Yes, I – I met Hans Christian, who was my interrogator.</span></p> <p><span id="s3177">10:15:36</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">Q: Your German interrogator?</span></p> <p><span id="s3179">A: Yes, my German interrogator.</span> <span id="s3180">Ph.D. from Heidelberg University.</span> <span id="s3181">He was arrested, he was in jail under different name and Captain Wulkanowski took me – took me to Brückenau, where the man was in jail and he said, “Stefan, maybe you would like to talk to this man, he speaks Polish.”</span> <span id="s3182">So they took me to his cell and I said, “Hans Christian, what are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s3183">“Was machen Sie da hier?”</span> <span id="s3184">And he looked, he said, “Stefan?”</span> <span id="s3185">“Yeah.”</span> <span id="s3186">“Du bist no’ nit tot?”</span> <span id="s3187">I said, “Well, if I was dead, I’m resurrected.”</span> <span id="s3188">So I asked him what his name is and he had different name.</span> <span id="s3189">I said, “His name is Hans Christian.</span> <span id="s3190">He was in – a Gestapo interrogator.</span> <span id="s3191">When he was questioning me, he took me out four times and shot next to me, four different people and told me I was going to be the next one if I don’t tell him what he wants to know.</span> <span id="s3192">And I know that those people are not tried to be executed.”</span> <span id="s3193">I testified against him.</span> <span id="s3194">So he – Mister – Captain Wulkanowski said, “Well” – he chain him.</span> <span id="s3195">He chain him to the bed.</span> <span id="s3196">He said, “Stay a while.</span> <span id="s3197">Beat the shit out of him.”</span> <span id="s3198">I said, “Okay, I’ll stay with him for awhile.”</span> <span id="s3199">So we – I stayed and we talked.</span> <span id="s3200">He said, “Aren’t you going to beat me?”</span> <span id="s3201">I said, “No, I’m not going to beat you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3202">You will get your reward.”</span> <span id="s3203">He said, “Well, you know, really, I didn’t want to beat you either, but I was doing my job.”</span> <span id="s3204">Said, “Well, now I would be doing my job.”</span> <span id="s3205">So then I knocked on the door and said, “Well, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s3206">I’m going to testify against you, I know who you are.”</span> <span id="s3207">And I did.</span> <span id="s3208">And I understand that couple years later he wa– couple years 130 What are you doing there here?</span> <span id="s3209">(German) 131 Aren’t you dead yet?</span> <span id="s3210">(Austrian German) later he was hanged.</span> <span id="s3211">But I wasn’t asked to come to the execution.</span> <span id="s3212">And Captain Wulkanowski, I walked out and said, “Take my pistol, go and shoot the son of a bitch.”</span> <span id="s3213">I said, “Shoot him?</span> <span id="s3214">You people can hang him, I don’t want to shoot him.”</span> <span id="s3215">Yeah, Hans Christian.</span> <span id="s3216">Beautiful, tall, blonde man with blue eyes and beautiful bleach hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">10:18:10</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">Q: Some people would have wanted to kill him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3220">We promised ourselves, when we were in a camp, when we were in Gusen, when the freedom come, if we are alive, we will go burning, killing.</span> <span id="s3221">Not raping because we are not strong enough, but we will do horrible things here.</span> <span id="s3222">Nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s3223">The only one atrocity that we committed – that people committed in a camp – was a Spanish from a Spanish civil war – his name was Santacara.</span> <span id="s3224">He was Oberkapoof the first shift.</span> <span id="s3225">He had under him about 20,000 people.</span> <span id="s3226">And he beat people and he killed people, he drowned people.</span> <span id="s3227">If, if somebody he didn’t like, he would just pick them up and – and tip him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3228">[Technical conversation] He was very bad person, he would – didn’t like somebody, he would lead a person to a washroom, pick him up and put him in the barrel head first and drown him.</span> <span id="s3229">I mean he was just a bad person.</span> <span id="s3230">Anyway, there were a bunch of Russians who hated him, because he especially hated Russians, I don’t know why, because he was a Spanish Communist and the Russians were Russian Communists, but he hated them.</span> <span id="s3231">So they nailed him – they stripped him, they nailed him to the barrack by hands and feet and they took a heavy machine gun and they shot him to pieces.</span> <span id="s3232">And I watched – when I was in the hospital I watched out of my window – was – my bunk was next to the window, I watched it.</span> <span id="s3233">And I asked, “Who that was?”</span> <span id="s3234">“Oh, was Santacara.”</span> <span id="s3235">“Oh, Santacara.</span> <span id="s3236">May God be merciful of his, of – over – over his mortal soul – immortal soul.”</span> <span id="s3237">So I know one – saw one atrocity committed by the former prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s3238">Q: Is there anything else?</span> <span id="s3239">Besides these things?</span> <span id="s3240">I have got one question I’ve got ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3242">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">10:20:30</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">Q: You said that you– [Break in tape] befriend him and how did – how–?</span> <span id="s3245">Did he know who you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">132 Senior foreman (German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to supervise Kapos.</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">A: Yeah, well we met – we met in a beer joint, I mean we were – a drinking place.</span> <span id="s3248">And there were a couple street girls with me and I introduced him to them and he said, “Do you want to come tomorrow, have a drink with me?</span> <span id="s3249">I’ll bring some good schnapps.”</span> <span id="s3250">So I came the next day.</span> <span id="s3251">Instead of watery beer, he had some good schnapps, we had a drink and we used to meet from time to time.</span> <span id="s3252">And he even did me little favors.</span> <span id="s3253">He liked those two girls, apparently.</span> <span id="s3254">So later on discovered he was the supply officer, I kind of went clo– and I showed a bunch of money, said, “Would you like some money?”</span> <span id="s3255">“Ja, Ja.</span> <span id="s3256">What do you want me to sell you?”</span> <span id="s3257">I said, “A Schmeisser.”</span> <span id="s3258">“Ja.”</span> <span id="s3259">“Zwei Schmeissers?”</span> <span id="s3260">“Ja.”</span> <span id="s3261">“Fünf und zwanzig Schmeissers?”</span> <span id="s3262">“Twenty-five Schmeissers?”</span> <span id="s3263">“Ja.</span> <span id="s3264">Wieviel?</span> <span id="s3265">So I said, “Well, about 200,000 marks.”</span> <span id="s3266">“Well, zwei hundert, tausend?Hundert Schmeissers.”</span> <span id="s3267">“Ganz gut.”</span> <span id="s3268">So he – he sold it to me.</span> <span id="s3269">He had it delivered to a place where I want it, driving the truck himself, we unloaded it.</span> <span id="s3270">He went – happy with his money.</span> <span id="s3271">A good German can sell you his mother or daughter.</span> <span id="s3272">Well, I have a – after the war I had a lady who used to do my washing, a German lady, refugee lady who had a bunch of children and she escaped from the eastern part of Germany to western part of Germany, she has a daughter, was “Rita the Virgin.”</span> <span id="s3273">And I went out with her daughter a few times and she says, “Stefan, be sure that you don’t go to sleep with my daughter.”</span> <span id="s3274">I said, “Frau Anders, I would never go to sleep with a beautiful young girl.”</span> <span id="s3275">“Rita is a virgin.”</span> <span id="s3276">Well, we called her from then on, we called “Rita the Virgin.”</span> <span id="s3277">“I would let Rita sleep with a rich American who would give me a big bag of Polen kaffee– unground coffee.</span> <span id="s3278">Because ground coffee was always adulterated.</span> <span id="s3279">If a rich American came and gave me a big bag of Polen kaffee, I would let

second one from the left, in britches and funny hat.</span> <span id="s3297">I behave like a peacock of course.</span> <span id="s3298">I thought I was on the top of the world.</span> <span id="s3299">So that’s awful little.</span></p> <p><span id="s3300">[Technical conversation] Yeah, this was taken sometime in 1943, on Sunday afternoon.</span> <span id="s3301">It was shortly after my encounter with blowing the building where the Einsatzgruppen stayed.</span> <span id="s3302">And I came home to celebrate and that was my neighbor, his name is Tadeusz and I’m the one on the right.</span> <span id="s3303">And I looked blonde and bleached, with big, blue eyes.</span> <span id="s3304">Yeah, that is a – a shield of a 11th armored division.</span> <span id="s3305">Those were

people lived.</span> <span id="s3313">And I think I was on the way to see a pretty girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s3314">10:25:55 This was taken shortly after I did get out of a hospital and went to sanatorium.</span> <span id="s3315">My hair grow up and I gained a lot of weight.</span> <span id="s3316">Ate a lot of soup and gained weight, probably half a pound a day.</span> <span id="s3317">That is Hohenfels Erholungsheim.</span> <span id="s3318">That means “Hohenfels TB Sanatorium.”</span> <span id="s3319">It was a castle on a top of a hill that was used as a recuperation center for German flyers during the war and after war it became a TB sanatorium for refugees from all countries of Europe.</span> <span id="s3320">It is my Ausreise– it means document.</span> <span id="s3321">When I worked as a detective in Wildflecken displaced person camp.</span> <span id="s3322">It was at times fun, at times was little harrowing.</span> <span id="s3323">We met all kind of people, some criminals, some petty criminals.</span> <span id="s3324">It was an interesting job.</span></p> <p><span id="s3325">This is a transit camp in Hamburg-Altona.</span> <span id="s3326">We stayed there for about a week or so before taking ship to America.</span> <span id="s3327">That was a document issued to me by German authorities in Bamberg, when I was in the hospital there, denoting that I was an honest to goodness political prisoner of the German Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s3329">That was probably an important piece of paper to have.</span> <span

id="s3335">You have to ask – answer many questions.</span> <span id="s3336">They did not want – did not want anybody to sneak in.</span> <span id="s3337">So that is the document they finally issued to

Minnesota, conducted by Katie Davis and this is tape number 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s3344">A: All right.</span> <span id="s3345">This is a poem, written by Polish poet, whose name is Michal Piasecki.</span> <span id="s3346">He’s a Polish Jew who escaped the Holocaust simply because he escaped to Soviet Russia.</span> <span id="s3347">He spent the war times – war time in Magnitogorsk, in Ural Mountains, working for the Russians.</span> <span id="s3348">He had a great sympathy with the Communism and I don’t care too much for him, but he’s a good poet, I love his poems.</span> <span id="s3349">I’m translating some of his poems to be published in this country, here.</span> <span id="s3350">And this is one of them.</span> <span id="s3351">I would like to read it in Polish and English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">“Szabas Juz biel sosnowy stol zaslania, Zapada zmierzch.</span> <span id="s3353">W kuchni ogien gasnie.</span> <span id="s3354">W lichtarze mama wstawi swiece,

Our pine table is shrouded in white.</span> <span id="s3373">Dusk comes; kitchen fires die.</span></p> <p><span id="s3374">Candles in menorah mother will place, First star like diamond will shine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3375">Street empty.</span> <span id="s3376">I’ll close the shutters now.</span> <span id="s3377">Water vendor his yoke will put by the well, To synagogue he walks, counting his pennies.</span> <span id="s3378">Sabbath todi– today, Fiszel does not trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s3379">By the window, birch racing for the sky, Candlelight timidly shines afar.</span></p> <p><span id="s3380">Stillness, only aspen leaves whisper softly.</span> <span id="s3381">By mother hands, the light shines bright, By prie– by prayer blessed, so then suddenly alive.</span> <span id="s3382">This one and that one took flight to God, Praying and begging for plenty to all, Health of a husband and children’s health.</span></p> <p><span id="s3383">Father in a mood, not ugly, sat behind the table.</span> <span id="s3384">Did not loose faith in good times to come, So that instead of hope in the promissory notes, For his tedious sewing, simple cash will flow.</span> <span id="s3385">Three dishes served of yore in Jerusalem, Gefilte fish in fish sauce and a soft challah, Chicken soup with beans with angel hair macaroni, Hen – Jewish style – divided to make eight quarters of one.</span> <span id="s3386">Sabbath is for your rest, just like good Lord ordered And with His Torah to proclaim his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s3387">To perform ablutions and all those good deeds – Good deeds do always, not only on the Sabbath day.</span> <span id="s3388">My Sabbath was trampled in these times of horror, When evil mark was spotted in ancestral scrutiny.</span></p> <p><span id="s3389">Dahlias in bloom, charmed and enchanted us, Safe ha – safe harbor here I searched for in a Far Eastern way.</span> <span id="s3390">Sabbath at times comes in dreams.</span></p> <p><span id="s3391">The same stars are shining by, The same dahlias still bloom.</span></p> <p><span id="s3392">And still of great old times, we daydream.”</span> <span
