McConahey.</span> <span id="s7">I was born in Pittsburgh, on May 7, 1916, and at age nine moved to Sharon, Pennsylvania, where I grew up, as a young boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Tell me about your military career, or your military involvement.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: I went to Harvard Medical School and graduated in 1942.</span> <span id="s10">At that time, the war was on, and most of my classmates, I think, had military commissions.</span> <span id="s11">I took one in the Army.</span> <span id="s12">I then had an internship in Philadelphia General Hospital where I interned until the end of June, 1943.</span> <span id="s13">I then was called to active service by the Army on July 17, 1943.</span> <span id="s14">I was assigned to the Medical Field Service School at Carlyle Barracks in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s15">This was a place where all medical officers began and got a quick, six-weeks indoctrination into the Army as far as how to act, what the military medical corps was like, map reading, field exercises, and many things such as this.</span> <span id="s16">At the conclusion of this, I was then assigned to my first station at Camp Carson, Colorado, with the 71st Light Division.</span> <span id="s17">This was a new concept at that time.</span> <span id="s18">The Germans had had a light division, which was pretty good in European action, and so the U.S. Army was going to try some light divisions.</span> <span id="s19">Our division in Colorado Springs, Camp Carson, Colorado, had only carts.</span> <span id="s20">We had no jeeps.</span> <span id="s21">We had pack mules for our equipment.</span> <span id="s22">And so, for the next some months, we maneuvered and practiced up in the Rocky Mountains with our mules and our mobile units to carry into combat.</span> <span id="s23">Then in about January of 1944, this would be, they got some orders to send some of us medical officers elsewhere, because the division, the 71st Division, was going to be shipped to California for further maneuvers, and they were, in a way, being re-formed.</span> <span id="s24">As a matter of fact, the 71st Division later became a regular standard division, and it was no longer a light division.</span> <span id="s25">So it was sort of done over and re-formed at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">I was ordered to report to Fort Dix, New Jersey, in, I think, late January or early February of 1944, with the 90th Division.</span> <span id="s27">The 9th Infantry had been training in the desert, mostly around Texas, and they were now fully trained for combat, were going overseas to England, and they needed to bring up to strength their membership, and they were short some medical officers, so I was sent to Fort Dix to join the 90th Division.</span> <span id="s28">We were there a short time.</span> <span id="s29">I got to know my fellow officers and the men in my medical section, and I was assigned to be an assistant battalion surgeon with the 337th Infantry, with the 3rd Battalion.</span> <span id="s30">Then on, I think, about March 23rd, we sailed out of New York harbor on troop ships for England.</span> <span id="s31">I was on the “Dominion Monarch.”</span> <span id="s32">This was a British boat which had been built for the run from England to New Zealand to bring back meat to England, built just before the war started.</span> <span id="s33">Down in the hold were bunks and hammocks for the enlisted men.</span> <span id="s34">The officers were in bunks, given cabins, with about three officers to a tiny cabin, and we crossed the Atlantic in this way.</span> <span id="s35">It was a rough crossing.</span> <span id="s36">It was March.</span> <span id="s37">There were a lot of storms around.</span> <span id="s38">Of course they were worrying about U-boats and attacks, and we had a convoy of around 60 ships.</span> <span id="s39">We were convoyed by destroyers and I think American ships convoyed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And this was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: This was in March of 1944.</span> <span id="s42">It took about ten days, you know, to cross the Atlantic, zig-zag back-and-forth.</span> <span id="s43">And we finally got safely to, I think Liverpool.</span> <span id="s44">We landed and disembarked, and then we were marched to trains and taken to our billets in England, where we were stationed in the Midland, not too far from Birmingham, England.</span> <span id="s45">Here we were then, from, if I remember, the first week in April.</span> <span id="s46">During April and May we did a lot of getting things ready, and taking hikes and getting in condition.</span> <span id="s47">And we learned about the end of May that we were, quote, “on the first team,” which didn’t please me too much.</span> <span id="s48">It meant we were going in pretty close to D-Day.</span> <span id="s49">We had no idea where, or what.</span> <span id="s50">We just were told that we were going to be on some of the assault troops somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Let’s go back to what D-Day was.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: D-Day was the day on which we were to land on the coast of Europe.</span> <span id="s53">We didn’t know where it would be, France, the Balkans, Greece, Norway, we had no idea where.</span> <span id="s54">We were going to land somewhere to engage the German army, to attempt to fight through to join the Russians and end the war in Europe.</span> <span id="s55">So we were trained, we got ready, and finally one day we were told that camp is sealed.</span> <span id="s56">First we went from there to the coast, from the camp down near Bristol and Cardiff in Wales, which we knew was near the embarkation point.</span> <span id="s57">And there we were for about a week.</span> <span id="s58">And then one night the camp was told we were going to get on the ships the next day, and we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">B: We marched down to the shore and loaded onto an American army troop ship -- troop transport.</span> <span id="s60">We were there about a day -- because we later learned D-Day had been delayed one day, we were an extra day in port -- and then sailed.</span> <span id="s61">I think, on about June 5th.</span> <span id="s62">We put out to sea, and were out to sea when D-Day happened on June 6th.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">There were two American beachheads on Normandy.</span> <span id="s64">One was Omaha beach made by the 1st Division, and the 29th Division, and Utah beach, which was made by the 4th Division and the 90th Division, which is the one I was with.</span> <span id="s65">Now we had no idea where we were going to be going in until we got to sea, and then they told us we’d land in Normandy.</span> <span id="s66">We got the maps, we were told exactly what we were going to do, where we’re going to be, what we’re supposed to do.</span> <span id="s67">Our group was to go in on D+2, that is on June 8th, two days after the beachheads had been made.</span> <span id="s68">Part of our division came in with the 4th Infantry, the 339th Infantry with the 4th Division on D-Day on Utah beach, and the rest of us came in on D+2, that’s two days later.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Utah beach was the easier of the two.</span> <span id="s70">Omaha was a terrible beach.</span> <span id="s71">They lost a lot of men.</span> <span id="s72">They almost got tossed back into the sea.</span> <span id="s73">They barely made it in, with great casualties.</span> <span id="s74">Utah beach was easier.</span> <span id="s75">The Germans weren’t as strong at that point and they didn’t have too many casualties.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">The paratroopers jumped ahead of us -- the 82nd Airborne had jumped inland to obtain the causeway.</span> <span id="s77">You see the Germans had flooded the land behind the beaches.</span> <span id="s78">If we landed on the beaches, on the sand, we couldn’t have gone inland, because we were trapped by all that water.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: This was in what country now?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: This was in Normandy, on the eastern shore of Normandy.</span> <span id="s81">But there were four causeways, four roads that went through the water from the beach to the main land.</span> <span id="s82">And the airborne troops jumped to hold those causeways so we could get in.</span> <span id="s83">And they did.</span> <span id="s84">They jumped inland ahead of us, and held the causeways so when our boys got in, they could go from the beach, across the causeways, into the land and engage the enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">So then we landed on June 8th.</span> <span id="s86">At that time the front had moved inland a bit, several miles, so there wasn’t any fighting on the shore, but there were still shells landing around the ships and there still was the sound of battle in the distance.</span> <span id="s87">We then went inland.</span> <span id="s88">I marched my aide station of 32 men inland to the place where we were to rendezvous and found a place where we stopped, dug foxholes for the night, and got ready to spend the first night ashore.</span> <span id="s89">We then got our jeeps in, which had our medical equipment, and by the next day we were ready to go.</span> <span id="s90">And so at midnight -- well about dark, eleven o’clock at night perhaps -- on June 9th we formed into files and started towards the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Now Ste. Mere Eglise was the first little town taken in Normandy by the American troops.</span> <span id="s92">The paratroopers took this in their jumps.</span> <span id="s93">And we were right outside Ste. Mere Eglise.</span> <span id="s94">The 82nd Airborne was holding a line a couple of miles outside of Ste. Mere Eglise -- the other side of it -- and we were ordered to relieve them and start the attack on the Germans going through.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">So we marched up and stopped just before dawn on June 10th at the Meteret River, which had been flooded by the Germans, and you could hardly get across, except on one bridge.</span> <span id="s96">It was really a small stream, but they dammed it up, so it was very wide -- just flooded -- and all sort of swampy.</span> <span id="s97">And about dawn, we started our attack across the bridge.</span> <span id="s98">That’s when we began our fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">The division then fought through France.</span> <span id="s100">We were part of the First Army, during our initial Normandy fighting.</span> <span id="s101">Once we were out of Normandy, we became part of General Patton’s Third Army, and the rest of the war we were with Patton’s Third Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">His famous attack around the Germans at Falaise, the Falaise Gap attack, where he trapped the German Seventh Army, we were in this.</span> <span id="s103">We then turned east, went south of Paris across the Seine River and through World War I battlefronts, the Argonne, and St. Mayenne, up to Verdun.</span> <span id="s104">And we were going as fast as we could without much opposition at that time.</span> <span id="s105">We broke out of Normandy and we got to Reims, France.</span> <span id="s106">Ran out of gas.</span> <span id="s107">We simply outstripped our supplies.</span> <span id="s108">Had to stop there to re-group, and during this time, the Germans came back and held some of the forts that they held on the front, so when we got going again, we were slowed down and never got the momentum again, because they had come back and held the line.</span> <span id="s109">Metz was as far as we could go, and they were then holding the Metz forts, and we had to stop there for several months.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: What were your duties all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: I was as far forward as medical officers got.</span> <span id="s112">I was in charge of an aid station taking care of the wounded.</span> <span id="s113">My work was entirely first aid.</span> <span id="s114">I did nothing else.</span> <span id="s115">We would be about a mile perhaps behind the front line.</span> <span id="s116">I had an aid station where I would get under cover, in a barn or an orchard if I had to, but usually a house somewhere.</span> <span id="s117">I needed to work inside.</span> <span id="s118">At night I’d have to use the lights and black it out so you couldn’t be seen, and if it was raining we had to be inside because of the wounded, so we tried to get some kind of cover.</span> <span id="s119">I would be remaining close to the battalion headquarters for communications, and I’d be within a mile or so, or less sometimes, of the front lines.</span> <span id="s120">And each battalion, you see, had three rifle companies and a heavy weapons company -- four companies -- and that would be a battalion.</span> <span id="s121">And the battalion aid station would take care of their casualties.</span> <span id="s122">And with each company we had three aid men.</span> <span id="s123">So in my medical group, I had, then, about ten or fifteen aid men who were technicians, medical technicians, to help with the wounded, and a couple of jeep drivers.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">We had put litters -- sort of litter frames -- on our jeeps so we could pile two litters on a jeep.</span> <span id="s125">If we got a call that there was some wounded at a certain company, I would send the litter jeep out.</span> <span id="s126">They would go up, four litter bearers and the driver.</span> <span id="s127">They would see where the wounded were, put them on the litters, load them on the jeep, and bring them back to the aid station, where I would take care of them.</span> <span id="s128">Next, behind us, was a collection company, and they were the next echelon, for taking care of the wounded.</span> <span id="s129">They had places for rough, quick surgery -- suturing, maybe doing some minor surgical repair.</span> <span id="s130">All I did was to stop bleeding, put on splints, give morphine.</span> <span id="s131">We gave a lot of plasma.</span> <span id="s132">We had this blood plasma with us -- cases of it.</span> <span id="s133">We gave a lot of this in the lifesaving of the wounded.</span> <span id="s134">We gave them the plasma right away, which was a substitute for blood.</span> <span id="s135">Because we had no blood.</span> <span id="s136">This was plasma, without you see, without the red cells in it, but it would stop shock.</span> <span id="s137">They’d do well until they got back to the next station, the collecting company.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">And so my job was to get the wounded out of the front lines, take care of them at my station, splint bones, fractures, stop bleeding, dress wounds, stop shock, stop pain, and get them back farther where they could get better care in a more stable installation.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: You were kind of on the march.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yes, we moved a great deal.</span> <span id="s141">We would be in position maybe two or three hours, maybe two or three days.</span> <span id="s142">But we would move quickly.</span> <span id="s143">We had our materials, our equipment, all in big boxes, cases.</span> <span id="s144">We would close them up and hop in a jeep and be gone in ten minutes.</span> <span id="s145">We kept in close touch with the battalion command post to know where they’re going to go.</span> <span id="s146">And we would try to keep close to the front line troops at all times.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">We, of course, weren’t armed.</span> <span id="s148">The medics in the European war, they had all decided to use the Geneva convention.</span> <span id="s149">Not so Japan, of course.</span> <span id="s150">But the Germans respected the Red Cross usually, and so we were safer to carry no arms and have the Red Cross markings.</span> <span id="s151">We really displayed them.</span> <span id="s152">We had them on our helmets, we had four Red Crosses, front and back and both sides painted.</span> <span id="s153">We wore Red Cross armbands on both arms, and on out jeeps we had a Red Cross flag.</span> <span id="s154">And they didn’t fire on us, usually.</span> <span id="s155">As a matter of fact, my life was saved, no doubt, several times, by being on that Red Cross jeep and having a Red Cross band.</span> <span id="s156">And I think that in general there was very little attacking of unarmed medics by the German Army.</span> <span id="s157">I won’t say the same for the SS troops.</span> <span id="s158">That was different.</span> <span id="s159">The ordinary troops, Wehrmacht, no; they were very decent soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: So what kind of path did you take, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: We went from Normandy, then broke out of Normandy, up to west of Paris, then swung south of Paris, across the river over to Reims in the northern part of France, then east to Verdun, and then to Metz.</span> <span id="s162">Metz is in the Alsace-Lorraine area, right near the German border.</span> <span id="s163">And this was on the Moselle River, which was about 60 miles, I guess, from there to the Rhine River.</span> <span id="s164">And that was the big barrier, the Moselle River and the Metz forts, that stopped us.</span> <span id="s165">Once we broke the Metz forts and started east, we then fought our way to the Rhine River, and our division then turned south.</span> <span id="s166">At Coblenz, the Moselle River comes into the Rhine, and makes a kind of triangle there.</span> <span id="s167">We crossed the Moselle River going south, went on south, down along the west bank of the Rhine for maybe 30 miles, and suddenly turned east and crossed the Rhine -- this is now about in March, I guess, of ’45 -- and turned north to Frankfurt, Germany, and east again right straight across and finally ending up in Czechoslovakia the end of April or early May of ’45.</span> <span id="s168">The war ended then on May 8th.</span> <span id="s169">We were in Czechoslovakia, near Pilzen, when the war ended.</span> <span id="s170">As we moved into the central part of Germany, we started hearing reports about the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s171">There had been a couple of them liberated and captured.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Who were you hearing reports from?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: From the Army, from our buddies, from the Army headquarters.</span> <span id="s174">Every day we’d get a briefing on enemy possibilities, and reports about what’s going on here and there.</span> <span id="s175">We would hear that these camps had been liberated, that there’d been some very terrible things seen.</span> <span id="s176">I think on April 23rd or thereabouts, our division liberated the Flossenburg concentration camp.</span> <span id="s177">I heard right away about this, and the next day I went to be there as a medical officer.</span> <span id="s178">We were a few miles from there in my aid station, so we took the jeep and some of my other officer friends and drove over to witness it.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Now Flossenburg was not the most famous camp in Germany, but it was one of the real, honest-to-gosh concentration camps.</span> <span id="s180">This held 15,000 prisoners, and altogether 60,000 to 100,000 people had been through there, because of course they died by the thousands.</span> <span id="s181">The camp was next to an airplane factory where the prisoners worked on some airplane parts, and they stayed in the camp.</span> <span id="s182">When we got there, there were only 1,500 inmates left.</span> <span id="s183">There’d been about 15,000 shortly before, but as the army got close, the German guards marched out about 13,000 toward Dachau, to get away from our advancing army.</span> <span id="s184">When I arrived, the gates were open.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Was this during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: This was during the day, in the morning.</span> <span id="s187">And there were great gaps in the barbed wire, I think by the prisoners.</span> <span id="s188">They were so delirious to get out, that they ripped the thing open, and some of them got hurt by doing it.</span> <span id="s189">The guards had left.</span> <span id="s190">They’d run.</span> <span id="s191">And there were no Germans around at all at that time.</span> <span id="s192">Only the inmates.</span> <span id="s193">So I had a good look at the camp.</span> <span id="s194">Now as I went in, there were a few, very emaciated prisoners wandering around in their prison garb, with their blue and white striped uniforms on.</span> <span id="s195">And we just sort of walked around and talked to some and looked at the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">The camp was laid out in a very neat barracks-style with two big barbed wire enclosures around it, one about a ten-foot fence on the inside.</span> <span id="s197">On the outside was about a 14 foot electrified barbed wire fence.</span> <span id="s198">And outside that, of course, they patrolled with police dogs and SS troops, when the prison was there.</span> <span id="s199">The camp had, running through it, like a little railroad, a push cart type, with rails and a cart.</span> <span id="s200">Like you see in some of the mines in Kentucky, you know, a little hand cart you can shove around -- they’re there to cart the coal in -- which they would take through the camp every day to pick up the dead!</span> <span id="s201">And haul out the dead bodies, to burn!</span> <span id="s202">I followed this cart up to the crematory.</span> <span id="s203">And here was the crematory, on one end of the camp, and it was still going strong, because they were still dying like flies.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Who was operating the crematory?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Well at that time, three inmates.</span> <span id="s206">What the SS did would be to get inmates to run the crematory.</span> <span id="s207">And that was their job -- to burn the corpses!</span> <span id="s208">And they were still there.</span> <span id="s209">They were prisoners, they were still there, and for sanitation, you had to do something!</span> <span id="s210">Because they were dying right and left.</span> <span id="s211">There were about 15 or 16 corpses lined up to be burned as I walked in this building -- each one about 40 pounds, I guess.</span> <span id="s212">You could pick them up with one hand, I think.</span> <span id="s213">They were just skin and bone.</span> <span id="s214">Nothing there.</span> <span id="s215">And one of them opened the furnace door, and there were a couple of bodies in there, sizzling away.</span> <span id="s216">And they would take the ashes out and dump them outside when they were through and put in some more!</span> <span id="s217">And this had been going on for years!</span> <span id="s218">And this was still going on, because they were still dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">The prisoners had been fed almost nothing.</span> <span id="s220">They would get some very thin soup once a day.</span> <span id="s221">That’s all they got.</span> <span id="s222">Maybe a potato or two, mostly water.</span> <span id="s223">They worked six days a week in the plant, and the seventh day they got beaten most of the day, and tortured and kicked around so it wasn’t a rest day.</span> <span id="s224">It was certainly a most horrible place for existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">I think we should remember as Americans that this was a place – that came out during the Nuremburg Trial -- that on Christmas Eve, 1944, the Germans had a big party for the inmates -- had a Christmas tree decorated -- and they hanged 15 American paratroopers.</span> <span id="s226">Just hung them up, on the tree, as decorations.</span> <span id="s227">The inmates had to watch it.</span> <span id="s228">This was their Christmas for their inmates!</span> <span id="s229">The SS’s celebration!</span> <span id="s230">That all came out in the Nuremburg Trials, so I think it’s no rumor.</span> <span id="s231">This is where Edvell Kanaris died.</span> <span id="s232">He was the -- I think -- intelligence chief of Germany, who really was an anti-Hitler man and finally got caught and was sentenced and put in Flossenburg concentration camp and killed there.</span> <span id="s233">Also, the famous German Protestant theologian (Dietrich Bonhoeffer) was imprisoned there, and died.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">So I saw the crematory, and as I say, they were still picking up the dead and burning them.</span> <span id="s235">They had to, I guess.</span> <span id="s236">And then I walked back and walked into the barracks where the prisoners had been kept, and some were still there.</span> <span id="s237">These were very drab, cold barracks, with three tiers of bunks on each side.</span> <span id="s238">Each bunk had nothing but boards.</span> <span id="s239">No straw, no mattress, no nothing.</span> <span id="s240">And on this, three people slept.</span> <span id="s241">It was big enough for one, but three slept on that every night in these tiers.</span> <span id="s242">And then I visited the “hospital” -- which I’ll put in quotation marks.</span> <span id="s243">This was a building where they brought them to die.</span> <span id="s244">If they could no longer stand, they’d put them in there on the floor.</span> <span id="s245">It had straw on the floor, but nothing else -- bare wooden floor with straw on it.</span> <span id="s246">They’d put the prisoners there, and they’d lie in their excrement and vomitus, and they’d die.</span> <span id="s247">Then they’d haul them out to the crematory and burn them.</span> <span id="s248">And no medical care of any sort!</span> <span id="s249">They put an SS doctor there, they told me.</span> <span id="s250">This is what I heard from the prisoners.</span> <span id="s251">I didn’t see him, he was dead.</span> <span id="s252">They said he was a very sadistic guy who would do experimentation on prisoners, did a lot of “surgery.”</span> <span id="s253">He’d hack off an arm or anything he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s254">He finally caught typhus and died.</span> <span id="s255">I think there was bloody justice.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Did they tell you the name of that doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: They did not, no.</span> <span id="s258">I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s259">By the way, my jeep driver was a boy from North Saint Paul, Peter Weedel.</span> <span id="s260">He’s now dead.</span> <span id="s261">Peter grew up in a German family and spoke fluent German, so he could converse with all these people, and he had quite a conversation with many, many prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Do you remember any of these conversations?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s264">They were from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s265">They were Poles, Russians, Czechs, French, Belgian, Spanish -- and they weren’t all Jewish people.</span> <span id="s266">They had a lot of the Jewish there, of course, but many were political prisoners.</span> <span id="s267">And one of the doctors, who wouldn’t give the names of some of the underground people.</span> <span id="s268">And a boy of fourteen had been there for two years -- a fourteen year old boy, now sixteen.</span> <span id="s269">We talked to them about what had been going on.</span> <span id="s270">They told us about the terror of the SS.</span> <span id="s271">That they’d get them out in line every morning for their inspection.</span> <span id="s272">If they didn’t pull their hats off quick enough and bow to the SS, they’d beat them unconscious.</span> <span id="s273">And every time an SS man walked by, they’d stop and bow and take their hats off.</span> <span id="s274">If they didn’t do it fast enough, they’d knock them down.</span> <span id="s275">They used to have a special sport on Sunday, which wasn’t a work day.</span> <span id="s276">They’d have “fun.”</span> <span id="s277">They’d make them clean out latrines with their hands.</span> <span id="s278">They’d make them haul latrine buckets with their teeth in races.</span> <span id="s279">They would beat them unmercifully.</span> <span id="s280">They all bore the scars of beatings and being knocked around.</span> <span id="s281">And some of their spirits were broken.</span> <span id="s282">They were just shells.</span> <span id="s283">They’d had it, and they were never any good, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s284">Some still had the zip and sparkle of life, but a lot of them were gone.</span> <span id="s285">They were walking around, but they’d lost the will to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">In the crematory where these guards were burning the corpses, those fellows were really pretty much zombies, too.</span> <span id="s287">And I think what happened there is that after those guys knew too much, they’d kill them and toss them in the furnace too.</span> <span id="s288">They were a crew that had been brought in to do the job for a while, and later they’d have been tossed in there too.</span> <span id="s289">They were pretty much beaten and cowed and lost the sparkle of life entirely, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">As we walked out of the camp, I saw the road where the 13,000 had started down towards Dachau -- a very poignant, sad looking road, because you knew they were marched out carrying some blankets and maybe a jacket.</span> <span id="s291">And along the road, they would get tired, and they couldn’t carry it, and they’d drop it off the side.</span> <span id="s292">They were too weak to carry even a coat or a blanket!</span> <span id="s293">And if they dropped in the road, they were beaten unconscious and left to die, or shot by an SS trooper.</span> <span id="s294">So they tried to make it and not fall, but they would drop everything they had, leave it there, because they couldn’t carry it.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">In the camp the sick were still dying.</span> <span id="s296">We couldn’t save them.</span> <span id="s297">We tried to feed some of those people, and really, we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s298">They hadn’t eaten for so long that for some, if they got food in, they vomited and bloated and obstructed.</span> <span id="s299">We had to put them in a hospital and get them back on small feedings very slowly over a period of weeks to get them back to normal life!</span> <span id="s300">They couldn’t start eating food like I was doing at that time.</span> <span id="s301">They had to go very slowly.</span> <span id="s302">And so you couldn’t save them!</span> <span id="s303">We felt terrible!</span> <span id="s304">They were dying under our eyes!</span> <span id="s305">Nothing we could do, because they were so close to death, and you couldn’t feed them.</span> <span id="s306">Some, of course, made it.</span> <span id="s307">They did take a little food and got better.</span> <span id="s308">Some of them hadn’t been in there as long as others, and they were stronger and hadn’t lost as much weight.</span> <span id="s309">They got out.</span> <span id="s310">But a lot of them didn’t, even once we got there.</span> <span id="s311">Very sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: What were some of the other conversations that you had with the prisoners that you can recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Well, it’s a long time ago.</span> <span id="s314">I can’t remember exactly everything that was said.</span> <span id="s315">I remember talking to some people.</span> <span id="s316">Why they were there.</span> <span id="s317">And the story of one was, he’d been with the French underground and caught.</span> <span id="s318">He was a “criminal.”</span> <span id="s319">So they threw him in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s320">I think that these were political prisoners, they were anti-Hitler, several of them.</span> <span id="s321">Many of the Jewish people, of course, they were there because they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s322">But actually, many of those had died before this.</span> <span id="s323">This was 1945.</span> <span id="s324">And so many of the ones that were left – there were more of the political prisoners that had been put in recently.</span> <span id="s325">And their stories were simply that they’d been picked up by the Gestapo at night, because they either had been subversive, or they thought they were anti-Hitler and anti-government, and were tossed in without trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">We also saw an underground torture room.</span> <span id="s327">This was a bare cement basement vault with hooks in the ceiling where they would take prisoners there, and hang ‘em by their thumbs, and beat them senseless, kick them in the testicles, burn them, and then maybe shoot them in the end, perhaps.</span> <span id="s328">And the prisoners told me that they would hear at night these screams of the tortured prisoners in the cells below, and the shots of pistols, and they knew what was going in, and it might be their turn next.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">I couldn’t comprehend it, really.</span> <span id="s330">I felt, here I am.</span> <span id="s331">I can see this.</span> <span id="s332">But unless I lived here and were one of these people, I couldn’t know what it was like.</span> <span id="s333">And I thank my Good Lord I never did have to do this, but I don’t think that I could understand what it was like to be there without having really been there.</span> <span id="s334">The hopelessness of it.</span> <span id="s335">No way out.</span> <span id="s336">Only torture, only misery, only starvation and finally death.</span> <span id="s337">It’s just a terrible, terrible thing to look at.</span> <span id="s338">You need to be there, to really understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: How long were you at Flossenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Probably about four or five hours, I think.</span> <span id="s341">I did what I could for the sick and the injured, and then they were moving in an ambulance to take out some to hospitals.</span> <span id="s342">So we simply talked to people, got their stories, gave what first aid we could to the sick and injured and then went back to our unit, because we were moving on.</span> <span id="s343">The war wasn’t over yet.</span> <span id="s344">Our division was advancing after the Germans and we were heading towards Czechoslovakia, and so we had to keep up with our own troops and take care of the wounded and be with them.</span> <span id="s345">We couldn’t stay for a long time.</span> <span id="s346">But they did bring in more base army hospital units to help clean up the mess in these camps after we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Did you ever hear after you left, what became then of the people in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: No, I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s349">I just know that they did have trouble, as I said, in saving them, even later, because of their atrophic stomachs -- no food for a long time.</span> <span id="s350">They did put them in hospitals before they could send them back home, to get them built up a bit.</span> <span id="s351">I got to Dachau.</span> <span id="s352">I saw that after it was liberated, if you’d like to talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s354">What month and year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: After the war ended, in Czechoslovakia, our division moved back into Germany, and I came home, then, in October.</span> <span id="s356">But during that period from about May to October, we were on occupation duty in eastern Germany, in a county, and ran the civil government, and took care of the medical affairs there.</span> <span id="s357">So I did have some time to travel, and one day, with some of my comrades, I got a command car and drove down to Munich, where Dachau concentration camp was.</span> <span id="s358">This was now probably two months, three months after the war, so it was all over, and all the prisoners were gone, and just the camp was there.</span> <span id="s359">But I did tour it with a guy who had been an inmate there himself, a young Pole who was still there.</span> <span id="s360">And we saw Dachau from top to bottom.</span> <span id="s361">We went into the main door.</span> <span id="s362">Dachau was a much bigger camp, of course, than Flossenburg.We again toured the barracks where they had the prisoners.</span> <span id="s363">We saw the crematories -- they had about six big ovens there, where they burned the corpses -- and outside there were stacked up by the thousands, jars of bones!</span> <span id="s364">Burned bones, ashes, of people who had been burned there.</span> <span id="s365">And I was told they used these for fertilizing the gardens.</span> <span id="s366">And I’m told also, that sometimes, if some Germans were shipped there for political prisoners and died, they would later send the family a pile of bones, “Here’s your loved one’s bones.”</span> <span id="s367">They might be anybody’s bones!</span> <span id="s368">They’d just pick up a pot and send it!</span> <span id="s369">We saw the whipping posts outside where they used to beat the prisoners for various minor offenses.</span> <span id="s370">We saw the torture chambers there -- they had big ones -- where they used to hang them by their thumbs, and beat them.</span> <span id="s371">And we were told that this is where many of the conspirators -- German conspirators for the anti-Hitler plot -- had been killed, and tortured.</span> <span id="s372">When Hitler had missed the bomb in that bunker, you remember there was a big to-do when they arrested anybody that might have been implicated in this business, and put ‘em in Dachau, and they were all killed there.</span> <span id="s373">And I was told that those political prisoners, they simply hung them up by their necks and let them strangle and suffocate.</span> <span id="s374">Didn’t hang them like a drop through a trap door, break their neck.</span> <span id="s375">They’d hang them and they’d suffocate, and they would kick and wiggle on the piano wire and they too pictures of this and Hitler looked at them.</span> <span id="s376">He wanted to see the whole thing, watch these enemies of his being slowly strangled.</span> <span id="s377">He was sitting in his bunker and watched this when they took it back to him.</span> <span id="s378">He thought it was great!</span> <span id="s379">There were thousands and thousands in Dachau at one time!</span> <span id="s380">It was simply another incredible camp of degradation and terror and horror and torture and suffering and the whole business.</span> <span id="s381">It was another story just like Flossenburg, only on a bigger scale.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Were you able to talk to any people who had been inmates at Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Just this one young Pole that showed us through the camp.</span> <span id="s384">He spoke a little English, and he did speak some German which my interpreter could talk to him.</span> <span id="s385">He told us about the beatings.</span> <span id="s386">And what they would be for?</span> <span id="s387">For nothing.</span> <span id="s388">They’d haul ‘em out of line and beat them on these whipping posts.</span> <span id="s389">That they worked them hard every day, That they were often kicked around.</span> <span id="s390">And that they had no rights of any sort.</span> <span id="s391">Nothing more than I had already heard at Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s392">The same sort of sad story about the human torture and degradation.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">I might add, going back to Flossenburg, we also walked out of the camp and saw the SS houses.</span> <span id="s394">There were six or eight or ten beautiful houses near the camp where the SS troops lived.</span> <span id="s395">You see, there were two types of SS, the Waffen SS.</span> <span id="s396">The fighting SS, and the Lagen SS, the concentration camp SS.</span> <span id="s397">They were the Death’s Head SS and they were terrible!</span> <span id="s398">They were really sadistic, and butchers.</span> <span id="s399">They had these beautiful houses they lived in with their mistresses, their SS women.</span> <span id="s400">And we were told by the prisoners that the women were even more brutal than the men!</span> <span id="s401">They would do more torturing and kicking around than the men would, sometimes.</span> <span id="s402">The little factory where they built the parts for the planes was close, and they didn’t have to walk too far for that.</span> <span id="s403">And the SS troops had their houses close.</span> <span id="s404">It was a community, but very great comfort for the SS and terrible, terrible for the inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: I was twenty-eight, I guess.</span> <span id="s407">I’d gone into the army after my internship.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Had you read any books or had any other experience that would prepare you for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: No, nothing!</span> <span id="s410">I had heard, as we all had, rumors there were concentration camps of some sort.</span> <span id="s411">We had heard that really they were for the political prisoners.</span> <span id="s412">We really had no idea this was going on – the fighting troops didn’t.</span> <span id="s413">We were completely unprepared for it.</span> <span id="s414">And then there were a couple liberated, as I said, I think it was Mauthausen, and what were some others up north that they got first?</span> <span id="s415">We heard about it.</span> <span id="s416">It was hard to believe it!</span> <span id="s417">And this was completely unexpected.</span> <span id="s418">Now we did see, once we got in and got going, the slave laborers all over Germany.</span> <span id="s419">They had brought people from France and Belgium and Holland and Czechoslovakia and Hungary and all over, to work in their farms and factories!</span> <span id="s420">And so every place we went, we would find the slave laborers running around the countryside.</span> <span id="s421">And they hadn’t been treated like the concentration camp people.</span> <span id="s422">They were very poorly fed, and they had to wear a special mark on their clothes to mark them as sub-German, and they weren’t well treated.</span> <span id="s423">They were strictly an inferior race.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Were you ever able to get any explanation as to why they were in this category?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: It simply was that the Germans needed people.</span> <span id="s426">They had all their troops in the field -- all their men were in the army.</span> <span id="s427">They needed people to run the farms, cultivate the fields, to harvest, to work in the steel mills, in the mines.</span> <span id="s428">And they’d just go into a French town and say, “We’re going to pick up fifty men.’</span> <span id="s429">With a rifle, they’d round them up, put them on a box car and ship them to Germany to work.</span> <span id="s430">They weren’t political prisoners, they were just Frenchmen, and they lost the war, so they were going to work for Germany now.</span> <span id="s431">They weren’t paid anything.</span> <span id="s432">They were just fed something, and they didn’t starve, and they weren’t whipped and beaten, but they were just, “Get to work now.</span> <span id="s433">You work hard and do work for us,” period.</span> <span id="s434">And that was because they were out of manpower.</span> <span id="s435">And in Holland and Belgium, they’d grab people, say, “Come on, you’re going to build the Reich and work.”</span> <span id="s436">And off they’d go.</span> <span id="s437">And so we knew that they had this “sub-group” around.</span> <span id="s438">And then we saw some of the Polish and Russian people who were really badly treated, because the Germans thought they were sub-human.</span> <span id="s439">And those slave laborers were really very much worse treated than the French and the Belgians and the Dutch would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: In what ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Well, they weren’t as well fed, weren’t as well clothed, and would be kicked around, maybe beaten up once in a while.</span> <span id="s442">And then we also picked up a few prisoners of our own that had escaped from German camps and got back to our lines, and gee, they were emaciated and sick.</span> <span id="s443">They hadn’t been tortured, but they hadn’t been fed worth a darn.</span> <span id="s444">They were really run down and sickly and starved.</span> <span id="s445">So we knew that things weren’t very good in any camp they had in Germany.</span> <span id="s446">But the deliberate attempt at murder, to torture, to kill, to wipe out -- of this we didn’t have any idea about the concentration camps -- at all -- until we got into them.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: This coming at this point in your life, do you think it had an effect, or is it difficult to evaluate this?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Well the whole war had a tremendous effect.</span> <span id="s449">It marked me for life.</span> <span id="s450">What did the war do for me?</span> <span id="s451">I think, one thing, I realized then that what counted was coming back home to a family, a wife, a home, a job, and doing something.</span> <span id="s452">And little things like being president of this, or to make a lot of money, or being a big-shot, that wasn’t as important as being alive!</span> <span id="s453">Enough to eat, a warm place to stay at night, and really be a person was what counted.</span> <span id="s454">And so I realized that all that stuff we used to strive for and fight form for position, for power, and all this stuff, was a lot of nonsense.</span> <span id="s455">It really didn’t count.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">And then as far as the concentration camps went, it had a tremendous impact, and all of us, I think, realized then, really more than ever, what we were fighting for.</span> <span id="s457">I think we before thought, well, we had to fight this war, that we’d been attacked and Germany’s going to enslave the earth, but once you got in there, we really felt this was a crusade.</span> <span id="s458">We had to do something to stamp this out!</span> <span id="s459">This was a really diabolical regime which was set upon the world, and this was really a holy crusade to wipe this out.</span> <span id="s460">We really felt that way, once we got in there and saw this.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Did this alter your views about humanity?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s463">I think today I still feel that, how can the human race be this way.</span> <span id="s464">Today we see all the atrocities throughout the world -- El Salvador, and in Guatemala, and in the Near East, and in Russia -- and so it hasn’t changed.</span> <span id="s465">People are this way, I guess.</span> <span id="s466">And it’s sad they are.</span> <span id="s467">The difference I think was this.</span> <span id="s468">That we have the same sadistic bums in this country who could do what the SS did in Germany, but there Hitler gave them a rank, a uniform and a purpose and a mission, and encouraged them to go.</span> <span id="s469">Most countries don’t do this.</span> <span id="s470">Their misfits, their psychopaths are not given this sort of mission.</span> <span id="s471">He did!</span> <span id="s472">So there he got around him this bunch of guys who did these things because they were this type of people.</span> <span id="s473">So I think the difference is, our government does not foster this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s474">It fights it if it can.</span> <span id="s475">There, the Hitler government fostered it.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Are there any other points we should make here?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s478">I just will say this, that in our division, we had 13,000 men.</span> <span id="s479">We lost 30,000 in our division.</span> <span id="s480">We replaced about two-and-a-half times over.</span> <span id="s481">It didn’t tell the story there, because most of the casualties came in the entering companies, and within two months of when we got into combat, we lost almost most of our men!</span> <span id="s482">I lost 21 of my 32 men.</span> <span id="s483">We used to say that a company commander, a captain, would last two months in combat.</span> <span id="s484">The second in command of a platoon would last two weeks in combat.</span> <span id="s485">That was about true.</span> <span id="s486">They were either killed or wounded by that time.</span> <span id="s487">So within two months, we were a whole new division.</span> <span id="s488">With World War II, once a division got shot up, they didn’t pull ‘em out to rest, like in World War I.</span> <span id="s489">They sent in replacements right along, to keep you going, so we would build up, so after about two or three months, we had a whole new division, all new men in the front lines.</span> <span id="s490">Now the engineers, the artillery, the headquarters, they were not pretty well shot up.</span> <span id="s491">They would go with the same people.</span> <span id="s492">But the rifle companies were almost all brand new after about two or three months.</span> <span id="s493">All I can say, I guess, is that we all got rather fatalistic, and I don’t know why we made it through it, but we hoped we would, and that’s about the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Do you think that coming back to a hero’s welcome -- well, somewhat of a hero’s welcome -- was difficult for you?</span> <span id="s495">I’ve heard this from other people, because the people were idolizing you, and they didn’t have any comprehension of what you had seen, or where you had been.</span> <span id="s496">Or maybe I’m off-track on this.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: I don’t think you are.</span> <span id="s498">In a way, yes.</span> <span id="s499">I had no trouble.</span> <span id="s500">When I came back home, I was going to go into a medical career.</span> <span id="s501">I had been side-tracked for three years in the Army.</span> <span id="s502">I was now going to go on and do what I wanted to do -- train in internal medicine.</span> <span id="s503">So I was set to go and move ahead and put this behind me.</span> <span id="s504">I didn’t have any trouble getting back into the track, I don’t think, and yet it is true that you simply can’t tell people what you did, what you saw, because they can’t understand it!</span> <span id="s505">Exactly like the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s506">Unless you’re there and go through it, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s507">Unless you’re in combat and fight the battle and crawl on your belly under machine gun bullets and dig a foxhole in the rain and get shelled, you can’t understand it.</span> <span id="s508">So I think this is true.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">I had trouble in not being able to tell people.</span> <span id="s510">I didn’t really want to, I simply had a different life.</span> <span id="s511">For instance, my medical colleagues, we had little in common as far as the service goes, because most of my colleagues were in hospitals -- base hospitals someplace.</span> <span id="s512">They had no concept of what I went through.</span> <span id="s513">Not that it makes any difference, but I was in the infantry, and that was my life.</span> <span id="s514">And it was not the medical corps as you know it, like in M.A.S.H., or in the movies.</span> <span id="s515">Nothing to do with that.</span> <span id="s516">We were out with the infantry, and having the same life as they were having, and the same death they were having too.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: That brings up another question.</span> <span id="s518">When it comes to literature and popular films about the Army and the medical corps in World War II, do you think that these accurately depict what went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: I think they do in general, yeah, but most of them of course are with base hospitals or with
