1994</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: You want me also to spell out the name of the city or is that not necessary?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: I need you to begin by stating your name, where you were born, when you were born.</span> <span id="s13">A: Many years ago.</span> <span id="s14">Should I start?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My name is -- my real name when I was born is Abraham Resnickowitz (ph.).</span> <span id="s17">Actually -- people know me by Abe Resnick, actually.</span> <span id="s18">But that was my given name at the time.</span> <span id="s19">I was born 1924, February 27th.</span> <span id="s20">I was born in a small city -- small town in the eastern part -- the northeastern part of Lithuania by the name of .</span> <span id="s21">It was a relatively small town.</span> <span id="s22">It was actually a county more than a town, in the sense that there was some surrounding towns -- small towns which most of the time our town was famous in having a large -- not conventions, but I would say markets.</span> <span id="s23">People used to come from all over because you see, Lithuania was an agricultural country and in the larger towns we used to have twice a week, markets whereby people used to bring their agricultural products to the city and they were sold at the -- at the markets.</span> <span id="s24">I was born in a family that my father -- who was -- who came from a different town.</span> <span id="s25">He was also in the -- he fought in the Independence War of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s26">And due to the fact that he was fighting for Lithuanian he was given two choices; one, a farm or a governmental job.</span> <span id="s27">He decided what's a Jewish boy going to do on a farm?</span> <span id="s28">So he decided to take a governmental job.</span> <span id="s29">And the job was -- basically he was an insurance inspector.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Insurance was, in Lithuania, belonged to the government and regulated by the government.</span> <span id="s31">So he came to this small town.</span> <span id="s32">First of all, he came to the town, in the beginning, as a -- as a bookkeeper and -- and he worked for a company.</span> <span id="s33">And, of course, he met my mother who was a native and a fourth or fifth or six generation of people who lived in .</span> <span id="s34">That means my grandfather and my great great grandfather, they were established there for many years.</span> <span id="s35">After my father married he opened up his own business and the office was in the house.</span> <span id="s36">I had a very nice house and the address of the house -- of course, that's irrelevant.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Then when --</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: But you had a very comfortable life.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I had a very comfortable life in the sense that we had a large family and we had many, many friends.</span> <span id="s40">And had even a Jewish bank in the town.</span> <span id="s41">There were out of the 6,000 people that lived in the town, I think 50 percent were Jewish.</span> <span id="s42">And it was -- had quite a few synagogues.</span> <span id="s43">It was a -- and the town was always known as a Habad (ph.) town which was now been known was as the .</span> <span id="s44">Incidentally, in 1933 the rabbi -- head rabbi from the movement -- came down to our town and it was a big, big event.</span> <span id="s45">I remember he came to the train station and he was carried through because he had a -- he was handicapped.</span> <span id="s46">And incidentally, my parents took me to him for a blessing and sometimes I say this blessing maybe was the one that saved me from all these difficulties that I went through in my life.</span> <span id="s47">Now, I had a younger sister -- two younger sisters.</span> <span id="s48">One was four years younger, the other one was eight years younger than myself.</span> <span id="s49">And the cultural life was very -- it was small city but it was very unique in the sense of the friendship and many, many -- large, large family -- plus the fact that we were also close to the border of Latvia.</span> <span id="s50">And I had an aunt who married into Dvinsk, which was about 50, 60 miles, but it was already in Latvia.</span> <span id="s51">So we had relatives that used to come in between Latvia and Lithuania.</span> <span id="s52">When I grew up, I went to public school.</span> <span id="s53">My parents decided to send me to Kovno, which was the -- which was the capital at that time of Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Before we get to Kovno -- as I understand it, your family was quite religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yes, they were not that fanatics but they were -- they were -- the whole city -- those small cities were very much religious.</span> <span id="s56">People were -- there were exceptions who were not religious, most -- 99 percent were religious.</span> <span id="s57">Everybody used to belong to the synagogue and there were no reformed or conservative.</span> <span id="s58">There was one type of synagogue.</span> <span id="s59">They were Orthodox synagogues at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Did the Jewish population mix much with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Very much in the sense that they were mostly storekeepers and we had attorneys and we had dentists and we had a, like I mentioned we had a bank.</span> <span id="s62">And the head of the bank was -- also, of course, a Jewish bank and the bank mostly was also in a sense to help people need -- people in need and they used to also participate in charity and in helping people to establish themselves in new businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Jewish and non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Jewish and non-Jewish, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s66">What about political or organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: There were -- everybody was there .</span> <span id="s68">And many people -- incidentally, at that time, it didn't exist yet the State of Israel, but we had in quite a number of occasions, when leaders used to come down to our city to explain the necessity of having a -- having our own country and promote ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s70">So you were beginning to tell me about moving to --</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yes, I moved -- actually I didn't move.</span> <span id="s72">My family still stayed on in and -- but I was sent to Kovno and at that time -- at the age of 12 or 13, I was sent to my grandparents who used to live in Kovno.</span> <span id="s73">And my parents felt very comfortable, the fact that I'm going to be living together with my grandparents and my uncle.</span> <span id="s74">And so they used to live almost on the main street, which was call .</span> <span id="s75">That means, in translating, the Alley of Independence.</span> <span id="s76">And I was right on the corner of and there used to live -- my grandparents used to live and we were very comfortable.</span> <span id="s77">And the fact that the school they put me in was also a gymnasium, which was about five minutes walking distance from where they used to live.</span> <span id="s78">And of course, I started going to the school.</span> <span id="s79">The schooling system was extremely well and this was -- the reason also they send me to Kovno, because in the small cities they didn't have Hebrew gymnasiums and this was a Hebrew gymnasium.</span> <span id="s80">And incidentally, this gymnasium was on the name of Chase because a benefactor by the name of Chase was the one that established -- from the United States -- was the one that established this gymnasium in the Kovno, the capital of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s81">So I went to the -- friends, had many friends.</span> <span id="s82">And we didn't have too much time, leisure time, because the system -- the education system was extremely, extremely serious and very disciplined.</span> <span id="s83">We used to have uniforms with a hat and a special outfit.</span> <span id="s84">And we basically started early in the morning and I used to come back home late and I had to make my homework and was very -- there was very little time to leisure.</span> <span id="s85">Of course, sometimes going to the movies, sometimes -- incidentally, I also lived next store, right around the corner to the opera, which I had very -- Lithuania was a small country but it had a very cultural -- the cultural life was very intense.</span> <span id="s86">And by having the opera around us and especially myself and also many of our friends were very much involved in the opera.</span> <span id="s87">Of course, we didn't have the money and the resources to go and sometimes to the opera but we always find a way to participate and to enjoy the cultural life and especially the opera and the ballet.</span> <span id="s88">And it was a beautiful, beautiful opera.</span> <span id="s89">And this was also was in a compound of a -- within a park, a city park.</span> <span id="s90">I also remember that I used to read quite a lot.</span> <span id="s91">And there was, of course, radio, what we had.</span> <span id="s92">And it was in the early stages.</span> <span id="s93">We didn't have, of course, TV or some other entertainment.</span> <span id="s94">So mostly our activities were basically around the community, around the synagogue, which was not too far also from us.</span> <span id="s95">Kovno was a city of about I would say 100 -- over 100,000 people -- out of about I would say 150,000.</span> <span id="s96">Out of them, maybe one-fourth, one-third was -- were Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: You were in the main part of Kovno?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: The main -- yes, in the main part, in the center -- in the center.</span> <span id="s99">And I remember that on Saturday, of course, the school -- there were no school and we used to walk.</span> <span id="s100">We had this , the street was composed of a median with benches and a place to walk and to enjoy.</span> <span id="s101">The climate was also very good in a certain way because we had -- we were almost the same parallel as Montreal, but other climate was a little bit milder in the sense, we had very harsh winters and very beautiful summers.</span> <span id="s102">And we really enjoyed the surroundings.</span> <span id="s103">In winter, we used to go skating and had some -- with sleds, you know.</span> <span id="s104">It used to be also beautiful in the sense that we used to go out and have the wintertime, you know, there's horses and sleds and it was a remarkable.</span> <span id="s105">It was a very interesting and very joyful life.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: What did the city look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: The city was an extremely, extremely clean city.</span> <span id="s108">And the buildings, we didn't have any high-rise buildings.</span> <span id="s109">I think the tallest building was about four -- four-stories high.</span> <span id="s110">Most of them were about two stories.</span> <span id="s111">In the center of the city, of course, there were commercial buildings and also apartment buildings.</span> <span id="s112">We had also a number of .</span> <span id="s113">And then we had a remnant from when Lithuania was occupied by Russia.</span> <span id="s114">We had a place which was called the sabor (ph.).</span> <span id="s115">The sabor was like a church that was not functioning as a church, but it was like a -- like a remnant from the -- from the times and it was used, like, mostly as a museum.</span> <span id="s116">We had also few museums.</span> <span id="s117">It was also a military museum, which was called the .</span> <span id="s118">We had -- also the topography was very beautiful because we had, like, small mountains surrounding and we had two rivers, the and the .</span> <span id="s119">And of course, wintertime was very joyful.</span> <span id="s120">When they were frozen we used to enjoy skating and going around.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: What about Jewish life?</span> <span id="s122">A: Jewish life was very --</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s124">I need you to start again because I was talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: I belonged to different -- not different -- there were not too many organizations -- Jewish organizations, mostly .</span> <span id="s126">And also at the same time, I belonged to the international organization, which was the Button Button (ph.), which were the boy scouts, which we enjoyed.</span> <span id="s127">We used to have outings and the outings were basically -- we used to go out to the forest and stay there -- over -- stay over.</span> <span id="s128">And also we were taught different -- different measures in relationship -- I mean, the essence of what does it mean to be a boy scout in Button Button.</span> <span id="s129">We also -- I remember we were taught also -- we used to wave with flags the morose code, by communicating which each other.</span> <span id="s130">It was the little flags like between two ships.</span> <span id="s131">Also, I remember we were also being educated and explained about -- about Palestine and about the activities that were at that time in Palestine about the influx of the amount of Jewish people to Palestine.</span> <span id="s132">Also, about times in Turkey, which were also -- some years ago that Turkey -- they had a very big influence on Palestine when they had -- they were in the Turkish occupation.</span> <span id="s133">We were very extremely well versed.</span> <span id="s134">And time went by and I used to go back to my -- in the summertime, I used to go back to join my family in .</span> <span id="s135">I remember I used to take the train.</span> <span id="s136">It would take forever.</span> <span id="s137">It was only about 200 miles.</span> <span id="s138">I don't remember, kilometers or miles.</span> <span id="s139">And then I used to join my family and I was very proud.</span> <span id="s140">People used to respect me very much for the fact that I am coming from my big city.</span> <span id="s141">My other friends were educated in our small city.</span> <span id="s142">Most of them went to Lithuanian schools and the relationship between the Jews and Lithuanians was very, very cordial, very nice, very friendly.</span> <span id="s143">And we had never had any -- any big sense of anti-semitism, at least we didn't feel that.</span> <span id="s144">Sometimes, in sporadic cases, there were certain -- certain acts of hostility, but very, very rare.</span> <span id="s145">And going back and forth and so we reached the time when I was -- reached eight.</span> <span id="s146">The last year was the eight class and this was the year when we -- I was going to finish the gymnasium and, of course, after gymnasium -- as you know, a gymnasium is like a -- translated in terms of American terms, it's like a partial college -- high school and college, whereby we had to take also and differentials and many items that were subjects that were being taken in -- in the university.</span> <span id="s147">I took Latin because we were able to take some foreign languages.</span> <span id="s148">I took -- Russian, I spoke because when I was born my parents finished Russian schools before Lithuania was independent.</span> <span id="s149">So I spoke, when I -- in the beginning I spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s150">And when I went to school in , I start speaking Yiddish and then, of course, Hebrew and then, of course, Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s151">And then I took German in school, I had to take.</span> <span id="s152">And then I took Latin because I -- my interest was to become a doctor and my parents wanted to sent me to Italy because the curriculum in Lithuanian was very small.</span> <span id="s153">We had a university, not too big, and it was very difficult to get into the university.</span> <span id="s154">So some friends of ours went to Italy and my aim was also to go to Italy after finishing the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s155">And of course, 1939, this was still before -- two years before I finished gymnasium, the Russians -- I mean, the turmoil in Europe started.</span> <span id="s156">The Russians have decided -- have to divide between German and Russia.</span> <span id="s157">Russia was going to take over the Baltics; Lithuania, Latvia, and Histonia (ph.).</span> <span id="s158">And Germany was to take part of Poland and, of course, Czechoslovakia and Austria, so far and so on.</span> <span id="s159">So it started already that -- soon we felt that there is something happening but we have never -- we were confident that our government, which was a democratic country with a president, a parliament, and is quite a lot of liberty and freedom.</span> <span id="s160">But in 1939, we have -- we found out one day that we are under the Russian -- the Russian -- the Russians have absorbed the three Baltic states and we have heard that -- I mean, like, a day or two days ahead of time that the Russian tanks are going to be coming into Kovno, to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s161">Of course, there was no resistance because compared to Russia, we had a small miniature army and there was no way that we were able to fight Russia at that time.</span> <span id="s162">And the Russians took -- I remember when they marched into Lithuania.</span> <span id="s163">And right away when they marched in -- you see, our gymnasium was a Hebrew gymnasium -- so when the Russians came in, they changed their -- right away they eliminate -- Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s164">This airplane --</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: We didn't give them permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: How did -- in Slovakia especially, was a very important center of Jewish life, and I would like to --</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: The bigger --</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yeah, but can I continue?</span> <span id="s170">And then -- Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: All right.</span> <span id="s172">So the Russians came and when they came in, they changed the whole system.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Suddenly from a democracy we became part of the Soviet Union, a republic.</span> <span id="s174">And right away they started changing the currency.</span> <span id="s175">They brought in many military personnel.</span> <span id="s176">They start taking over and nationalize the businesses.</span> <span id="s177">They -- in my -- in , my parents were told the house was too big, too luxury for a family, that we have to take in some families.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">And they put in some families in the house.</span> <span id="s179">Our business -- we had a factory of roofing paper, which was not too big so they didn't -- they didn't do anything about it.</span> <span id="s180">But in Kaunus -- in Kovno, they started nationalizing the big businesses and they start taking out those people who they felt they are not sympathic with the Russian government and they had some kind of history that they were exploiting people.</span> <span id="s181">They start taking them out -- taking them to Russia.</span> <span id="s182">I remember being still in school, I was given an assignment to nationalize a large wholesale food business with all kinds of items there.</span> <span id="s183">We had to take the inventory and then, of course, the owners were replaced temporarily to be the managers and then they were kicked out basically from those businesses.</span> <span id="s184">And so in they also start taking out those people who they considered that they are bourgeois and fortunately my parents had very good contacts within the Lithuanian community, so could speak perfect Lithuanian, so they didn't touch him.</span> <span id="s185">But some of her relatives, they took them out and they send them to Russia.</span> <span id="s186">And those people had very difficult time but they have -- they were fortunate in a certain way.</span> <span id="s187">And I'm going later to relate to you, that they were fortunate they were taken to Russia rather than stay.</span> <span id="s188">So going back to Kaunas, we had -- Kaunas was a, as I mentioned, not a large city but we had some suburbs.</span> <span id="s189">One of them was Slovakia, which was called in Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s190">And this was a center of Jewish learning.</span> <span id="s191">And there were -- people used to come -- students used to come from all over -- all over the world to be educated in those , which were in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s192">Slovakia is like a something -- a special place of learning, which many, many big scholars have come out from -- from this .</span> <span id="s193">We had another in -- in , but Slovakia was the -- like the crown of the -- of the learning institutions.</span> <span id="s194">And most of the people, it was a most of Slovakia was comprised of Jewish population, middle lower class.</span> <span id="s195">But people were comfortable.</span> <span id="s196">There was not -- nobody was hungry, especially, as I mentioned that Lithuania was an agricultural country.</span> <span id="s197">So there was never a shortage of meat and bread and some other products like butter and milk.</span> <span id="s198">So Slovakia was very much considered as a very, very unique and very special place, not only in Lithuania, like I mentioned, but throughout the -- throughout the western hemisphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Did you spend time in Slovakia as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: I spend very little time because I was more to -- our gymnasium was not a -- not an extreme religious organization.</span> <span id="s201">We spoke Hebrew, we observed the holidays, but we were not fanatics like I mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: I have to ask you to try not to say "as I mentioned," because if this gets edited, we won't know what the other part --</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Okay, all right.</span> <span id="s206">So we start living under the -- under the -- regime of -- see I finally became from a country, communist.</span> <span id="s207">Communistic system, socialistic system, they called that.</span> <span id="s208">And it was, in the beginning, we felt -- we didn't feel too good about it but then we got used to it.</span> <span id="s209">Because especially at the age of 16 -- 15, 16, 17, truthfully, we have not -- we were still not -- had the burden of carrying on a family and making a living and we were just sitting there and watching the changes which happened very, very fast.</span> <span id="s210">We saw also many fortifications have become -- have been taken over by the -- of course, the Russians have displayed their force.</span> <span id="s211">We had an airport which was about seven or eight miles from our city.</span> <span id="s212">And of course, we didn't have a military -- military planes.</span> <span id="s213">I think we had one or two of them.</span> <span id="s214">That was considered a sizable amount for the -- for the military in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s215">So time rolled and we have had -- incidentally, at that time, also in the -- after '39, we had something very special happen to us and this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: I'm going to have to stop you because we're out of tape and I don't want to interrupt that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I have to mention that -- can I go on?</span> <span id="s220">Also being in the Ghetto was very traumatic for the chairman from time to time, they called up Doctor Elkus (ph.) and they said, "We need 100 people for a special assignment."</span> <span id="s221">Nobody knew whether this assignment was for real or whether it is to take out and to shoot people, because there were some real assignments.</span> <span id="s222">So I remembered Alberson (ph.), which was the place where the -- where the counsel was, and it was a special building assigned -- it was also a place that had also a jail.</span> <span id="s223">Because, in the Ghetto, there were sometimes found some people who stole and who did certain acts of -- which was not permitted, you know.</span> <span id="s224">So I remembered when the police head and Alberson, the counsel, they had a very difficult task, whom to take out?</span> <span id="s225">I mean, the chairman told them we need 100 people.</span> <span id="s226">I mean, there were also certain favoritism, which has to -- I mean, happens from time to time.</span> <span id="s227">Because if you have a -- if you are a police officer and you have a relative that they want him out, I mean, you would -- you would try to protect him rather than somebody you don't know.</span> <span id="s228">So in many cases, it was a very, very difficult job for the -- for the -- for the elderot (ph.), for the -- for the counsel to make.</span> <span id="s229">What they opted to do is, most of the time, is people who didn't have families, people who didn't have -- who were not -- who couldn't work for some reason, whom they had some grievances or some problems with them, problematic, you know.</span> <span id="s230">Because many people have just collapsed mentally under this pressure, you know, not everybody was able to be withstand that, you know, because it was -- it is like the game of the cat and mouse and it bites off one leg and then the other one.</span> <span id="s231">It was a constant game, you know, especially when the Gestapo used to appear and come into the -- into the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s232">I mean, it was very traumatic.</span> <span id="s233">I have also to mention to you is about -- because it came to my mind about .</span> <span id="s234">I had a personal -- after I finished at the airport, I got myself a good brigade.</span> <span id="s235">Mine was good because I worked in a -- for some reason they formed a good one and I was at the right time at the right place.</span> <span id="s236">They formed a brigade in a marmalade factory -- and this was fantastic, you know -- which held, like -- out brigade was a , who survived incidentally the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s237">He later in Italy.</span> <span id="s238">And I was very friendly with him and I was able to stick to this brigade.</span> <span id="s239">After -- especially after this , this was like a new -- new life.</span> <span id="s240">brigade was, we had to -- it was a factory of marmalade and right next to that was also a place where they used to produce sour kraut and sour pickles -- pickled -- pickled, you know, cucumbers.</span> <span id="s241">And at least you had -- you were able to -- to get some food, you know, because sour kraut and pickles and marmalade, it's already a meal.</span> <span id="s242">And plus the fact marmalade is made with sugar and sugar is very heavy.</span> <span id="s243">I remember they used to -- I was compelled -- I was pretty strong, you know.</span> <span id="s244">I was compelled to -- to take up bags of 100 kilo sugar -- which is 225 pounds -- to the third floor, where they had the mixing of the marmalade.</span> <span id="s245">And sometimes what I used to do is, I used to punch a hole in the bag and I had a -- this -- this coat that you see in this picture.</span> <span id="s246">On this one.</span> <span id="s247">And my grandmother had made, like, a double -- a double-deck, you know -- a double --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s249">Can we start that through again and just say, "I had a coat that my grandmother" -- A: I had a coat that my grandmother fixed it up in such a fashion that she made, like, a -- hidden pockets.</span> <span id="s250">And when I carried the sugar, I used to punch a hole in the bag and make -- from paper make, like, a little canal and I used to canal the sugar from the bag directly to my -- to my coat, you know.</span> <span id="s251">And this was very, very helpful in a certain way to survive because sugar is very nutritious.</span> <span id="s252">And in one case, there were -- we had a German civilian who was very much connected to the Gestapo -- besides that, what I used to do also, I used to steal marmalade.</span> <span id="s253">But the only way to steal that was in -- in -- we had, like -- like, they have now -- you know, the metal coca-cola containers -- using a container.</span> <span id="s254">And many times I burned my -- my stomach because I used to steal it and I used to insert it right here and then with a coat, I used to close it up.</span> <span id="s255">And I used to pull it out from the -- from the -- I was not able to have accessibility to this when it was already placed in a cool place, so I had to take that when it was hot.</span> <span id="s256">And this was -- it was sometimes terrible.</span> <span id="s257">Not withstanding that, I felt the pain of the -- of the burning was worth it in order to accomplish the -- accomplish the aim -- you know, the goal.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: I want to ask you a question.</span> <span id="s259">When Ray (ph.) talked to you the other day, she mentioned that you said something about carrying sugar up for the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s261">That was in my school, when I went to the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s262">I had -- I was sent -- twice, I was sent there for special work, also carrying 225 pounds of -- also to the top floor.</span> <span id="s263">They converted our school into -- they made it into a storage place.</span> <span id="s264">And when had to -- we had to do that and that was before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s266">Would you tell me about that though?</span> <span id="s267">A: About --</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: What did you do, because I'm --</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: What I did is, we had to carry these bags of -- they used to take us to the truck down to the main entrance, and we used to have to -- to -- about five or six of us, go out to the top floor where they had the sugar, and they had the purpose to place that in a high level so it should not be stolen or something.</span> <span id="s270">So they -- we used to carry them to -- to the certain places for -- for stirring purposes.</span> <span id="s271">And -- but that's not related to the marmalade factory, which it was a separate --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s273">But while we're on that, who was up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: There was a -- there was a military storage for the -- for the German -- for the German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">And it was not precisely Gestapo, it was a military.</span> <span id="s276">Gestapo is -- I was threatened by this myre (ph.), and I was in the factory.</span> <span id="s277">One day he caught me with this -- with this marmalade, and he just waved his finger and says, "Next time you're going to go to the Gestapo if I catch you."</span> <span id="s278">It was -- was something like that.</span> <span id="s279">So he was very generous at that time.</span> <span id="s280">He just kicked me and that's all, and took away the --</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: When -- when you went up to take the sugar to the -- this military storage place, did you hear people talking, did you see anything that was particularly interesting?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Not -- we were too busy in carrying and being able to carry the load.</span> <span id="s283">That was -- that was -- actually, my mind was blanked out at that time.</span> <span id="s284">We were not able even to communicate because they -- they used to -- when it came to a job like this, it's not like the airport where you had a shovel and a pick and you had to dig and this.</span> <span id="s285">You know, this -- this was they had to be unloaded in a certain time and they -- and you had to -- you had to rush.</span> <span id="s286">And if you didn't rush they just clubbed you.</span> <span id="s287">So at this -- this moment, you were just trying to -- to keep up with your strength, in order to be able to fulfill the -- fulfill the job.</span> <span id="s288">There was also, in cases before I became -- I start working, not withstanding if we worked at this brigade, from time to time, they take us to some other places.</span> <span id="s289">And I have to tell you something which is -- which was very much inscribed in my memory.</span> <span id="s290">It's that while in 1941, beginning '42, they brought to Lithuanian, echelons (ph.) -- train loads with the boxcars of people from Austria and from Czechoslovakia and from some other places.</span> <span id="s291">And amazingly --</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: I've got to stop you.</span> <span id="s293">I hate to -- actually, I need that you to start that whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: There was a very remarkable something that I have to bring it up because there are certain aspects of being in the camps that -- that I have to highlight.</span> <span id="s295">And one of them is that this incredible experience that I had.</span> <span id="s296">And namely, they start bringing, to the railroad station, echelons -- boxcars with the Jews from Austria and Germany.</span> <span id="s297">They called that, we found out later, the .</span> <span id="s298">It basically means "place from one" -- "take them from one place and put them into another place," in German.</span> <span id="s299">And this train came with cars loaded with pianos, with furniture, with all kinds of luxury items, to make believe to those people -- because you see, when they took out from Germany or from Austria, Jews to send them to their -- to their massacre -- I mean, to their graves, to their killings, was -- apparently, they had a certain -- a certain -- they had to handle it in a certain way.</span> <span id="s300">They tried to convince them that they are being taken to another place, just only they have to take them to other places.</span> <span id="s301">So when they came -- and at that time, I was working for the Gestapo brigade.</span> <span id="s302">There was a special brigade which was the Gestapo brigade and many people have tried very hard to work in this brigade because this brigade was always connected with certain -- certain things that had to do with food.</span> <span id="s303">And there was many possibilities to -- to fill up your stomach, you know, to be -- not to be hungry.</span> <span id="s304">And this time they needed additional -- additional people.</span> <span id="s305">So apparently, they took me and they took a group of other people to that task.</span> <span id="s306">And I saw the way this echelons came, and I saw that they came in -- in, like, in plush trains.</span> <span id="s307">It was not -- some -- some boxcars came also at the same time, but they came for a -- for a purpose of baggage and some other things.</span> <span id="s308">But these trains came with the people with their jewelry, with everything, and you could see very highly standard people who came.</span> <span id="s309">And I knew exactly what they are doing with them -- what they are going to do with them.</span> <span id="s310">Before came over to us, he pulled out his pistol and we were, like, six trucks, six guys, and he said to us -- he said, "You see, I forbid you to communicate and to talk to these people.</span> <span id="s311">There is no way that you can exchange some words, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s312">If I see your lips moving, I know that you're trying to tell them something or give -- send them a message, so there is going to be nothing else than a bullet through your head."</span> <span id="s313">And he just, like, took his pistol and just scraped our faces, you know, to impress upon us that he means business.</span> <span id="s314">The difficulty was my knowing what's going to happen to those people.</span> <span id="s315">Who do we tell them or whether to tell them was the right thing or not to tell them.</span> <span id="s316">It was so difficult.</span> <span id="s317">Now, our task was to take out from the windows, a German would say to one of the cars -- plush cars and say, " .</span> <span id="s318">It means, "Give me your packs.</span> <span id="s319">You have a few kilometers.</span> <span id="s320">You have to walk a few kilometers, please give us your packages because it's going to be very burdensome and we are placing these packages in the trucks and we are going to deliver them.</span> <span id="s321">And make sure to describe your names on the packages so we are going to know how to return them to you."</span> <span id="s322">I knew that that's fallacy.</span> <span id="s323">I mean, where they are taking them is to the 9th Fort and it's about ten for 12 miles walking.</span> <span id="s324">It's not a couple of kilometers.</span> <span id="s325">And that's what's going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s326">And in one case, I saw a lady, which I -- pretty young lady, and I really felt -- was a husband, it was a couple apparently -- and if I felt very bad and I tried to explain to them, to tell them that -- of course, we were already involved in taking the packages.</span> <span id="s327">I looked around, I didn't see , apparently he went to have something to drink or something.</span> <span id="s328">And I said to them, "They are taking you to your death.</span> <span id="s329">Try -- when you march, try to escape or try to do something or something."</span> <span id="s330">You know, the people didn't believe me.</span> <span id="s331">They just didn't trust me.</span> <span id="s332">They trusted the Germans but they just didn't trust me.</span> <span id="s333">They looked at me, looked at me, and they looked at me like I'm trying to -- and then I felt very bad about the fact -- I mean, I felt scared that they should not -- they should not give me -- and they should not give me -- turn me over or say that I tried to tell them.</span> <span id="s334">This was -- this was the authoritism.</span> <span id="s335">The German -- the German Jews were very .</span> <span id="s336">They felt that they were first Germans and then Jews.</span> <span id="s337">That was their big -- their big problem.</span> <span id="s338">They were -- they eliminated, from their prayer books, Jerusalem -- it would say, "Next year in Jerusalem."</span> <span id="s339">They used to put in, "Next year in Berlin."</span> <span id="s340">This incident I remember so vividly.</span> <span id="s341">And I remember when they took the packages, and we took them directly to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s342">And the Gestapo, they had a big -- a big warehouse where they just threw them in one big pile and then they used to have a -- those people who worked at the Gestapo used to sort them out and place -- for instance, place different items based on a list that they had, which items have to go here and there.</span> <span id="s343">And they were very meticulous and very organized.</span> <span id="s344">The Germans, they were extremely organized.</span> <span id="s345">I mean, when it came to organization it was -- I mean, they were leaders in the world on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Was this in --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: This was --</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: -- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: This was -- I'm not sure, but I think it was in the beginning of '42 or the middle of '42 or something, it happened into that time.</span> <span id="s350">And I know for a fact that they were taken to the 9th Fort and they were -- and they were massacred there.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Do you know how many?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: There were many -- there were thousands, at least based on what found out later of 5,000 or 6,000.</span> <span id="s353">The have inscriptions in the main fort where they held them overnight.</span> <span id="s354">Many inscribed their names on the walls.</span> <span id="s355">Certain inscriptions thinking that somebody is going to find them and find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: You know that there was a huge transport from I don't know where in Europe in November of '41, where they brought 5,000 people in and --</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Maybe that was -- that was -- I -- I truthfully -- I -- I just cannot synchronize my mind with the dates because to me, it was a -- you see, to me and I think to everybody, a minute was a day and a second was an hour and a day was a year, you know.</span> <span id="s358">It was torturous just beyond comprehension.</span> <span id="s359">And then, of course, we found out 1941, that in the small cities they took out everybody.</span> <span id="s360">And they didn't put them in camps or Ghetto or anything, but they took them out and in certain secluded spaces and they made them dig graves and then they shot them there.</span> <span id="s361">There was mostly Lithuanians .</span> <span id="s362">It was under supervision of the Germans.</span> <span id="s363">I have a book here which describes city by city when it happened and how it happened.</span> <span id="s364">And my father was one of the eldest in the -- in , him and the other one.</span> <span id="s365">And he was offered to -- they offered him that he was to give him some harbor -- shelter, you know, harbor him, himself.</span> <span id="s366">But he said, "It has to be the whole family."</span> <span id="s367">They said, "The family cannot be ."</span> <span id="s368">So he said, "No way.</span> <span id="s369">Wherever the family goes, I will go."</span> <span id="s370">And of course, afterwards, it was two years ago I was in Lithuania, very secluded small place, a few kilometers from the city where they took there -- there were like 2,750 people, children and which they have massacred there.</span> <span id="s371">They kept them for a short time.</span> <span id="s372">We had a -- in our city we had a little lake, and there was a count that had his palace there, still from .</span> <span id="s373">So in this place, they may have -- he had some stables for horses.</span> <span id="s374">Right there they made certain accommodations and they kept people there for a few days and then they took them out with this and he was .</span> <span id="s375">And you had to go through a narrow path and there was, like, a wooded area and they took them there and there is a -- they have a monument there and they -- and they shot all of them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Did you have much information in terms of what was happening in other towns when you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Very little information.</span> <span id="s378">We were kept aware way from newspapers.</span> <span id="s379">But, of course, when we went outside to work in the brigades, we had sometimes opportunities to exchange views with some Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s380">I had also a case where I had my cousin , where we worked together.</span> <span id="s381">One day they took us to , that was a -- "NSKK" it's called in German -- which they -- that was a special unit.</span> <span id="s382">They took us to cut -- it was winter.</span> <span id="s383">It was snowing.</span> <span id="s384">It was Christmas -- before Christmas.</span> <span id="s385">And they took us to a place and we had to cut some wood.</span> <span id="s386">And it was cold and the guard -- lady was a Lithuanian lady.</span> <span id="s387">She felt guilty, you know.</span> <span id="s388">She was an opera singer.</span> <span id="s389">She invited us to come in to warm up and she gave us a little soup and some other things.</span> <span id="s390">And then she -- remind that to my cousin -- she kind of blessed us and she told us that she hopes that we are going to live through this dark chapter and survive.</span> <span id="s391">And the guard, this was -- this also was a -- this was still before it became a concentration camp, and he was also from the .</span> <span id="s392">He was a very nice guy and he was also sharing.</span> <span id="s393">At least we were cutting wood and we had -- the blood was flowing through our veins and we were a little warm but he had -- all the time he just patted himself.</span> <span id="s394">That was a very -- there are some moments, you know, that you remember vividly.</span> <span id="s395">I remember exactly the house where -- in my back mind -- the way we were cutting the wood and the way she invited us to the house and she had tears in her eyes.</span> <span id="s396">And she said -- she was very human, you know, very much against what was going on.</span> <span id="s397">She talked to us in Lithuanian, the guard didn't understanding any of it.</span> <span id="s398">So she was very open.</span> <span id="s399">And right away she gave us tea and some soup and some piece of bread.</span> <span id="s400">Incidentally, Lithuanian food was very good bread, the butter.</span> <span id="s401">Lithuania used to export to England.</span> <span id="s402">All kinds of farm products to England in large numbers.</span> <span id="s403">Of course, when the Russians came they took out everything.</span> <span id="s404">I mean, they devastated the country.</span> <span id="s405">They eliminate many, many -- we had cows in the thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Back to the Ghetto -- A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Back to the Ghetto -- A: Yeah, back --</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Did everybody in the Ghetto go out on these work brigades?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: There were some -- some factories within the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s410">They were mostly for youngsters and for people who learned a trade.</span> <span id="s411">I had, for instance, a teacher of mathematics by the name of Faulkman (ph.).</span> <span id="s412">He was a brilliant, brilliant guy.</span> <span id="s413">He became a shoe maker in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s414">And you know, if you had a trade you had more possibilities to survive and to -- especially, you know, there were many Germans that used to come in and say, "Look, my boots are -- fix them" -- and this and that -- or "I need to buttons there.</span> <span id="s415">I need certain things to be fixed."</span> <span id="s416">And tradespeople were able to -- to fulfill their requirement.</span> <span id="s417">Now, there were -- basically the Ghetto was , that's the way they were called.</span> <span id="s418">The Ghetto factories were -- basically what they did is they used to manufacturer there many items for the army, like, all kinds of uniforms -- everything from uniforms, from hats, from underwear, from boots.</span> <span id="s419">And we had shoe makers and we had tailors and we had -- we had all kinds of tradespeople who were there.</span> <span id="s420">We had also something very interesting, which is going to surprise you.</span> <span id="s421">I'm going to tell you.</span> <span id="s422">We had a symphony orchestra within the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s423">We had people who were very talented, extremely talented.</span> <span id="s424">They were performing sometimes with the permission of the -- of the guards and we had to announce that we have a concert there.</span> <span id="s425">There were people -- writers who wrote and, of course, actors.</span> <span id="s426">I could mention to you now, we didn't have a hospital, so we made a provisional place where we used to take care of sick people.</span> <span id="s427">But the word was, "Don't get sick if you want to survive."</span> <span id="s428">And that was, "Don't get sick if you want to survive."</span> <span id="s429">So how could you prevent that.</span> <span id="s430">Sometimes, you know, with the snow and the bad weather and the colds.</span> <span id="s431">But the instinct, you know, the force of wanting to survive was sometimes so -- so strong, you know, that is stronger than any bacteria or anything.</span> <span id="s432">You can overcome something.</span> <span id="s433">And this is without food.</span> <span id="s434">And I myself, when I used to work in Sativa (ph.) --</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: We have to change the tape.</span> <span id="s436">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s439">We were talking about the children being --</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Where in the Ghetto, at the children section, it was specially devised to get out all of the children from the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s441">And in order to impliment that, they had also to take out all the police because this was also -- there were also children from the police officers and you know how a father would react seeing his child being dragged and beaten and taken to a bus and then taken away.</span> <span id="s442">So after this -- this happened -- and this was very fast, they had a big number of of SS people who implimented this function.</span> <span id="s443">They went from house to house and they knew exactly which house had children.</span> <span id="s444">They had already a list.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Apparently, previously they have asked for the -- for the composition of the people who lived in each -- in each house.</span> <span id="s446">You know, it was -- so they had certain records or somebody gave them the records.</span> <span id="s447">And they discriminately -- I mean, they have -- they have walked into each house, pulled out of the children.</span> <span id="s448">And most of the children were -- especially the oldest ones -- were -- their mothers were at work at this time.</span> <span id="s449">There were only a number of mothers, who when they took the children, they want to go with their kids.</span> <span id="s450">They wouldn't let them stay with the kids so they beat them up and they just kicked them and then they took away the children.</span> <span id="s451">And the mothers were devastated.</span> <span id="s452">So especially now at six, seven o'clock, when the people started returning from work, and when they found out this news, it was such an out cry.</span> <span id="s453">It was such a tremendous outcry that everybody was crying and everybody was devastated.</span> <span id="s454">It was something that some people threw themselves on the barbed wire, you know, to see whether they just can just get out and do something.</span> <span id="s455">And people -- really, the mothers didn't care -- care for their lives anymore.</span> <span id="s456">They just wanted to join them, to be together with their children.</span> <span id="s457">And the police officers -- the way we found out later -- they were investigated to find out whether there were some kids that were hidden, like we were -- we hid my cousin, who was really about, at that time, about three years, three and a half years, maybe four years.</span> <span id="s458">And besides that, they want also to know where -- because they had information at that time -- it was already '44 and they knew that there were many, many, many freedom fighters who still have communication with the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s459">And they had -- apparently it was felt that also that the police -- certain police officers had helped some and still helping some of the -- of the freedom fighters.</span> <span id="s460">So they wanted to find out and they shot quite a number of police officers.</span> <span id="s461">They shot this Greenberg (ph.) who was very instrumental.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">They tortured him and shot him and he would not divulge and would not give out where the -- where the hiding places were.</span> <span id="s463">And then the rest of those police officers, they -- part of them -- they returned back to the Ghetto and became devastated and found also their children gone.</span> <span id="s464">And it was really -- the -- the feeling, I mean, it was -- it was so bad, you know, that the whole situation created an incredible loss of hope, you know, when you saw something like this.</span> <span id="s465">And this was March and it was already when the Russians have advanced already, substantially towards -- towards the -- towards the west -- towards the -- they liberated already many, many cities in Russia and they were moving towards Lithuania.</span> <span id="s466">And that was an episode which is -- which was very, very tragic, you know, very even difficult to describe this.</span> <span id="s467">This is -- sometimes we are talking between ourselves, some survivors, and we exchange -- exchange views.</span> <span id="s468">And the question is, between one survivor and the other one is, how to make people understand what we went through.</span> <span id="s469">I mean, this is -- I mean, it's -- you see, you are limited in being able to understand it when somebody tells you something, you know, because there -- our minds are in a certain way limited.</span> <span id="s470">We cannot understand beyond this limit, you know.</span> <span id="s471">And it is, how can somebody describe certain things that like?</span> <span id="s472">How can somebody describe that a German SS man takes a child of a year old, takes him by his legs and smashes him with his head against -- against a wall?</span> <span id="s473">I mean, how can -- this is -- it's -- it's not even the more substandard countries.</span> <span id="s474">I mean, it's happening, you know.</span> <span id="s475">They kill people, they massacre people, but I don't think it's only -- I mean, and it's hard to describe and it's hard to believe.</span> <span id="s476">Sometimes I myself, it's hard for me to believe that -- it looks to me like a bad nightmare.</span> <span id="s477">But I mean that, it truly happened, you know.</span> <span id="s478">And time was going so slow, you know.</span> <span id="s479">The worst part is that although you worked so hard and you did all kinds of -- I didn't mention some other work that I used to do.</span> <span id="s480">They took us to the -- to the army barracks sometimes and I had to clean up the latrines and something else.</span> <span id="s481">And sometimes they took some people and they just threw them into the latrines just to have a little pastime for themselves, you know.</span> <span id="s482">So I mean, it's beyond -- beyond description.</span> <span id="s483">Now, that's one of the reasons when we met together with survivors sometimes and we share experiences, we -- we can understand it much better than explaining that to the outer world.</span> <span id="s484">And it's very hard to believe that a country so advanced, you know, was get -- getting and and all this.</span> <span id="s485">That were able that -- came down to a level, to such a level to be so destructive and so without hearts, without -- so Ghetto was -- this was a -- at that stage it was already a camp, yeah.</span> <span id="s486">Now, next move was that we decided that we cannot keep -- my uncle decided that he cannot keep anymore his daughter there.</span> <span id="s487">So we made contact to a -- there was a rabbi's wife, Sherman (ph.) was her name.</span> <span id="s488">And I'm sure that she is going to surfacing in some of your -- in some other places.</span> <span id="s489">She was an incredible lady.</span> <span id="s490">She was a rabbi's wife.</span> <span id="s491">Her husband was in Israel -- in Palestine already.</span> <span id="s492">And she -- some way he left before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">And she was matchmaking.</span> <span id="s494">She was out -- without -- without .</span> <span id="s495">She was going around and finding places to harbor children.</span> <span id="s496">So somebody told us about her and we contacted her and she found a place for Sarami (ph.), which was my -- my -- my cousin.</span> <span id="s497">She was three and a half, four years old at that time.</span> <span id="s498">My aunt laughs always, she says that I used to have an incredible appetite, you know.</span> <span id="s499">And I used to watch, you know -- she used to give her -- sometimes we were able to smuggle in tapioca.</span> <span id="s500">You know what it is?</span> <span id="s501">It's a -- and I used to sit quietly and watch that and pray that she should not eat the tapioca so it would be left over for me to eat.</span> <span id="s502">So she always -- so we decided to -- how we would do it.</span> <span id="s503">At that time, we had two SS people in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s504">One's name was Fifeger (ph.) and the other name was -- what was the other name?</span> <span id="s505">It will come to me pretty soon.</span> <span id="s506">Yeah, it's was Fifeger was a former teacher and he was very much befriended my uncle.</span> <span id="s507">He was very nice.</span> <span id="s508">He was the SS.</span> <span id="s509">And he told the story that he was forced into the SS.</span> <span id="s510">And he expressed very good sentiments.</span> <span id="s511">So my uncle had to put his confidence -- he showed -- in few cases, he showed that he was helpful.</span> <span id="s512">And we could see that he is not one of -- one of these beasts, you know.</span> <span id="s513">So my uncle explained to him and he knew that we're having the child there against all odds, and he promised my uncle that he is going to help him out.</span> <span id="s514">This was a remarkable -- but his comrade -- his friend, who's name I forgot, was just the opposite.</span> <span id="s515">Just the opposite.</span> <span id="s516">What he did once was also beyond -- he encouraged people -- he opened up -- he opened up this -- first, let me finish with Fifeger.</span> <span id="s517">So they arranged that the bread was coming in twice a week with these big platforms, and then horses with a driver were going out.</span> <span id="s518">So we arranged to -- I gave her a sleeping pill.</span> <span id="s519">We put her in the bag because they -- it used to come in bags.</span> <span id="s520">So we put her in one of the bags.</span> <span id="s521">And we put her under a so that she can go through the -- through the gates.</span> <span id="s522">Because at the gates, they always used to stick something to find where there's sometimes hide -- but it was already prearranged, you know, that apparently he did that -- Fifeger did that, you know.</span> <span id="s523">And we were able to get her out and she was given away to a very nice Lithuanian family.</span> <span id="s524">They took care -- they even baptized her and made her, like, a part of the -- and she spoke only Lithuanian and she was -- she fortunately survived.</span> <span id="s525">In exchange, my uncle -- the police officer who was shot, his little boy was also given out to somebody.</span> <span id="s526">But he was betrayed and they killed him.</span> <span id="s527">Apparently, this Lithuanian that took him was given certain things in order to do that.</span> <span id="s528">They betrayed him and he was -- we found out later that he was -- he was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Do you want to take a break now?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Let me just finish with -- it will come back to me, the name of the other guy.</span> <span id="s531">He was a bad, bad -- I should have written it down.</span> <span id="s532">So he formed -- it was already March, April -- it was already -- the Ghetto already knew that it's -- it's -- it's still a little bit of hope on the horizon.</span> <span id="s533">So he let out the word that he is going to -- that he is going to let out some people to escape.</span> <span id="s534">And he opened up a hole that was in the fence.</span> <span id="s535">And needless to say, he was with a machine gun there and he killed like 14 people there, claiming that they tried to escape.</span> <span id="s536">So that was SS .</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Another thing I think I asked you before -- why don't we -- A: You want I should tell also about the escape or --</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s539">Tell me a little bit about the Ghetto becoming an official concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Well, it was the end of the 1943, we saw certain movements in the different directions.</span> <span id="s541">We felt that there is some kind of changes going to be implemented in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s542">And we really didn't know exactly.</span> <span id="s543">We felt that the guards were changed.</span> <span id="s544">We have seen more -- that was also a time when we had seen more Hungarians.</span> <span id="s545">They brought in Hungarians, and especially some truck drivers.</span> <span id="s546">One of them, which I knew pretty well, he had a bad mouth, but he was not so bad.</span> <span id="s547">But the rest were very bad.</span> <span id="s548">He was , he was a Hungarian truck driver who worked very close with -- with and Fifeger.</span> <span id="s549">He was, like, always with them.</span> <span id="s550">And we felt that by bringing in this nationalist, and by trying to put in more restrictions, and start -- they started also watching more of the -- all the movements and what's going on and what's happening in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s551">And they were very much concerned and very much were looking for -- for some kind of supplies that the Ghetto would supply or the Ghetto would produce or the Ghetto would have some contacts with the -- with the freedom fighters.</span> <span id="s552">So in order to have a tighter watch, they have also tried to squeeze out from the police and see whether their police -- to find within the police also some people who would -- who would be on their side.</span> <span id="s553">They were not -- were not too much able to -- they had not been able to get from the Jewish police, accept in isolated cases, because the police was well aware of what was happening.</span> <span id="s554">And they themselves -- the Ghetto was -- were the counsel in many occasions -- and in many cases have tried to they help.</span> <span id="s555">And they knew sometimes the whereabouts of people who would go out to the forest and fight and in different measures and acts of terrorism and blowing up railroads, cutting off supplies, and shooting in many cases, in back of the Germans.</span> <span id="s556">Although the Germans themselves, like -- the Germans themselves, they -- they -- most of the time they didn't dare to invade the forest because the forest was for them, taboo.</span> <span id="s557">But they used for that purpose, they used Lithuanians, in many cases, to find out and find out the right spots and then they would be able to -- be able to move in.</span> <span id="s558">We also saw, not only by the change of the guard and by their behavior, we had felt a bigger presence in the Ghetto of the military.</span> <span id="s559">Because normally, in all those years, they were most of the times guarding the Ghetto from the outside and they were hardly -- not too frequently, they used to come in and look for themselves, look in at certain aspects of the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s560">Now, in the late '43, we have -- we had a much bigger presence.</span> <span id="s561">There were also a repetition of people that -- of requirements for labor force in some other places within Lithuania and outside of Lithuania, whereby they used to come and, of course, make a selection or they used to appeal to the counsel in order to provide them with those elements who can be useful for them.</span> <span id="s562">And most of the times, they -- some of the times they also tried to get some people who had some skills, and tried to use them to the best of their -- their ability.</span> <span id="s563">We have seen also that factories, in the very sudden, have been over swamped with additional work.</span> <span id="s564">As the front was getting closer, there were more requirements and more necessities to -- for -- for the Germans, for their supplies.</span> <span id="s565">They needed the help and the cooperation of this .</span> <span id="s566">So they used to work overtime.</span> <span id="s567">I mean, instead ten or 12 hours, they used to work 14, 15 hours.</span> <span id="s568">And they also implemented some shifts in that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">The underground movement grew faster and faster.</span> <span id="s570">They had now much better opportunities because the Lithuanians by themselves also were not dumb.</span> <span id="s571">They saw that the tide was changing.</span> <span id="s572">So they, in many cases, they tried to befriend and be a little bit more helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Although, the same orders still persisted that if they catch somebody that they would have a .</span> <span id="s574">But we have seen that they were more aggressive in hiding people and in helping and -- in trying to make up for the damages that they have done before.</span> <span id="s575">When the -- in 1944, after the -- after children and after we have -- we have brought out our -- my cousin from the Ghetto, I myself started thinking in terms of getting away.</span> <span id="s576">I was in contact in two cases, in both --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: I would ask you to say that again because of the airplane.</span> <span id="s578">What are you going to tell me about now?</span> <span id="s579">Are you going to tell me about your escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s581">The guards, they are more frequently coming into the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s582">I didn't see, really a -- I mean, they were as brutal as they used to be because this -- especially foreigners -- the Hungarians, they were not good people especially.</span> <span id="s583">They were they were as brutal as there are, maybe some more than the others on many, many occasions.</span> <span id="s584">This truck driver, he was -- I mentioned about letting the people -- and telling them they can escape and so forth and so on, because people have started feeling that the air has changed that the front was getting closer and closer.</span> <span id="s585">And the question was when and how fast.</span> <span id="s586">At the same time, they started getting preparations for -- for -- to liquidate the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s587">Apparently this was mentioned in few occasions that -- that pretty soon they have already orders in place in order to eliminate the Ghetto, and to -- and to take out all those remains of the people.</span> <span id="s588">At that time, I think -- I'm sure that in the Ghetto there were not left over more than 4 or 5,000 people maybe, from 33,000 originally.</span> <span id="s589">So what they did is -- also, when they used to -- when the Ghetto became smaller -- smaller in population -- they also start cutting off smaller territories.</span> <span id="s590">What it is, where we had the where the gate was -- the gate for the supplies -- there was a number of houses that one day they came in and they took a bunch of people, workers, and they didn't remove the fence.</span> <span id="s591">It was the original fence.</span> <span id="s592">What they did is, they put in another fence, cutting off, like, four or five blocks from the original one.</span> <span id="s593">So it became like a Ghetto was in a Ghetto, you know.</span> <span id="s594">This was, in a certain way, to my personal advantage, you know, because -- and maybe some others, which I don't know.</span> <span id="s595">I can speak for myself on it.</span> <span id="s596">What they did is, actually by putting a new fence and putting guards -- putting guards around this fence, they have diminished the guards from the overall fence, which was before, even without taking off.</span> <span id="s597">What happened was, when we used to go to work, we decided -- five people decided to flee the camp.</span> <span id="s598">We saw already that the time is running out.</span> <span id="s599">I spoke three times to one friend of mine that was in the -- was in the partisans.</span> <span id="s600">And he told me that whenever I want to join them I should contact somebody in order to join them.</span> <span id="s601">The only thing is, after that I tried to get the contact man and he was already gone.</span> <span id="s602">So I went to where my uncle was and I told him, "Look, I think that it's no reason for me to remain here.</span> <span id="s603">I mean we're close.</span> <span id="s604">We're very close to the end.</span> <span id="s605">I mean, they are going -- one of these days, we are going to get up and we're going to find ourselves surrounded by trucks and they are just going to take us -- take us out and take us to camps or take us somewhere else or take us to the 9th Fort."</span> <span id="s606">So my uncle, who was very conservative always -- and he really was very close to me, like a father to me.</span> <span id="s607">And this was maybe one of reasons that I did not leave the place sooner.</span> <span id="s608">And especially my grandmother, she was crazy about me, you know.</span> <span id="s609">she has saved her, she would not -- and we knew that she also survived, you know, the children .</span> <span id="s610">That I also remember because she was with a child because now we couldn't get her out because it would be too difficult, you know, a child is something else.</span> <span id="s611">So my uncle came to the conclusion that's fine and gave me his blessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">And I deciding to -- now, how are we going to do it?</span> <span id="s613">So I devised a plan, in other words, the houses which were behind the first -- general fence, a few houses still left.</span> <span id="s614">They have -- Normally, in many cases they would explode some of the houses.</span> <span id="s615">They would put in some dynamite and explode it.</span> <span id="s616">Here, they did it later on with the rest of the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s617">So I had a -- I had three more people with me -- three -- four.</span> <span id="s618">There was one guy that was himself from Poland and for some reason he was stuck in and never was able to get out.</span> <span id="s619">I think it was the nephew of -- the nephew of my aunt, who is now in Charlotte, North Carolina.</span> <span id="s620">And then the other one was a guy that used to frequently come to our house.</span> <span id="s621">And then it was the other fellow that was -- also was a nephew of somebody who worked with my uncle.</span> <span id="s622">So this guy knew -- supposedly he knew the road, how to -- I mean, where to go in order to get to the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: You know what --</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: The forest was --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: -- I have to stop you, sir.</span> <span id="s626">The reason is, I think that people --</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s628">I'll make that short, you know.</span> <span id="s629">Okay.</span> <span id="s630">We were five, we have accumulated some supplies in one of the houses.</span> <span id="s631">And one day when we came back from work, we have -- we just defected from the -- from the group, which was large from when we came back from work.</span> <span id="s632">And we went into this house and then we watched the out guard -- the outside guarded had also special plans to cut -- to cut a wire.</span> <span id="s633">We have -- wait until the night.</span> <span id="s634">On that third day, we cut -- in our supplies what we had was water, sugar, and bread.</span> <span id="s635">We watched -- we timed the guards as far as walking, we cut through the wires, and we just came out.</span> <span id="s636">And we -- it was nighttime and we were not able to go too far because nighttime, it was -- it was very dangerous to go because you're able -- they would stop you and right away you would be finished.</span> <span id="s637">So we hid next to a house in the garden, there was dense bushes and we stayed there for the night.</span> <span id="s638">And then early morning, we left and we went towards the woods -- towards the woods which was .</span> <span id="s639">There was a place were there were already some partisans were working -- were working in exploding some supplies -- some supplies for the Germans and so on.</span> <span id="s640">Okay.</span> <span id="s641">We had to go through to a main highway.</span> <span id="s642">And when we walked, we walked like in one behind the other one.</span> <span id="s643">So when we reached the highway -- and this was during the daytime already, a guy with a -- with a bicycle and was dressed in civilian but with a rifle was waiting for us.</span> <span id="s644">And when we approached him, I mean, he took off the rifle and he said, "Your documents."</span> <span id="s645">Okay.</span> <span id="s646">We start running in different directions.</span> <span id="s647">This was outside the city, you know, it was a big field of potatoes and corn.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Details, I have no knowledge of the details.</span> <span id="s651">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: I know certain -- certain -- was in the camp, you know, but there is nothing that I was able personally to -- personally to verify.</span> <span id="s653">So -- okay.</span> <span id="s654">So we start and this guy took off his rifle and started shooting one of the five.</span> <span id="s655">I mean, he hid and then I found out later that they killed them.</span> <span id="s656">Four of us, we dispersed and I ran in one direction to the cornfield.</span> <span id="s657">And I saw some -- it was really late during the day and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: You know something?</span> <span id="s659">I hate to ask you to do this, but actually I'm concerned because this is on two tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Towards the beginning of '44, we have seen with a change, also, the status of the -- from the Ghetto to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s661">We felt a new arrangements and some things -- certain things -- certain changes which we -- it was not too hard for us to figure out.</span> <span id="s662">We saw the handwriting on the wall.</span> <span id="s663">We saw that everything that's happening with the Russian army, the victorious expelling, pushing the Germans towards -- towards the west.</span> <span id="s664">And we felt also that there is time for me and for some friends to get out and get out as soon as possible because every day was a matter that -- we knew exactly what our fate was going to be.</span> <span id="s665">So truthfully, we didn't have too much to risk because one way or the other way, we would not be able to survive.</span> <span id="s666">So I went to see any uncle and I told him that -- and my grandmother, I told them that I'm ready with my other fellow -- fellow friends to get out and to get out fast.</span> <span id="s667">So my uncle also gave me -- he had, like, a little golden coin and he gave this me and he said in case of necessity or something .</span> <span id="s668">He had, like, three of them so he was hiding them always in somewhere.</span> <span id="s669">So when -- soon I got together with my friends and when we went to work, coming back we just evaded the guards and we came -- came into one of the houses that we marked for our shelter in between, in order to be able to -- to plan our escape.</span> <span id="s670">One of my friends was much younger than us, a couple of years, and he was a short one, and we used him as the outlook.</span> <span id="s671">So he used to look in to watch.</span> <span id="s672">And he was the one that timed the steps of the guard on the outside of the fence and then came to the conclusion.</span> <span id="s673">He gave us the signal, we came out, we cut through the wires and it was nighttime.</span> <span id="s674">And we just slipped out, all of us.</span> <span id="s675">Because really the security was behind us in the smaller Ghetto where there was double-rolled barbed wire.</span> <span id="s676">This was an old fence which they had never tried to repair because the Ghetto was in the Ghetto, you know.</span> <span id="s677">Now, when we had to -- we slept over there in a -- in a garden, a dense garden.</span> <span id="s678">And in the morning we start going.</span> <span id="s679">But we left a distance between ourselves.</span> <span id="s680">Rather than walking in a group, we walked, like, one by one, some meters, one behind the other one.</span> <span id="s681">When we came to a place where we had to cross a highway there was one person with a bicycle and a rifle on his shoulder, a Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s682">And suddenly he came out and approached us, "Stop.</span> <span id="s683">Documents.</span> <span id="s684">Raise your hands."</span> <span id="s685">So when he did that, we start running in different directions.</span> <span id="s686">It was only one person and we knew that he might shoot one but he cannot shoot everybody.</span> <span id="s687">Besides that, his aim was not too good because I felt -- when I run, I felt, like, a couple bullets passing me and then I don't know.</span> <span id="s688">I really ran like never in my life.</span> <span id="s689">And then I threw myself in the cornfield.</span> <span id="s690">I know also that later on when I was laying there for quite a while, I know that they had some people with horses try to locate somebody and I hoped that they are not going to find anybody, but during nighttime I walked about additional half a mile and I saw the flickering lights.</span> <span id="s691">And I say to myself, "Would that with quarters for the chairman or some barracks or something?"</span> <span id="s692">Then I stepped away and I found myself close to a small, small woods.</span> <span id="s693">And there I slept over the night.</span> <span id="s694">It was a little bit cold nighttime, but I covered myself with leaves and some other things.</span> <span id="s695">And there was a little -- a little -- I wouldn't say a river, but it was little place with water.</span> <span id="s696">And then I was hiding behind the bushes.</span> <span id="s697">In the morning, I heard some voices in Russian and I watched and I saw that there a woman came and she -- apparently two friends.</span> <span id="s698">But one stayed with a -- with a metal thing, you know, what they put here -- put in cloth.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">And she started washing right around this where there was -- it was not even like a river.</span> <span id="s700">But it was a place that I remember I drunk water.</span> <span id="s701">I had my hat.</span> <span id="s702">So with my hat I used to take and drink the water because food was nothing.</span> <span id="s703">I used to collect some berries, you know, some wild berries, and this was my food.</span> <span id="s704">So I was desperate.</span> <span id="s705">I was very hungry and this woman was washing and I said myself, "Let me -- let me approach her."</span> <span id="s706">And I spoke perfect Russian, of course.</span> <span id="s707">So I came out.</span> <span id="s708">I said, "Look, I'm an escapee.</span> <span id="s709">You should help me with some food."</span> <span id="s710">So I was not sure whether she was going to go -- first of all, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s711">I asked her what was there in this place where I saw the flickering lights in the night.</span> <span id="s712">And she said, "No, that's a camp, a civilian camp for civilian Russians.</span> <span id="s713">An intern camp for civilian Russians."</span> <span id="s714">But then she told me that she is going to come back and bring me some food.</span> <span id="s715">And I thought to myself, I prayed, I said, "She is going to bring me food or she is going to bring me a German who is going to kill me."</span> <span id="s716">About 15 minutes later she comes back with a bottle of milk and a piece of spec (ph.) -- you know, that's from -- it's meat, fat meat, you know -- and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s717">And then I started talking to her and she said to me that she got scared when she saw me because I looked like I'm an old .</span> <span id="s718">And I explained to her that I'm a refugee so far.</span> <span id="s719">And so she said to me, "Look, we have in our camp two Russian prisoners who fled and who are hiding in out -- in this camp.</span> <span id="s720">And they also are going to -- they are planning to go to join the freedom fighters, the partisans.</span> <span id="s721">And where they are going?</span> <span id="s722">They are going to ."</span> <span id="s723">, -- there used to be the forest of , which was not too far away from there.</span> <span id="s724">And this guy that was with me, he was leading us.</span> <span id="s725">And he told us and he explained to me because he was himself from , and he told us, he gave me a certain set perimeters, but now I mean, he was gone, so I had to do them myself.</span> <span id="s726">So then in the evening, the two Russians came over.</span> <span id="s727">They had knives for themselves and they asked me a few questions and they wanted to verify that I'm legitimate, I shouldn't be some betrayer.</span> <span id="s728">And then the next morning -- early in the morning, we're going to the woods, we approached them and one of them had apparently a contact or he knew exactly a certain spot.</span> <span id="s729">First of all, the Russian prisoners were not treated very friendly by the Russians because Stalin's -- Stalin's view was that a Russian should never fell into a prisoner's life, he should give his life for the country.</span> <span id="s730">But of course, that was not the case.</span> <span id="s731">So he took us to the forest at one point and he -- then we met about three or four more guys there.</span> <span id="s732">They were from the -- apparently they were former Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s733">And they had already a plan, a topographic plan, and they had all rolls.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">They said that they had received some supplies from parachutes that they -- and they had some assignment to watch and to see whether some German forces are going -- if they are going to be close by, they have to communicate and they have to try to do certain sabotage -- sabotage work.</span> <span id="s735">We spent about, I would say, maybe about close to 20 days moving around from one spot to the other one because we didn't want to stay in one spot.</span> <span id="s736">On few occasions -- I was not trained, I didn't know anything about ammunition or anything.</span> <span id="s737">They have done, basically, the work.</span> <span id="s738">In different cases, I was the look out.</span> <span id="s739">They used me to be the look out.</span> <span id="s740">They had some light arms and knives basically, and they had some back packs with ammunition.</span> <span id="s741">We spent about, I would say about four weeks.</span> <span id="s742">And one day, we heard the movement.</span> <span id="s743">We put our ears -- normally, what we used to do is, we used to put our ears to the ground so we can detect -- that's a way of detecting whether there is some heavy movement and here we detected some -- based on our imaginations -- some tanks.</span> <span id="s744">And now we saw about three or four German tanks rolling not too far away, you know.</span> <span id="s745">And then about a couple hours later, we heard some shootings and an exchange of fire.</span> <span id="s746">And this whole neighborhood vicinity became like a -- like a military -- I mean, hell.</span> <span id="s747">Because bullets were flying out at the shrubs -- so burning -- burning bushes and all this.</span> <span id="s748">It was an incredible, incredible exchange of fire.</span> <span id="s749">Then, it lasted for about an hour, an hour and a half and it looked to me that it lasted forever, you know.</span> <span id="s750">Because we found ourselves in the middle and we said to ourselves, "Now we are going to be killed by friendly -- by friendly -- our friendly power -- gun fire."</span> <span id="s751">Suddenly, it whitened out.</span> <span id="s752">It was quiet like nothing -- like nothing ever -- anything ever happened, you know.</span> <span id="s753">And I say to one of Russians, "What would that be?</span> <span id="s754">It's too quiet."</span> <span id="s755">We got used already to the -- to the incredible sound of explosions, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">And then suddenly we heard again -- the Russian put his -- he put his ear on the ground.</span> <span id="s757">He said, "Something is happening.</span> <span id="s758">It's quite apparent but something is happening."</span> <span id="s759">And, like, 45 minutes later we heard some movement of, like, troops.</span> <span id="s760">Not too many.</span> <span id="s761">And then we saw the first Russians approaching us.</span> <span id="s762">And the first question was -- the first question was, "Have you seen some tanks?"</span> <span id="s763">"Yeah, we saw quite a few hours ago."</span> <span id="s764">And he said, "No, these tanks already .</span> <span id="s765">Have you seen some other tanks?"</span> <span id="s766">I said, "No."</span> <span id="s767">Right away it was -- I amazed, you know, because right away I was approached by one of the lieutenants.</span> <span id="s768">I think he was a captain, not lieutenants -- captain, because he had three stars.</span> <span id="s769">It was a captain.</span> <span id="s770">He had actually told me that -- he looked at me and looked at me and says, "Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s771">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s772">"So am I," he says.</span> <span id="s773">Okay.</span> <span id="s774">We embraced each other and he -- right away what he did is, he told us -- he said, "Look, this is the front line and the line might change because we don't know what -- what is going to happen a few kilometers from here.</span> <span id="s775">My advisors, and what I want to see you is towards the back."</span> <span id="s776">You know, towards the back .</span> <span id="s777">And right away, he called a soldier and he said, "Take these guys and take them over."</span> <span id="s778">And in the meantime, we was already approaching some jeeps and some -- some -- some other military units.</span> <span id="s779">And he told us to move as far as possible towards the back.</span> <span id="s780">He said, "You went through already, it's sufficient."</span> <span id="s781">I mean, it's -- and this was the -- this was actually the way that we -- so happy.</span> <span id="s782">I mean, the first time we felt, like, liberated, you know.</span> <span id="s783">And then he asked me -- another guy that he referred me to asked me some question.</span> <span id="s784">He said me whether I want to join the army or what I want to do.</span> <span id="s785">I said, "No, no, first what I want to do is, I want to go -- I want to see" -- because my question was, how soon are they going to liberate Kaunas?</span> <span id="s786">He said, "That might take still a few days or it still might take some time."</span> <span id="s787">So we where with the army for about -- I think about ten or 15 days until they have to Kaunas and to liberated it.</span> <span id="s788">I went right away to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s789">The Ghetto was exploded.</span> <span id="s790">Everything, all the houses were exploded.</span> <span id="s791">So people came out from the hiding in some places, some people came out from hiding.</span> <span id="s792">I went to this place where we were hiding and we had some photographs and I found some photographs.</span> <span id="s793">But supplies and other things that we had in our -- in our house in the ground was nothing.</span> <span id="s794">It was, like, everything burned.</span> <span id="s795">Right away I went to Kaunas.</span> <span id="s796">This was .</span> <span id="s797">I went to Kaunas, I got myself -- right away I met with this officer and he told me that he is going to -- he is -- I mean, that he is going to be coming into Kaunas and he gave me a number where I can reach him.</span> <span id="s798">And he told me that if I have some -- some kind of desire of something.</span> <span id="s799">I said, "Yeah, I would like to have -- I have some -- I have some relatives here, and I would like to see whether I can find them."</span> <span id="s800">I'm sure that I felt very optomistic.</span> <span id="s801">I said, "Maybe there are some relatives that I have."</span> <span id="s802">And I start floundering around for quite a few days.</span> <span id="s803">And then I found a family that we were together in the Ghetto and then later they went to Canada.</span> <span id="s804">But I used to send them packages when I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s805">When -- just a minute -- but I send them packages after, when I want there anymore.</span> <span id="s806">They -- I helped them to find a place -- a living place because the city was -- was devastated, you know.</span> <span id="s807">There were not too many -- too much fights in the city, but it was many have escaped and left behind themselves apartments with furniture.</span> <span id="s808">You know, the same way, like, when the -- when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s809">So right away I found a friend of mine who told me that if I would like to serve -- to serve in the Russian army because, due to the fact that I have finished gymnasium, I speak Lithuanian, German, and Russian, so I would be able to prospect.</span> <span id="s810">He told me that there is coming a group of -- a group of people to -- of military men to take some -- to -- they are looking for some interpreters.</span> <span id="s811">They need very badly people who speak Lithuanian and Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Basically German is not -- at this point, is not important but it's going to become important later.</span> <span id="s813">And at the same time, they promulgated already that all these people from this and this year are going to be -- they are going to be from 1924, 1925, 1926, they are going to be taken into the army -- to the regular army.</span> <span id="s814">And I say to myself, "I would rather serve in a specialty unit than to wait and then we recruited for the army."</span> <span id="s815">They had a place to this -- this is a military place, whereby they check out new -- they check out perspective soldiers, you know, healthwise and whether they have TB because there were many with TB, you know, from those that survived.</span> <span id="s816">So I actually signed up for this -- for this unit.</span> <span id="s817">I remember a younger captain came in and -- and interviewed me and he was satisfied.</span> <span id="s818">And then he told me that he is going to recruit me and I will have to go through a short preparation -- military preparation of about six weeks.</span> <span id="s819">And I agreed.</span> <span id="s820">In the meantime, he told me I can stay there and he gave me an official paper where I can go and find myself an apartment.</span> <span id="s821">So I found my relatives, those I mentioned.</span> <span id="s822">And I found myself not too far away where I used to live before, on the some , on same main street.</span> <span id="s823">I got myself a nice apartment and my relatives were very happy.</span> <span id="s824">They had two children and myself and I told them, "Look, I'm going to be just here only temporarily and I'm going to be leaving."</span> <span id="s825">And also, it was very interesting walking on the -- when I got myself a bicycle and riding on a bike, I met a very good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s826">This , who was the head of the .</span> <span id="s827">He wasn't in the Ghetto and he was involved in the partisans.</span> <span id="s828">And he escaped -- I mean, he joined in the also in the army but in the civilian department.</span> <span id="s829">They made him, like, commissary in the civilian department because he had excellent contacts with some high-ranking people.</span> <span id="s830">So I met with him and it was incredible, incredible meeting, you know, in the middle of nowhere or something, like, in the middle of the city, to meet someone who was such a close friend of mine.</span> <span id="s831">And so from there, I was -- I was sent to a -- to a training camp and in about six weeks they send me to the first nation.</span> <span id="s832">I was recruited, got the uniform, got my -- they sent me within Lithuania, in certain places to be attached to the -- there was also -- you see, there was also a Lithuanian brigade under Commander Bellinski (ph.), which was formed right when the war -- in the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s833">Very brave.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Many of those people died in Russia and it was incredible.</span> <span id="s835">But I didn't -- I joined the regular army, which I said that is a policing force, which is called the -- it was the 33rd regimen of the , which was the border police, attached to the .</span> <span id="s836">After the training and after they send me to Lithuania, they send me to a place which was in -- it was in Lativa.</span> <span id="s837">And there they had big -- a big fight because there were the -- I don't know whether you heard about the , that is a General from Ukraine who joined the Germans and he created a Ukrainian -- Ukrainian battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Almost the army who fought with the Germans against the Russians, against their own people.</span> <span id="s839">So there were entrenched a group of those people and they fought to the nail because they knew that if they are going to be captured, they are going to be killed.</span> <span id="s840">They wouldn't take them as prisoners.</span> <span id="s841">And there I had my first incident.</span> <span id="s842">I was in jeep with a captain and a driver and there was a big shelling, and it hit the jeep and I was just knocked out from the jeep and I found myself later in the hospital.</span> <span id="s843">Thank God I had only two broken ribs and a small -- small contusions and some other things.</span> <span id="s844">But the captain who was sitting next to me was killed, a Russian captain.</span> <span id="s845">And then from there, they sent me up to .</span> <span id="s846">It took me about 14, 15 days to be back on my feet.</span> <span id="s847">They send me to Germany, was to and participate in liberating the City of which was very interesting.</span> <span id="s848">And from there, they came an order to -- after a while, came an order -- a special order, that our regimen was going to be sent entirely to the Islands, to the Japanese front.</span> <span id="s849">And I was the only one that got the assignment to join 's army in the direction of Berlin.</span> <span id="s850">And this was -- and I feel that this was because the that was in charge -- I mean the , I think he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s851">And I told him once -- I pleaded with him, I told him, "Look, if you are going to send me to the Islands, I am going to be of no use and I am in the mood to take vengeance for my people and I think my place should be on the German front rather than on the Japanese front."</span> <span id="s852">So next day, I found a -- it's called , that means my assignment to travel.</span> <span id="s853">And this is when I traveled through Warsaw.</span> <span id="s854">I remember traveling through Warsaw bridge, it took us maybe an hour to pass this bridge because the bridge was completely damaged and the train was going slowly through that.</span> <span id="s855">And then there I joined -- I joined 's forces.</span> <span id="s856">And this was incredible experience, an incredible experience.</span> <span id="s857">And then we marched, I mean we continued to Berlin and we also liberated a concentration camp of Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s858">And we had, in our power, most of the -- of the guards from the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s859">Now the --</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Tell me a little bit more about what you saw when you got to Sachsenhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: What we saw was -- was terrible, terrible things.</span> <span id="s862">I mean the , there were few people -- I mean, not too many people.</span> <span id="s863">I would say a few hundred people.</span> <span id="s864">Maybe there might be more than than that, maybe there were 1,000 people that were liberated.</span> <span id="s865">Most of them we found many, many, many ravines with human bodies, you know, skeletons.</span> <span id="s866">And it was a terrible, terrible, terrible view, you know, to see that.</span> <span id="s867">See what actually -- and in Sachsenhausen, there were not only Jews, there were also many, many from other different nationalities.</span> <span id="s868">There were Russian prisoners, there were Polocks, and there were some non-Jewish people also.</span> <span id="s869">We have -- we were successful because they actually -- they wanted to play the cards, actually threw away their weapons and they wanted to -- they actually surrendered.</span> <span id="s870">The fight was -- it was not a big fight because they felt that it's over and although there were SS, they were pure SS.</span> <span id="s871">They were not the .</span> <span id="s872">And they were all apprehended, most of them.</span> <span id="s873">The head of the camp and the commander of the camp and the more important people were -- they escaped.</span> <span id="s874">They would spend their short time -- there was also a very big stench, you know, because this camp was -- was devastated, you know.</span> <span id="s875">They had committed so many atrocities, apparently they wanted to move the people to move out -- to move out a little bit further because Sachsenhausen is not far from Berlin.</span> <span id="s876">It's like 50 kilometers from Berlin.</span> <span id="s877">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: We have to change the tape.</span> <span id="s879">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: So they have decided and it was a captain that was decided that they rather than -- they rather surrender than keep up fighting.</span> <span id="s881">The people were -- I mean, they were, like, stunned when we came in.</span> <span id="s882">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s883">They thought we were angels.</span> <span id="s884">We were -- we were -- we came down from heaven, you know.</span> <span id="s885">They have never, never, never believed that they are going to be able to survive because that was a German camp.</span> <span id="s886">It was not many Germans, also, German Jews.</span> <span id="s887">It was a swift liberation on this -- this camp was remarkable.</span> <span id="s888">And then, through the guards, we found out many, many, many details in questioning them.</span> <span id="s889">We brought them to -- those people, we brought them to our headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">End of Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: I'll let you finish --</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Right.</span> <span id="s894">Let me finish -- let me finish this part, which is -- I'll tell something.</span> <span id="s895">One day, I will talk to Spielburg and one day we'll make a very profitable film for him.</span> <span id="s896">So I had my German , which I got from the chief of police when we were out hunting.</span> <span id="s897">I had my Russian .</span> <span id="s898">I had money, rubles, money in German occupational marks, and I had a little caliber.</span> <span id="s899">And the little caliber was -- and you will not believe for what.</span> <span id="s900">Not to shoot anybody, but to shoot myself if they would catch me because there's no question in my mind, they would have done this without any reproach, you know.</span> <span id="s901">So -- and then we moved to the -- move to the train and I figured already everything out.</span> <span id="s902">I figured we had a long voyage to a small town which is going to the direction to Bremen, but Bremen is in the British Zone of occupation.</span> <span id="s903">But I felt that -- I figured out, I said, "I know that this train is going to be searched.</span> <span id="s904">There is going to be a -- some type of guard is going to come in at some certain point to check the documents on the train."</span> <span id="s905">Because that was a normal procedure and I knew it was going to happen.</span> <span id="s906">I also -- I thought to myself, "It's going to come in a German guard, I'm going to show them that I am a Russian and I traveled there to see some relatives."</span> <span id="s907">And I didn't have a problem because I had also this , my was out of town.</span> <span id="s908">He was in Moscow for a conference and I had the right to travel to certain distance because I needed a special permit which I didn't have, but I could justify my trip, you know, because I didn't carry with me any belongings or anything, just maybe a small thing.</span> <span id="s909">Then I said, "If it comes a Russian, I'm going to identify myself as a German."</span> <span id="s910">What can they do?</span> <span id="s911">Okay.</span> <span id="s912">We travel.</span> <span id="s913">The train was crowded.</span> <span id="s914">I mean, so crowded it was you unable to turn.</span> <span id="s915">Suddenly, we come to a certain point, there's soldiers.</span> <span id="s916">Russians and Germans together.</span> <span id="s917">I said, "That's .</span> <span id="s918">That's .</span> <span id="s919">What shall I do?"</span> <span id="s920">And I had to think quickly.</span> <span id="s921">I was next to the guy with his wife and we were chatting and here comes the -- "Documents, documents, documents."</span> <span id="s922">I ventured to pull out my German rather than Russian and I think I made the right decision, you know.</span> <span id="s923">In the middle of looking at my -- checking my document, the child starts crying.</span> <span id="s924">And some way that tension was deflected and I was -- I think it was a sheer -- sheer luck for me, you know.</span> <span id="s925">And they just ask me where I traveled and I said, " a town and ."</span> <span id="s926">"So why do you come ?"</span> <span id="s927">And I said a few words in German, you know, and my worries were over.</span> <span id="s928">They came to the -- almost to the border.</span> <span id="s929">We came off and he said to me, "We have to go now.</span> <span id="s930">We have to walk now for about two kilometers because there is a place where I'll always go through where there is a very little -- sometimes even they don't have even a guard on the border."</span> <span id="s931">Because you see, it's not a natural border, not where they -- which they had -- which they made later in the later years when they had air supply, Berlin, that was much more difficult to escape.</span> <span id="s932">But in 1947, was still -- you know, it was still at a point where the war was still -- they were still not, not organized now.</span> <span id="s933">And I remember when we crossed -- I mean, we heard some shots on the other side, but it was not irrelevant.</span> <span id="s934">We crossed and there were -- not the last, there were quite a few people who crossed.</span> <span id="s935">Apparently, this was the place where we crossed the border and there was a big sign that said, "You are entering the British Zone of occupation.</span> <span id="s936">If you have some armorments or some illegal items, the is here, here, here.</span> <span id="s937">You have to immediately identify yourself and the ."</span> <span id="s938">I kissed the ground when I found myself in this.</span> <span id="s939">And then I pulled out -- first thing, I threw my pistol and I said, "Hell with that."</span> <span id="s940">I was going to throw it, this guy grabs me by the hand, he says, "What is that?</span> <span id="s941">I didn't know you were armed," he said to me.</span> <span id="s942">I said, "Why not?"</span> <span id="s943">And he said, "It's completely prohibited.</span> <span id="s944">You cannot have arms.</span> <span id="s945">I mean, it's against -- it's against the terms, you know.</span> <span id="s946">So who are you?</span> <span id="s947">You are not a smuggler like you told me."</span> <span id="s948">I said, "No, I'm sorry to tell you, but I'm a Russian officer."</span> <span id="s949">He says, "You're crazy.</span> <span id="s950">How come you didn't tell me?"</span> <span id="s951">I said, "Because I didn't feel it was relevant at the point."</span> <span id="s952">He said, "Give me, give me.</span> <span id="s953">Let me see the pistol."</span> <span id="s954">He says, "Oh, you know what this is.</span> <span id="s955">You know what, I'm going to bury that right here.</span> <span id="s956">When I come out I'll take it.</span> <span id="s957">It's worth $500."</span> <span id="s958">He said, "This is so beautiful.</span> <span id="s959">This is real -- real elephant bone handle.</span> <span id="s960">I mean, it's worth a fortune."</span> <span id="s961">I said, "You can have it.</span> <span id="s962">You need some marks?"</span> <span id="s963">I told me, "You have here marks also, because they are useless here."</span> <span id="s964">Because I had Russian occupation -- I mean, the German occupational marks, which belong to the Russian .</span> <span id="s965">The Russians -- the British and Americans all had different -- different marks now.</span> <span id="s966">So I gave it to him and then we went to -- from there we went to Bremen.</span> <span id="s967">In Bremen, we slept in the -- in the railroad station.</span> <span id="s968">I had my knapsack and my boots were in my pillow and we were so happy.</span> <span id="s969">From there I had to go to Bergen-Belsen, which was in the vicinity.</span> <span id="s970">Because there I had my contact.</span> <span id="s971">I went to Bergen-Belsen, and spend there a night.</span> <span id="s972">And then I found the man that's suppose to take me back to -- take me to Munich.</span> <span id="s973">And then I came to Munich, my friend was ecstatic.</span> <span id="s974">He had a little, tiny room, you know, as big as my closet here.</span> <span id="s975">And he says, "You can share it.</span> <span id="s976">You can stay here."</span> <span id="s977">And for the first time, I had a good meal, you know.</span> <span id="s978">It was fantastic, some American products and some other thing.</span> <span id="s979">I forget to mention to you that when we were in Berlin, I had to mention to you something very important.</span> <span id="s980">That I overlooked something.</span> <span id="s981">Being in Berlin, we have a -- I have special mission.</span> <span id="s982">I don't know how many people are aware, but I don't think too many are aware of that.</span> <span id="s983">I'm going to tell you that they have transplanted factories from Berlin to some -- they used to take them to different parts of Russia.</span> <span id="s984">So I was assigned a mission.</span> <span id="s985">It was a truck with three soldiers to go to -- they have -- take out the Company from Berlin, and they are suppose to be shipped to Lenigra (ph.) to dismantle completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Not only dismantled, what they have for assignment was to take the workers, including even the lowest paid guy, like, the guy that cleans the factory.</span> <span id="s987">Everybody had to be placed on a train by five o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s988">And we used to come with a truck and come to the house and knock on the door and say, "Be out in five minutes."</span> <span id="s989">So having five minutes -- so you have five minutes to get your belongings and out to the car.</span> <span id="s990">This was such a pleasure, this task that I had.</span> <span id="s991">Of course, it was nothing compared to what they have done to me.</span> <span id="s992">But it was, I found a certain -- although, I didn't have anything against the guys -- the guys that worked there in the factory.</span> <span id="s993">Now, this factory, for a fact, they were so organized -- the Russians were so disorganized, that it took them "X" amount of months to reach the destiny for the factory.</span> <span id="s994">And then they found out that part of the factory went to one place, to Smolensk and the other went to Lenigra.</span> <span id="s995">And that was -- but I had to mention that because that was a very, very unique experience, you know.</span> <span id="s996">Whereby, I was in charge of taking -- I mean, to -- disassembling and taking these people to the train station at five o'clock.</span> <span id="s997">And it was remarkable.</span> <span id="s998">You know, Sometimes if you remember certain -- certain -- okay.</span> <span id="s999">So when I came -- when I came to Munich, I -- it happened to be those people I used to send packages.</span> <span id="s1000">Those relatives were in Feldafing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: They were in Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Next to Munich was small DP camps.</span> <span id="s1003">One was Landsberg and the other was Feldafing.</span> <span id="s1004">They were in Feldafing.</span> <span id="s1005">So I stayed couple days in and then he took me to Feldafing because they are relatives.</span> <span id="s1006">And this lady, Fruma Lankavich (ph.), she went out of her way to accommodate me and to -- and to help me out.</span> <span id="s1007">And what I wanted basically is to get -- is to get out from Germany and go to Cuba.</span> <span id="s1008">So there was -- I asked her -- from there, I wrote already freely to Cuba and they send me some -- they send me letters and send me also a letter saying that they have the instituted a visit for me in Paris to go -- I mean, in order to come to Cuba.</span> <span id="s1009">Now, how do you go to Paris?</span> <span id="s1010">I don't have any documents.</span> <span id="s1011">I start working on documents.</span> <span id="s1012">In the meantime, a guy came by and he said that he's capable, you know, very desperate, you know.</span> <span id="s1013">The time was now important to get out.</span> <span id="s1014">I mean, we just wanted to reach already a destiny.</span> <span id="s1015">There was so many pain and suffering.</span> <span id="s1016">So we had -- the guy said that for $100 he is going to make me false papers to travel to France.</span> <span id="s1017">So I found a -- a friend of the family, by the name of Bernard Pickford (ph.), who also was from the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1018">And he was a bridageer here -- the brigade, Bernard Pickford.</span> <span id="s1019">And he lend me the $100.</span> <span id="s1020">And I gave it to the guy and he gave me this paper, it didn't look to me good but I figured he knows what he's doing.</span> <span id="s1021">But through the train, we went to and to .</span> <span id="s1022">And when we came to France, the came out and the French police took us off and sent -- was going to send us back.</span> <span id="s1023">And I got very, very scared so I took out certain things that I had from the Russians and I just flushed then down the toilet, you know.</span> <span id="s1024">Because I figured maybe they are going to send me back to the .</span> <span id="s1025">At that time you were fearful, you didn't know.</span> <span id="s1026">They might send you back to your destiny, where you were coming from.</span> <span id="s1027">So then I came back to Feldafing and we start working .</span> <span id="s1028">And she helped me so much, this Fruma.</span> <span id="s1029">Fortunately, they went later to Canada and she's passed away now.</span> <span id="s1030">So then I was able to -- I got -- I got already the real papers, went to France, and then there I had my visa.</span> <span id="s1031">I spent in France a few days, and then I found out that in order to go to United States -- to Cuba -- I have to go to United States and I need a visa.</span> <span id="s1032">And this is eight months -- you needed to wait for eight months to get a visa for the United States.</span> <span id="s1033">And so I started -- I found out also another guy that was going to Cuba, by the name -- same name like me, Abraham, but his name was Rubenowitz (ph.).</span> <span id="s1034">And he told me, "Wherever you go, I go with you."</span> <span id="s1035">I said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s1036">So I start walking up and down in France, in Paris, and looking.</span> <span id="s1037">I spoke a little English so it was easier for me because he didn't and I thought -- finally, I found -- we found a maiden flight of a six-motor hydroplane from Air France.</span> <span id="s1038">It was going to Dakar (ph.), Africa, and Portatin (ph.).</span> <span id="s1039">And from there -- from the Dakar to Portatin.</span> <span id="s1040">So we -- what I did is, we had our tickets from Pan American, we exchanged that and the company, they gave us credit and some way we hustled around and all together what we had was $10 in our pocket.</span> <span id="s1041">Then we took the trip on this six-motor hydroplane and it took us -- it was an incredible flight.</span> <span id="s1042">They gave us champagne and we felt like kings already there.</span> <span id="s1043">And then when we came to Portatin, we had to go to Antequa (ph.) -- British Antequa.</span> <span id="s1044">So from there, we went -- we had to take a boat and go there, to British Antequa.</span> <span id="s1045">And from British Antequa, we found out that in order to go to Cuba, we need still an American transit visa because we have to stay in Puerto Rico, which is an American -- Q: You were carrying a French passport now?</span> <span id="s1046">A: I didn't have a passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: I had a paper which said "stateless," a person without a country.</span> <span id="s1049">That was there for everybody's standards.</span> <span id="s1050">It was so like -- so finally, in Antequa, there was a -- it's a very small British island, but very clean.</span> <span id="s1051">I remember comparing it to the -- to the French, which was .</span> <span id="s1052">The counsel was staying at the same hotel that we stayed at.</span> <span id="s1053">And the lady that -- we told her our stories and she made arrangements for us to see the counsel the next day.</span> <span id="s1054">So next day when we went in.</span> <span id="s1055">The first question of the counsel was, "Do you have some money to sleep overnight in Puerto Rico?"</span> <span id="s1056">I said, "Of course."</span> <span id="s1057">I show him the $10 very proudly.</span> <span id="s1058">When I came out, I gave it to my friend.</span> <span id="s1059">He came in with the same $10 and show that he has also $10, because that was the minimum that you could have.</span> <span id="s1060">And then August 1st -- and from there we cabled my uncle that we were coming down.</span> <span id="s1061">So August 1st, 1947, and my uncle came with his car to pick me up and pick up my friend.</span> <span id="s1062">And this was the way we came to Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Long trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: It was a long trip but I found somebody waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1065">Q: Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Now, go ahead with the questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: I have a couple of questions.</span> <span id="s1068">I want you to turn your chair back a little bit this way.</span> <span id="s1069">A: That's not the question that's the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Keep going.</span> <span id="s1071">Keep going.</span> <span id="s1072">Now, there are a couple of things that we talked about.</span> <span id="s1073">A: That are missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1075">One is the 9th Fort.</span> <span id="s1076">A: Yeah, the -- yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: In late 1943.</span> <span id="s1078">You can tell me what your memory is for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1080">This is precisely -- I have a book of that which I have not had a chance to read.</span> <span id="s1081">The 9th Fort was one of the most vicious and criminal places in Lithuanian, whereby, most of the -- most of the inmates from the camps were taken.</span> <span id="s1082">And it was -- we had few forts, but the 9th Fort was the one that's for -- were the -- it was best equipped to kill and also to dispose of the bodies.</span> <span id="s1083">But you see, there were so many -- so many people were killed -- or murdered, not killed -- at the 9th Fort, that they didn't have -- didn't give them time to get rid of the bodies.</span> <span id="s1084">So what they did is, they used to burn -- they used to place them in rows, you know, one top of the other one.</span> <span id="s1085">But then, apparently towards at the end of 1943, there came an order from the command that it has to be something done in order to eliminate the bodies.</span> <span id="s1086">So they looked for a commander and they took a number of people and -- of Jews from the -- from the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1087">And they had decided they had some other people which they kept there for a long time.</span> <span id="s1088">What they used to do with those people is, after they -- after they did their -- their dirty work, they used to kill them and then bring in some new people now because they always tried to hide their tracks behind them and the evidence behind them.</span> <span id="s1089">So they brought in this contingency of this other commander and they were there for some time and they tried to -- they exhumed the bodies and they tried to burn them.</span> <span id="s1090">And the way they used to do that, they used to lay them in layers and put in wood in between and then pour gas and then -- of course, in the concentration camps they used crematoriums, which was more advanced technology.</span> <span id="s1091">They did it in more primitive way.</span> <span id="s1092">And incidentally, I have some friends who are -- especially one friend that send me now a book -- that escaped, one of the escapees.</span> <span id="s1093">It was an incredible, incredible escape which is like escaping from Sing Sing (ph.) or for -- whereby, they have plan.</span> <span id="s1094">They knew that they are not going to last too long because after they burn, they are going to be one of those who are going to be burned also.</span> <span id="s1095">So what they plotted is, they found themselves that they have .</span> <span id="s1096">They have some way got some additional -- additional liquor for the guards and when they were drunk, they traced -- they had a map of the 9th Fort and they -- some way they were able to escape and this was an escape, like, a large group of people were able to escape.</span> <span id="s1097">And this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Where did they go?</span> <span id="s1099">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Where did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: They -- many of them went to the partisans.</span> <span id="s1102">Especially my friend.</span> <span id="s1103">He joined the freedom fighters and he survived.</span> <span id="s1104">I mean, he survived being in the underground in the freedom fighters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: When you refer to the "partisans," are you talking about Russian partisans, Lithuanian partisans, Jewish partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: There were a mixture.</span> <span id="s1107">There were a mixture.</span> <span id="s1108">They had -- they had -- most of the time, they had Lithuanian -- had in some cases, they were as head of the partisans, were Lithuanian, in many cases.</span> <span id="s1109">In more of the cases, they were Russians.</span> <span id="s1110">But there were some few Lithuanian parties instead of partisans -- depending on what section you where in, what part of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: But did they fight together in the same groups?</span> <span id="s1112">A: No, not necessarily, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: So when the people from -- A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: -- went out into the forest to fight like you did for a while, were you basically on your own or were you -- you had your own experience with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Yeah, I was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: But did they ever join up with the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: They -- they used to try to join up at one point.</span> <span id="s1118">But it was always -- it was -- practically, it was not to be in big groups because big groups are spotted much easier than smaller groups.</span> <span id="s1119">Even when they had bigger groups they used to separate themselves in smaller groups and disperse themselves in different -- in different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: What I was trying to understand is if the Russians had the Jewish partisans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: They were a supply -- they were not -- they were in some places, they were in the , there were Jewish partisans.</span> <span id="s1122">Some of there were still -- Bellski (ph.) .</span> <span id="s1123">They were strong, maybe 500, 600.</span> <span id="s1124">That was a big, big contingency.</span> <span id="s1125">But there were .</span> <span id="s1126">You know what means?</span> <span id="s1127">It's a forest which is very dense and very, very difficult to penetrate.</span> <span id="s1128">It's like a jungle.</span> <span id="s1129">But normally, Lithuania was not so dense, especially where we were, close to not a great, great forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">.</span> <span id="s1131">There was a forest but it was not this type --</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: How many -- how long were you out in the forest?</span> <span id="s1133">A: About five weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Would you say that as a full sentence?</span> <span id="s1135">A: Pardon?</span> <span id="s1136">Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Would you say that as a full sentence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1139">I was about close to five weeks in the far away from Kovno.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">.</span> <span id="s1141">, which is not too</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: When you -- when you traveled back into Kovno with the Russian army and you saw what had happened to the city.</span> <span id="s1143">It must have been a -- it must have been an incredible feeling to go back into --</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: You mean when I came back to the Ghetto?</span> <span id="s1145">First -- first trip was my trip was to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s1146">I mean, I was very anxious to find out what happened to the house where I lived and to the -- and to the basement where we had -- where ingeniously, we used to make basements even during the time in the Ghetto, in many places.</span> <span id="s1147">And that's the reason why they -- somebody -- somebody -- I mean, betrayed us, you know.</span> <span id="s1148">There were somebody betrayed many, many of us.</span> <span id="s1149">But that's one of reasons why they came in.</span> <span id="s1150">How did the Germans find out?</span> <span id="s1151">Because this was done so carefully.</span> <span id="s1152">The sand or the soil was taken so carefully and it was done in the nighttime.</span> <span id="s1153">And it was like -- like -- termites, you know, a slow, very slow process.</span> <span id="s1154">And how did they know where it is?</span> <span id="s1155">Imagine, in my house, when I came in, we had -- what we had is steps to the second floor.</span> <span id="s1156">So what we did is, it was, like, professionally engineered.</span> <span id="s1157">We were able to take out a whole step and right through there, slide into the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: To hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: To hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: To hide.</span> <span id="s1162">To hide -- in fact, hide things -- where I -- where we hide my cousin.</span> <span id="s1163">Q: A lot of people made hiding places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: A lot of people made hiding places, yeah.</span> <span id="s1165">And for some reason, they found out.</span> <span id="s1166">My place was open.</span> <span id="s1167">When I came, it was open.</span> <span id="s1168">And I found only some photographs.</span> <span id="s1169">I didn't find anything else, you know.</span> <span id="s1170">But it was not -- it was not destroyed.</span> <span id="s1171">It was not burned.</span> <span id="s1172">But in many other cases, were burned.</span> <span id="s1173">And some people were buried under the -- under the rubble of the -- they used to come in and throw grenades to make sure that -- the Germans would come into a house and whether there is somebody or not, throw a grenade and everything would -- if one was not sufficient, throw other grenade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Did you see any Jewish people around?</span> <span id="s1175">Were there people around when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: No.</span> <span id="s1177">When I came I didn't see anybody.</span> <span id="s1178">I mean, I saw people wandering, but I found out that there were -- there were -- few families saved themselves.</span> <span id="s1179">And they were able to come out to come -- although they exploded most of them, put few families -- but that was really -- I came in it was already, like, five, six days after they liberated the city, so people already came out.</span> <span id="s1180">Some way they sensed that they are free and they came out, so I was not able.</span> <span id="s1181">But I went -- I went in down to the -- and I found some on photographs which I -- which I cherish.</span> <span id="s1182">And I have them with me so far.</span> <span id="s1183">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Do you think that there was a special spirit of defiance in Kovno, when people -- like, the people escaping from the 9th Fort or the hiding or the going to the forest?</span> <span id="s1185">Do you thing there was something unique about this, as a spiritual resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s1187">I think it was in every place.</span> <span id="s1188">The only thing is that people -- it's very hard for people to understand that the Lithuania was -- you see, I don't know about Poland as much, you know -- but in Lithuanian, it was very difficult to penetrate and to go threw because we had two layers of difficulties.</span> <span id="s1189">One was that the Lithuanians were very, very much anti-semetic in a sense and they would betray -- most of them, you know, most of them -- betray anybody that tried to hide or trying to reach something.</span> <span id="s1190">Because many -- most of my friends were killed by -- were -- were -- I mean, caught by -- caught by Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s1191">The same time, I was almost caught by Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s1192">It was not a German.</span> <span id="s1193">German wouldn't know me from nothing, whether I am Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s1194">But they have sense -- they -- they were able to identify.</span> <span id="s1195">And it was extremely, extremely difficult and they were not cooperative.</span> <span id="s1196">They didn't provide you with arms, they betrayed you, they did everything possible to hurt you rather than to help you.</span> <span id="s1197">So it was extremely difficult but the spirit of resistance was always there.</span> <span id="s1198">Of course, we didn't have this help necessary.</span> <span id="s1199">You have to -- you have to have outside help in order -- without outside help, you cannot do anything, you know.</span> <span id="s1200">I mean, it's not a matter that you can serve yourself.</span> <span id="s1201">Where are you going to get armorments or where are you going to?</span> <span id="s1202">I mean, you have to have help contact.</span> <span id="s1203">Not withstanding that is -- is -- End of Tape #5 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
