tell us your name and where and when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: My name is Amalie Petranker.</span> <span id="s14">Now it's Salsitz.</span> <span id="s15">I was born October 21st, 1922 in Munich, Germany, but I was just born there.</span> <span id="s16">Why?</span> <span id="s17">It was an accident.</span> <span id="s18">My mother was visiting there, but I was raised, brought up and till '42 I lived in Stanistlawow (ph) which is now .</span> <span id="s19">It's very much to the southeast of Poland as Landberg (ph).</span> <span id="s20">Stanistlawow was considered a big city.</span> <span id="s21">It...a large city with inhabitants a hundred thousand.</span> <span id="s22">From there forty thousand Jews, forty thousand Ukrainians, and twenty thousand Poles.</span> <span id="s23">Before the outbreak of the war, Polish government wanted to Polanize it, so they brought Poles from , from the German border and they settled them in Stanistlawow in order to increase the Polish population.</span> <span id="s24">And Stanistlawow, Stanistlawow was a modern city.</span> <span id="s25">It became big after the 1st World War, has beautiful parks, boulevards.</span> <span id="s26">Had many high schools and each minority its own high school, like the Jews had their Jewish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s27">The Ukrainians had Ukrainian gymnasium, and the Germans had a German gymnasium.</span> <span id="s28">And naturally we had state gymnasiums and there very few Jews were accepted.</span> <span id="s29">It was numerous classes, so means a certain number, only seven percentage of the students.</span> <span id="s30">Majority of Jews in Poland, uh in Stanistlawow were progressive.</span> <span id="s31">We had a small nucleus of Hasidic (ph) Jews but they lived in this one section which later became ghetto.</span> <span id="s32">Uhâ€¦</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Tell us about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: My family.</span> <span id="s35">My parents were very progressive.</span> <span id="s36">My father was a , a Zionist, who believed very much in education.</span> <span id="s37">He was very well rounded.</span> <span id="s38">He had the Jewish education and he was a graduate of Agriculture School.</span> <span id="s39">For him, education was very important.</span> <span id="s40">My mother also was a graduate of the uh art (ph) school.</span> <span id="s41">This was a German school.</span> <span id="s42">Ten years.</span> <span id="s43">They have something like this now in Haifa, in Israel.</span> <span id="s44">My mother went there.</span> <span id="s45">All the subjects were taught in German because most of my mother's family was in Germany, so they wanted her to know.</span> <span id="s46">My fath...my father was a modern Jew, and his knowledge, especially in Judaic studies taught him well because he was in lumber business and the Jews didn't like to go with any every case to the court, so they selected like judges, , and my father was selected to be a because he knew the Jewish law and because he was so educated.</span> <span id="s47">For him, or Hebrew scholars was just the same.</span> <span id="s48">He also had a hobby.</span> <span id="s49">He was a painter.</span> <span id="s50">And wha...this saved him when he was in the army because when he was in the Austrian army, Jews were just plain soldiers, and actually they used to be even orderlies (ph) to officers.</span> <span id="s51">They have to clean their boots.</span> <span id="s52">But because of his ability to draw he worked in an office and he printed and drew the announcement proclamations that they needed.</span> <span id="s53">My father's family was quite well to do before the 1st World War, but after the war, when they were burned out, they had lumber business.</span> <span id="s54">Uh they had uh uh brick factory, and they had an inn, but they lost a lot of money, so what remained is only education and this made a very deep impression on my late father.</span> <span id="s55">So having three daughters he said I will try to prepare for them dowry, but I'm not sure if they will be able to take advantage, so my duty is to give them very good education, so at least they will have something to stand, which will sustain them, that he would have foreseen what future would be.</span> <span id="s56">My mother was a very easy-going, very sweet woman.</span> <span id="s57">She was very young.</span> <span id="s58">She was twenty-two only when I was born, and twenty-one when my oldest sister, so she was like one of us.</span> <span id="s59">And maybe it's good she was easy- going, because my late father was like a Prussian officer.</span> <span id="s60">He didn't have any sons, so he actually treated us like we'll be in the army, like soldiers.</span> <span id="s61">He was fair but very demanding, so she in a way protected us.</span> <span id="s62">Sometimes when he was strict, she did.</span> <span id="s63">He demanded, but now I'm very grateful.</span> <span id="s64">At that time it was very hard on us, like for example, we attended private schools.</span> <span id="s65">He wanted us to be protected from being called kikes and Jews, so from the kindergarten...we went to a Hebrew kindergarten where all, we spoke only Hebrew...we went to Hebrew school from the first grade to the sixth where all the subjects were taught in Hebrew except History in Polish, then we went...so of course Jewish gymnasium because the language, prevalent language was Polish, but we continued with our Judaic studies, and we were three sisters.</span> <span id="s66">My older one was Pepi (ph).</span> <span id="s67">I was the middle one and my younger one was Teela (ph) and we were just a year apart, so like first, second, third grade.</span> <span id="s68">Second, third and fourth.</span> <span id="s69">So we were called in school , , , (laughter) because we were so...just a year apart, you know, and we looked alike.</span> <span id="s70">As a matter of fact, I looked...my younger sister looked very much like I. My older...little bit...she was platinum blonde with blue eyes and unfortunately I was the middle and the shortest and the smallest.</span> <span id="s71">And I was unhappy because in Europe was accepted to hand-down, so naturally the oldest gave to the middle and the middle to the youngest.</span> <span id="s72">In my case, I got stuff from my youngest one, so it wasn't so pleasant for me, so I had to prove myself and there I tried to excel in studies, like not only what we had a lot of work in school.</span> <span id="s73">It was very demanding because it was very expensive and unless we performed our parents took us out from the school, would take us out and we would have to learn vocation, but our ambition really was to be...to finish and to cont...to go to medical school, so I remember when it came Sabbath, this was the only day off.</span> <span id="s74">Instead we should be off and go with our friends for a walk, so winter time, every Friday night, my father after dinner sat down with us and we had to study with him , the of the Sages (ph) and also the , the Savior from the Weak (ph), and every Saturday, summer time, .</span> <span id="s75">At that time we resented it very much and I resented it very much and being the middle one, I had to show I am the best, so...because I was the smallest one...so uh then we were rewarded.</span> <span id="s76">Whoever knew got money, spending money to go to the movies.</span> <span id="s77">And God forbid if we didn't know what happened someplace to my older sister, so she was the pride of the spending money, for allowance, which was really a tragedy for her at that time.</span> <span id="s78">And you see also not only that we had to read books for school for literature.</span> <span id="s79">My father assigned to us books and every Saturday we had to finish by Saturday and discussed.</span> <span id="s80">So education was very stressed.</span> <span id="s81">My mother was very active like in PTA.</span> <span id="s82">We had lunchtime...like every Tuesday she used to serve lunch in gymnasium for us.</span> <span id="s83">I was very proud.</span> <span id="s84">She was a very pretty woman, on the heavy side with her beautiful smile, very pretty face.</span> <span id="s85">Now my father was in lumber business but I think two, three years before the start of of the war, it was nationalized and our part by the government and it was called .</span> <span id="s86">Being my father was quite known and prominent in lumber business, the director from Warsaw came and told him, you cannot be director of because you are Jewish, but you will be the vice director, and he nominated as the director, and I mentioned because later on I'll tell you...he was helpful in my survival.</span> <span id="s87">As a rule, we were sheltered.</span> <span id="s88">We didn't have a lot to do with the Christian population.</span> <span id="s89">Actually each minority kept to itself.</span> <span id="s90">We didn't have too much problem.</span> <span id="s91">Only our problem arose during the holidays or on Sundays, because other schools were closed.</span> <span id="s92">Our school was next to a church, so this was a day free for them to throw stones on us.</span> <span id="s93">As children I resented it to be singled out.</span> <span id="s94">I was hurt.</span> <span id="s95">But this was something we couldn't do.</span> <span id="s96">It...even when...it became so bad before the outbreak of the war, that the police advised our custodian...we had an iron gate around our school...to keep it closed, so they shouldn't be able to enter our school yard and to throw stone and to beat us up.</span> <span id="s97">In our town, there were some incidents of anti-Semites, especially when there were students came from universities at Christmas time and Easter and they wanted and they liked to beat up the Jews, but we had Jews who were actually very strong physically, the butchers, the uh drivers and later they learned to be prepared and they used to take a two-by-four and fight back.</span> <span id="s98">They didn't take it.</span> <span id="s99">Now uh we had good relationship with the Ukrainians because they also were minorities.</span> <span id="s100">So before the war, they co....they cooperated with the Jews in commerce and in business, like my late father needed for example a loan.</span> <span id="s101">He went, he got a loan from Ukrainian bank, but not from the Bellish (ph) uh, Polish bank, from the state bank.</span> <span id="s102">I had many friends.</span> <span id="s103">We were three daughters.</span> <span id="s104">My house always was full with friends, because even if...to each one of us came one friend.</span> <span id="s105">My closest friend was Junior (ph) Lawber (ph) and happens that she was named like my mother, Frederika (ph) Junior, and I was named like her mother, because my parents called me Malia (ph) and her mother.</span> <span id="s106">We were very close friends and this was through the whole war.</span> <span id="s107">And also I was very close to my younger sister.</span> <span id="s108">We loved each other so much that when my parents wanted for my sister and to make sure that she would listen, they came to me and they used to joke, what will happen when Malia will get married.</span> <span id="s109">With whom will you be, although it was only one-year difference between us, but my older didn't want to bother with us.</span> <span id="s110">She went with other friends.</span> <span id="s111">And we had beautiful parks.</span> <span id="s112">We participated.</span> <span id="s113">We used to go to summer camps.</span> <span id="s114">Wintertime, the winter vacation.</span> <span id="s115">We went skiing.</span> <span id="s116">We had pretty normal, happy life.</span> <span id="s117">It's true it was not the life of all the Jews in my town.</span> <span id="s118">There was a select group, middle and above which could afford it.</span> <span id="s119">There were poor Jews.</span> <span id="s120">There were Jews who after the mandatory six grades went to learn vocation, to be a seamstress or to be a salesgirl.</span> <span id="s121">I would say there are some very poor who just didn't have even money for Sabbath.</span> <span id="s122">We had some magnets (ph) like , very very rich who donated planes to the government.</span> <span id="s123">Majority barely eked out a living, but was a group like my parents, middle and above, who were quite comfortable.</span> <span id="s124">This was un...until the war broke out.</span> <span id="s125">In '31, in September, broke out the German war, uh the World War, but we had...</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: You mean '31...</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: '39.</span> <span id="s128">At that time I was not even seventeen years old.</span> <span id="s129">First, '39, after a few weeks, we read a proclamation that the Russian army...I think after a week or two...that the Russian army will come for order and safety of the city 'till the situation will be cleared and that we should cooperate.</span> <span id="s130">So far...when the war broke out we had bombs, bombing and a few Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s131">Some buildings were destroyed.</span> <span id="s132">But this was at the beginning, in '39, September.</span> <span id="s133">The Russians came to our town.</span> <span id="s134">They occupied it.</span> <span id="s135">It was not for time being like we were told, and we had never dealt with the Communists, with the Russians.</span> <span id="s136">We didn't know what to expect.</span> <span id="s137">So we wanted to get some feeling, some understanding.</span> <span id="s138">So we stopped the soldiers to ask them, to question about the life in Russian.</span> <span id="s139">When we questioned them, they told us everything in superlative, so Jews were very skeptical so we, so some just asked and tell me...how about , .</span> <span id="s140">Do you have a lot of ?</span> <span id="s141">And they said no, .</span> <span id="s142">So we knew it's all uh propaganda and not true.</span> <span id="s143">Our life changed drastically.</span> <span id="s144">Special the middle-class and the rich or the so-called bourgeois...like my parents were given a special paragraph, paragraph 11 - means we were any moment destined to be shipped to Siberia, and in a way I wish it would happened.</span> <span id="s145">Maybe my parents would survive.</span> <span id="s146">And also, I was at that time, I graduated from first .</span> <span id="s147">I was supposed to go to the second and graduate.</span> <span id="s148">So they entered it, and the ten-year system they call it, the class, and the standard of learning and living changed.</span> <span id="s149">Like my foreign language was English.</span> <span id="s150">This is why I have such an accent even now, because I learned in the gymnasium, but for them learning languages...I mean unless you're in special school, was a bourgeois, so this we had only reading for comprehension where in the third year of my learning English I already had Shakespeare.</span> <span id="s151">Lowered the standard.</span> <span id="s152">But the subjects math and physics was a very high standard.</span> <span id="s153">But the problem is immediately they developed , with political departments, and each student was called in and specially from the middle class and I was warned, unless you report on your friends, then you'll be expelled or you'll be fined.</span> <span id="s154">Always threatened.</span> <span id="s155">And then we saw our schoolmates suddenly taken in by .</span> <span id="s156">They had special cars which they took away.</span> <span id="s157">This installed fear in us.</span> <span id="s158">My father, who was a government high official, was in business, suddenly became a laborer.</span> <span id="s159">And I was accepted to institute they call it.</span> <span id="s160">They didn't want to take me to the medical school, but they were short in teachers, so they expec...uh accepted me to Institute they call it, .</span> <span id="s161">Means math and physics.</span> <span id="s162">After four months, I was called in.</span> <span id="s163">I was told because you cannot get a stipendum (ph) because each student got a stipendum that he could sustain himself and could study.</span> <span id="s164">You cannot because you're bourgeois but if you pay us six hundred rubles a month, you can continue.</span> <span id="s165">At that time my father earned only two hundred rubles, so naturally it was out for me.</span> <span id="s166">Also we lived in fear that any time they will ship us to Siberia.</span> <span id="s167">One thing saved us.</span> <span id="s168">Where our house, it was actually our condominium, this was assigned each section was assigned to different branch of government.</span> <span id="s169">Our section was assigned to rail authorities (ph).</span> <span id="s170">Means they could take over any apartment for their workers, officials that they have chosen.</span> <span id="s171">Our apartment were assigned to a Russian engineer.</span> <span id="s172">When he came to take it over, my sis...my younger sister was present, and when he saw my sister...she was very beautiful and li...little on the heavy side.</span> <span id="s173">He said he cannot throw my sister out.</span> <span id="s174">He put his name on the door, and my sister saved that apartment at the time.</span> <span id="s175">But it was very important, because we didn't have any other address and he lived on this one, so means they couldn't ship us anymore.</span> <span id="s176">We were not registered.</span> <span id="s177">See my older sister, she got married in '31, with a Pales...Palestinian from my town who came for vacation and met her.</span> <span id="s178">He was eleven years her senior.</span> <span id="s179">He fell in love with her.</span> <span id="s180">They were in a resort and he wanted to marry her.</span> <span id="s181">The war broke out, so he gave a choice for my sister and he said, let's get engaged.</span> <span id="s182">After the war I will come back.</span> <span id="s183">I will marry you.</span> <span id="s184">Or if you want, I can marry you and you'll go with me back to Palestine.</span> <span id="s185">My sister had chosen to get married.</span> <span id="s186">My parents didn't approve.</span> <span id="s187">She was only eighteen years old, but she persuaded them being my grandmother and my mother's brother and the whole family who were Germans, lived at that time in Palestine, so she explained she has family there and she's not going just with her husband and they permitted.</span> <span id="s188">I'll never forget the day when she left.</span> <span id="s189">First of all, we were never separated, and like I explained we were just a year apart and my younger sister, like she would have a premonition.</span> <span id="s190">She fainted and blood came out of her nose, like she would have known this was the last time that she sees her.</span> <span id="s191">(crying) So my sister left for Palestine and my family was my parents, my younger sister and I.</span> <span id="s192">When the Russo (ph) German war broke out in '41 in June, where I worked they gave some Jews pink (ph) , means permit to evacuate with the Russians.</span> <span id="s193">I came home with this, and I presented it to my parents and my late father said, I didn't know that I raised a Communist.</span> <span id="s194">You are not leaving the house.</span> <span id="s195">You're staying here but if you leave, you cannot come back to us.</span> <span id="s196">And my mother said, I went through with the Germans during the 1st World War.</span> <span id="s197">They are civilized people.</span> <span id="s198">I don't believe the atrocities that we hear.</span> <span id="s199">This must be Russian propaganda.</span> <span id="s200">We are staying put in the place.</span> <span id="s201">So, I was supposed to leave with my boyfriend, Alec (ph) Lamsdorf (ph), whose father was the chief engineer of the railroad authority.</span> <span id="s202">Being he was Jewish, he couldn't become so-called .</span> <span id="s203">This was the highest official, but he has a special car for himself on the line from my town to the border, so we could have escaped.</span> <span id="s204">He proposed, he would take his sister Tricia (ph), who by the way survived, and I would take my sister Teela, and we four will escape if our parents don't want.</span> <span id="s205">But my father forbade me.</span> <span id="s206">So when the Ru...Russo-German war broke out, first we had for a month the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s207">The Hungarian army entered my town, Stanistlawow or .</span> <span id="s208">The Hungarians were very were good to us and again, the same story.</span> <span id="s209">They were supposed to requisition apartments.</span> <span id="s210">Being our apartment was like on the 5th Avenue, ours was supposed to requisition, be requisitioned, and came a Hungarian graf (ph), Count , with his adjutant.</span> <span id="s211">This time I saved the situation.</span> <span id="s212">He liked me, so he decided he's not going to take it.</span> <span id="s213">He stayed in the hotel, but he put his name on our apartment and he started courting me.</span> <span id="s214">I was eighteen only.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Flowers, and food was scarce so he ate in our house so we would be able to have meal together.</span> <span id="s216">Was even one situation unheard of.</span> <span id="s217">Uh they had a spy, a Hungarian young man, extremely handsome, whom they used to draft in England.</span> <span id="s218">They had spy uh housekeeper for one very important uh lord or something, and he spied for the Germans.</span> <span id="s219">So the count said that he has to invite him too.</span> <span id="s220">He'll come to our house, but we should be very careful not to disclose that we are Jews.</span> <span id="s221">And he told us about his uh deeds, what he had done and how he worked in Hungary.</span> <span id="s222">The Count told my father that he knows that our fate is sealed and it's very set.</span> <span id="s223">They are going to kill us.</span> <span id="s224">He told my father I cannot save you all, but he would like to save me, so he proposed that I should embrace Christianity and he will marry me and he will smuggle me to Hungary.</span> <span id="s225">My father expressed his gratitude and he said as a family he would like to stay together.</span> <span id="s226">He appreciates it and in a way he declined it.</span> <span id="s227">I couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s228">Not that I loved him but he...I was impressed.</span> <span id="s229">ten years old and I remember also the graf used to come with us where the Jews were assigned for slave labor with the army.</span> <span id="s230">Among them was Baron Moore (ph) who was his friend before the war.</span> <span id="s231">Now he tried to protect him and to help him as much as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">So even the Baron Moore talked to my father.</span> <span id="s233">Listen, now he's infatuated with your daughter, but you are wise not to let her go.</span> <span id="s234">He is the first-born.</span> <span id="s235">His mother would not tolerate it, and it may be a unto your daughter.</span> <span id="s236">You're very smart, but my father didn't explain to me, so I surprised, asked him why he didn't permit me.</span> <span id="s237">He stated the reason that even I understood is right at that time.</span> <span id="s238">Meantime, this was...they were shipped to Russia, to fight in Russia, and the Germans entered.</span> <span id="s239">At that time, they shipped Russian, uh Hungarian Jews to our town, and when the Germans entered, they kept the Jews on .</span> <span id="s240">It was a big mill house uh and they were kept there.</span> <span id="s241">When the Germans came, immediately they ordered us to wear the bands with the star, after age I think twelve, and they ordered all the Jews to register.</span> <span id="s242">Specially the first to register, they ordered the teachers...the professional people.</span> <span id="s243">So the Jewish , which took care of the Jewish life before the war, told them to register, so the Poles should be able to get jobs.</span> <span id="s244">They never returned from the meeting where they were called to a meeting.</span> <span id="s245">This was the first.</span> <span id="s246">Then we all had to register, according to the streets, and we specially from 5th Avenue, from the nice neighborhood, were assigned as cleaning girls to the Gestapo building to scrip, to scrub the floors and the toilets with our hands.</span> <span id="s247">We had to wear scrub brushes, pails, and we were assigned.</span> <span id="s248">One day when I was assigned there...it was just after a week my sister was assigned, my best friend Junior was assigned to work, and we...when once we came there we had uh lady who was German, ethnic German, means born in Poland, and she was the supervisor.</span> <span id="s249">One day, a Gestapo man came and he pointed to me and to another girl to step out of the line.</span> <span id="s250">The supervisor was once a neighbor of mine, because when we were young, we lived in the German suburbs...was beautiful, out of town and only two Jewish families lived there.</span> <span id="s251">Family Sweik (ph) who owned a farm, and me, and we.</span> <span id="s252">She knew us by sight because this was at least I would say to '35 so means I was uh twelve, thirteen years old.</span> <span id="s253">When he called me out, to step out and this girl...this girl was a refugee from Berlin, Vita Sh , a beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s254">She was sure that he wants to kill us, to shoot us so she said that we are good workers, decent workers.</span> <span id="s255">We should be left alone.</span> <span id="s256">So he slapped her on the face.</span> <span id="s257">He didn't know that she's aunt of the two brothers, Mueller (ph) who are, were very sadistic and very big off...high officers in the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s258">He thought that she's Polish only.</span> <span id="s259">So she advised me not...and he, so he told us to report to the private quarters where they just moved in to clean the apartments there.</span> <span id="s260">She advited...advised us not to report to work.</span> <span id="s261">She would protect us in order he should forget, because she still didn't trust him what he will do to us.</span> <span id="s262">So a few days later, when we reported back, we had to clean the buildings and he spotted me through the window, and he called me in and this Vita Sh .</span> <span id="s263">He called me.</span> <span id="s264">He started questioning me very nasty and he said he wants me to work, to be responsible for this apartment.</span> <span id="s265">I'll never forget the picture of my sister with a group waiting outside and crying because she thought this is the end.</span> <span id="s266">At that time I was responsible for cleaning this particu...his apartment and Vita Sh was responsible for cleaning another apartment.</span> <span id="s267">Meanwhile responsible because then they sent from the Jewish community, uh from the , other Jewish girls to clean and Jewish women who are wives of the professionals whose husbands were taken away, they're responsible for furnishing the apartment.</span> <span id="s268">And my sister still remained in the main building to clean.</span> <span id="s269">You know, the Jews from Hungary were sitting there in the coal (ph) yard.</span> <span id="s270">They brought them from the mill, from , to the courtyard of the Gestapo, and they were crying.</span> <span id="s271">They were hungry.</span> <span id="s272">They were tired.</span> <span id="s273">They were beaten, with children.</span> <span id="s274">They were there.</span> <span id="s275">My sister went to work, and they made a sandwich that my parents gave her when she went to work and for me, she dropped through the window for them to eat.</span> <span id="s276">A Gestapo officer noticed it, and he brought her down to there.</span> <span id="s277">Since then I have never seen her.</span> <span id="s278">She started to cry, and there was Ukrainian police, and she told him that her sister is working in the apartment for Gestapo and and was his name, and he should notify me, who can talk that I can do something for her.</span> <span id="s279">This is a mistake.</span> <span id="s280">Then they take her out.</span> <span id="s281">I tried.</span> <span id="s282">So there were Gestapo who took me out of the line, he was in charge and when I came crying he told me I should go and the one who was in charge, maybe he will listen to me, and I forgot in the apartment we were told not to wear the armbands.</span> <span id="s283">When he saw me, and I told him, explained the reason of my coming, he said so she's Jewish.</span> <span id="s284">So you're Jewish.</span> <span id="s285">And he yelled at me...how did you dare to come without a band.</span> <span id="s286">I'll shoot you too.</span> <span id="s287">Actually the penalty was to be shot if somebody didn't with band.</span> <span id="s288">He let me go...I don't know.</span> <span id="s289">The Gestapo, how cruel he was.</span> <span id="s290">He kept telling me and his fiance who came to live with him who was from and she took a liking to me, that they took only my sister for labor because it was harvest time and they were short in field hands.</span> <span id="s291">After fall, they will release her.</span> <span id="s292">So, I came home and I had to bring the news to my mother.</span> <span id="s293">Naturally it was a terrible shock and my mother tried to comfort me because I was very close to my sister, and I tried to comfort my mother.</span> <span id="s294">My mother was only forty years old and from red hair she had, she became white within a day.</span> <span id="s295">And we still believed...we clung to the hope that my sister will come back after the wa...the harvest.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Meantime we saw shooting on the street, random shooting.</span> <span id="s297">They took the Jews and to work on the street.</span> <span id="s298">They used to catch them, you know, and then to dig ditches or to work at bridges and then sometimes they used to throw them into the river and Russians erected many monuments so they took the Jews to destroy the monuments, and many of them were shot.</span> <span id="s299">They didn't come back.</span> <span id="s300">This was going on till around, till September, and I still work at that time by this Gestapo.</span> <span id="s301">Then we were told that we will have to leave our apartment and to move to a section which was designated as ghetto.</span> <span id="s302">This was the poorest section of the Jews.</span> <span id="s303">Being...again we lived like on the 5th Avenue, my parents secured immediately an apartment in the future ghetto, and the always optimist Jew that we hoped war will end before we'll have to move.</span> <span id="s304">We transferred our furniture there.</span> <span id="s305">We still kept only a mattress, the essential thing in ghetto and on...while we lived on 35, with hope that we'll maybe not have to move.</span> <span id="s306">Then suddenly, on , October the 12th, we were in our apartment which almost was bare and it was a large apartment.</span> <span id="s307">Only the mattresses and some utensils.</span> <span id="s308">We heard terrible commotion and noise.</span> <span id="s309">I went out on the balcony and I saw a lot of Gestapo and Ukrainian police.</span> <span id="s310">We knew something is brewing, something bad is going...will happen, but neither what really happened.</span> <span id="s311">We thought that maybe now they will gather the Jewish men like have done with the Hungarian men that they brought to us, to break us economically so means only the men are in danger.</span> <span id="s312">So my mother decided to hide my father in one of the attics.</span> <span id="s313">Each condominium, condominium had it's own part of the attic and it's own part in the cellar, so we have hidden my father on the attic.</span> <span id="s314">My mother got the key.</span> <span id="s315">And after an hour, my mother's cousin who lived...also owned a condominium in this complex came and said look, it's very unsafe to stay in an apartment.</span> <span id="s316">Let's all go to the cellar and let's hide there, and this was a house like a facade (ph)...many buildings.</span> <span id="s317">She thought it's safe there.</span> <span id="s318">I really never disobeyed my mother because we were raised to uh obey our parents.</span> <span id="s319">I refused to go with her down to the cellar with the family and other Jewish neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Only one neighbor, Mrs. Pollack (ph), who was an old lady, seventy-five, something...she had, she had also hidden her husband.</span> <span id="s321">She decided to stay with me.</span> <span id="s322">My reasoning was they will come in.</span> <span id="s323">They will see empty rooms.</span> <span id="s324">They will not enter the last room.</span> <span id="s325">This is how my reasoning went, and I refused to go.</span> <span id="s326">I stayed with her in the, in our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">We heard...we heard cries.</span> <span id="s328">We heard noise, but we didn't know from where it's coming.</span> <span id="s329">By noon, my neighbor's son knocked at the door, Rister (ph), and he said your mother would like you very much to come.</span> <span id="s330">Please don't be stubborn.</span> <span id="s331">Again, the same story.</span> <span id="s332">I don't know why I was so stubborn.</span> <span id="s333">I can't explain to today.</span> <span id="s334">I refused to come down.</span> <span id="s335">I didn't.</span> <span id="s336">Towards evening it come down...some...Mrs. Pollack and I decided to venture in the hall and to find out what's going on.</span> <span id="s337">Our Christian neighbors said, you are here.</span> <span id="s338">They took everybody from the cellar.</span> <span id="s339">They loaded them on the trucks and they took them to the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s340">It was a terrible shock.</span> <span id="s341">I didn't know how to act.</span> <span id="s342">But I still didn't suspect that this was for killing.</span> <span id="s343">This was the first time.</span> <span id="s344">So I thought maybe this is the gathering place, so now I have somehow to get my father out and to join my mother.</span> <span id="s345">Finally I managed with the neighbor's help, to get him out.</span> <span id="s346">Before we managed to go, my neighbor, Mrs. Reifter (ph), with her husband and children, came .</span> <span id="s347">Straight hair pulled down and from her we found out what happened...that they took them to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s348">My mother was crying on the truck when she saw the direction, and she said they're taking us to the cemetery to be shot.</span> <span id="s349">Why didn't I listen to Malia.</span> <span id="s350">My parents called me Malia.</span> <span id="s351">At the cemetery...first of all they told them to sit down in rows and they sent Jewish girls, young girls, to pick up all the jewelry.</span> <span id="s352">And there was a board and they shot...even if people were killed or not, they fell to the ditch.</span> <span id="s353">They collected thirty thousand Jews on this day.</span> <span id="s354">My mother was with her cousin and they took my mother's cousin.</span> <span id="s355">So the cousin said to my mother, I can't witness this.</span> <span id="s356">So my mother said you are right.</span> <span id="s357">Let's move closer.</span> <span id="s358">We'll be spared to witness the shooting.</span> <span id="s359">Let's be shot.</span> <span id="s360">She didn't know that when it became dark, the Gestapo announced whoever is alive can go back to his home.</span> <span id="s361">But my mother was not there anymore to come home.</span> <span id="s362">So this how my sister and my mother were gone.</span> <span id="s363">(crying) My father and I remained home.</span> <span id="s364">And now they shot fifteen thousand Jews on this day.</span> <span id="s365">This was .</span> <span id="s366">This was my birthday.</span> <span id="s367">On the Jewish calendar, .</span> <span id="s368">Naturally I will never now celebrate on my birthday on the Jew calendar and so immediately from my family, my father and I was left.</span> <span id="s369">Now we had to go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s370">For two people we couldn't have an apartment.</span> <span id="s371">They assigned ten people per room.</span> <span id="s372">My mother had a step-sister.</span> <span id="s373">Her name was Clara Hoot (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Actually I would say she was poor.</span> <span id="s375">They were not so close, but the goodness and the best was coming out and there were bad times.</span> <span id="s376">She lived where the ghetto was supposed to be, so she approached my father and said, you're only two people.</span> <span id="s377">Why should you be assigned to strangers?</span> <span id="s378">We are five people.</span> <span id="s379">We have only a room and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s380">We'll take you in.</span> <span id="s381">And she was to me like a mother.</span> <span id="s382">(crying) Till today, you know, I felt so guilty that we didn't treat them like really aunt should be treated.</span> <span id="s383">How good she was, and we stayed with her.</span> <span id="s384">Her husband maked tops of the shoes and this was very good because the Germans liked boots so there was a German cobbler who used to bring the materials he should make it.</span> <span id="s385">For this he got food, so he was also sustaining us, helping us with food where others were starving.</span> <span id="s386">The life in ghetto was just terrible.</span> <span id="s387">Many of my schoolmates, rich people, wealthy people...I will never forget the face, for example, from one other , only child, so spoiled...his father was the head of the Juden (ph), uh Jewish , not Juden...and laying on the streets swollen.</span> <span id="s388">The next day from hunger water came out, and this the picture.</span> <span id="s389">You saw, you knew the people starving to death, and you couldn't even share and give them.</span> <span id="s390">So my father learned that if he is assigned as a slave laborer out of ghetto, at least he will have the chance to barter clothes for food, whatever...bread was really very hard to get.</span> <span id="s391">So with his connections, he was able to get a job on the railroad as as slave worker, and then he tried for me to get a job too, because my father said, being we two are left, let's not ever separate.</span> <span id="s392">Let's always be together.</span> <span id="s393">Meantime my uncle died in ghetto.</span> <span id="s394">My Uncle Dabbie Toot (ph), he died a natural death.</span> <span id="s395">His son, Jacob, was taking .</span> <span id="s396">It's forced labor .</span> <span id="s397">His daughter was taken away from the street.</span> <span id="s398">She was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s399">They collected hundred of beautiful...hundred beautiful Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s400">They disappeared.</span> <span id="s401">We don't know where.</span> <span id="s402">So only my Aunt Clara, her daughter Pepi (ph) who's named like my sister Pepi (ph), and the oldest son who also got the job to make tops for the German cobbler Gross (ph)...I remember his name...he remained.</span> <span id="s403">And one day my father said to me, you know what.</span> <span id="s404">We have to escape from ghetto.</span> <span id="s405">My father had so-called iron (ph) luck (ph).</span> <span id="s406">Spoke Polish well.</span> <span id="s407">So he decided that we'll try to get to the Iron side and maybe some of his friends will help us or to or will harbor us, will help us.</span> <span id="s408">We didn't think farther, just first to go out.</span> <span id="s409">So he dressed himself with few suits.</span> <span id="s410">He divided the money that we have.</span> <span id="s411">He gave me some few thousand and we were supposed to go out from ghetto and try our luck.</span> <span id="s412">And he said let me go first.</span> <span id="s413">If I succeed, then you go.</span> <span id="s414">I waited.</span> <span id="s415">After five minutes he came back, beaten up by the Ukrainian police.</span> <span id="s416">Luckily he had the money, because if not he would be shot, but they took away his suits and the money and they pushed him back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s417">So our escape was foiled.</span> <span id="s418">Meantime they will have killings in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s419">You know, they assigned the Jews, classified the Jews, just to find excuse for each killing which they call an aktion.</span> <span id="s420">First were the children.</span> <span id="s421">Then were all the old people.</span> <span id="s422">Then were people who were sick, people who couldn't work, so was A, B, C classification.</span> <span id="s423">One day we got classification of A - means we don't have to be afraid because we are working, right?</span> <span id="s424">One day we saw through the window aktion.</span> <span id="s425">Aktion was...there was no secret.</span> <span id="s426">Openly, in the ghetto they digged ditches and they shot on the spot, so everybody had seen it.</span> <span id="s427">It's not like concentration camp, we didn't have.</span> <span id="s428">We didn't have a labor camp.</span> <span id="s429">They just had done it first on the Jewish cemetery, but then when there's no room anymore, they had done it in the ghetto, and the ghetto was life, in between the killings, going on semi-normal.</span> <span id="s430">We tried.</span> <span id="s431">We hoped this is the end, especially when Roosevelt entered the war.</span> <span id="s432">We thought we will be saved.</span> <span id="s433">Everybody just tried to live another day with the hope that they would survive, and one day...this was before my father obtained for me also uh a labor card that I can work on the railroad...again we heard rumors that there's to be another killing.</span> <span id="s434">My cousin Pepi worked in a factory where the mill was on making slippers for the army.</span> <span id="s435">Those usually workers were excused from aktion, from killing.</span> <span id="s436">My poor Aunt Clara tells me, come with me...we'll be there safe because my father was out.</span> <span id="s437">At that time it was safe to be out of ghetto when killing was going on.</span> <span id="s438">My other cousin, my cousin was out by the German who lived in , where he made, you know, the boots, so she said to me, come with me.</span> <span id="s439">We'll be safe in the factory because they didn't touch before the factories.</span> <span id="s440">Again my premonition.</span> <span id="s441">I said Aunt Clara, I don't want to go.</span> <span id="s442">You have an old house.</span> <span id="s443">You have an old hut (ph).</span> <span id="s444">Let's hide under where the firewood is kept and let's crawl under this.</span> <span id="s445">We'll cover it with the firewood and they will not find us.</span> <span id="s446">My Aunt Clara said said you're a child.</span> <span id="s447">Listen to me.</span> <span id="s448">It's safer there.</span> <span id="s449">I refused.</span> <span id="s450">I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s451">Again, why?</span> <span id="s452">She was so good to me.</span> <span id="s453">She was like mother.</span> <span id="s454">Why I didn't listen to her...I remained.</span> <span id="s455">I crawled there.</span> <span id="s456">I have hid myself.</span> <span id="s457">She went to the factory.</span> <span id="s458">On this day they took everybody from the factory.</span> <span id="s459">There was no more room for the ditches.</span> <span id="s460">This was the first time they shipped them to to be gassed.</span> <span id="s461">So only my father, my cousin and I were left in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s462">So my father obtained for me a permit to work, a working card to work outside, and he told me if should ever come the time that we'll be separated and we are not in the same transport to be sent to be gassed, let's jump from the death train, cattle cars.</span> <span id="s463">What more can happen to us?</span> <span id="s464">Let's run for our life, and within three weeks to get in touch with the other part which we means left in the ghetto if we are not in the transport, and get united again.</span> <span id="s465">It was in October '42.</span> <span id="s466">I had high temperature.</span> <span id="s467">I couldn't go to work.</span> <span id="s468">My father closed me in the apartment with the lock outside.</span> <span id="s469">He went to work.</span> <span id="s470">Even...I had high temperature.</span> <span id="s471">I was delirious.</span> <span id="s472">I heard noises.</span> <span id="s473">I knew another killing is going on, so I crawled again in the same space where I have hidden myself before, hoped that my father is safe because he is out of ghetto, yes?</span> <span id="s474">And nothing will happen and usually when it was dark they let in the workers from outside, the slave workers in to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s475">It's dark.</span> <span id="s476">Meantime they came to look in the apartment with the dog, and the Germans said, is here, rouse (ph), and they leaved uh left the apartment.</span> <span id="s477">So I was so happy.</span> <span id="s478">I said at least my father is safe.</span> <span id="s479">When it's dark he will return to the ghetto and we will be united.</span> <span id="s480">It's night.</span> <span id="s481">My father is not there.</span> <span id="s482">So I decided, sick or not sick, I have to go next day to work...you see, because we used to march, and they guarded us with the Ukrainian police to work actually like prisoners, and I'll find out what happened.</span> <span id="s483">Before even I came to work, my Christian acquaintance was standing behind the gate of the ghetto and she said, don't look for your father.</span> <span id="s484">They took all the Jews from outside to be shipped to be gassed.</span> <span id="s485">So I somehow, knowing my father I knew he will do everything not to let himself be shipped to the gas.</span> <span id="s486">And meantime what I didn't mention, once when there was such killing and we knew we all had Cate...Category A means we're exempt from shooting, we stayed in apartment.</span> <span id="s487">At that time my Aunt Clara was still alive.</span> <span id="s488">Her daughter Pepi was alive, my father and I. And the brother opened our apartment.</span> <span id="s489">We presented our cards and they said, rouse.</span> <span id="s490">They always ignored it.</span> <span id="s491">We were fools.</span> <span id="s492">We thought that they will respect it.</span> <span id="s493">He recognized me from the days when I was assigned to the private apartment because he had that sadistic pleasure when I went to work to knock at the window, and I was very afraid of him because he known, was known as a sadist, and this give him a pleasure.</span> <span id="s494">So I guess in ghetto when he came to take us out for shooting, he pushed me inside.</span> <span id="s495">He recognized me through the apartment (ph).</span> <span id="s496">So I had the presence of my uh mind that I'm...and I said no.</span> <span id="s497">He is my father.</span> <span id="s498">I cannot let him go.</span> <span id="s499">So they didn't believe me because my father was very young looking so they were two brothers - Willie and Hans (ph), so one tried to test me so with his uh what...rubber what they had...uh not gun...oh how you call it... ( )...he hit my father very hard and I saw tears from my father's eyes, so I started to cry bitterly.</span> <span id="s500">This convinced them that this is my father.</span> <span id="s501">So they permitted him to go with me, and then I said on my aunt, this is my mother.</span> <span id="s502">I will never know why they let me go, but they let go.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">.</span> <span id="s504">When it was day of trial in Vienna, I was called as a witness, and I have problem.</span> <span id="s505">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s506">To go to testify because I witnessed many killings, or because he recognized me, not to go.</span> <span id="s507">And I have chosen not to go but I'll send somebody else, and unfortunately she didn't know the facts.</span> <span id="s508">And the facts were after they let us go, through my window I saw where was the , the gathering place already where they took for killing, and I saw Willie shot my neighbor, Mrs. Leichter (ph) who came from the cemetery who told me what happened at the cemetery, in the back.</span> <span id="s509">She was just walking.</span> <span id="s510">So it was willful killing.</span> <span id="s511">It was not that she was caught in the aktion.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">This kind of guy he was.</span> <span id="s513">So maybe I was destined to live, and this what happened.</span> <span id="s514">So coming back to this, when I lost my father, I was left alone.</span> <span id="s515">The German shoemaker kept my cousin and he kept him in his apartment...he should work for him.</span> <span id="s516">While I was working as a slave labor on the railroad, every Jew or Jewess was not because we had the and we had to work with our bare hands to wash the toilets and scrub the floors.</span> <span id="s517">There was employed a carpenter, a by the name Abraham...uh Edmond Abraham Ovitch (ph).</span> <span id="s518">He was from , half hour away from town Stanistlawow where there was a big concentration of and they were considered by Hitler, by the Germans, as foreigners because they were Turkish descendants from Crimea (ph).</span> <span id="s519">Mostly they were farmers or army men.</span> <span id="s520">And he worked there.</span> <span id="s521">He offered me...when my father was still alive...to take me and to help me and to harbor me.</span> <span id="s522">He lived with his mother, sister-in-law and a baby and he said he will help me and he told me that he helped ten other, other Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s523">I will tell you what happened, or maybe I should tell you right now.</span> <span id="s524">I was the only one who who didn't blend into the Slavic population because I don't have the high Slavic cheekbones and my eyes were considered very Semitic.</span> <span id="s525">The other girls were all typical so-called Aryan looks, blonde, blue eyes and from the eleven, I am the only one who survived.</span> <span id="s526">Because I knew that I don't look Slavic, I could pass somehow as a German girl so I was advised to work in the lion's den so I worked for German companies.</span> <span id="s527">I will explain later what I have done, and they were so sure that they would not be recognized so they worked in Polish companies and normally they were beautiful.</span> <span id="s528">They were approached by Poles to date, and when they refused...maybe they said it jokingly...you must be a Jewish...and the sudden fear in their eyes gave them out and the Poles denounced them.</span> <span id="s529">I was the only one.</span> <span id="s530">So one day he propo...offered me this while still my father was alive.</span> <span id="s531">But he told me that he cannot harbor my father.</span> <span id="s532">When my father was gone, I waited three weeks.</span> <span id="s533">I didn't hear from him, so I thought he didn't succeed to jump from the running train and poor one (ph), he was killed.</span> <span id="s534">So one day he came and he told me according to my information, they will...they last two thousand Jews who were left at ghetto from one time hundred thousand Jews, we were forty thousand Jews and they used to bring in Jews from small towns and villages.</span> <span id="s535">What, at one time we were a hundred.</span> <span id="s536">Only two thousand remained.</span> <span id="s537">So he told me that from here's information that now they will finish us all off, and he would advise me not to go back to go back with the column of slave workers, back to the ghetto...only after work, he will arrange that I will be able to stay in the office on the railroad and the next day after work will dispose of my and to go to with him to .</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: We have to stop here.</span> <span id="s539">We need to change the tape.</span> <span id="s540">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s543">We're rolling.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: So Edmund Abraham Ovitch, he told me to stay, that I shouldn't go back, and I slept on the railroad station in the office of the Chief .</span> <span id="s545">After the War, I found out how he arranged it, and this proved to me how sincere and honest he is, that he really wants to save my life and after work I dropped my arm band with my star carelessly on the tracks because if they would find it they would search for the one who threw it away, and I boarded the train to , half hour ride.</span> <span id="s546">But I didn't want to sit next to Mundig because I felt if I'm caught, why should he loose his life.</span> <span id="s547">So I sat by myself and there were workers, maybe about thirty, coming back from work.</span> <span id="s548">They all knew me because if I should present it because like all white and one .</span> <span id="s549">I was there with the arm band so they saw me everyday so they knew me, and like in every train the police came and the German police came.</span> <span id="s550">On every train was a Gestapo police, checked the passengers.</span> <span id="s551">When I..</span> <span id="s552">.</span> <span id="s553">before they were supposed to approach me I must have been in terrible fear.</span> <span id="s554">I can't explain why the workers gave me a sign with their eyes not to fear, that they will not give me away.</span> <span id="s555">Where they were so eager to denounce others, I was destined to live.</span> <span id="s556">And the police came.</span> <span id="s557">I didn't have any papers.</span> <span id="s558">I was afraid, but the German police sat next to me and discussed the weather, how beautiful it is, and he left.</span> <span id="s559">So safely I arrived to Mundig's house.</span> <span id="s560">His mother was very upset.</span> <span id="s561">I don't blame her, because I endangered her and the whole family.</span> <span id="s562">On top of it without any reward.</span> <span id="s563">I didn't have even money to pay for it.</span> <span id="s564">She resented and she made it clear to me, so the son promised her that whenever he can find for me a safe haven, I will leave.</span> <span id="s565">As a matter of face, even she refused me the meals.</span> <span id="s566">Again I don't blame because it was very hard to get food, so the son, to make sure that I am eating, demanded that I should eat with him the dinner together.</span> <span id="s567">But I would like to go back to a few scenes in the ghetto that I omitted.</span> <span id="s568">I think it's very important.</span> <span id="s569">You see, the Germans, when their wives came to visit them from Germany, their pleasure was to show the ghetto like we'll be animals in the zoo and they used to take them and parade them through the main streets.</span> <span id="s570">So one day parading them and looking at them, at us Jews like animals, one Jew...I forgot his last name...Joseph...by the way, he's alive...he's now in the United States...when they were gaping at us, he spate on the Germans and run away.</span> <span id="s571">Immediately the Gestapo came to the Juden and they gave, and at that time the president of Juden was Goldstein, and he gave an order to line up uh the Jewish orderlings (ph), means the Jewish police, and every ten was singled out to step out and he was hanged, but he needed the rope to hang them, so he said first that the Juden , the president should decide which ones will step out.</span> <span id="s572">He said I cannot do it, Mr. Goldstein said.</span> <span id="s573">I'm not God.</span> <span id="s574">I will not do it.</span> <span id="s575">He should bring rope.</span> <span id="s576">He didn't want to bring rope, so they sent somebody else and they hanged the head of the Juden , Mr. Goldstein with every ten police...uh Jewish police.</span> <span id="s577">One of them married my schoolmate, Eddie Fraley (ph), and he, when they hanged him, the rope broke down and he escaped.</span> <span id="s578">They let him escape because they thought that they will get him another time.</span> <span id="s579">But they didn't and actually he escaped from ghetto.</span> <span id="s580">He looked very much like a gentile.</span> <span id="s581">He escaped to Warsaw and in Warsaw he was one of the chief officers from the underground .</span> <span id="s582">He survived with my schoolmate.</span> <span id="s583">They live now in Florida.</span> <span id="s584">The second incident was....</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: How many were killed altogether?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Hundred (ph), and they were hanging.</span> <span id="s587">This wasn't over for the whole week, for everyone in ghetto to see it.</span> <span id="s588">The poor because it was a friend or a relative, and the stench...if we do something, you know, to show us they punish.</span> <span id="s589">Not enough that they were shooting us.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">They were hanging...after a a week, they removed them, and you know, they couldn't find the commandant, uh a Jew to be a commandant of the police.</span> <span id="s591">They wanted a hi...a Polish officer.</span> <span id="s592">They wanted that he should have been a pol...an army officer, so they brought a Kariate from , whose family was in .</span> <span id="s593">In ghetto they gave him a Jewish name, uh a Mr. , and after that he left by train back to his family.</span> <span id="s594">He joined his family.</span> <span id="s595">This also I found out after I escaped from ghetto from, uh from Mundig I called him, this Abraham Mundig, Abraham Ovitch.</span> <span id="s596">He told me about it.</span> <span id="s597">Now when we were in ghetto, and I was left alone and it was cold...I didn't have any firewood.</span> <span id="s598">Some of our furniture was in uh in a shack, so I took a chair and I wanted with a hammer to break into firewood but I wasn't handy so I just had to break it.</span> <span id="s599">I cut myself next to my ankle and I was bleeding.</span> <span id="s600">Later sets uh set in puss (ph) but I couldn't do anything because no doctors, no medication and this how I walked.</span> <span id="s601">Again, why I didn't die on gangrene and when it was cured, it's again a question.</span> <span id="s602">So coming back to Mundig, being I was persona non gratia, parents didn't want...my...uh his mother didn't want me, I couldn't stay there.</span> <span id="s603">So I I told Mundig...that uh I cannot stay there, so he found me a place to hide by a Ukrainian peasant.</span> <span id="s604">Ukrainian peasant had beautiful daughter.</span> <span id="s605">A lot of Ukrainian militiamen used to come to visit her, and every time I had to run in the attic and to hide between the hay, and I said this is not the life for me.</span> <span id="s606">I don't want to be hidden there.</span> <span id="s607">But while, while I was in a month later, Edmund Abraham Ovitch told me have to tell you some very sad.</span> <span id="s608">And brace yourself.</span> <span id="s609">Your father jumped from the cattle car by prying off the boards from the floor of the cattle car, although they were pressed like sardines, and he lifted the board and he asked who would like to jump with him, because more than that cannot be to let themselves down from the running train and run for their life.</span> <span id="s610">Only one girl...she was from ...I don't know her name...my age...wanted to go with my father.</span> <span id="s611">I guess the rest didn't want to separate.</span> <span id="s612">Sometimes there were families together.</span> <span id="s613">They wanted to die together.</span> <span id="s614">My father let themselves down.</span> <span id="s615">He got only bruised knees.</span> <span id="s616">The girl was not harmed at all.</span> <span id="s617">He walked to our village, which was half-hour walking distance where I was in and he entered a Ukrainian peasant's house.</span> <span id="s618">There was only a woman.</span> <span id="s619">Her husband was still in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s620">She...it was harvest time.</span> <span id="s621">She needed field hands.</span> <span id="s622">Without questioning my father, she took in my father and the girl, the girl posing as a daughter of my father.</span> <span id="s623">He tried to get in touch with me.</span> <span id="s624">He couldn't.</span> <span id="s625">He didn't get any response.</span> <span id="s626">He couldn't live with the thought that his sheltered daughter is alone in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s627">He decided to board the train which is certain death penalty for any Jew who boarded the train, to go back to ghetto to look for me.</span> <span id="s628">On the train was an architect, a Ukrainian who used to buy lumber from my father, who was wined and dined in our house.</span> <span id="s629">Without any reward he went to the Gestapo...each train I told you was a and a Gestapo...and said I know this man.</span> <span id="s630">This is Dabbie Petranka.</span> <span id="s631">He's a Jew.</span> <span id="s632">They took him off the train.</span> <span id="s633">They brought him to the mill on where they gathered the Jews already to be shipped to the death camp.</span> <span id="s634">My father probably tried to get in touch with me, but I was not there.</span> <span id="s635">So I'm alive, but my father was killed.</span> <span id="s636">(crying) So this is my story.</span> <span id="s637">So when I didn't want to stay by the farm, by Ukrainian farmer, Mundig said to me, I'll get you a false labor certificate.</span> <span id="s638">You should have some document.</span> <span id="s639">His friend, a big anti-Semite that off-hand I don't remember his name...in my book that I am writing which will be published in November...I, at that time I still remembered.</span> <span id="s640">I don't remember now.</span> <span id="s641">I know only that he was a student, second gymnasium which was known for the biggest anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s642">He was the director of , scrap iron (ph) and it was very important during the War because they needed it, so he gave me a certificate that I'm employed in his company under assumed name.</span> <span id="s643">Now I had to choose my name.</span> <span id="s644">My actually name was Amalia Petrankia but I'm not Jewish and not German, but everything was very important to be able to blend into the population.</span> <span id="s645">First impression's very important.</span> <span id="s646">My "r" is a French and German, but not a Slavic, and this was very dangerous, so I picked the name Felicita (ph) which means in Latin black, felicita and I picked the name of Mewycheski who was my beloved uh writer.</span> <span id="s647">You see we didn't have heros baseball, basketball, ballerinas...we had writers, and she was from Vilna (ph) so he put...he made a certificate that I am Mewycheski, Felicita.</span> <span id="s648">I was careful to keep my birthdate, because when you are under stress, this is the first thing that you forget...dates...and I gave my real...only my birthplace was Vilna, and now I became Felicita Mewycheski.</span> <span id="s649">With this, Mundig took me to where I thought being it's a big city, metropolitan city, I will be able to get lost there.</span> <span id="s650">He took me to his cousin's, first cousin's apartment which was just a studio apartment.</span> <span id="s651">Turn out his cousin was the king of the black market, the king of the underworld.</span> <span id="s652">And they had only two beds.</span> <span id="s653">This was a terrible experience at that time for me, a sheltered child.</span> <span id="s654">He slept with his mattress...uh mistress on one.</span> <span id="s655">I was supposed to sleep with Edmund on the other, and there were terrible, provocative remarks from him.</span> <span id="s656">Mundig understood it's not for me, so he found me a place in a hostel...this was...you see wives of Polish officers unable to be able to sustain themselves...they rented one room where they put beds, and this is where Poles who traveled slept because the hotels were only for Germans.</span> <span id="s657">How little did I know that this is the day when they're closing the ghetto in and they were searching in every hotel and hostel for Jews who may have escaped from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s658">And after the curfew...the curfew was ten o'clock...two Ukrainian police are coming to this woman's house and they with flashlight...you know...putting into our eyes, questioning everyone.</span> <span id="s659">They started with the two Polish girls but he didn't have any doubt that they are Christians.</span> <span id="s660">They let them go.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">There's a woman with a child and I was there.</span> <span id="s662">One Ukrainian was busy with this woman and the child.</span> <span id="s663">I overheard...she had baptismal papers but from '37.</span> <span id="s664">She was a wife of a Christian judge, but she was converted, so they considered her Jewish because it was '37 and they took her away with the little girl who was born already a Christian.</span> <span id="s665">The one Ukrainian asked me questions.</span> <span id="s666">He said you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s667">Prove to me you are not.</span> <span id="s668">I, a product of Hebrew kindergarten, Hebrew schools, Jewish gymnasium...on top of it we had a maid, a Jewish orphan...so I was never exposed to and all this.</span> <span id="s669">I didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s670">I failed.</span> <span id="s671">So he told me to get dressed and he's bringing me to the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">On the way he tried to persuade me that, to admit that I am Jewish and he will let me go.</span> <span id="s673">How could I trust him?</span> <span id="s674">I thought he wants to have an easy job and to come, she admit it and, you know if somebody escaped from ghetto was even worse punishment...they used to let the dogs to tear them to pieces or they used to bill uh beat up to pulp.</span> <span id="s675">It was a terrible death, so when finally I reached the building, the steps of the Gestapo building, I didn't have what to loose.</span> <span id="s676">So I said OK.</span> <span id="s677">And then I became very arrogant.</span> <span id="s678">You know, Jude (ph)...I was what, eighteen years old...I said go ahead...you spilled a lot of Jewish blood you have on your hands.</span> <span id="s679">There's a saying in Polish...go ahead...go...tell them I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s680">Kill me.</span> <span id="s681">He looked at me and start calling me with strong epithets, insulting me, and he said to me, go.</span> <span id="s682">I thought he was joking.</span> <span id="s683">He said go, but I don't want to see you anymore in because if I recognize you, I'll shoot you myself.</span> <span id="s684">How did I have the guts?</span> <span id="s685">I don't know.</span> <span id="s686">To go after curfew so another one will get me.</span> <span id="s687">I said how can I go?</span> <span id="s688">He said, OK...what do you want now...and yelling...I said you should bring me back to the hostel.</span> <span id="s689">He said no, I'll bring you back to the railroad station and disappear.</span> <span id="s690">At that ti...at the railroad station was a lot of police.</span> <span id="s691">A lot of police, looking for for Jews and for black marketeers so imagine - it was so dangerous for me.</span> <span id="s692">How I survived the night...it's another miracle.</span> <span id="s693">In the morning I went to the woman where my belongings were there and at this hostel and I said you see, I'm not Jewish.</span> <span id="s694">They let me go.</span> <span id="s695">She said I don't care if you are or not.</span> <span id="s696">Take your things and get out.</span> <span id="s697">So .</span> <span id="s698">Where do I go?</span> <span id="s699">So I decided to go to Krakow.</span> <span id="s700">This is one corner of Poland to another corner of Poland and in Krakow, this who was my father's boss, lived with his wife and a daughter.</span> <span id="s701">They was very good friends of my parents...even they were invited to the wedding of my older sister, and I thought so I don't know if they will extend their help or hand and help me but somehow I felt they will not give me away.</span> <span id="s702">And being he was an aristocratic family, I knew they would be in the telephone book.</span> <span id="s703">I will find them.</span> <span id="s704">In order to go to Krakow...we didn't have straight connections...I had to go to a city .</span> <span id="s705">I was little...how little I knew... was very important for Jews who try to escape to Hungary, so there was a lot of police.</span> <span id="s706">I arrived.</span> <span id="s707">A lot of police.</span> <span id="s708">Past curfew.</span> <span id="s709">I couldn't sleep on the station.</span> <span id="s710">What do I do?</span> <span id="s711">There was a girl who had a newspaper stand.</span> <span id="s712">I approached her.</span> <span id="s713">I started conversation.</span> <span id="s714">She liked me, and I said look, what should I do?</span> <span id="s715">I don't want to live on this station...like it's inconvenience, not that it was dangerous for me.</span> <span id="s716">And what should I do?</span> <span id="s717">She said you know what.</span> <span id="s718">Soon I'll finish my work.</span> <span id="s719">I live next to the station.</span> <span id="s720">I will take you for the night.</span> <span id="s721">I was so grateful.</span> <span id="s722">She didn't suspect.</span> <span id="s723">I slept there.</span> <span id="s724">In the morning, I'm on the station.</span> <span id="s725">A young man, very well dressed is following me.</span> <span id="s726">Well, I didn't like, everybody, you know, took off their hat to him.</span> <span id="s727">He was too young to be so prominent, so at uh I got idea I will go to the ladies room.</span> <span id="s728">No man would dare to follow me there.</span> <span id="s729">I'm in the ladies room...I see his shoes in the main hall where each compartment is.</span> <span id="s730">I knew I'm finished.</span> <span id="s731">So I come out on the aggressive side, and I said how did you dare to follow me.</span> <span id="s732">Imagine what guts I had.</span> <span id="s733">How did you dare to...what kind of upbringing do you have?</span> <span id="s734">This put him in the defense and he was shocked.</span> <span id="s735">He didn't expect.</span> <span id="s736">He thought he'll find me timid with fear.</span> <span id="s737">So he questioned me and I told him...I said I will tell you my name and I'll introduce myself if you, you'll introduce yourself to me first.</span> <span id="s738">Who are you?</span> <span id="s739">I said I have an aunt who is very sick in Krakow.</span> <span id="s740">I want to go to her to help her.</span> <span id="s741">He obtained for me the ticket railroad ticket.</span> <span id="s742">Was a long line and he sitted me in his compartment like he would feel guilty that maybe I suspect that he's police and he wanted to cover up for me.</span> <span id="s743">I took the train.</span> <span id="s744">We had to pass through Tarnow (ph).</span> <span id="s745">Tarnow again police, and they light the flashlight into you eye, and the fear in my eyes and the Gestapo man said to me, why is your voice shivering so much.</span> <span id="s746">And he saw the fear in my eyes.</span> <span id="s747">What could I say?</span> <span id="s748">I'm able if I don't understand German because you see mostly only Germ...Jews understood German.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Mostly Poles from the knew French but not so well German.</span> <span id="s750">Through interpreter I said I wonder if you two will travel forty-eight hours, if you wouldn't be tired, if your voice would not shiver.</span> <span id="s751">He took it.</span> <span id="s752">He left so the Polish woman who sit next to me, she said, you know what.</span> <span id="s753">He took you for a Jew, she's telling me.</span> <span id="s754">And this was one.</span> <span id="s755">Again another episode.</span> <span id="s756">I arrived in Krakow.</span> <span id="s757">At that time on the railroad station, I saw a lot of Polish police and a Gestapo with the dog.</span> <span id="s758">But they were not searching for Jews anymore.</span> <span id="s759">They are looking for Poles without valid, valid Polish working papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Means papers that they won't, don't work for the war, German war industry.</span> <span id="s761">The Polish police recognized me immediately and they approached me, and they said you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s762">What you are doing here?</span> <span id="s763">So naturally I was on the defense.</span> <span id="s764">I said how do you dare to insult me?</span> <span id="s765">Why do you do it to me?</span> <span id="s766">He said OK.</span> <span id="s767">If you are not Jewish...he started to again to question me from their New Testament.</span> <span id="s768">I failed.</span> <span id="s769">So they marked me and they said hah.</span> <span id="s770">He will finish you off, pointing to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s771">I was resigned.</span> <span id="s772">I said my Israel.</span> <span id="s773">I felt so alive, and I said OK.</span> <span id="s774">So I tried.</span> <span id="s775">But if not, I will join you and my parents and my sister.</span> <span id="s776">Enough is enough.</span> <span id="s777">You know, I felt like this.</span> <span id="s778">I felt lightÂªhearted.</span> <span id="s779">I accepted it, and my feet were like glued to the ground.</span> <span id="s780">The Gestapo man checked all other papers, then my turn came and the Polish police told him that I'm a Jewish, a Jewess.</span> <span id="s781">I had a bag in my hand.</span> <span id="s782">He requested...he took....told the police to hand him over the bag.</span> <span id="s783">He looked in the bag.</span> <span id="s784">I don't know what he looked for.</span> <span id="s785">He looked me up and down and he said to me why I came to Krakow.</span> <span id="s786">I told the same story.</span> <span id="s787">I'm a poor girl.</span> <span id="s788">My aunt is very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">She lives in Krakow.</span> <span id="s790">She sent for me.</span> <span id="s791">Through interpreter naturally.</span> <span id="s792">Where does she live?</span> <span id="s793">I have never...I never was in Krakow, but like here, every time almost has Broadway.</span> <span id="s794">I said the street , which is after very famous Polish writer.</span> <span id="s795">You know, he said .</span> <span id="s796">Means go.</span> <span id="s797">I didn't believe my ears.</span> <span id="s798">And I couldn't.</span> <span id="s799">You know, when a person is so resigned...I was ready to get uh you know, a shot...to be shot from the back.</span> <span id="s800">I said OK.</span> <span id="s801">He wants me to move, and he sent off the dog in the back who will tear me to pieces.</span> <span id="s802">I just couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s803">So the police, police said fall to his feet.</span> <span id="s804">Kiss his feet.</span> <span id="s805">He let you go.</span> <span id="s806">I, we don't know why, in Polish.</span> <span id="s807">And like a robot I start moving till I left the railroad station.</span> <span id="s808">I didn't believe that I will leave it alive.</span> <span id="s809">Why he let me go I don't know.</span> <span id="s810">When I left the station, now where should I go now?</span> <span id="s811">It was Christmas Eve.</span> <span id="s812">So inquired about some...again a boarding house, a hostel who will take me.</span> <span id="s813">And I was told one has a room where he rents beds.</span> <span id="s814">He gave me the address.</span> <span id="s815">I came there and the said you see all beds are taken unless somebody offers to take you in, which with a sardonic smile, vulgar smile.</span> <span id="s816">And there was a woman, little older than I. I noticed the hair was re...painted red, not her natural, with dark eyes.</span> <span id="s817">And she offered to take me into her bed.</span> <span id="s818">Immediately she recognized me that I'm Jewish and I recognize her.</span> <span id="s819">It turned out she was a seamstress from Lublin (ph) who escaped and now she tried her luck as a gentile.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">What the night was terrible.</span> <span id="s821">You know what was going on on other beds?</span> <span id="s822">I had wonderful school of life (ph).</span> <span id="s823">She gave me a sign not to talk.</span> <span id="s824">Only when we were in the park we spoke.</span> <span id="s825">I told her who I am and she told me...she shared with me the bread that she bought on the black market and I told her I am...the only chance I have...let me look up .</span> <span id="s826">We went to the telephone book.</span> <span id="s827">I found his address.</span> <span id="s828">I came over there.</span> <span id="s829">His wife, Kashimira (ph), opened the door.</span> <span id="s830">When she saw me, she couldn't believe her eyes.</span> <span id="s831">She thought it's a ghost, and she closed the door.</span> <span id="s832">Then she opened it again and she pulled me in, and I said I am Amalia Petranka, David's daughter.</span> <span id="s833">She started to cry.</span> <span id="s834">She embraced me and she said look, I didn't recognize you.</span> <span id="s835">Let's see if my husband will recognize you.</span> <span id="s836">If he doesn't, so maybe we can harbor you for a while till we'll find something for you.</span> <span id="s837">Her husband came.</span> <span id="s838">He didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s839">She told him who I am.</span> <span id="s840">So he said, I hate Jews, but for the daughter of David Petranka, I'll do every thing.</span> <span id="s841">Let's see what we can do for her.</span> <span id="s842">Now this was the high life of Krakow.</span> <span id="s843">Every night bridge, different companies, and being she was Armenian...again the Germans considered her a foreigner and she lived in a beautiful German neighborhood, so she had two little girls and she had a maid.</span> <span id="s844">She said to me you'll sleep with the girls and you'll...I'll tell the maids that you are the new governess for the children, and I stayed for three weeks.</span> <span id="s845">And they found for me in the newspaper a job as a housemaid to a , to Germans who had children.</span> <span id="s846">And she gave me advice, to work for Germans because this is safer and they will not recognize me.</span> <span id="s847">I got the job.</span> <span id="s848">The Germans liked me because they got a maid, you know, from...a peasant girl who didn't understand German.</span> <span id="s849">I was very helpful.</span> <span id="s850">They treated me quite good.</span> <span id="s851">They thought that I am Polish.</span> <span id="s852">And I developed here .</span> <span id="s853">It was abscessed with puss.</span> <span id="s854">So the Germans said it's not proper.</span> <span id="s855">We'll bring you to the hospital.</span> <span id="s856">I am a Jew, no papers.</span> <span id="s857">How could they enter a hospital, and I didn't have uh the social card from uh from here like Medicare or some...I didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s858">But he was a big shot.</span> <span id="s859">He arranged.</span> <span id="s860">They accepted me.</span> <span id="s861">How little I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Before the operation, a priest comes for confession.</span> <span id="s863">I didn't know how and what.</span> <span id="s864">So he started talking.</span> <span id="s865">So he said I see you're from the same town that I am.</span> <span id="s866">You're from Landberg (ph) and I am special accent in Polish.</span> <span id="s867">So he said how about...and now he wanted I should confess.</span> <span id="s868">I said, Father, how about if you'll sing for me a song, a very famous song just from Landberg.</span> <span id="s869">This changed the mood, and he did.</span> <span id="s870">But I was afraid after I will wake up or during when they give me anesthesia, I may spill who I am because usually what you do.</span> <span id="s871">I spotted a nurse who looked to me Jewish and I said look, please, watch over me.</span> <span id="s872">Protect me.</span> <span id="s873">Why, she said.</span> <span id="s874">Because I'm Jewish and you're Jewish.</span> <span id="s875">Not I'm not Jewish.</span> <span id="s876">I said I don't care.</span> <span id="s877">Help me.</span> <span id="s878">And I showed her my leg, which was already with gangrene and I developed lice last day in ghetto and I couldn't get rid of it.</span> <span id="s879">I said help me.</span> <span id="s880">And she did help.</span> <span id="s881">So she wouldn't do it if she wouldn't be Jewish masquerading.</span> <span id="s882">And also, imagine how you can control your mind.</span> <span id="s883">Before even I woke up, they looked for my nightgown and I was able to point where it is hanging.</span> <span id="s884">Meantime, Edmund came to visit me.</span> <span id="s885">There, next bed to me was laying a Polish peasant girl by the .</span> <span id="s886">She liked me.</span> <span id="s887">She worked for a German casino.</span> <span id="s888">Means they were employees, bookkeepers, everything for oil, from the oil company sent from Germany.</span> <span id="s889">Because they were by themselves, they had a casino, like a club where they lived, dined and then they went to the office.</span> <span id="s890">I said Kashimira, can you get me a job there.</span> <span id="s891">I thought if it's a German place, the Polish police doesn't have any access.</span> <span id="s892">Where they used to comb the houses in Polish sections searching for Jews and I will have some security and a roof over my head.</span> <span id="s893">And one day a girl by the name Katia (ph)...I forgot her last name...came to visit Kashia, so this .</span> <span id="s894">Kashia said, you know what.</span> <span id="s895">You're like each other.</span> <span id="s896">I notice you are educated.</span> <span id="s897">She's educated.</span> <span id="s898">You're alike.</span> <span id="s899">She's Ukrainian.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Kashia started talking to me.</span> <span id="s901">She recognized immediately that I am Jewish and I recognized that she's Jewish, so she started, tried to stay away.</span> <span id="s902">So this chambermaid Kashia said to me, I thought you liked each other.</span> <span id="s903">How come you dislike each other?</span> <span id="s904">I couldn't tell her.</span> <span id="s905">We came to the casino.</span> <span id="s906">She obtained for me the job and I started as a chambermaid.</span> <span id="s907">I had to clean eight rooms, to kindle their fire and for this I have...she took me into their room and this, how I could stay and was safer.</span> <span id="s908">One day this Katia Ukrainian comes to me and she says look...at that time she had a job as the chief manager of the kitchen, which was wonderful because she got food.</span> <span id="s909">She...and because of it she got a room for herself.</span> <span id="s910">She said come to me.</span> <span id="s911">I want to discuss with you something.</span> <span id="s912">I said OK Katia, what is it.</span> <span id="s913">I came to her.</span> <span id="s914">She said look, you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s915">I am Jewish, and there is another Jewish girl, Soshia (ph) who doesn't sleep in the casino.</span> <span id="s916">She sleeps outside but its very dangerous for us.</span> <span id="s917">Because you are the last one, you are the one who has to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">And she told me she was a medical student in Lamburg (ph).</span> <span id="s919">She comes from the and her husband's friends who who was a communist and was presently in Russia, gave her the paper as Ukrainian, a Ukrainian, and this is how she's surviving.</span> <span id="s920">So I said Katia, you're right.</span> <span id="s921">By right I should leave, but I don't have a scrape of paper.</span> <span id="s922">Let me get some documents and I promise you that I will leave, but again when you have to do with nice people, when Soshia who was the daughter of a lawyer from Lamburg, a little bit older than I..</span> <span id="s923">.</span> <span id="s924">she said I'm staying anyhow outside the theat...uh casino.</span> <span id="s925">I will go first.</span> <span id="s926">And then my boss came to me and he says, he said you know, how comes you don't have an ID.</span> <span id="s927">How come Anna cannot feed you because not having an ID you don't have any ration cards?</span> <span id="s928">So I had to apply.</span> <span id="s929">I wrote a letter to Mundig and I said I need baptismal papers because this is how you applied for ID.</span> <span id="s930">Dear Mundig, bless his sole...he went to a Ukrainian priest, Catholic priest.</span> <span id="s931">So I got my baptismal paper.</span> <span id="s932">I'm Roman Catholic, but the baptismal paper, the stamp was for Ukrainian church, Orthodox church.</span> <span id="s933">When I gave the application to the police, they came looking for me.</span> <span id="s934">Who am I?</span> <span id="s935">What a contradiction.</span> <span id="s936">And they call it in the German and they summoned me to the police.</span> <span id="s937">Now I was thinking what can I do.</span> <span id="s938">Not to report to police means I have to run.</span> <span id="s939">Where do I run again without papers.</span> <span id="s940">To report, they will catch me and I'm gone.</span> <span id="s941">So then he said...I looked very young, younger for my age than I was.</span> <span id="s942">I was always very petite.</span> <span id="s943">I had two braids and I prayed to God, the woman who'll investigate me should me an old maid or old man.</span> <span id="s944">Somehow they had some compassion for children, for young people.</span> <span id="s945">And I came there and she saw me...she said you know what, your priest got drunk.</span> <span id="s946">Look what the nonsense he wrote.</span> <span id="s947">Write for another baptismal paper.</span> <span id="s948">But not I'm at fault, only this.</span> <span id="s949">I have done it, so Mundig sent me another with the stamp Roman Catholic and this I got legitimate ID from the police which meant a lot.</span> <span id="s950">No money could buy it, because this, you know, the first thing when they caught a Jew, they checked with the police, then they check with the parish, so I was...because of it I was able to get a labor card and I was able to rep..</span> <span id="s951">.</span> <span id="s952">get a card, you know, from uh , you know, to get health, health care.</span> <span id="s953">And I worked there.</span> <span id="s954">While I worked there, meantime came the Jewess from Lublin who helped me.</span> <span id="s955">She learned I'm there, and she cried...she doesn't have a piece of paper and they're searching...she worked, she worked for a seamstress who gladly kept her for food for her labor.</span> <span id="s956">But she didn't have any paper.</span> <span id="s957">Nothing can get .</span> <span id="s958">I give her my piece of paper.</span> <span id="s959">Not the ID still didn't have.</span> <span id="s960">Only Felecita Mewycheski.</span> <span id="s961">Luckily this wasn't the time of computers because immediately we both would be caught, but I didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s962">I knew I have to save her.</span> <span id="s963">When you're young, you don't think.</span> <span id="s964">And in casino, in this was one .</span> <span id="s965">His mother was Jewish descendent.</span> <span id="s966">His grandfather was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">.</span> <span id="s968">He recognized me immediately, and one day he told me I'll have to report to his room.</span> <span id="s969">I said I don't have to report because Poles were forbidden to socialize with Germans.</span> <span id="s970">He insisted with a threatening voice.</span> <span id="s971">I knew I don't have a choice.</span> <span id="s972">I came up.</span> <span id="s973">He presented me with a pic...a picture, a photo of a Jew and he said to me, this is my grandfather.</span> <span id="s974">I thought he wants to provoke me.</span> <span id="s975">I thought he is from the Gestapo because each unit has also each office.</span> <span id="s976">I said what do you want for my life?</span> <span id="s977">If you know I'm Jewish, why didn't you report me to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s978">He says cut it out.</span> <span id="s979">I want to help you.</span> <span id="s980">I want to save you.</span> <span id="s981">First of all, you cannot work here.</span> <span id="s982">You don't blend in.</span> <span id="s983">You're not a chambermaid with the coarse white features and everything.</span> <span id="s984">You must get out.</span> <span id="s985">I said how can I get out.</span> <span id="s986">I need a roof.</span> <span id="s987">It was hard to get a room, and even...and I need a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">And no job will pay me for be able to pay rent and to sustain myself.</span> <span id="s989">He said don't worry.</span> <span id="s990">I will see what I can do for you.</span> <span id="s991">He knew an architect, a very big engineer from the railroad authority, , .</span> <span id="s992">, whose brother was the Commandant of Berlin while Hitler was shot there.</span> <span id="s993">The Chief Commandant.</span> <span id="s994">He spoke to him.</span> <span id="s995">He said, you know many construction firms.</span> <span id="s996">I would like you to find a job for my fri..</span> <span id="s997">.</span> <span id="s998">my Polish who uh Polish acquaintance who is working in this place where I am now, and he obtained for me a job in a construction firm, but while I was in casino, they decided, you know, the director of the casino was a a a brother of the secretary of Hans Frank and the castle in Krakow.</span> <span id="s999">And he used to get his meals from the casino.</span> <span id="s1000">I was the one selected to bring the meals, but to enter it I was checked and double checked and everything.</span> <span id="s1001">I didn't have the papers.</span> <span id="s1002">I couldn't get out of it.</span> <span id="s1003">I didn't know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Luckily, with this scrap of paper...before I had my ID, they let me through and I used to bring the meals to the castle.</span> <span id="s1005">Imagine.</span> <span id="s1006">With all the police guarding and everything, so he found for me a job and , a construction firm which was located in and employed slave workers from , Jews.</span> <span id="s1007">And I..</span> <span id="s1008">.</span> <span id="s1009">when I worked there, I said my goodness.</span> <span id="s1010">I'm open now.</span> <span id="s1011">I..</span> <span id="s1012">.</span> <span id="s1013">maybe I can help the Jews by supplying them bread, maybe potato.</span> <span id="s1014">So I asked my boss, Wilhelm Langerd (ph) if he will permit me to go with him on the , means where they were working there, not in the office, and just to see how it's going on.</span> <span id="s1015">He thought that I'm going for the gold, because he used to get gold from the Jews who were able to buy out their way not to work so hard only in the office.</span> <span id="s1016">And one day he was in good mood and he took me to the office.</span> <span id="s1017">I came there.</span> <span id="s1018">The secretary was Doctor Leibermann (ph).</span> <span id="s1019">He was a ref...a German Jew who was .</span> <span id="s1020">He introduced me.</span> <span id="s1021">This is our secretary, Felecita Mewycheski and Dr. Leibermann looking at me said, you know what.</span> <span id="s1022">Our secretary looks complete like my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s1023">So I couldn't go there any more, and the door door was closed for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">While I was working there they brought Czech and Slavic Jews in the cattle cars, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1025">I..</span> <span id="s1026">.</span> <span id="s1027">the office was on a hill.</span> <span id="s1028">Down were the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s1029">How I as a Jewess could take the screams and the cries for water.</span> <span id="s1030">I was in the office.</span> <span id="s1031">At that time was also in the office a Polish mining engineer.</span> <span id="s1032">He was a terrible anti-Semite and I took a pail filled up with water and went down to hand the water to the uh...they had the little windows which were .</span> <span id="s1033">They were guarded by Ukrainian police with the bayonets.</span> <span id="s1034">The police approached me and said what, do you want to be killed to and threw the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">With a broken heart I went up to the office and the mining engineer, with this smirk on his face tells me...Miss Felecita, what will you be after the war?</span> <span id="s1036">Then I knew he recognized.</span> <span id="s1037">I played dumb and I told him how do I know who I'll be.</span> <span id="s1038">How do I know whom I'll marry after the war, but I have to go ahead of time, after the war, when the war ended, on the bus stop where I used to board my bus...here was standing , the engineer.</span> <span id="s1039">I knew it.</span> <span id="s1040">He comes over to me.</span> <span id="s1041">He said, Miss Felecita.</span> <span id="s1042">I recognize you.</span> <span id="s1043">At that time you gave yourself away, but I didn't have the heart to give you away.</span> <span id="s1044">I hated Jews, but I didn't have the heart to give you away.</span> <span id="s1045">Another incident.</span> <span id="s1046">Well, when I was working for this Wilhelm Langerd, I was masquerading as Miss Felecita Mewycheski.</span> <span id="s1047">In was a very elegant family, a widow and a sister by the name mewycheski, to whose house used to come my boss, the Nazi, the German, Mr. Wilhelm Langerd, and she, hearing that this Mewycheski must be family, insisted on meeting me.</span> <span id="s1048">When finally I couldn't avoid it, I went there.</span> <span id="s1049">Sure enough that she will recognize and it's my aunt.</span> <span id="s1050">I came over there.</span> <span id="s1051">She pulled me all my face on all sides and there she looked at me and she asked me who I am and I had a story that I prepared who my father and so what, and she said you know you are not from the main line.</span> <span id="s1052">You must be from the branch of Mewycheskis in Lamberg and insisted that I should move in, because she felt responsible for a young girl to live on her own.</span> <span id="s1053">Miracle again.</span> <span id="s1054">Another miracle.</span> <span id="s1055">Well works till there by Mr. Langerd, the company paid five per capita for every Jew for slave work to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1056">In was Gestapo Miller (ph), a known sadist.</span> <span id="s1057">Tall, slim.</span> <span id="s1058">With a stick in his hand he used to walk, and at at will, at random he used to kill, shoot at the Jews who were in ghetto, in .</span> <span id="s1059">I heard of him.</span> <span id="s1060">One day whom do I see in the frame of the por...of the door - it was him.</span> <span id="s1061">Then I had to think fast.</span> <span id="s1062">Did he come for me?</span> <span id="s1063">No.</span> <span id="s1064">He's too big to come for me.</span> <span id="s1065">He could have sent somebody else, but I couldn't take off my eyes from the two German Shepherds.</span> <span id="s1066">They were terrible.</span> <span id="s1067">They were known that used to just to tear up Jews to pieces, so my eyes were glued.</span> <span id="s1068">He approached the desk, and he said, you don't have to fear.</span> <span id="s1069">My dogs will smell a Jew a mile away.</span> <span id="s1070">So means you are not a Jew.</span> <span id="s1071">What luck.</span> <span id="s1072">And then he stated the reason why he came here.</span> <span id="s1073">Another.</span> <span id="s1074">I was never a secretary.</span> <span id="s1075">I took humanities.</span> <span id="s1076">I was supposed to study medicine.</span> <span id="s1077">I didn't know any secretarial work.</span> <span id="s1078">When this that commanded me to this guy, he told him.</span> <span id="s1079">After a month my boss told me, you know what.</span> <span id="s1080">I admire you.</span> <span id="s1081">How come you grasp so fast, like a Jewess.</span> <span id="s1082">Another incident.</span> <span id="s1083">One day he tells me, how come that you have such Semitic eyes.</span> <span id="s1084">What answer do I give him?</span> <span id="s1085">To deny?</span> <span id="s1086">I will blush.</span> <span id="s1087">I'll give myself away.</span> <span id="s1088">Said, was probably nonchalantly, probably my grandmother was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1089">No one would admit because till third generation they were considered Jews.</span> <span id="s1090">He thought that it was such a joke.</span> <span id="s1091">He burst out laughing.</span> <span id="s1092">This was only incident in one place.</span> <span id="s1093">Why I bring them out...we are accused that you went by ship to Florida.</span> <span id="s1094">It's not true.</span> <span id="s1095">But there were many incidents and you had to be lucky not to be caught, or killed because I was caught many times.</span> <span id="s1096">Not to be killed.</span> <span id="s1097">One more would have, I would have been killed.</span> <span id="s1098">Another one.</span> <span id="s1099">When the Russians were moving close, the front, they didn't have enough...the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1100">Many who built for war in say like the bridges, railroad, toward the Russian front were excused for active service in German army.</span> <span id="s1101">Towards the end they needed everybody.</span> <span id="s1102">So they also were drafted the workers, the German who worked for company as carpenters and other jobs.</span> <span id="s1103">So my boss sent me , which was a part of Gestapo, to excuse them for army service.</span> <span id="s1104">I told to my boss, how can I do it?</span> <span id="s1105">I am a Pole.</span> <span id="s1106">They are not permitted to go there.</span> <span id="s1107">Why do you send me?</span> <span id="s1108">He said, I give you order.</span> <span id="s1109">You have to do it.</span> <span id="s1110">Having no choice, I went.</span> <span id="s1111">The Gestapo at the desk greeted me with a heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s1112">I was careful.</span> <span id="s1113">I answered, .</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Poles were not supposed to say heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s1115">I explained to him the reason of my coming.</span> <span id="s1116">I produced the papers.</span> <span id="s1117">He took care of it, positively, and when I was supposed to leave, again I said .</span> <span id="s1118">And he said heil Hitler and he called me back.</span> <span id="s1119">And he said, why don't you say heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s1120">Aren't you good enough to say heil Hitler?</span> <span id="s1121">I said, I I said in German, I am not supposed to.</span> <span id="s1122">What do you mean you're not supposed to?</span> <span id="s1123">I said I am a Pole.</span> <span id="s1124">He got so angry.</span> <span id="s1125">He took the telephone and called up my boss.</span> <span id="s1126">How did you dare to send a Pole on such a sensitive mission.</span> <span id="s1127">Another incident.</span> <span id="s1128">There's another one.</span> <span id="s1129">Railroad authority had a big ball, and they wanted...the one of the chief ones whose wife was in Germany, asked my boss if I will be his company...companion.</span> <span id="s1130">I tried to get out of it, because it was very dangerous and I was not supposed to socialize with Germans, and if I would be caught, it's terrible.</span> <span id="s1131">As a Pole and on top of as a Jewess.</span> <span id="s1132">So I said to my boss I will only go if you will tell him the truth, that I am not ethnic German but I am a Pole, and if he wants to take the risks, because as well as for the Germans, if they are caught they were sent to the Russian front.</span> <span id="s1133">Then I will agree to go.</span> <span id="s1134">I don't know why he did agree.</span> <span id="s1135">I came to the ball.</span> <span id="s1136">I didn't have what to wear.</span> <span id="s1137">I had a black woolen dress with a velvet rose here and I told him I can go only if you'll be a gentleman...when I feel very uncomfortable that you will take me home immediately.</span> <span id="s1138">He agreed.</span> <span id="s1139">There were checkpoints.</span> <span id="s1140">They checked but such a big shot, they didn't and say anything.</span> <span id="s1141">I didn't know that Frank, General Frank was inviting the also to this affair.</span> <span id="s1142">You know, the big shot, the .</span> <span id="s1143">When he came, they all rise up and they introduced their partners.</span> <span id="s1144">And this uh engineer, ... he was a very high official by the name I think Brown, introduced me as a par , you know, from this Baltic, from Lithuanian and so because knows what Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1145">Frank looked at me and he said, .</span> <span id="s1146">You know, and even if you don't get complimented directly to a person, only .</span> <span id="s1147">Means he picked the rose, and he said .</span> <span id="s1148">Stupid me, my age, I said why only rose.</span> <span id="s1149">Why not , means this...I .</span> <span id="s1150">I guess he got very impressed.</span> <span id="s1151">He made a toast.</span> <span id="s1152">I wish all the German girls will be like the .</span> <span id="s1153">And I realized I went too far.</span> <span id="s1154">I blushed, but this was accepted.</span> <span id="s1155">Modesty.</span> <span id="s1156">And I turned to my escort and I said I must leave.</span> <span id="s1157">I'm not comfortable.</span> <span id="s1158">Those are the incidents.</span> <span id="s1159">There are many others.</span> <span id="s1160">Towards...I then, when they evacuated I didn't want to go with the firm to , I was assigned to , a tough organization.</span> <span id="s1161">They used to build the ditches.</span> <span id="s1162">Another incident.</span> <span id="s1163">And every Pole had to give a week work for nothing.</span> <span id="s1164">One day my boss tells me there will come a watchmaker.</span> <span id="s1165">He will give you two watches.</span> <span id="s1166">One for me.</span> <span id="s1167">One for you.</span> <span id="s1168">And you will excuse him for digging the ditches.</span> <span id="s1169">The day comes.</span> <span id="s1170">The man comes in.</span> <span id="s1171">Who is the man?</span> <span id="s1172">Anti-Semite Pole from , whom the government transferred to Stanistlawow to Polanize it, who had a jewelry store street across the street from me.</span> <span id="s1173">When I saw it I bent down double, make believe that I have cramps and I run out.</span> <span id="s1174">I waited till he's out.</span> <span id="s1175">Then I come in and my boss said to me, now because of you I lost my watch, because he didn't he didn't want to accept himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">This was so so many incidents.</span> <span id="s1177">There was recognize how I got away I really can not tell you.</span> <span id="s1178">This is when I was in .</span> <span id="s1179">Then I got a job and now I think I'll need to end because I don't think we have enough time.</span> <span id="s1180">There was another construction firm which didn't evacuate.</span> <span id="s1181">This is the construction firm of and Krause (ph).</span> <span id="s1182">There I became a personal secretary to the boss, , who was Yugoslavian and the son-in- law of one of the owners of and Krause, .</span> <span id="s1183">How little I knew that the firm was assigned to build the barricades in Krakow to slow down the Russian approach and also to destroy historical buildings from Krackow and all the bunkers around the German buildings because this was after the Warsaw uprise from the Poles and they expected it in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1184">When the wasn't and ha...they had to evacuate back to Vienna, he wanted to take me along.</span> <span id="s1185">I said no, my place is my motherland, Poland, and I stay on.</span> <span id="s1186">So he said...and then in that case I make you...I put you in charge of the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">This was in middle of December and till we were combatively uh pushed away the Russian army will come back in March.</span> <span id="s1188">Meantime here's the key from the safe and here are the checks for the employees and you pay...pay them out, and you should expect call, a phone call for from some important papers.</span> <span id="s1189">Didn't specify, didn't tell and I didn't know.</span> <span id="s1190">Around...I think the thirteenth or tenth of January, when the German army was completely in retreat, I get a phone call from the Commandant from Krakow...means the high uh Commandant of the military uh military in Krakow, and he said is this the firm and Krause.</span> <span id="s1191">I said yavol (ph).</span> <span id="s1192">.</span> <span id="s1193">Means dynamite the .</span> <span id="s1194">I put two and two together, and I understood it.</span> <span id="s1195">And then I was thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">What should I do?</span> <span id="s1197">Had I been a German, I would have said my company evacuated and you have to do it.</span> <span id="s1198">I said what will happen to me if I fail to tell him...by this I would save the Krakow from really being destroyed but I didn't survive now the war to loose my life.</span> <span id="s1199">But then I thought no...he didn't ask me for my name.</span> <span id="s1200">He just said the company, and the company was still left...the daughter-in-law of the owner of the building who was the hostess of the company, the custodian and two chambermaids.</span> <span id="s1201">I would never admit receiving the phone call, and I called up the Polish underground which I joined while I was a chambermaid under request of Kashimira uh and my link was .</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">And I gave them the message, happy knowing this is the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1203">Two days later, some Polish officers knocked at the gate of the building and this is while the German army was in retreat, while they were bombings and even uh bombs uh uh hit one of the rooms...and I told the custodian and the Polish woman, I said let's not open the gates because it will be a chaos.</span> <span id="s1204">This is a building where German companies were there.</span> <span id="s1205">Many Poles will be free to plunder and our lives will be in danger till we explain who we are.</span> <span id="s1206">And they listened.</span> <span id="s1207">And then again I see another group of officers, knocked at the door and looking out the window I recognized one of the officers is definitely a Jew, so I thought from this quarter cannot come any danger to me, and I told the custodian to let them in.</span> <span id="s1208">They came in and among them was my husband...my present husband, but he was in civil clothes and a leather coat...somehow he just likes me the most and started questioning me angrily and harshly.</span> <span id="s1209">I decided I'm not going to reveal him now, with the armies in retreat.</span> <span id="s1210">I have witnesses here, the custodian, the chambermaids.</span> <span id="s1211">Maybe they will come back and I will be shot, so I refused to answer his questions and I told him if you have any doubt who I am, please...here's my ID I took out and if not take me to your superior.</span> <span id="s1212">My husband said I am the superior and you answer to me.</span> <span id="s1213">I said no, I'm not taking any chances.</span> <span id="s1214">I don't have to deal now with such anti-Semites now when the war is toward the end, and I approach the officer who looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s1215">I said do you mind to step in with me to the other room.</span> <span id="s1216">I want to talk to you.</span> <span id="s1217">Coming in to the other room, he asked me who are you.</span> <span id="s1218">I said I am the same thing who who you are.</span> <span id="s1219">What do you mean?</span> <span id="s1220">You are Jewish and I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s1221">He said how do you know it.</span> <span id="s1222">In Polish it's a saying...look at your face.</span> <span id="s1223">From where are you?</span> <span id="s1224">I said from Stanistlawow.</span> <span id="s1225">From where are you?</span> <span id="s1226">From Krakow.</span> <span id="s1227">So he tells me....and from Krackow.</span> <span id="s1228">I told him I had a schoolmate in Jewish gymnasium by the name of .</span> <span id="s1229">By any chance do you know this family?</span> <span id="s1230">He paled.</span> <span id="s1231">It was his first cousin.</span> <span id="s1232">Jubilant, he comes back to the room, approaches my husband and says to leave her alone.</span> <span id="s1233">Not only that she is not German, because they thought I'm German...not only she's not Polish, she's Jewish.</span> <span id="s1234">So my husband was sure that knowing him as a womanizer that probably I promised something all done and now he tries to protect me.</span> <span id="s1235">So he moved closer to me, my husband, and he told me, do you know any other language.</span> <span id="s1236">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1237">What other language do you know?</span> <span id="s1238">I said uh English, German, Russian, and I still didn't say Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1239">Any other language?</span> <span id="s1240">So he start asking me in English, what little English he know.</span> <span id="s1241">What nation are you?</span> <span id="s1242">I said I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s1243">Prove it to me.</span> <span id="s1244">How can I prove?</span> <span id="s1245">So he said do you know Hebrew?</span> <span id="s1246">I said yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Speak to me.</span> <span id="s1248">I got so mad.</span> <span id="s1249">I said, .</span> <span id="s1250">.</span> <span id="s1251">So he couldn't believe.</span> <span id="s1252">He said how come this young girl can speak so well the Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1253">Was probably the Germans who taught her Hebrew...she should spy on the Jews and get them out.</span> <span id="s1254">Imagine.</span> <span id="s1255">So then he asked me when do we say .</span> <span id="s1256">When he asked me about , I understood he's Jewish too.</span> <span id="s1257">Excited with tears in my eyes, I said to him, you too?</span> <span id="s1258">So naturally then he knew.</span> <span id="s1259">He switched back to Polish and from then he stated the purpose of his coming...that he came, they found out this is the company that build the barricades and built the columns and he wants the plans because he knows I was the secretary and I must have it...the office in the building.</span> <span id="s1260">I should give him to save the city because must be a key how to detonate and how to neutralize it.</span> <span id="s1261">I said why didn't you say it from the first place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Now we have to change tapes.</span> <span id="s1263">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: So, then I told my husband, be my guest.</span> <span id="s1266">You know, then I was really very light and very happy and I invited him to go across the uh stairs, stairway because this is where the office was.</span> <span id="s1267">I opened the safe and I handed him the papers and he asked me who I am, what's my name.</span> <span id="s1268">I told him who I am and then I asked him...first I told him Felecita Mewycheski.</span> <span id="s1269">He said no.</span> <span id="s1270">Tell me the real name.</span> <span id="s1271">My real name is Amalia Petranka and he said...told...gave me his real name and then he said, isn't this ironic that you, a Jewish girl, were able...was instrumental in saving the city from destruction.</span> <span id="s1272">I gave him the plans and since then we started dating and later...I mean now we are married but I would like to add a few more things, very important...how people in face of death and misery, still how they were good and honest.</span> <span id="s1273">My fia...Alec, who was my fiance, he applied for medical school in Poland but they didn't want to accept him on and when the war broke out, when the Russians came, he got a job as a bookkeeper in the railroad uh on the rail...in the railroad authorities.</span> <span id="s1274">And each one who applied for a job had to submit his baptismal papers and a Russian ID.</span> <span id="s1275">When the Russians left, somehow he kept one ID from a Ukrainian girl.</span> <span id="s1276">She was just a few years older than I.</span> <span id="s1277">In ghetto he came to me and he said run for your life.</span> <span id="s1278">Here are the papers, legitimate papers because first they check, you know, usually the parish and you're covered and I know she moved uh evacuated to Russia.</span> <span id="s1279">You're on the safe side.</span> <span id="s1280">She's little older but age you can never tell, and take it and go out of ghetto.</span> <span id="s1281">I said Alec, how can you do?</span> <span id="s1282">This is worth so many thousands of dollars.</span> <span id="s1283">Your mother is starving to death.</span> <span id="s1284">Your father who was such a prominent uh Jew before the war, start...died of starvation.</span> <span id="s1285">Your sister is starving, so why don't you sell the papers.</span> <span id="s1286">I don't have many thousand dollars to pay you.</span> <span id="s1287">I need some money for escape to have it, so sell and make some money.</span> <span id="s1288">He insisted I should take them and save myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">He refused to escape from ghetto although he was really...his looks were like hundred Aryans, not one but he didn't want to because his mother was on death bed and he didn't want to leave her, and I found out that he committed suicide when his mother died.</span> <span id="s1290">His sister Trica (ph) who was eight years his junior, was taken in by the family who was from a small town...I think , I'm not sure, of ...still, you know, a small town...some Jews could pay their way and some Ukrainians or peasants harbored them for money.</span> <span id="s1291">So they took her and this is how she survived the war.</span> <span id="s1292">Right now she lives in Long Island.</span> <span id="s1293">You know, we had very .</span> <span id="s1294">When the Germans came they proclaimed that we are all are Communists, and we are...they are free to kill us.</span> <span id="s1295">So within a year, they killed us all.</span> <span id="s1296">Actually the only survivors from our, from our town maybe are three hundred to four hundred, only who masqueraded as gentiles and like I who were not caught and again I'm telling you it was very hard, because Poland was not a melting pot that you could blend in easily.</span> <span id="s1297">One reason or another there always were pitfalls.</span> <span id="s1298">Some survived who were drafted to Russian army and they survived in Russia, because like I mentioned before, we didn't have any concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1299">We didn't have any labor camps.</span> <span id="s1300">Only that came towards the end, when there was no room any more.</span> <span id="s1301">And you know what?</span> <span id="s1302">During the war, many times I contemplated suicide.</span> <span id="s1303">And I made and I resolved if Hitler wins, I cannot go on a life of flight, and I'll commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1304">If he looses, then I will not be an orphan left alone because I still had a sister, a grandmother...my gran...my mother's brothers in Palestine and I will be united with them.</span> <span id="s1305">And also there was a will, a strong will of destiny.</span> <span id="s1306">My goal was to survive, not to let the Germans to rewrite the history.</span> <span id="s1307">Although I was very young and I didn't have any sense of history at that time, but because they claimed that we all Jews were Communists, and I knew how the world hated the Communists, so later if there will not be eye witnesses...I didn't know that there are more Jews will survive...they will be able to claim that they only killed us because we were Communists.</span> <span id="s1308">And this gave me the strength to live.</span> <span id="s1309">Another thing I have to mention...again goodness.</span> <span id="s1310">This Katia that I mentioned, who was a medical student from Lamberg who posed as a Ukrainian, she left me to the job in the kitchen and she got a job as a housekeeper by a German physician, a doctor, which was much easier, better food.</span> <span id="s1311">When I worked in the casinos as a chambermaid, I was entitled to have week vacation.</span> <span id="s1312">Where could I go?</span> <span id="s1313">So, Katia suggested to me that she will harbor me in their apartment.</span> <span id="s1314">I will not be permi...natural able to leave, to make believe that I went home for vacation and then I will come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">She endangered herself.</span> <span id="s1316">She had to share her food with me.</span> <span id="s1317">Goodness.</span> <span id="s1318">Actually I must tell you that I the goodness of people.</span> <span id="s1319">Jews whom I encountered, and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1320">But whatever I could do, I have done the same thing.</span> <span id="s1321">For example...</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: You need to come back to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1323">Tell about what you and your husband did right after the war...</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: But one more...good.</span> <span id="s1325">But one more episode in goodness I have to also explain.</span> <span id="s1326">Maybe this part is on my side.</span> <span id="s1327">When I graduated, (cough) we used to get tabloid (ph), picture of all the students.</span> <span id="s1328">The picture was done by a photographer by the name Barchowski (ph), who had the studio next to our building.</span> <span id="s1329">One day I'm walking with Kashia on in Krakow to the garden.</span> <span id="s1330">I see from har...far the Jew from Stanistlawow, Barchowski.</span> <span id="s1331">I wasn't sure if he would recognize me or not.</span> <span id="s1332">I ran towards him, embraced him and said my name is Felecita Mewycheski.</span> <span id="s1333">What's your name?</span> <span id="s1334">He told me, and I introduced him to Kashia uh and he invited us to his studio.</span> <span id="s1335">He started to date Kashia.</span> <span id="s1336">I persuaded her, because he needed somebody to be...he slept in the studio by the Polish photographer.</span> <span id="s1337">He made us pictures.</span> <span id="s1338">One day...he survived with his sister and his child...this sister put, could pass for an Aryan, but the child not at all.</span> <span id="s1339">Was five-year-old girl.</span> <span id="s1340">One day when I was still working in the casino, the sister came running, crying.</span> <span id="s1341">And you know, there was a guard at the door.</span> <span id="s1342">Not everybody...you...could enter the club.</span> <span id="s1343">They asked for me.</span> <span id="s1344">I came.</span> <span id="s1345">She said I'm Julia, Barchowski's sister.</span> <span id="s1346">He was caught.</span> <span id="s1347">And I cannot stay where I stay and I cannot sustain myself.</span> <span id="s1348">What could I do?</span> <span id="s1349">So I went to the boss and I asked him if he can give a job to Julia, also as a chambermaid.</span> <span id="s1350">Was dangerous, crowding again...two Jewess and you don't know how she will behave.</span> <span id="s1351">And about her daughter.</span> <span id="s1352">I went to Kashia .</span> <span id="s1353">She was really a nice girl.</span> <span id="s1354">I said Kashia, your mother has seven children.</span> <span id="s1355">Would she take on Julia's niece, Barchowski's daughter and Julia will pay you with her salary.</span> <span id="s1356">After a month, her mother accepted the good little girl.</span> <span id="s1357">The Polish police recognized that she is Jewish and the mother writes a letter to Kashia...what did you do to me?</span> <span id="s1358">You sent me a Jewish child.</span> <span id="s1359">So Julia was in danger.</span> <span id="s1360">I was in danger and the mother.</span> <span id="s1361">Luckily the police took pity on the little girl and she...he said to the mother, I'm not sure she is, but I'll let her stay in your place.</span> <span id="s1362">The father survived.</span> <span id="s1363">Barchowski survived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1364">He came back to Israel.</span> <span id="s1365">We met him after the war.</span> <span id="s1366">The sister survived.</span> <span id="s1367">I had little trouble with the sister, because she like to drink a little bit, and it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1368">I really...the last two months maybe also persuaded me to leave, and the little girl survived, who's now married, lives in Israel, has family.</span> <span id="s1369">So we really tried to help each other.</span> <span id="s1370">Now after I met my husband, he was very busy at that time uh because they're managing to take care of many Germans who were...and naturally he supplied me with food, with everything.</span> <span id="s1371">But what only...what he supplied not only me...he gave me clothes because this was the time in May when the Jews, slave laborers came out from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1372">Tattered stripe...what they had there, the or what.</span> <span id="s1373">He gave me clothes that he took from the Germans, that he conf...confiscated from the German apartment.</span> <span id="s1374">I should give it out.</span> <span id="s1375">Then there were many orphans that Jews started collecting them, you know, who survived, looked, some knew where they have hidden their children, and one Jewess, although she converted, , she took care of the children.</span> <span id="s1376">But she didn't have food to feed them, not to dress them.</span> <span id="s1377">And it came to my husband's attention and he was able to supply them.</span> <span id="s1378">What we didn't know...at that time my husband was a high official in the Polish government in Krakow...so this , brought the children to Israel and she put his name, under the name that he was known at that time.</span> <span id="s1379">It's a problem.</span> <span id="s1380">So then he got a death sentence because he also searched for the , the ones that wanted to poison him, that were so anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1381">So I arr...I was able to arrange for him a transfer to another city.</span> <span id="s1382">But meantime I wanted to study medicine.</span> <span id="s1383">I didn't have any papers, so I have to take exam that dismiss me from the whole subjects and he had connections and I was accepted in Krakow but he was transferred to Breslau, so I dropped it.</span> <span id="s1384">I went with him to Breslau and I saw that this is under a satellite of Russia.</span> <span id="s1385">I didn't survive the war to be cut off again from my family.</span> <span id="s1386">Even my husband with high position, I felt I'm a queen for one night.</span> <span id="s1387">This is not for me.</span> <span id="s1388">So I told my husband I don't want to stay.</span> <span id="s1389">We survived.</span> <span id="s1390">We have to go to Palestine, and my husband wanted to fight, at that time to join the Jewish , to be able to fight for Israel.</span> <span id="s1391">He couldn't obtain a legal permission to leave.</span> <span id="s1392">He was told the only way he can leave or he'll be sent to Siberia or he should shoot himself.</span> <span id="s1393">The confidential (ph), the high position he had, he knows too many secrets.</span> <span id="s1394">So I arranged for him...it's a long story...an escape and he escaped and then I escaped with his brother.</span> <span id="s1395">I wanted with him, but his brother who survived with him decided that I have to stay with him, he should be able to liquidate the business which was not my place with the brother, only with my husband, but he was young.</span> <span id="s1396">This was an older brother sixteen years, so he listened.</span> <span id="s1397">I stayed.</span> <span id="s1398">They kept us as hostages waiting for my husband to return to look for me.</span> <span id="s1399">Luckily one Jew who know not my husband and me, learned about it, so he guaranteed for me because they just kept me.</span> <span id="s1400">I was in jail, but there was no sentence for me.</span> <span id="s1401">They just wanted him come to...for me and to catch him...</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Who was keeping you in jail?</span></p> <p><span
