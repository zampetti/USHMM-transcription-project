Liebmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Where were your born?</span> <span id="s18">I was--</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was born in Mannheim, Germany, on September 3, 1921.</span> <span id="s20">Q: Tell me about your parents and your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: My father was – had a -- was in his own business.</span> <span id="s22">He and his brother had a textile representation business.</span> <span id="s23">They represented a -- what is called here, a converter of textile goods.</span> <span id="s24">They had one of the largest -- or the largest European weaver of textile goods and before ’33 -- they also had some Czech clothes -- cloth firms, and eventually, after 1933, and a few other companies which I can't remember.</span> <span id="s25">And after 1933, in particularly, after 1934, when my father's partner which was his brother had a stroke and could no longer work, my father remained with two companies which stayed with him until they could no longer employ him, due to Nazi legislation.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s27">Would -- did you remain in Mannheim all this time?</span> <span id="s28">A: I was in Mannheim 'til I was deported in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s30">Tell me then about growing up in this family in Mannheim, Germany -- the first 10 years of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: The first 10 years were very -- basically very uneventful.</span> <span id="s32">I was told I grew in the midst of the inflation and my parents were middle or upper-middle class and my childhood was very uneventful.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: What kind of schools did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I went first in 1928, I started public school.</span> <span id="s35">In Germany, you go to public school for four years and then you switch to high school.</span> <span id="s36">In l9 -- when I was about 8, in 1930.</span> <span id="s37">I started with cello lessons and in 1932, I switched from public school to what was called RealgymnasiumThe Realgymnasium is something which I don't think we have here.</span> <span id="s38">You start -- in your first year, you start with Latin, then in the third year, you get, in addition to Latin, you get French and in the fourth year, in addition to Latin and French, we got English.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">01:03:00 And I went to school until I decided at the end of December 1937 that it makes no more sense for me to continue school.</span> <span id="s40">When I quit school, I was sent in the what was called ObertertiaI would have had three more years to go to make -- to graduate, which was called in Germany abiturObviously, everything changed with the advent of Hitler and I have memories that there were the emergency police running around the city in their car -- in their automobiles because they were always demonstrations and counter-demonstrations.</span> <span id="s41">We had a balcony where I could watch this very clearly.</span> <span id="s42">We were living on a fairly important thoroughfare.</span> <span id="s43">School became more difficult with the advent of Hitler.</span> <span id="s44">I think it was in the second or third grade of high school -- I was about 11 or 12 when the taunting started.</span> <span id="s45">And it was harmless -- it wasn't badly meant, but it was grinding, because it went on and it went on and it went on.</span> <span id="s46">So, in the school I went to, there was a custom that each -- each class every other year goes together into a youth hostel for three days to play football -- to play soccer, and generally to have a good time.</span> <span id="s47">And I picked this particular time to have a fight with one of the guys who were taunting me and I beat him up.</span> <span id="s48">I picked one I could handle.</span> <span id="s49">And from that moment on, there was peace, not only for me, but also for my other three Jewish classmates.</span> <span id="s50">We were four Jews in my class.</span> <span id="s51">I had basically no problem with the exception of one altercation I had with a -- with my German professor.</span> <span id="s52">He was a member of the party, if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s53">He -- one day we had to write a paper about how we could contribute to the Four Year Plan.</span> <span id="s54">That was an economic plan which Göringwas supervising.</span> <span id="s55">And when I got the paper back, I got a bad mark with a note that I must have copied this out of a newspaper or a magazine.</span> <span id="s56">So I didn't let this sit.</span> <span id="s57">Challenged him to show me where I copied it from.</span> <span id="s58">Unbeknownst to me, I used American style, “you're innocent until proven guilty.”</span> <span id="s59">And eventually he had to change the mark.</span> <span id="s60">He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">01:06:04</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: At the end of December of 1937 we were only two Jewish boys left in my class and very few other Jews in the whole school, and I decided it made no sense to stay in school .</span> <span id="s64">I -- I knew I would never go to a university in Germany.</span> <span id="s65">It became more and more difficult, so I told my parents, "Enough is enough.</span> <span id="s66">I want out. "</span> <span id="s67">And I started -- then we compromised and in the 1 Liberal arts high school (German) 2 The sixth grade level in German Gymnasiums (German) 3 High school graduation examination (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s68">4 Hermann Göring beginning of 19-- immediately at the first few days of 1938, I went into a private, commercial language school where I had French and I had English.</span> <span id="s69">I learned German, stenojust to keep me busy.</span> <span id="s70">After all, in 1930 -- at the beginning of ‘38, I was just 17 years old -- not -- no -- l6 years old.</span> <span id="s71">And I went to school there until the famous Crystal Nightof 1938 which was the end of school and basically for all German-Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Can we slow down for just a minute?</span> <span id="s73">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">01:07:30</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: You talk about your experiences as a Jew.</span> <span id="s76">What was your household like in terms of Jewishness?</span> <span id="s77">Was there observance?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: We were not observant Jews in the -- in the sense that there was a kosher household or any such thing.</span> <span id="s79">My father belonged to a Gesangsverienwhich is a singing organization which is very customary in, in Germany.</span> <span id="s80">This one happened to be the Jewish one.</span> <span id="s81">And my father was a member of that Board of Directors since almost immediately after World War I. Incidentally, my father was a soldier in World War I and was a veteran of front service, which permitted me actually to stay -- to stay in high school as long as did, because I believe in 1936 or 1935 already, the children of non-veterans were legislated out of public schools.</span> <span id="s82">So, no we -- I mean we never -- my father also was a member of the legislative body of the Jewish community of Mannheim so there was never a question of where we belonged or where we were, but we did not per se be practicing Jews that we went regularly to temple.</span> <span id="s83">I mean I was Bar Mitzvah, of course, my father would make an appearance as a member of the legislative counsel at least once a year in the temple on, on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s84">I went a few – I went a number of times on Saturday morning more for social reasons than any other reasons -- we would meet with our friends.</span> <span id="s85">And, of course, we had every Friday night, there were -- a different meal with the German version of challah which is called BerchesAnd so we were, of course -- obviously it was not a matter of denying that we were Jews.</span> <span id="s86">We were Jews, but there was no practice -- practicing Judaism.</span> <span id="s87">We would not light a home candles for Hanukkah or would have a Seder, not withstanding the fact that for -- for these days, I always went to my uncle and my aunt, my -- the sister of my mother had no children of her own and until they immigrated in 1930 -- early in ‘34 to Palestine, I was there on all these holidays like Pesach, etceteras, etceteras.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">01:10:00</span></p> <p><span id="s89">5 stenography</span></p> <p><span id="s90">6 Kristallnacht 7 glee club (German) 8 German-Jewish braided holiday bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s92">Okay.</span> <span id="s93">Thank you.</span> <span id="s94">By November, then, of 1938, you were a young 17 year old.</span> <span id="s95">You were going into this special school waiting for something.</span> <span id="s96">What happened as we -- I am sorry -- as we approach Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s98">No, that is okay.</span> <span id="s99">Since my father was very active in -- in this what originally started out for 80 or 90 years as a singing organization, was converted in 1933 or 1934, into what was referred to as a Jewish cultural organization.</span> <span id="s100">And since we were excluded from everything which had to do with culture, we had our own.</span> <span id="s101">In addition to the cause which was a mixed choir, there was an orchestra added, and by the time I was 14 or 15, I was in the orchestra and we did all kinds of opera, opera performances, oratorios.</span> <span id="s102">And all this, of course, stopped with the event in of -- at Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s103">Incidentally my father at the time of Crystal Night was in Greece.</span> <span id="s104">His -- one of his companies where he was always the number one salesman, suggested to him since they couldn't employ him anymore in Germany, if he wouldn’t want to try to build an existence in Greece.</span> <span id="s105">We'll come back to this a little later.</span> <span id="s106">Let's do it chron--chronologically.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Just a point of confusion.</span> <span id="s108">You used the word “converted” to a Jewish cultural organization.</span> <span id="s109">I wonder if that's what you meant or if you where thinking of the Jewish ethical society.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: No.</span> <span id="s111">No.</span> <span id="s112">No.</span> <span id="s113">I didn't mean the conversion as a -- in a religious sense.</span> <span id="s114">Q: Okay, I mean, to be clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: I meant it, it used to be a it used to be simply an organization where an orchestra was -- the local orchestra was hired and they would sing concerts.</span> <span id="s116">Now we added on a an orchestra and it became a self-sustaining, Jewish cultural organization, where culture was continued parallel to whatever we were able to do with restrictions obviously.</span> <span id="s117">We were not permitted to do German composers.</span> <span id="s118">We had to restrict ourselves to either foreign composers or Jewish composers so we could not perform after 1934, I think, or ’35 -- Bach was out.</span> <span id="s119">But we did do Orpheus and Eurydice, by Gluck.</span> <span id="s120">We were permitted to do an Offenbachopera -- operetta.</span> <span id="s121">We did Judas, Judas Maccabaeus, by Handeland things like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">01:13:04</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: What happened as we moved toward Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Crystal Night, I went to school.</span> <span id="s125">This is a commercial school where I went like on every day, and it seems to be I walked on that day.</span> <span id="s126">Why I walked and didn't use a bicycle, I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s127">But I walked.</span> <span id="s128">And I did not really see much of mobs because I was in school at eight o'clock.</span> <span id="s129">I saw something which struck me funny.</span> <span id="s130">I didn't give it a second thought.</span> <span id="s131">I 9 Christoph Willibald Gluck 10 Jacques (nee Jacob) Offenbach 11 George Frideric Handel went to school and around nine or nine-thirty, the telephone I was called by the directress and was told, "Your mother has called.</span> <span id="s132">You should leave school immediately, and you should go to Heidelberg and you should wait in Heidelberg for your cousin who will come separately and you will spend the day in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s133">When I called home to find out what was going on, I was told, "Don't ask so many stupid questions.</span> <span id="s134">Just go to Heidelberg and call me tonight."</span> <span id="s135">So Heidelberg being only 10 miles from Mannheim, I walked myself over from the school to the.</span> <span id="s136">.</span> <span id="s137">railway station which was only a 10 minute walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">01:15:00 And on the way I started to realize what was going on in the city.</span> <span id="s139">I saw furniture being thrown out of windows and people being arrested, but since I didn't look Jewish in their sense, nobody bothered me.</span> <span id="s140">So I went to the railroad station, bought a ticket to Heidelberg, and 15 minutes later was in Heidelberg where I met my cousin and we spent the day in the famous Heidelberg woods, walking and there seems to be a -- a faint memory that we were supposed to touch base with a -- I don't know if it was a far relative of my grandmother or just friends.</span> <span id="s141">In any case they were of Czech nationality and we were supposed to touch base there to see what was going on and I arranged -- we agreed with my cousin that this would take place around -- after four o’clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s142">So we walked in the woods, and my cousin got very nervous and wanted to come down much earlier.</span> <span id="s143">However, I said, "No.</span> <span id="s144">We, we said -- we agreed it was four o’clock.</span> <span id="s145">We are not going to change the date.”</span> <span id="s146">Which was very fortunate because by the time I -- we got there or shortly after four o'clock, the man had been arrested.</span> <span id="s147">If we would have gotten there earlier, we would have probably been arrested to.</span> <span id="s148">So we continued walking around in Heidelberg and when I called my mother at seven o’clock, she said she thinks the worst is over.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">01:17:00 We should come home.</span> <span id="s150">Now let me add there that in the beginning of 1938, since nobody knew how long we would have to stay in Germany or would be in Germany, my father was gone and there was no income coming we had given up our own apartment and had moved in with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s151">My grandmother happened to be a French citizen which is a story in itself which came about shortly after the war.</span> <span id="s152">She wanted to go to Mannheim's twin city, Ludwigshafen.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: You mean after World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: After World War I. And when she came -- she was on the trolley car and when she came to the rail to the bridge across the Rhine to Lugwigshafen, the French had blocked passage for the day.</span> <span id="s155">They did this on occasion.</span> <span id="s156">And so my Grandmother descended from the trolley car and was trying to force her way across the bridge.</span> <span id="s157">She called the watch commander and explained to him that she is born before the Franco-Prussian War in 1970in the Alsace and 12 The interviewee later corrects this date to 1870.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">therefore, by rights, she is French.</span> <span id="s159">And the man happened to be a lawyer and explained to her that in order to become a French citizen again, she would simply have to apply for what was called reinstatement of some kind -- I forgot the French word right now -- which she did .</span> <span id="s160">Therefore my Grandmother in 1920 or ‘21 -- my mother always told the stories at -- during World War I, there were no political discussion in her house because my grandmother, not withstanding the fact that her future son-in-law was a German soldier and her husband was a German -- was always a French patriot.</span> <span id="s161">So my Grandmother then applied for reinstatement and became a French citizen.</span> <span id="s162">So in 1938, on Crystal Night day, which was November 10th, when the destruction took place, my mother called the French consulate when the SA started to smash in the back loft where my grandmother had commercial space rented out to a Jewish store who sold glass -- glass fixtures, electrical glass fixtures.</span> <span id="s163">And this was smashed to millions of bits and when my mother called -- my mother called the French Consulate because after all the apartment was in the name of my grandmother -- was a large apartment -- in order to protect the apartment from destruction.</span> <span id="s164">And within five or 10 minutes an SA man in uniform came, stopped the carnage in the back loft and was posted there all day long in order to protect my grandfather's apartment who was after all a French citizen.</span> <span id="s165">So I came home in, in the evening.</span> <span id="s166">Without a doubt the apartment was destroyed, but I do remember that one or two days after the 10th of November, I went to Ludwigshafen to help a former member of the orchestra straighten out her apartment which was in, in pitiful shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">01:21:00 After Crystal Night 1938, I spent 1939 basically doing nothing.</span> <span id="s168">There was nothing I could do.</span> <span id="s169">I was reading a book a day and then war broke out.</span> <span id="s170">Now I think we should come back to my father.</span> <span id="s171">In March of 1938, my father went to Greece, and after a few months was able to start selling his company's goods again which did not sit too well with the German competition.</span> <span id="s172">And when they figured out in 1939 who was behind their loss of business which went to another firm, they managed to get my father expelled from Greece.</span> <span id="s173">My father went, I think in May, from Greece to Italy.</span> <span id="s174">In fact, my mother visited him in August of 1939 in Italy.</span> <span id="s175">She had a passport.</span> <span id="s176">We all had passports.</span> <span id="s177">And at that time was so convinced that nobody would be insane enough to start another war -- this was in August of 1939 -- that she came back home and instead of calling me who also had a passport to join her in Italy, so the family would have been reunited.</span> <span id="s178">So my mother came home second my father illegally went from Ventimiglia to Nice, across country on a boat -- on a little boat around the border and, of course, did all the things other people did who came in illegally.</span> <span id="s179">He was in jail for a few weeks, and then he lived precariously in the Nice until he was accidentally until he ran into a German patrol accidentally in, in 1944, and was deported.</span> <span id="s180">My mother came back home and on first of September 1939, World War Two broke out.</span> <span id="s181">The first thing which happened was that we were called to a Wehrmachtoffice where we were mustered out of the army for being Jewish.</span> <span id="s182">In other words, we could not serve.</span> <span id="s183">We were not -- it was, it was not dignified for Jews to serve in the German, army.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">13 Sturmabteilung [storm troopers] (German) 14 Armed forces (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Had he been admitted to the German army.</span> <span id="s186">01:24:00</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: No.</span> <span id="s188">We had not been admitted to the German army, but we were mobilized like everybody else and had to present ourself in a separate little office and these soldiers were very nice about it and -- but of course, we, we were not mobilized.</span> <span id="s189">Then in -- that was in the middle of September.</span> <span id="s190">Shortly after that, I was required to perform how would you call this, harvesting service in East Germany.</span> <span id="s191">That was east of Frank--Frankfurt on the Oder.</span> <span id="s192">It was very far away in those days, it was a trip overnight through Berlin and then to Frankfurt on the Oder, and I was in a small village.</span> <span id="s193">We were quartered in the hall where you normally would have weddings.</span> <span id="s194">There were they installed platforms where we could sleep on.</span> <span id="s195">There were about 30 or 40 young people of Jewish -- German Jews, and we helped farmers harvest the sugar beets and potatoes.</span> <span id="s196">I don't know how much we harvested, but I can assure you every time I hit a -- I made an effort to hit into every potato and every sugar beet I had to dig out.</span> <span id="s197">And what was traumatic about this was not that we had to do this, but in Germany, there's a law, on the -- was on the books, probably still on the books -- that when you move from one location to the other, you have to go to the local police precinct and notify them you are going from here to there, so that your records are maintained and, of course, my mother probably worried that if, when I would -- when I come back, there would be trouble.</span> <span id="s198">But when we were there six weeks and when I came back, there was no trouble.</span> <span id="s199">I just registered again I am back.</span> <span id="s200">That was the end of it.</span> <span id="s201">Then my mother was able to arrange that in on January the third, I think, or second, immediately after the first of the year in -- of 1940, I started to work at the HilfsvereinThe Hilfsverein was an organization set up by the National Representation of German Jews in Berlin to assist people with their immigration problems and since America was still out of the war at that time, there was -- Jews still could immigrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">01:27:00 German Jews were still able to immigrate to the United States or to Cuba so we had a very busy office and I was working there as a volun--volunteer secretary until we were deported.</span> <span id="s203">And in order to be able to work there, I had to travel to Berlin to present myself to the chief of this organization.</span> <span id="s204">In the Jewish ReichsvertretungYou know the German Jews had their own organization who represented the Jews with the vis à vis the government and I traveled at night from Mannheim to Berlin, presented myself in the morning to the chief -- was a man with a beard whose name I don't remember anymore -- and traveled back the same night from Berlin -- the next, next night from Berlin back to Mannheim which was not very pleasant because my mother decided I should travel second class.</span> <span id="s205">It would be more 15 Hilfsverein der Deutschen Juden [German Jews’ Aid Society](German) 16 Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutschland [Reich Representation of Jews in Germany](German) comfortable since I would not sleep for two nights and all I had in the compartment were either officers of the army or SSofficers who were traveling – it wasn't very funny.</span> <span id="s206">But you know I did what my father always did when my father was traveling, as long as he was traveling and working until the end of 1937.</span> <span id="s207">He always had Nazi newspapers, so I did the same thing.</span> <span id="s208">I had Nazi newspapers and they left, no--nobody bothered me.</span> <span id="s209">So nothing much happened in 1940, until on October 21st around 10 o'clock the telephone ran in the office and the chief of my office was at the same time the representative of the Mannheim Jewish community with regard to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s210">So at 10 o'clock around the telephone rang.</span> <span id="s211">The Gestapo was on the phone -- he should come down immediately, which he did.</span> <span id="s212">He had weekly contact with them.</span> <span id="s213">He probably had to report to them on -- on the state of immigration and how people you know people -- we were still able to get a lot of people out.</span> <span id="s214">And in fact my own cousin was able to leave through Russia, went to Japan, and managed to get into San Francisco before the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s215">So he was lucky.</span> <span id="s216">The head of this office came back and told us, "We're going to close up now.</span> <span id="s217">We are going to be deported tomorrow to France."</span> <span id="s218">And he went upstairs to notify the president of the Mannheim Jewish community.</span> <span id="s219">And so eventually around noon, we closed up the community offices.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">We went home.</span> <span id="s221">When I came home, I said to my mother, "We are going to pack now because we're going to be sent to France tomorrow."</span></p> <p><span id="s222">01:30:00 And my mother was totally -- couldn't believe this.</span> <span id="s223">So I started to pull out suitcases, started to put stuff together which I wanted to take along and when she saw I was really dead serious about it, she finally -- half-heartedly believed that what I was saying was true, and then after dark, at night, a -- we had a man who worked for us, bringing up coal from the basement, when we lived in our own apartment.</span> <span id="s224">And he came at night surreptitiously, to tell us that he had heard from his friends at the police, that we would be deported tomorrow to France.</span> <span id="s225">And then she finally believed it.</span> <span id="s226">Unfortunately, why we couldn't -- we were not able to communicate with our friends because telephones were no longer an item for Jewish families after 1939.</span> <span id="s227">So we packed and indeed, the next morning the Gestapo rang around eight o'clock and told us that we were arrested and in the name of the people, we should pack what we should take and they would pick us up in a hour which was really two and a half or three hours.</span> <span id="s228">So they -- the people were fairly decent.</span> <span id="s229">They gave many people enough time to pack, half-way reasonably.</span> <span id="s230">They explained we should take stuff along which was warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">We were allowed to take what we can carry, plus 100 marks, plus I believe food for two or three days.</span> <span id="s232">They came.</span> <span id="s233">They picked us up.</span> <span id="s234">We were brought to I think it was a railroad station and then we were loaded into passenger trains no less and this was an action which related to all German Jews in Baden, in the State of Baden, and the Palatinate; the two Nazi officials who -- or the Nazi official who was responsible for these two states wanted to be one of he first ones to report that he has no more Jews in his state.</span> <span id="s235">So we were loaded.</span> <span id="s236">We, we went into this special train, and it was one of seven trains which, if I remember right which was to go to France and shortly before we departed, an SS officer appeared in our car 17 Schutzstaffeln [Protection Squads] (German) -- why he came to our car I don't know, was haphazardly -- and picked out a man who wore in his lapel a sign which identified him as a, a German war veteran of World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">01:33:00 He appointed him chief of the train.</span> <span id="s238">So when the train left, we went first through the Alsace in Mulhouse the SS appeared, threatening us and changing -- exchanging our money and telling us that if any money would be found on anybody in excess; of the 100 marks, we were permitted to take the person -- people would be arrested and shot.</span> <span id="s239">But nobody -- they never searched anybody, and there were indeed probably a number of people who gambled and had more money on them.</span> <span id="s240">So our 100 marks were exchanged for 2000 French francs and then we went on.</span> <span id="s241">We came to Lyon and apparently, we were the first train so when in Lyon, the French gendarmarie which was at the station looked for some spokesman.</span> <span id="s242">The man who was appointed the transport chief identified himself and asked me to translate because he didn't speak French.</span> <span id="s243">So it turned out these -- the French were not notified by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">They were -- the French were told that there are Alsatians coming who don't want to stay under the German rule.</span> <span id="s245">But that was all they were told.</span> <span id="s246">They didn't know numbers.</span> <span id="s247">They didn't know that this was a lie.</span> <span id="s248">They were dumbfounded when they found that there were German Jews in this train and this was one train and, of course, they didn't know there were six others coming.</span> <span id="s249">So they gave us some food, and then the trains went on.</span> <span id="s250">Actually, we were deported on the 22nd and we got to Oloron, which is the closest railroad station to the camp on the 25th, so we were three days in this train and we came -- we arrived in Oloron in a down pour which was unbelievable and we were put on trucks and taken to camp, which turned out to be Camp de Gurs.</span> <span id="s251">For identification purposes, let's say that Camp de Gurs is in the south of France about 40 or 60 miles from the Spanish border.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Could you describe your arrival in Gurs please?</span> <span id="s253">01:36:15</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: At Gurs we -- when we unloaded in front of the camp, it was still raining.</span> <span id="s255">And so it was -- I believe it was evening, and so we were taken into the camp and distributed into a camp block, 30 or 40 people into one block.</span> <span id="s256">All we found was an empty barracks.</span> <span id="s257">All the barracks were empty.</span> <span id="s258">There was some straw and they gave us empty covers and we had to do -- we had to fill them to have a straw mattress.</span> <span id="s259">And the ground in Gurs is -- I don't know how to describe it.</span> <span id="s260">There was very little there were -- there was one central street.</span> <span id="s261">The camp incidentally was built by -- by the Spanish for the Spanish refugees.</span> <span id="s262">And so we were dumped into these barracks and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s263">There was a -- at the beginning we had milit-- paramilitary gendarmeries there who guarded us and, of course, men and women were separated.</span> <span id="s264">It took awhile to sort out where everybody was, but eventually we found out where -- where our -- the members of our families were.</span> <span id="s265">I was deported with my mother and Incidentally, my grandmother had to leave Germany abruptly on September 1, 1939, because she was a French citizen.</span> <span id="s266">She tried to get into Switzerland where she had a sister, but Switzerland had imposed visa requirements and she couldn't go into Switzerland so she ended up in an old age home in Nancy and eventually she went to Bordeaux.</span> <span id="s267">And from Bordeaux she joined my father in Nice and eventually she set up household with him in Nice, and she died in Nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">01:38:10</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: How old was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: My grandmother was born on January 27, 1970, so she was about -- Q: 1870?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: 1870.</span> <span id="s272">So she was she was about 73 or 74.</span> <span id="s273">I think 73.</span> <span id="s274">Q: Let's come back to you -- to Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Well, the beginning, of course, was very chaotic.</span> <span id="s276">We didn't -- and the first night, we didn't even have our luggage.</span> <span id="s277">The luggage was brought the next morning.</span> <span id="s278">It was just dumped in the rain and we had to pull our -- you know, it was lying in a big pile and he had to find our luggage.</span> <span id="s279">And which I did for both myself and my mother.</span> <span id="s280">And so my mother was in one block and I was in the other, and there was nothing to do, of course.</span> <span id="s281">We could not get out of the block.</span> <span id="s282">And I was here and my mother was a few hundred yards further north in another block with the women.</span> <span id="s283">And by the time all of the transports had finally arrived there were over 7,000 or 8,000 people in the, in the camp for which the authorities had, of course, very little advance warning because nobody knew we were coming.</span> <span id="s284">Well, eventually things settled down.</span> <span id="s285">Every time it rained people would fall in the mud, particularly the old people.</span> <span id="s286">The food was abominable.</span> <span id="s287">We had very little to eat.</span> <span id="s288">The French had nothing to eat, so we had even less.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">01:40:00 And since a friend of my father was the vice chief of the block where I was in, I managed eventually to get myself occupied by working in the office in the -- each block had its own administrative office and I managed to work in the office.</span> <span id="s290">The one advantage of this was that it was warm.</span> <span id="s291">There was no heating material, but the offices had, of course, more heat so during the day I was reasonably warm while I was working there.</span> <span id="s292">And periodically, maybe once or twice a week, you managed to get enough -- a pass to visit members of your family in the other block and my mother worked in the block office where she was because the woman who was picked as the chief of the block had only one qualification.</span> <span id="s293">She spoke fluent French.</span> <span id="s294">She was probably the only one who spoke as fluent as French as she did.</span> <span id="s295">My mother spoke French obviously, so she managed to be this woman who spoke so fluent French managed to become the block head of the block which had benefits.</span> <span id="s296">You had a barrack.</span> <span id="s297">At night the barrack was yours.</span> <span id="s298">She had alone -- she lived alone in this big barrack which during the day was the office and somehow or other, all of the block chiefs ate better or most of them.</span> <span id="s299">They just took food out of the kitchen and life settled down.</span> <span id="s300">There wasn't very much to do.</span> <span id="s301">Eventually I managed -- we managed to get musical instruments and we started to play a quartet and in this respect, I must say, the French administration, who really showed not very much sympathy organized to have one barrack in each block as a cultural, as a cultural barrack so you had lectures.</span> <span id="s302">We gave concerts, and for me it was very good because the moment I was a part of a quartet, I had a permanent pass and I could circulate in camp.</span> <span id="s303">And the instruments came from the YMCAwho, who were with other organizations very active in trying to ameliorate our fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: What instrument did you play?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: I played cello.</span> <span id="s306">I still do.</span> <span id="s307">I met my wife in camp.</span> <span id="s308">01:43:00</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Tell me about that meeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Oh, my wife worked in, in the -- she was a messenger, I believe, in the, in the office where my mother worked, so when -- I met her when I visited my mother.</span> <span id="s311">And eventually the Secours Suisseor rather the Swiss Red Cross who had sent a nurse -- Elsbeth Kasser, she is still alive -- set up in a barrack, breakfast for the young generation.</span> <span id="s312">And that was really -- I don't remember now if we got it once or if we got it daily or if we got it two or three times a week, but we got a supplementary feeding which helped many of us survive better.</span> <span id="s313">So, every morning I would come -- I would -- we were permitted, of course, to leave the -- the block for this.</span> <span id="s314">We would I would pick up my wife at the end of the -- her block.</span> <span id="s315">We would walk together to the barrack to have our food and come back, and I would see my wife every time when I obviously we weren't married then -- when I would visit my mother or if I came to visit to see her.</span> <span id="s316">We met in a -- I met her in, I think, it was December of 1940, so this is now 50 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: What kinds of things were you able to do during the day?</span> <span id="s318">Were you able to see your wife during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: No.</span> <span id="s320">We saw each other fairly frequently since I could circulate.</span> <span id="s321">She worked.</span> <span id="s322">I think she, she will tell you that herself.</span> <span id="s323">She was giving out mail.</span> <span id="s324">She was running errands.</span> <span id="s325">I worked in the office and she was able to leave well before me.</span> <span id="s326">She left in, I think, in September of ‘41.</span> <span id="s327">I am not sure about the date.</span> <span id="s328">She will tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: We'll take that up.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: You take that up with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">18 Young Men’s Christian Association 19 Swiss Aid (French)</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Let's pick up where you -- I am sorry.</span> <span id="s333">01:46:00</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I was still in my block.</span> <span id="s335">However, eventually the French authorities needed to stage an example on -- for everybody's benefit to limit corruption.</span> <span id="s336">By corruption I mean the two chiefs in my block and one chief's wife were really stealing food from the block and lived very well.</span> <span id="s337">And there were French inspectors who noticed this and eventually this became -- was very pervasive.</span> <span id="s338">I believe it was done in almost every block with the exception of one.</span> <span id="s339">And the French became concerned with this, so since other things happened about which I am not quite sure what happened.</span> <span id="s340">They caught them in all kinds of unethical things.</span> <span id="s341">They decided to stage an example and to get rid of these people, the block was dissolved.</span> <span id="s342">And one morning before some movement of people started, the redistribution of our entire block to other blocks started.</span> <span id="s343">The French inspector who was responsible for our block, stood in front of me and asked me if I would do a job for him.</span> <span id="s344">The job was I had to inventory -- do the inventory for the whatever little equipment there was.</span> <span id="s345">Which I did.</span> <span id="s346">It was my first experience with inventory.</span> <span id="s347">Little did I know that in my later life, inventory would play a big role because in accounting, inventory is a very important feature.</span> <span id="s348">And so when this was done and I had given him all the lists and all the equipment, He said to me, "I will thank you in kind.</span> <span id="s349">I will take care of you."</span> <span id="s350">Now I don't have something for you at the moment."</span> <span id="s351">He knew I was working at the office, of course.</span> <span id="s352">Otherwise, I wouldn't have gotten that job.</span> <span id="s353">"But I will take care of you."</span> <span id="s354">So I was put into really a terrible block mostly with people who were not from the group of German Jews who were other people who were interned there.</span> <span id="s355">And I was there about three weeks, very unhappy.</span> <span id="s356">Fortunately, I had my pass and I could get out when I wanted to get out to see my mother and….</span> <span id="s357">Well, one day three weeks later, he stood again in front of me, "I haven't forgotten you.</span> <span id="s358">I have a job for you.</span> <span id="s359">We'll move you to the hospital and you can do the office in the hospital."</span> <span id="s360">This was a very privileged position because I shared the -- the room.</span> <span id="s361">I had a room in a barrack, but it was a room with a door with our own stove with a bed.</span> <span id="s362">Had only a straw mattress, but it was a bed while we slept basically on little wooden platforms which the Spanish refugees had made for us for money with barbed wire where the barbs were taken out and the wire was used as, as a mattress support.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">01:49:00 So there I had a hospital bed.</span> <span id="s364">We could light a fire in the evening during the day and I shared the room with a man who was really responsible for -- he was really the, the block chief for the hospital to the extent that this was necessary.</span> <span id="s365">This was basically the job of accompanying really sick people who had to be evacuated to a hospital to ride the ambulance daily back and forth to either Oloron, which was the closest point to a doctor or to the hospital in Pau.</span> <span id="s366">And eventually I also was able to commute once in awhile out of the camp and with the ambulance, breathe some fresh air.</span> <span id="s367">In retrospect, of course, it was stupid I never took my mother along.</span> <span id="s368">I -- if I would have taken my mother along and gone with her to Pau, we could have managed probably to escape and join my father in Nice.</span> <span id="s369">But being Germans, it never occurred to us.</span> <span id="s370">Eventually in -- I was approached or my mother was approached -- if I could leave -- if there would apply -- a space some -- somewhere a place could be found for me if I would be permitted to leave my mother and get -- to get out of camp and, of course, she consented to that.</span> <span id="s371">And so in probably in July of 1942 after 20 months I left camp with the same social worker who escorted Hanne and her group to Le Chambon, and was bought to Talluyers.</span> <span id="s372">Talluyers is a small village outside of Lyon.</span> <span id="s373">With me was one other young fellow about a year or a year and a half younger than I was.</span> <span id="s374">And the two of us were brought to a farm which was run by the Jewish Boy Scouts of France.</span> <span id="s375">It was a working farm.</span> <span id="s376">There were a lot of young people there.</span> <span id="s377">The one problem we had with the farm was neither he nor I were Orthodox and this was not an Orthodox farm, but an ultra-Orthodox farm.</span> <span id="s378">They didn't let us work too much because they knew we were so skinny, we couldn't have worked anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">And around the end of July, the very end of July, my girlfriend came from Gurs having obtained permission to visit her mother and I saw her then for the first time after about a year.</span> <span id="s380">And when she came back from the camp, she came again to tell me that her mother was deported.</span> <span id="s381">She could not enter camp.</span> <span id="s382">She will tell you that herself.</span> <span id="s383">And we arranged then and there that if there would be problems for me that I should try to make my way to where she was because she felt certain that there would be help for anybody who is up there in Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s384">Now, you must remember this was -- she was, of course, in 1942, she was just 17 and since people didn't talk about what was going on, it was just the feeling she had and she knew there would be help.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">01:53:00 What we didn't know was that about a week or two after she had left we -- an announcement was made by the management of the farm that they were notified that in about two weeks or two and a half weeks, there would be raids on the farm and all the foreign Jews would be arrested, which meant all of us, of course.</span> <span id="s386">But not to worry, that we would be helped by hiding.</span> <span id="s387">But when the time came to disperse everybody, help was indeed forthcoming for everybody but four of us -- my friend from Gurs and two other somewhat older young fellows who were not Orthodox -- we were told to help ourselves.</span> <span id="s388">What was interesting is that these people who were running the camp -- it was an Alsatian Jew and two Rabbis who - - because they are still alive I won't mention their names -- German Rabbis, who were in Gurs who are mentioned by name in, in -- as being very helpful while they were in Gurs -- in a book by Schrammabout her experiences in Gurs and but there was no help for us.</span> <span id="s389">We were told, "Do what you feel is right.</span> <span id="s390">Go wherever you want to go."</span> <span id="s391">And that was the end for that.</span> <span id="s392">So my friend and I from Gurs, Gurs, we went to Le Chambon, which wasn't so far away from there, because all we knew Hanne had explained to us, we leave to go to Saint Étienne and in Saint Étienne I believe there was a train going up to Le Chambon.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">01:55:00</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: On the camp management, well the camp -- I want to make sure this is clear.</span> <span id="s395">The camp</span></p> <p><span id="s396">20 Hanne Schramm management did take care of everybody except you four.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: The farm management.</span> <span id="s398">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Took care -- took care of all of the other people.</span> <span id="s400">In fact, I understand that most of these people today are in Israel, including the principals.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: What, what was the life like for you on that farm for those two or three weeks you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: It was probably 5, four or five weeks.</span> <span id="s403">I have a very hazy recollection.</span> <span id="s404">I really don't remember much.</span> <span id="s405">It was obviously much better than it was in camp but you know, I am not the one who is at ease in any farm.</span> <span id="s406">I am not the type.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Let's hold it for a moment and let us change tape.</span> <span id="s408">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">01:56:00</span></p> <p><span id="s410">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: …And you know, I have talked with other people about this and they really said that they're not surprised because the Germans are very rigid.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: What a minute.</span> <span id="s413">Hold on.</span> <span id="s414">Is the tape rolling again?</span> <span id="s415">We're back on for an hour?</span> <span id="s416">Okay.</span> <span id="s417">We're back on.</span> <span id="s418">Just one minute.</span> <span id="s419">I think we should finish this and we should finish this and I think we should finish it on the tape.</span> <span id="s420">Will you tell us on tape about the incident in New York please that you were describing to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s422">but to -- to finish up with the farm.</span> <span id="s423">We were -- Hanne and I and our daughter was in, in New York.</span> <span id="s424">We were in New York only a very short time, a few weeks.</span> <span id="s425">We were walking down Broadway, pushing the baby carriage when we ran into the two rabbis who were in Talluyers and whom al-- of course, we also knew from Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: These are the two rabbis who had refused to help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: These are the two rabbis who did, did nothing to help.</span> <span id="s428">And their reaction was actually very interesting because if they could have sunk into the earth to disappear when they saw us and we started to talk with them for a minute or two, they would have really disappeared because they visibly had a bad conscience when they saw us.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s430">Thank you.</span> <span id="s431">Alright.</span> <span id="s432">So you left the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: So, we left the farm early in the morning and by 10 o'clock at night, we were in the Le Chambon.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Did you have help in getting to Le Chambon?</span> <span id="s435">Q: No.</span> <span id="s436">We took, we took the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: We had a few francs, and we took the train to Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s439">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Well, it was 10 o'clock.</span> <span id="s441">Where I am going to find Hanne at 10 o'clock at night?</span> <span id="s442">I don't even know where she is.</span> <span id="s443">So, we decided we're going to sleep.</span> <span id="s444">There was a little wooded opening in the middle of nowhere, and we decided that we are going to put our sleeping bags down and we're going to sleep there.</span> <span id="s445">And we did.</span> <span id="s446">Around four-thirty, five o’clock, five-fifteen in the morning, we hear -- we had just woken up and we had just folded up our sleeping bags when we hear girls' voices passing on the path where we were in the in the little wood and who walked by?</span> <span id="s447">Hanne!</span> <span id="s448">With a few of the teenage girls who were with her in the little children's home in, in Le Chambon.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">02:03:00 And so I whistled after her because I had to run first to, to catch her and she absolutely refused to turn around.</span> <span id="s450">Her girlfriend, who knew me, saw me and tried to stop Hanne walking on and so eventually she physically turned her around.</span> <span id="s451">There was I was.</span> <span id="s452">So Hanne took us to Madame André Philipwho she apparently -- she knew her, and she figured she would be a logical person to, to help.</span> <span id="s453">So Mireille asked her only one question: Can she trust me?</span> <span id="s454">Hanne said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s455">He's my boyfriend."</span> <span id="s456">And so Madame Phillip took me to a villa where I stayed overnight and in the meantime, obviously, she had to find a place for me to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">And so the next night I walked about an hour and a half at night to a farm like the farms which are -- were shown on the movie by Pierre Sauvage, typical farm like this to a farmer whose name I don't know to this day.</span> <span id="s458">If I knew it, I forgot it but I don't know the name.</span> <span id="s459">Was a man, maybe in his late 40s.</span> <span id="s460">He looked old to me because he had a gray beard already, and his wife, and a teenage daughter and since farms, living spaces very restricted because most is given over to animals and to hay he put me into the hayloft, and I must say the man was very practical.</span> <span id="s461">The first thing he did, he cut a hole at the end of the hayloft into the where you would normally put a, a wagon or something.</span> <span id="s462">He put a hole there which led right down to the -- where the animals were so that I have -- would have my, my toilet or something.</span> <span id="s463">It was the first thing he did, took a saw and cut out the hole.</span> <span id="s464">And I spent three and a half weeks in the hayloft.</span> <span id="s465">I got my breakfast.</span> <span id="s466">I got my lunch, which I ate in the hayloft.</span> <span id="s467">They brought it.</span> <span id="s468">And I came down for dinner.</span> <span id="s469">I ate dinner with them in their kitchen.</span> <span id="s470">You know every night was a wonderful dinner for the times -- was potato soup with lard and milk poured into the soup and some vegetable.</span> <span id="s471">And what really these three and a half weeks with this farmer permitted me eventually to gain enough physical strength to get out of France through the mountains which wasn't so easy, was a physical, great physical exercise.</span> <span id="s472">In fact, the only literature I had in, in this hayloft for three and half was a New Testament.</span> <span id="s473">That's all he had in the house so he gave it to me and I read it.</span> <span id="s474">And I thought already, “They must have forgotten I am here.”</span> <span id="s475">I didn't hear from anybody.</span> <span id="s476">I didn't see anybody.</span> <span id="s477">I was totally alone with these farm people for three and a half weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: You didn't see Hanne?</span> <span id="s479">02:07:00</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: No, Hanne was -- in fact, Hanne during this period was hiding herself most of the time with another farmer because there were raids going on all over the so-called unoccupied zone of France and the people were being arrested and deported.</span> <span id="s481">So one day the farmer brought me a little note from Hanne so at least I knew, aside from hearing from Hanne, I knew that people knew where I was.</span> <span id="s482">And lo and behold a few days later at right somebody came to pick me up to bring me back to Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s483">I slept in the same villa where I was -- when I was</span></p> <p><span id="s484">21 Mireille Philip brought.</span> <span id="s485">The next day Madame Philip, and I saw Hanne, of course, who had come back at the same time too apparently, and Madame Philip explained to me that they are going to make photograph of me, giving me false papers and will help me to get across France to the French Alps and from there I would be helped into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s486">So they had -- the papers were made.</span> <span id="s487">I got them at night.</span> <span id="s488">And the next morning I set off with three other young fellows from, from Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s489">In a train, regular trains, we went across that portion of France into the French Alps and we stopped -- I don't remember the name of the place.</span> <span id="s490">One - - I believe it was one stop before Saint Gervais -- in the French Alps.</span> <span id="s491">There a 10 year old boy picked us up, brought us to the home of his father.</span> <span id="s492">We met there a, a young Protestant minister who was supposed to go with us when we would cross the mountains to learn the route so that he would help people later on go the same route.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">02:09:00 So the next morning we set off.</span> <span id="s494">Our guide was this 10 year old boy who knew these, these mountains like his back pocket.</span> <span id="s495">The priest and the four of us, the minister and the four of us and we climbed all day until it was night.</span> <span id="s496">We stayed -- it was raining at night -- we stayed under an overhang under a rock so we were dry and we -- I was even able to sleep even.</span> <span id="s497">And we continued the next day and sometimes maybe at eight o’clock, we started very early, and sometimes during the morning the boy said, "Now, from here on, you are on your own.”</span> <span id="s498">He explained to us where we had to go.</span> <span id="s499">He told us we would have to go down this mountain.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">We were about -- I don't now -- .</span> <span id="s501">somewhere around the 9,000 foot level probably, maybe a little less, maybe a little more, well above the tree line.</span> <span id="s502">He explained to us where we should go and said we would come into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s503">They also told us -- the minister told us, we should get rid of our false identification cards because they were afraid that if the Swiss find false papers on us, they might suspect an organized effort behind this and would immediately return us.</span> <span id="s504">Well we, we climbed most of the day down, eventually ended up on a highway which was totally deserted, and walked on this highway further down, descended through a tunnel and in the tunnel we were stopped by a patrol who had -- as they told us when they brought us back to the -- to a mountain hut where we found another 30 or 40 people which were gone during the day.</span> <span id="s505">They told us that they had watched for hours with their glasses coming down.</span> <span id="s506">The next morning we were, we were able to buy -- I had one or two Francs.</span> <span id="s507">It was enough to buy some breakfast in this mountain hut.</span> <span id="s508">All of us were told that we would be returned to France.</span> <span id="s509">We would not be kept.</span> <span id="s510">A detachment of soldiers started to bring us back up into what is -- what they called no man's land, from where we would descend again to France.</span> <span id="s511">Now we came into France -- into Switzerland, in the valley not far from Finhaut.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">02:12:00 I was able to determine this later where I was.</span> <span id="s513">And I managed also in the morning during breakfast to look at the map and I had somebody show me from the Swiss where we were.</span> <span id="s514">So I knew exactly where I was.</span> <span id="s515">So a detachment of soldier--soldiers took us back up into the mountains, well above the tree line again.</span> <span id="s516">And then something very extraordinary happened during this hike up the mountain.</span> <span id="s517">All of a sudden, a non-commissioned Swiss soldier started to scream at me and tiraded me for about 15 minutes, screamed at me what I'm not permitted to do: I'm not permitted to come back to Switzerland, I'm not permitted to do this, I am not permitted to do that.</span> <span id="s518">What the man really did in these 15 minutes, he laid out for me but exactly how to go back to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s519">All I had to do is subtract the word "not."</span> <span id="s520">The tragedy was that everybody in our group heard this.</span> <span id="s521">Nobody understood what this man was trying to do.</span> <span id="s522">So eventually the captain of -- of this detachment stopped and told us that they would stay here and we should go on.</span> <span id="s523">So the first thing I did was -- we went on.</span> <span id="s524">We went across a bend, around the bend, where I was sure the Swiss couldn't see us anymore.</span> <span id="s525">Then I stopped the whole group and I explained to them what just had transpired, and they had all heard it.</span> <span id="s526">And we argued this out for an hour and nobody understood -- had understood what this was all about and these people were so shaken that after an hour of talking with them, I finally found one person who was willing to see the -- my logic and my reasoning that we know what's down there and all we do is possibly waste another day, but we also may -- might save our lives.</span> <span id="s527">So this one fellow and I separated from the group, and the rest went down and I went back towards Switzerland.</span> <span id="s528">We crossed a little icy stream coming down, which was a glacier border, you know, but not further than a few like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">02:15:00 Was very narrow because it had only started a little further up, and we climbed further up and all of a sudden we were on a very, very narrow path and the fellow who was with me who didn't know really where he was -- an Austrian, I never saw him again after, after we separated in Switzerland -- wanted to go to the right and I wanted to go down to the left.</span> <span id="s530">And I said, “When -- look when you go to the right, you're going nowhere.</span> <span id="s531">You're going back to France possibly.”</span> <span id="s532">But in order to convince him, I said, "Alright.</span> <span id="s533">Let's walk to the right the way you want to walk because I am sure you will, will end up nowhere."</span> <span id="s534">And lo and behold, after five minutes, we were abruptly at the precipice down 1,000 or 3,000 feet, was nothing.</span> <span id="s535">So, he finally believed me and we turned around and we walked the same path.</span> <span id="s536">We came back and eventually this very narrow little path became wider and became wider, became a little road and we eventually came into a little village which was Finhaut.</span> <span id="s537">Now I had no Swiss money.</span> <span id="s538">He still had some.</span> <span id="s539">And we had been told in Le Chambon already that if we need help we should look for a Protestant minister.</span> <span id="s540">If there's no Protestant minister, go to the Catholic priest.</span> <span id="s541">They probably will help you.</span> <span id="s542">So I went to church, to the church.</span> <span id="s543">There was a church.</span> <span id="s544">Yeah, but the priest wasn't there.</span> <span id="s545">He was -- had gone into the valley for the day.</span> <span id="s546">So we went on and it became dusk.</span> <span id="s547">I didn't want to stay in Finhaut.</span> <span id="s548">It was too big for me.</span> <span id="s549">So it became eventually dark and we walked and we came through another few -- a village of maybe 10 or 15 houses and I looked around and I said, "I don't want to sleep in the open again tonight."</span> <span id="s550">I had slept two nights before in the open -- in the rain.</span> <span id="s551">So I picked a house which I thought looked friendly and just knocked at the door and a man peers out.</span> <span id="s552">I explained to him, "We are refuges.</span> <span id="s553">Could we stay over for the night?"</span> <span id="s554">And he said, Well, he's newly-wed.</span> <span id="s555">It's not his house.</span> <span id="s556">It's a house of his brother-in-law, but why don't we wait.</span> <span id="s557">“I'll, I'll ask him.”</span> <span id="s558">Well, after five minutes, he came back, "Come on in."</span> <span id="s559">They gave us food.</span> <span id="s560">They gave us a bedroom.</span> <span id="s561">They gave us breakfast the next morning and they explained to us where we were and where we should go, so we walked most of the day and, and he also told us not to go to Martigny -- which was the next larger place -- because Martigny was a garrison city with military police all over.</span> <span id="s562">So -- and military all over.</span> <span id="s563">We would probably get, get stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">02:18:00 So we went to -- he showed us a way how to go to the next village.</span> <span id="s565">I don't remember the name.</span> <span id="s566">And by then it was already two or three o'clock.</span> <span id="s567">Here we had walked all day to come down and then I went again to the Catholic priest's house.</span> <span id="s568">He gave us two eggs to eat, which was something because there was strict rationing in Switzerland and he gave me five francs which was enough to go by railroad to Lausanne, the next bigger city, where I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s569">And he also told me, "Don't go with the express trains.</span> <span id="s570">The express train is checked by military police.</span> <span id="s571">Go with the local train."</span> <span id="s572">And lo and behold, we got to Lausanne.</span> <span id="s573">Nobody had bothered us.</span> <span id="s574">Then I was in Lausanne in the railroad station and I really, for a moment, didn't know what to do with myself until about 15 or 20 -- we were wondering aimlessly around this -- this railroad station until I realized, “You are Jewish.</span> <span id="s575">God, why don't you look in the telephone for the Jewish community?”</span> <span id="s576">I went to the telephone book.</span> <span id="s577">The other guy wasn't much help.</span> <span id="s578">He followed.</span> <span id="s579">And lo and behold, the Jewish Community was Rue de la Gare – it’s the railroad street, the station street.</span> <span id="s580">So we went out of the railroad and within one or two minutes, we were -- we walked into the Jewish community, who welcomed us and told us, "Now look, we have to turn you over to the Swiss authorities, but don't worry.</span> <span id="s581">You will not be returned."</span> <span id="s582">These people had not known, of course.</span> <span id="s583">I had never told anybody that I had been arrested and, and the Swiss who were up in the mountains did not take apparently our names down, did not report it, so nobody knew apparently, as it turned out, that I had been 48 hours or 24 hours before already in Switzerland, and was returned.</span> <span id="s584">So we were turned over to the military.</span> <span id="s585">We were kept for a few days in the barrack at Ouchy, which is a suburb of Lausanne, where we had to fill out long questionnaires and were interrogated by some investigators who fortunately did not speak German and my Austrian friend with whom I had come did not speak French or very little French, so I was translating the way it suited me from what he said, to what I told the guy, so he never knew anything what I didn't want him to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">02:21:00 And from Ouchy, we were taken to a quarantine, military camp.</span> <span id="s587">You can't call it a camp.</span> <span id="s588">It was in the back room of a local inn, where they had made matt-- you know, platforms to sleep on.</span> <span id="s589">And they fed us, and the food was good.</span> <span id="s590">There was nothing wrong.</span> <span id="s591">It wasn't, wasn't French food.</span> <span id="s592">It was at least -- and we were there from September after -- oh yeah, end of September, October first maybe until about four weeks and then four weeks later, we were transferred to another identical facility on the other end of Switzerland in the German part of Switzerland and there I was for another four weeks probably.</span> <span id="s593">And on December 22nd, 1942 I was given papers to a work camp again in the French part of Switzerland.</span> <span id="s594">And when I came there in the early afternoon, the only person in the camp was the camp director.</span> <span id="s595">It was then a civilian camp -- was internment camp with barracks, but it was a civilian camp.</span> <span id="s596">The only person there was a director of the camp who had -- with his wife and his small child at the time, who not that small -- the daughter was maybe 12 or 13.</span> <span id="s597">Everybody else was on leave somewhere in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s598">So the first question was, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s599">I said, "I was assigned here" "You have any family somewhere in Switzerland?"</span> <span id="s600">I said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s601">I have a cousin here."</span> <span id="s602">"Let's call him.</span> <span id="s603">Maybe you can go there."</span> <span id="s604">So I came from, from almost the border of, of the Swiss-German border and I went practically back to the same place because my cousin lived very close by.</span> <span id="s605">And I spent three days or four days with my cousin during the Christmas holidays and then I came back to camp and I started camp life in, in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Do you know -- two questions.</span> <span id="s607">Did you know first what happened to the people who you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: No.</span> <span id="s609">I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s610">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: I know.</span> <span id="s612">No.</span> <span id="s613">I don't know really what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: What camp was it that you are in what internment?</span> <span id="s615">Do you know the name of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s617">Where?</span> <span id="s618">In, in, in Switzerland, I was in many internment camps and we can -- I can read them off to you.</span> <span id="s619">I have this--</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: No.</span> <span id="s621">The one where you just left-- A: Was Sierre.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: How long were you there and what did you do?</span> <span id="s623">What was life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Well, the camp was set up really to clear land, to make land arable because there was a great shortage of food in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s625">You know, they had to be more or less self supporting and I am really not familiar with the dates.</span> <span id="s626">We can -- I can show you the dates afterwards on my -- when we take a photo of the identifications -- Swiss identification papers.</span> <span id="s627">Well, when I came back, it had snowed.</span> <span id="s628">There were about two or three feet of snow.</span> <span id="s629">And the first thing we had to do was to clear the road from the camp to the street -- to the main highway and I didn't very much appreciate this.</span> <span id="s630">I don't like physical labor.</span> <span id="s631">So I decided at that point already that this is not for me.</span> <span id="s632">I got to do something about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">02:25:00 And I managed to get, within two weeks, I was in the office.</span> <span id="s634">They needed somebody in the office because there was a great deal of administrative work to be done on a daily basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">There was rationing and you had to do rationing reports which had to be typed a certain way in order to get the rationing tickets to which we all were entitled to or the camp was entitled to, so there was a great deal of administrative work to be done.</span> <span id="s636">So I went into the office.</span> <span id="s637">And I was in offices in refuge camps or homes for the rest of my Swiss stay for five and one half years.</span> <span id="s638">I was in -- the only time I was out was a few months while I was -- where I was in Geneva where I took some social services courses.</span> <span id="s639">We -- one did not know what would be.</span> <span id="s640">I had no profession basically.</span> <span id="s641">So when the opportunity came to take some courses in social service, I took the opportunity.</span> <span id="s642">I was put in the pension in Geneva and I took these courses.</span> <span id="s643">Incidentally, we also got married during this period in Geneva.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s645">Tell, tell me about that.</span> <span id="s646">How did you meet up again with Hanne and how did you--?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Well, Hanne came in February of -- February 28, 1943.</span> <span id="s648">She will tell you she came a different way.</span> <span id="s649">The difference between her and me was that I came and remained an illegal alien in Switzerland for the entire five and a half years we were in Switzerland while the moment Hanne set foot on Swiss soil, she was legal because her relatives had procured a Swiss visa.</span> <span id="s650">We managed to get permission after I was married.</span> <span id="s651">After all, I knew the ropes, how to do these things.</span> <span id="s652">I was in the offices all this time.</span> <span id="s653">I got permission to bring her .</span> <span id="s654">with me, to live with me.</span> <span id="s655">Then eventually they decided since she is really not an internee, and a -- but a legal foreigner, she could not live with me.</span> <span id="s656">Then we had to go through the charade of having a room, renting a room in Montreux would cost a lot of money.</span> <span id="s657">We had to pay for the room, which she didn't use once.</span> <span id="s658">She stayed with me in, in the home where I was.</span> <span id="s659">Eventually, we were able to give up the room again.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">02:28:00 And after the social services course we came -- I went back to a refuge home in the office.</span> <span id="s661">I was assigned again to an office, to run an office and she came along.</span> <span id="s662">By the way, while I was, while I was in Geneva and Hanne was in Geneva -- and the circumstances of Hanne staying in Geneva she will tell you herself -- we, all of a sudden, we are approached by -- now I can't think of the name of the man -- by a German Gentile.</span> <span id="s663">I believe he was Gentile.</span> <span id="s664">And we were not married at the time yet.</span> <span id="s665">Hanne will probably supply the name.</span> <span id="s666">I can't think of it right now.</span> <span id="s667">He invited us for tea twice, and he was really trying to recruit us.</span> <span id="s668">The war would end soon.</span> <span id="s669">It was in 1944 or early 1945, and why wouldn't we come to East Germany where the Russians were to help build up East Germany?</span> <span id="s670">And we got into a rather lengthy discussion twice about the merits of going into an authoritarian dictatorship.</span> <span id="s671">I pointed out to Siberia and the camps in Siberia which the man tried not to play down, of course.</span> <span id="s672">And eventually, I made -- we made it clear to him that we are not interested.</span> <span id="s673">What is interesting about these two interviews is that about 20 years later, we are reading an obituary in the New York Times about the right hand of Mr. Brandtwho was German Prime Minister, and it was this man and the obituary related that after the war, he came back to East Germany, eventually ran afoul of the Russian authorities, was in Siberia, somehow when he was released managed to get to West Germany and became the right hand man of Mr. Brandt.</span> <span id="s674">So, 22 Willy Brandt (nee Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm) Hanne and I got married in Geneva in -- on April 14, 1945.</span> <span id="s675">Our daughter was born in March of 1946, and in 1948 in -- after we had obtained our visas for the United States, we came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">02:31:00</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Where did you go once you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: We came to New York and we stayed in New York.</span> <span id="s679">In the beginning, you know, I was told, "Go to HIASMaybe they can help you."</span> <span id="s680">And we went, and the suggestion was made, "Why don't you go to Pritoria -- Peoria ?"</span> <span id="s681">Peoria, Illinois.</span> <span id="s682">Well, first, of course, no where -- I didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s683">For the first two weeks so I permitted myself the question, "Who’s going to pay for all of this?"</span> <span id="s684">“Well, your relatives, of course.”</span> <span id="s685">So, we never went to Peoria, Illinois.</span> <span id="s686">We stayed in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Is there anything else that you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: No.</span> <span id="s689">Probably after we all finish with the interview tomorrow or the day after, I probably can think of all kinds of things which I forgot, but right now --</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s691">What I would like to do now is to photograph the passports that he brought with us -- with him, please.</span> <span id="s692">What we will do, we will ask you to hold each up, and describe it, but they have to do funny things with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Yeah, I realize that.</span> <span id="s694">We will, we will Hanne her passports and I will just show mine, my two.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">And then we'll show the travel document yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: My notes say here that you succeeded in returning to Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s697">When are you talking about?</span> <span id="s698">You talked -- when we talked, before the interview, you said -- you described the 30 people.</span> <span id="s699">You're just talking about a later visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: No.</span> <span id="s701">That is much, much -- No.</span> <span id="s702">That is five years ago, four years ago.</span> <span id="s703">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s704">Okay.</span> <span id="s705">That's all I needed to make sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: It's not of consequence to-- Q: I just needed to be very clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: This is my internal refugee pass for Switzerland.</span> <span id="s708">It contained identification with a picture.</span> <span id="s709">It shows-- 23 United Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: You'll have to hold on that longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Longer?</span> <span id="s712">Okay.</span> <span id="s713">Raise your hand when, when you want me -- Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s714">Continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">02:35:00</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: It shows that there were always periods given in which we are permitted to remain in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s717">It was always a year or so and then it had to be renewed, which was a formality because they know, they know we couldn't go anywhere.</span> <span id="s718">It shows here, for instance, that we were interned by order of the police -- the federal police really.</span> <span id="s719">This is the record of all of the refugee camps and the homes where I was in from.</span> <span id="s720">And it finally has pages which shows what rationing cards were issued to me.</span> <span id="s721">Because after all, the Swiss are worse bureaucrats than the Germans.</span> <span id="s722">Now finally, on this page are three numbers.</span> <span id="s723">One is a number which -- under which I went while I was interned in these camps or homes.</span> <span id="s724">Actually I was more in formal hotels which due to the war were empty and where refugees were housed.</span> <span id="s725">One of those numbers is a police department number from the federal police.</span> <span id="s726">My -- I had an aunt who lived in Switzerland, who was married in Switzerland, who gave on the occasion of one of her visits a passport application where we had tried for me to come to Zurich to study at the conservatory of music.</span> <span id="s727">And as we discovered, this was a number which was given to me by the Swiss when I became -- when I came into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s728">Not only this, but when Hanne married me, all of sudden she -- this same number turned up on her refugee pass.</span> <span id="s729">We never were told anything about it, but you know the Swiss are very subtle.</span> <span id="s730">And since we had to fill out when we came a questionnaire of maybe 30 pages, they were able to trace back who we were and they matched my passport application from 1939 to my arrival in 1942 in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s731">Now, the other thing I wanted to show yet is the passport I used or we were issued in Switzerland since we refused to accept German papers.</span> <span id="s732">I did not want a German passport.</span> <span id="s733">I wanted no part of Germany.</span> <span id="s734">So this is the Swiss travel document which was used for us to obtain our American visa which is in here.</span> <span id="s735">It's just like a regular passport.</span> <span id="s736">It had our transit visa and our immigration visa.</span> <span id="s737">This is the immigration visa into the United States signed by the same man who had been promoted from Vice Consul to Consul who in Germany gave untold people untold trouble.</span> <span id="s738">I don't know if this ever was mentioned in an interview, but to obtain a immigration visa in those days in Germany was an extremely harrowing experience.</span> <span id="s739">Any pretext would be used to deny a visa.</span> <span id="s740">People would come with their children.</span> <span id="s741">The child might have bumped her arm or his leg and there would be a blue mark.</span> <span id="s742">This was enough, during the physical examination which was given in the Consulate in Stuttgart and in Berlin, to reject an application or to postpone an application for three, or four, or five months.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s744">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s747">[Conclusion of interview]</span></p></body></html>
