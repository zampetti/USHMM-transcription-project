Barac.</span> <span id="s13">I was born in Belgium in 1933 in April.</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Brussels.</span> <span id="s15">I know that my parents at the time lived in a town of Namure (ph) that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Your parents were from Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: No, my parents were both Russians.</span> <span id="s18">My mother and father were both born in Madava (ph), which at that time was Disrabia (ph), and came to Brussels, I guess in about 1928.</span> <span id="s19">So actually on their way to South America.</span> <span id="s20">My father had a Ph.D in chemical engineering and was a paper expert.</span> <span id="s21">And they stopped, had dinner at somebody's house, who had invited a man who is in charge of the paper mills in Belgium, they were naturalized.</span> <span id="s22">And, this man and my dad got along very well.</span> <span id="s23">He offered my dad a job and asked my mom how she liked the country, and she said she loved it, and there we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What do you remember of your life in Belgium before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Normalcy, a great deal of normalcy.</span> <span id="s26">We lived -- it was very old fashioned but the people who worked at my dad's factory were separated between the workers and the -- what do you call them -- the managers.</span> <span id="s27">And they all lived in complexes, and where we lived which is where the managers would live, was the street with a mountain behind it and a square, not too far away.</span> <span id="s28">And I was not allowed to go play on the square.</span> <span id="s29">And on Sundays we would climb up the mountain.</span> <span id="s30">And other than that, I was allowed to talk to people on my street and play with their dogs.</span> <span id="s31">None of them had children.</span> <span id="s32">I went to bed at the same time every day.</span> <span id="s33">I got up at the same time every day.</span> <span id="s34">I was fed basically the same food every day.</span> <span id="s35">Very, very normal untramatic life.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: No brothers, no sisters.</span> <span id="s38">I had a lot of cousins who I saw quite a bit.</span> <span id="s39">Q: What about school?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Oh, I don't remember much about school except that I loved my teachers.</span> <span id="s41">Q: Was it a public school or a ?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: I don't remember that there were any other Jews in that town.</span> <span id="s43">It was a suburb of Manue (ph) where we lived, and I know there were no other Jews in that town from the things that my parents have said to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: And did that cause any confusion?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: No.</span> <span id="s46">My parents were both and I was brought up with no consciousness of being Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s47">One of my sets of cousins was terribly terribly Catholic.</span> <span id="s48">And, I remember thinking it's kind of a silly waste of time to have to spend so much time praying and going to church and all that, because it's their business.</span> <span id="s49">And my other cousins who weren't Jewish were really not practicing Jews in the same way that we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Was there any conscious -- political consciousness about ?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: No, my parents were both -- I guess they both felt -- especially my dad, that they belong to the Russian Italian Embessy.</span> <span id="s52">I guess that my mother didn't.</span> <span id="s53">My mother was really very high politicalized person, but she was much broader, my father was not.</span> <span id="s54">And my father belonged to that category of Jews who had aligned themselves with the Russian Communist Party to a great extent.</span> <span id="s55">And really thought of themselves as Russians not as Jews.</span> <span id="s56">And felt that they had been totally accepted in the world of Russians on .</span> <span id="s57">That is what he felt.</span> <span id="s58">And so one of my uncles had gone to Pakistan and came back and was disappointed in it.</span> <span id="s59">I never met him really from the time I was a child until the time I was an adult, I was never really able to talk to him about his feelings or his experiences in Pakistan.</span> <span id="s60">Now my other uncle had run a communist army and went out and fought in the army and stayed in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: The reason I am asking this is I am trying to get a sense of how the weren't practicing at all.</span> <span id="s62">What really -- how you identified with being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: I didn't.</span> <span id="s64">I didn't until I was in my teens.</span> <span id="s65">Until way way after the war.</span> <span id="s66">As far as I could see there were the Germans and they were the enemy.</span> <span id="s67">And then there were all the French speaking people.</span> <span id="s68">And they were the good guys that included the French and the Belgiums.</span> <span id="s69">And then of course, the Flemish (ph) Belgiums.</span> <span id="s70">And, I wasn't really too conscious of the Dutch.</span> <span id="s71">But I was conscious of the British as being the good guy which was a little bit confusing later on.</span> <span id="s72">Because, I knew that Wellington was the bad guy.</span> <span id="s73">My historical concepts got very very mixed up.</span> <span id="s74">But at that time the British were good and the French were super good and the Germans were super bad.</span> <span id="s75">And so I really put down all the horrors of war to the conflict between the good guys and the bad guys.</span> <span id="s76">And I wasn't really conscious of the bad things that they were doing to the Jews because they were equally bad things to people that I knew and saw around me.</span> <span id="s77">Now by the time we got to the South of France and I got myself situated or I didn't, my history did.</span> <span id="s78">I got me situated in a village where there were many many Jews living as well, even though I still considered myself French.</span> <span id="s79">I began to get a sense of the bad things that were being done to the Jews and -- but I still wasn't clear that I was a Jew at all.</span> <span id="s80">I just thought that these were poor people who were being treated shamelessly, and so it was kind of difficult.</span> <span id="s81">But later on -- oh, maybe about seven or eight or ten years ago, but no more than that, I met somebody in New York City.</span> <span id="s82">Quite by accident, who had been the daughter of one of the villagers in one of the smaller villages that we lived in.</span> <span id="s83">And she and her husband had been running a restaurant in New York City and distributing leaphlets to their restaurant in front of the tickets booth on 42nd Street.</span> <span id="s84">And, I was reading a French book and that got us into a conversation which finally ended up by telling her where I was from and she said "Oh my goodness, she was from there.</span> <span id="s85">When did I live there?"</span> <span id="s86">Very suspiciously she asked me this and I told her and she looked at me and she said "Oh, were you the Belgiums or the Jews?"</span> <span id="s87">So which really brought home to me the fact that I wasn't the only one that considered myself not a part of this Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Because there were many -- I don't know, there were quite a few maybe 20, 30, Jewish people who were living there, you know, under village arrest.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: You were aware that you were Jews but you weren't aware of the double risk?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s91">I didn't realize that anybody was at a double risk.</span> <span id="s92">And I was a small child and quite innocent.</span> <span id="s93">My knowledge of war came from literature.</span> <span id="s94">And in literature there is no such thing as this.</span> <span id="s95">At least not the literature that you read when you are six or seven years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">There are good guys and there are bad guys, and that is basically it.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Let's go back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s98">I want you to tell me a little about what you were, your family knew about Hitler or Naziism (ph) before Belgium ?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: I knew nothing.</span> <span id="s100">My father, I really don't know.</span> <span id="s101">My father obviously knew everything that my mother did because she would have shared it with him.</span> <span id="s102">My mother was a clinical scientist and she said that when I was born, she cried and cried and cried and cried because it was 1933 and she could see what was coming.</span> <span id="s103">So she was very aware.</span> <span id="s104">And I know that when I was a child there had been many many conversations about immigrating.</span> <span id="s105">And my father kept saying no, we will be okay and my mother kept saying, no we got to go.</span> <span id="s106">At one point they -- my mother and I, went to Romania (ph) where my maternal grandparents were living and we went to where my maternal grandmother was living.</span> <span id="s107">You see my maternal grandparents and my maternal grandmother were living and to try to get them out.</span> <span id="s108">At one point my maternal grandparents did leave Romania (ph) and they went to visit their son who at this time, that's the man who had gone to live on at one point.</span> <span id="s109">And he was now living in Argentina with his wife and two children.</span> <span id="s110">I guess maybe that he didn't even have two children at that time.</span> <span id="s111">Yeah, but anyway they went to visit him and they decided they really wanted to go home, they didn't feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s112">They felt that maybe they were too old to take on this culture.</span> <span id="s113">My mother and father argued with them that a Spanish culture was something very foreign to them.</span> <span id="s114">French or Belgium culture would be something they would be much more familiar with, at least through their education, etcetera etcetera and tried to convince them to stay in Belgium.</span> <span id="s115">They declined this as well and went on back.</span> <span id="s116">And then in 1937 my mother and I went to Romania (ph) and Russia, and tried to get my grandparents to leave, to no avail.</span> <span id="s117">So that is how much my parents knew, a great deal, a great great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: What do you remember about this when it happened, how things started changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Well, we didn't stay.</span> <span id="s120">But how it happened was very sudden, it happened overnight.</span> <span id="s121">It happened in one or two days.</span> <span id="s122">And I went to school one day and the school teacher told us that they were passing out flowers in a corner and we should take these flowers and take the petals off of them and put them in baskets.</span> <span id="s123">Because, the next day our armys would come on through on their way to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s124">And so we did this to the flowers and a great deal of hooplah and horay horay, we are going to be saved.</span> <span id="s125">The next day we were excused from school.</span> <span id="s126">And, my parents house was on a main road which was a two-lane highway but was still a main road.</span> <span id="s127">And, the troops came marching down the main road where everybody who lived anywhere near was out on the streets.</span> <span id="s128">And people had bread and they had cheese and they had wine and lots and lots and lots of wine which they gave to the soldiers wishing them well and wishing them luck and children would throw petals on the soldiers marching by.</span> <span id="s129">It was very glorious and very very glorious and three days later they came back or four days later or something, you know.</span> <span id="s130">The war was won, the Germans had walked all over them.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: How was the mood?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Well, they went from total elation to total defeat, I mean not good.</span> <span id="s133">There is a very very powerful poem written by -- I believe it is .</span> <span id="s134">It just basically sets the tone for this you know, it says: The month of May was the month of roses and the month of lilies, and the month of June had a dagger in its heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Were the people in your town trying to deal with this in any certain way?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I don't think -- I may be wrong.</span> <span id="s137">But I really don't think, apart from the political groups, that people in Northern France and Belgium and maybe more France than that to, were really so aware of the Nazis as being different from the Germans.</span> <span id="s138">Don't forget that the French and the Germans had these conflicts for centuries.</span> <span id="s139">And the most recent one was in 1914 and it was a question of land grabbing and wanting more power and this had already been done through the Eastern Army that was what Poland was all about.</span> <span id="s140">And that's what parts of were all about and so I think, although I have no reason to say that, other than what I have read since.</span> <span id="s141">But people were probably more conscious with the fact that this was another devastating war that was going to take place.</span> <span id="s142">But, I don't think that anybody thought of it as strictly political war or even any political overtones.</span> <span id="s143">I think that came quite a bit later.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Now, while you were in Belgium, did you come in contact with German troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s146">While I was in Belgium and when my father went to work one day, oh -- within a week or so of the occupation and his boss said to him that he felt that my dad should take his family and leave.</span> <span id="s147">That he wasn't a Belgium number one, and that he was a Jew, number two, and that he was at great, great risk.</span> <span id="s148">So he gave my father what amounted to six month salary and he said "God Bless You," and when he gave my dad a letter of introduction to his sister factory in and we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Let me just ask you one question while we are on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: So even the short time and we are talking a few weeks -- A: No, we are talking -- yeah maybe two.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Were your activities restricted?</span> <span id="s153">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Was there any sense --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No that is what I was going to tell you.</span> <span id="s156">Yes, things changed terribly from the day of the petal throwing to the day that we left which was somewhere between seven and ten days later.</span> <span id="s157">I mean we are talking about a very short period of time.</span> <span id="s158">What happened is that the routine my life had followed until that day became nonexistent.</span> <span id="s159">Nobody seemed to care whether I was fed or not.</span> <span id="s160">I had a maid, my parents had a maid who was usually about 17 years old or so that took care of me.</span> <span id="s161">So she was more or less like a mother's helper more than anything else.</span> <span id="s162">Anyway, this young girl had gotten quite sick with and she had gone to live with her parents and I think she died.</span> <span id="s163">I didn't know very well what had happened to her but I know she was a nurse so she wasn't taking care of me.</span> <span id="s164">So for the first time there was nobody but my mom to take care of me.</span> <span id="s165">My parents and my neighbors were crouched over a radio most of the time.</span> <span id="s166">Certainly in the evening from five or six o'clock on there was this crowd of people a holding on to this radio.</span> <span id="s167">I could go on and do whatever I wanted to.</span> <span id="s168">I could go to bed whenever I wanted to.</span> <span id="s169">I remember staying out and watching it getting dark and I've never seen it get dark outside before.</span> <span id="s170">I continued to go to school, nobody at school seemed to care about what was going on.</span> <span id="s171">It was a terrific change for several days and after that we left and we went up and took my mothers bicycle and I can't remember if we took my dad's bicycle as well, I think we did.</span> <span id="s172">And we took a suitcase and we took my mothers -- my mother had an old battered fur coat which her mother had maybe given her ten years before or so.</span> <span id="s173">It was pretty battered up and we took that.</span> <span id="s174">And so we were traveling very light and we were using the fur coat pretty much as a blanket or a mattress or whatever we needed to use it for.</span> <span id="s175">And, we left.</span> <span id="s176">During the out of Belgium and I guess the also rode into France and I was bringing movies to sort of back up some of my stories as the French movie which was made oh, maybe in the 1940s or early 1950s called "Forbidden Games" I don't know if you're familiar with that.</span> <span id="s177">Anyway, it is a magnificent movie but one of the things that it shows it is about a girl whose parents are in one of these lines and she escapes dying after she runs after her little dog.</span> <span id="s178">But it shows very, very clearly this thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people in a line just moving down a road.</span> <span id="s179">And some of them are on foot and some of them are on bicycles and of course some of them are in cars.</span> <span id="s180">But of course there is no gasoline as the ones in cars go so far.</span> <span id="s181">And the, the ones in cars get abandoned and the streets the roads are with cars.</span> <span id="s182">And maybe every two or three minutes begins and so people dodge for cover and they dive into the ditches and the sides of the roads.</span> <span id="s183">And sometimes the people get up and sometimes they don't because a certain amount of are successful and people are just down dead.</span> <span id="s184">So it is just an unbelievable sight you know.</span> <span id="s185">And this went on for a long time, it went on for about two days, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Who were all these people ?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: People, people.</span> <span id="s188">Belgium citizens, .</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Where were they going?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: They were going away from trouble.</span> <span id="s191">They were being bombed, I think.</span> <span id="s192">And you know the Germans had occupied Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Where were they going ?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: To the South, there was no other way to go because on the one side was the ocean and on the other side was Germany.</span> <span id="s195">So they all had to go to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Would you find this or somewhat an adventure this ?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: I don't remember how I found it at first.</span> <span id="s198">Eventually I found it terrifying at first.</span> <span id="s199">I don't think that I was terribly frightened, I had my parents with me and I felt very comfortable and comforting when my parents.</span> <span id="s200">They were good parents and I was a good child.</span> <span id="s201">We all got along very well you know, so I trusted them.</span> <span id="s202">And pleasantly I guess I would not have to be so terrified as other people might be.</span> <span id="s203">But then something really bad happened and I got to a spot where my dad decided that he just couldn't take it with the three of us across so what he said he would put me behind this tiny little wall, it's a kind of open wall shelter, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">And he would leave me behind this wall and take my mom.</span> <span id="s205">I think what had happened is that we had lost one of the bicycles, I think that it must have been that.</span> <span id="s206">And so he decided that he was going to take my mom and bring her somewhere down south and come back get me and bring me back there.</span> <span id="s207">And at that point, I got terrified.</span> <span id="s208">Because that is where the started and I had to hide behind this wall that is probably no higher than this.</span> <span id="s209">(indicating) It was just panics then.</span> <span id="s210">But my dad did come back and he said that my mom was okay and he picked me up and brought me to where they were.</span> <span id="s211">So we wandered on and on and on and on and eventually we got to .</span> <span id="s212">And that must have taken us two, three days, not that long we were all good walkers.</span> <span id="s213">Another thing that I would really have to say at this point is really that physically very good shape my father and my mother were bicycling for years and years, they were great walkers as well.</span> <span id="s214">They lived in suburbs and not in the city.</span> <span id="s215">So I think that they had it over the people that came from the city.</span> <span id="s216">But other people that lived in the suburbs were just as well off as who lived in that country.</span> <span id="s217">So anyway we arrived at .</span> <span id="s218">And my father went to present himself at the factory where they kind of laughed at him and said "Gees we would love to take you, but the Germans had just taken us over.</span> <span id="s219">So I don't think that you would feel very happy here."</span> <span id="s220">So that was one of our hopes gone.</span> <span id="s221">So by that point we lived pretty much by my parents wits.</span> <span id="s222">And we went from LaMoss (ph) to Paris which of course, was occupied at the time.</span> <span id="s223">But my Argentineans (ph) uncles sister in law lived in Paris so we went and lived with her.</span> <span id="s224">We went and stayed there maybe about a month and a half and it was very, very strange because people were wearing gas masks and all I remember Paris is playing on the , which was .</span> <span id="s225">And the gas masks that people were wearing were very strange.</span> <span id="s226">It was kind of a unpleasant time.</span> <span id="s227">So after Paris, we went to this --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: How long ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: About a month and a half.</span> <span id="s230">Until after Paris then my parents decided that we ought to go to the South of France.</span> <span id="s231">And I guess this must have been in July or the end of June or July.</span> <span id="s232">In putting it all into perspective I thought that we got to in June because everybody went to in June but, I think maybe it was in July.</span> <span id="s233">When I say everybody I really mean everybody.</span> <span id="s234">The whole country was heading for .</span> <span id="s235">It was the big free city it was still the third or fourth largest city in France at the time.</span> <span id="s236">It was free, all the great movie stars were there.</span> <span id="s237">All the great singers the popular singers were there.</span> <span id="s238">Everybody who was anybody who had any rights to anything was there.</span> <span id="s239">And the whole population besides that was there and all the refugees were there.</span> <span id="s240">The city was bursting, there was no room anywhere.</span> <span id="s241">When we got to .</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: How did you get there?</span> <span id="s243">A: How did we get there?</span> <span id="s244">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: It's difficult.</span> <span id="s246">My mother was pretty much the brains behind our organization of that particular trip and she said that we had to leave, so we went on to the southwest.</span> <span id="s247">And we got to and along with a great, great many people, we tried to cross the river a couple of bridges and we got to one of the bridges was already overfilled with people and the Germans were still , they were bombing badly.</span> <span id="s248">And we barely did not make it to the bridge.</span> <span id="s249">But then we finally did.</span> <span id="s250">And we pushed and we shoved and we pushed and we shoved and we moved to the other side of the bridge.</span> <span id="s251">And we pushed and we shoved and we got off the bridge and the bridge went into the river.</span> <span id="s252">So I guess that was a very scary experience that was in my life, because then we are really talking about maybe a minute, maybe less.</span> <span id="s253">The difference between life or death you know just so visible and just so terrifying to see all these people.</span> <span id="s254">And then we left and then my mother decided that we had to take the train to go to , and she managed to get us on the last train leaving through free France from north to south.</span> <span id="s255">There wasn't an requisition by the Germany army.</span> <span id="s256">I don't know how she did but I can still remember her screaming "my child must get on this train."</span> <span id="s257">The train was just and my mother had a lot of .</span> <span id="s258">She got her child on the train and then she said "that no child can ride on the train without its father."</span> <span id="s259">So she got my father on and then she said something about we can't travel without a bicycle and then she finally got on.</span> <span id="s260">So the four of us once again we on this train.</span> <span id="s261">We went for quite awhile and then the train was stopped and everybody had to get off but we didn't have a bicycle.</span> <span id="s262">So we never made it to Rome.</span> <span id="s263">Though, we were to Central France then we went on to LaRuse (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: ?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s266">We got to LaRuse (ph) which is, as I say, was a total mad house.</span> <span id="s267">And you know how French towns are with the squares in the middle, every tree on that square was filled with notes.</span> <span id="s268">You know family so and so looking for so and so and looking for so on.</span> <span id="s269">But in 19-- maybe it was 1983, '82, something like that, I was stuck at the airport in Miami because of a huge snow that developed in the North, that was getting back to New York City.</span> <span id="s270">And I was stuck there like for a day and a half, and turned out I was sitting next to a French family there talking away in French.</span> <span id="s271">And my father and I had just gone through a part of his history and I was writing it down.</span> <span id="s272">And he had just told me about his episode in LaRuse(ph).</span> <span id="s273">You know how everybody was blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s274">So these French people were there and I asked if they were about my age or a little bit older.</span> <span id="s275">Actually maybe ten years older than I was.</span> <span id="s276">And they were at about the right age to remember everything.</span> <span id="s277">And I said to one of them after we made friends, and where were you in June of 1940?</span> <span id="s278">He said "Madam, I was in LaRuse (ph) like everybody else."</span> <span id="s279">And he described to me the scene exactly as I have described to you.</span> <span id="s280">So that's -- I found that very interesting, indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: When you were traveling, did you have food?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Where did we stay?</span> <span id="s283">We always stayed with somebody, somebody always put us up.</span> <span id="s284">I mean we were -- I think by this time France has sort of polarized itself, you know, pretty much.</span> <span id="s285">The poor Germans and the Germans and the for the most part were communists.</span> <span id="s286">And they tended to be for the country people.</span> <span id="s287">And not necessarily everybody.</span> <span id="s288">But that was still at the very beginning of the war, don't forget this was 1940.</span> <span id="s289">So people were still not thinking of it so much as the Nazi party versus other things.</span> <span id="s290">As they were still thinking in the terms of 1930s when the Spanish Civil War -- as a war of where the classes sort of got mixed in.</span> <span id="s291">You know, and the French Communist Party were pretty strong in the country and my parents being Russian of course works as a very very big plus.</span> <span id="s292">And they're speaking French as well was as equally a plus so they had it on both sides.</span> <span id="s293">So we always had somebody to stay with and we had money.</span> <span id="s294">We had money but it wasn't worth very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">But we still had all this money that my father's boss had given him.</span> <span id="s296">Then we got into LaRuse (ph) and then in LaRuse (ph) we found my cousins who lived in Brussels who were Jewish cousins, who had made it down there with a car.</span> <span id="s297">Two families, one of them with one child and a grandmother and the other one with two children.</span> <span id="s298">So there were eight people in one car who had their way down to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: How did they find them?</span> <span id="s300">A: By putting their note up.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: On the tree?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: And so had they.</span> <span id="s303">People find each other like that, you know.</span> <span id="s304">It's the same way they found themselves after the war was over in all countries.</span> <span id="s305">They put up notes and advertised in newspapers.</span> <span id="s306">People just combed those lists, you know, and if you knew somebody that was looking for somebody, you found the name and you pass it on.</span> <span id="s307">When people are determined, it's not very hard.</span> <span id="s308">All you have to do is just comb the lists.</span> <span id="s309">So anyway, we stayed with a very nice family in LaRuse (ph) the man had been I guess he had a place that done weddings and receptions and what not, so there were grounds -- very nice grounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">And little gazebos and a very, very lovely large restaurant and barns and what have.</span> <span id="s311">And most of his family was there and some of his friends were there and we were there.</span> <span id="s312">And after that I have no idea why we were there.</span> <span id="s313">But I know that my parents and he just got along just famously and he had a nephew who was 15 who's my life and other than that it was a really nice place to stay.</span> <span id="s314">Oh there were some and other nice things in cages, you know.</span> <span id="s315">We had enough to eat there, it was okay.</span> <span id="s316">So we stayed there for a while and the Germans took us and put us in a series of villages where we were under -- well, one place we were under a village arrest and eventually we were under house arrest, but that comes later.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: This was in villages?</span> <span id="s318">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: ?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Well, this wasn't free France for very long.</span> <span id="s321">Okay.</span> <span id="s322">It was free France when we first got there and then after a while, it wasn't.</span> <span id="s323">So then the Germans took us and we were on a list and then we went where we were told to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Were you on a list because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s326">Well, I still didn't know that I was considered Jewish, I just thought that I've been captured by them.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: ?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: ?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: With passports and what not, you know.</span> <span id="s331">They didn't have Belgium passports my parents hadn't been in Belgium long enough to become Belgium citizens.</span> <span id="s332">I think they were lacking two or something.</span> <span id="s333">Which happened to change most of our life.</span> <span id="s334">Anyway, my father as I said, I lived in Disrabia (ph) and he done his military service in Disrabia (ph).</span> <span id="s335">Disrabia (ph) changed back and forth from 1914 to 1940 between Russia and Romania.</span> <span id="s336">And in 1940, I was given over to Romania.</span> <span id="s337">Romania was part of the axis, so therefore I thought it was part of his military service under an allied country or an unallied country.</span> <span id="s338">Which caused a great deal of problems to the Germans who were very, very rule bound as we all know.</span> <span id="s339">And, he didn't know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s340">So they simply put us under house arrest and they sent out for more instructions.</span> <span id="s341">This was -- I skipped over one town that we were in all together.</span> <span id="s342">That is the town where I lived -- the woman I told you about earlier.</span> <span id="s343">Anyway, we are in a little town called which was outside LaRuse (ph) and that is where the Germans had problems with my identification, my parents had classification and they put us under house arrest.</span> <span id="s344">And we would leave at night and we would go stay in the yard, mostly in barns and then we would come back in the morning.</span> <span id="s345">Anyway, one night my parents had organized a group of maybe about 17 people or so -- all Jews, and with children unfortunately.</span> <span id="s346">We left one night to cross the to get into Spain and because the shepherds in the hills were very, very friendly.</span> <span id="s347">They kind of considered everybody to be part of .</span> <span id="s348">And which we certainly weren't.</span> <span id="s349">These three salted the milk.</span> <span id="s350">They salted the milk so it wouldn't go sour and they welcomed people to use their huts.</span> <span id="s351">Well they weren't really huts they were more like stone .</span> <span id="s352">I mean great big stones.</span> <span id="s353">We arrived in one of those and settled in and children cried and screamed because of the salt in the milk and they were hungry and tired.</span> <span id="s354">So my father put it in cold water down stream but he didn't -- the Germans running an expedition found the milk and us and brought us back to the village.</span> <span id="s355">Of the 17 people that were there, 14 of them were sent immediately to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: ?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Well , I don't know, they were just sent.</span> <span id="s358">And they didn't know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s359">So the next time --</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: How come you didn't go with the other 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Because they didn't know what to do with my father's papers.</span> <span id="s362">My father had done his military service for the route.</span> <span id="s363">So he now has the right and they didn't know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s364">So if he had been German and had done his military service, there would be no problem that was covered.</span> <span id="s365">So, it is nice not to be covered.</span> <span id="s366">So anyway, we were put under strict house arrest except me, I still had the freedom to go around the village.</span> <span id="s367">I still don't know why I did that.</span> <span id="s368">It was a very small village, I don't think there was a 150 people in that town, that village.</span> <span id="s369">We left again, this time we left the two grown men, two brothers and we crossed the mountains and arrived in .</span> <span id="s370">I was kind of terrified that we were caught by soldiers on the way up but they were French soldiers so they let us go.</span> <span id="s371">I think my father gave them some gold.</span> <span id="s372">We also had a guide, my father said that he knew the guy that was going to kill us or try to kill us because that is what a lot of the guides did.</span> <span id="s373">They killed the people for gold or whatever they had and went out and got more.</span> <span id="s374">My father said that he knew that he had to stay up all night and watch the guide and if the guide was going to make a move, my father had to make his move first.</span> <span id="s375">And he said that he really didn't know if he was going to be able to do that.</span> <span id="s376">You know kill in cold blood like that.</span> <span id="s377">But he said that the guy just gave up after a while and disappeared, he just ran off.</span> <span id="s378">So then there was just the five of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: ?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: And he had a very, very Jewish last name -- I forgotten what it is anymore, a very nice man.</span> <span id="s381">So we arrived in and I remember that my father -- my father always liked his title-- you know he had his PhD and always calls himself doctor so and so.</span> <span id="s382">How wonderful a doctor, we have a very sick young person so my father instead of saying well, I'm not really a doctor said ""Hum, okay I'll try."</span> <span id="s383">So I remember him performing some sort of a very minute operation on this patient who had been through a whole thing -- I don't know if it was a very bad splinter or something but anyway something of no big consequence but he was able to deal with that very well.</span> <span id="s384">And we spent the night there and then the next day we went on -- or the next night we went on to Spain and in order to cross the border between and Spain to go over some treacherous .</span> <span id="s385">And a path that ran between a very, very steep on one side -- at least it seemed very steep to me.</span> <span id="s386">And I forgot what holds them open.</span> <span id="s387">The body of water on the other side and dogs were howling and the guard dogs that was really scary too.</span> <span id="s388">So I remember the bridge and this first incident that I told you about my dad, leaving me in this little walk was one of the most scariest things that had happened to me during the war.</span> <span id="s389">And they are all very, very physical things, you know.</span> <span id="s390">Anyway, we made it through the border and we got on a train and we headed out to Barcelona (ph) and we went to a hotel that had been given to us as a safe house, which it wasn't.</span> <span id="s391">And the next morning at about six in the morning we -- the police came by picked us up and took us to jail.</span> <span id="s392">But that was okay because even though we didn't know it at the time, our troubles and perils were really over.</span> <span id="s393">That by now this was 1942 or the end of 1942 and nobody was ever going to try to kill us again.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: You felt that?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s396">But I know that now.</span> <span id="s397">So we were fitted into a jail which was the perfect jail and so kind of like a precinct jail and all kinds of people were there.</span> <span id="s398">And we stayed there for about five or six days.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: ?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Well, you watch cops and robbers -- those shows on television, that's what I mean.</span> <span id="s401">Q: Where were the people from?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Mostly they were Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: They were actually criminal prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Many of them were.</span> <span id="s405">There was small time criminals, there were prostitutes.</span> <span id="s406">There was the occasional political prisoner there was the -- mostly they were criminal .</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: ?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: No, not at this level of jail.</span> <span id="s409">And of this level of jail, of course, we were sorted and put into other jails.</span> <span id="s410">The women went off to the women’s jails and the men went off to the men’s jails.</span> <span id="s411">Now the men’s jails was just more of the same.</span> <span id="s412">It had political prisoners, it had political prisoners that were left over from the Spanish Civil War.</span> <span id="s413">It had criminals, it had big time criminals, it had small time political prisoners.</span> <span id="s414">And those jails was the men’s jail which was the main jail in Barcelona (ph) which also was filled to capacity.</span> <span id="s415">Anyway, I am trying to remember exactly what -- I went to the jail a number of times so I'm trying to remember what it looked like.</span> <span id="s416">It had three sides with a bench of a stone bench built inside to the side of the cell and the door or whatever and I think that in my father's cell there was nine men with a place for three men to sleep.</span> <span id="s417">So they took turns, you know.</span> <span id="s418">And my dad tells me that one of the men who was a political -- I'm sorry who was a political man, a wonderful, wonderful story teller.</span> <span id="s419">And I know that one of the other men was a political prisoner who -- a Jew, a French Jew who joined the French underground.</span> <span id="s420">He's a psychiatrist who been caught and sent to which was the terrible concentration camp in Spain.</span> <span id="s421">And he had been taken out of Miranda (ph) and put into this jail.</span> <span id="s422">Eventually he got put back into Miranda (ph) and stayed there until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s423">At which point my parents found him quite accidentally in Montreal (ph) and he came to stay with us for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s424">And he was still practicing psychiatry, he was almost ninety years old.</span> <span id="s425">Years ago, child psychiatry at that.</span> <span id="s426">Obviously, something is wrong somewhere there, I think.</span> <span id="s427">Well, I don't think should be practicing child psychiatry -- anyway, there was this highway man, and this psychiatrist and my father with a PhD in chemistry and I'm sure that there were some ordinary and I mean interesting criminals there as well.</span> <span id="s428">And I know that there was one Spanish Jew, because my father kept in touch with him for many, many years.</span> <span id="s429">He was a middle class person.</span> <span id="s430">So -- well, the women’s jail was far less interesting in the people that were there.</span> <span id="s431">There was the great majority of them were petty thieves and prostitutes.</span> <span id="s432">And as I say that jail was in uncommon because the jail -- the women’s jail had been filled.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">And that is where my mother stayed and I stayed with my mom for a very short period of time.</span> <span id="s434">No I didn't, I didn't stay with her at all.</span> <span id="s435">I was in a jail, a precinct jail.</span> <span id="s436">When these people came by their name was Hartock (ph) and they had been given my name by the joint.</span> <span id="s437">And they had no children and they wanted to take care of me and look after me.</span> <span id="s438">They wanted to take care of me and they were a Swiss-German family, and they had a dog and they were very nice.</span> <span id="s439">They loved their dog and like I say, they had no children.</span> <span id="s440">And, I had just been through several years with no food on the table and I was very perturbed by that situation.</span> <span id="s441">I was very perturbed by the fact that they were Germans and I tried to set fire to their house.</span> <span id="s442">And I drowned their house and I tried to kill the dog.</span> <span id="s443">I was just doing the best after the war you have to understand, I mean we had things so good after all these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">And they were wonderful, they put up with me.</span> <span id="s445">They weren't very understanding because they put me in a private school and they put me in a Swiss-Deutsch school.</span> <span id="s446">You know, instead of letting me go to the local school and learn some Spanish.</span> <span id="s447">So things did not go too well.</span> <span id="s448">I stayed with them for two or three months until my parents got out of jail and my mother got out of jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s452">Well I am going to go back in time now and tell you about my life in France.</span> <span id="s453">Because that will give you a sense on how people did live.</span> <span id="s454">The first town that I lived in that I can remember very well was Paris.</span> <span id="s455">Paris as I remember was a fearful place, not a pleasant place.</span> <span id="s456">A very -- maybe science fiction type of place because of the gas masks.</span> <span id="s457">And they are really fixed in my memory.</span> <span id="s458">And I don't know if they really looked that way or not but as I see them, they had these two thinks plopped over your eyes.</span> <span id="s459">And then this nozzle which came out and I think, plopped over your mouth.</span> <span id="s460">So it really looked like an anthestetic-type contraption, you know.</span> <span id="s461">As I said, I don't remember if it's true or not, maybe that is just what I see in my mind's eye.</span> <span id="s462">But, I didn't have any friends there where I used to play on the Chamuse (ph) and under the Eiffel tower.</span> <span id="s463">And I just don't remember anything except life was not pleasant.</span> <span id="s464">Life was definitely not pleasant.</span> <span id="s465">We had the run of the town, there was no food to be had.</span> <span id="s466">The Germans were there and there were lines everywhere.</span> <span id="s467">There were coupons for goods but even with coupons you couldn't really get anything, so that takes care of Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: What was the German presence like?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: I don't remember, I don't remember anything except what I've told you.</span> <span id="s470">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: There were curfews and there were blackouts and yeah, the curfews were very long.</span> <span id="s472">I guess they were from six to seven or eight or something like that.</span> <span id="s473">So all night long -- a lot of sirens, a lot of sirens and a fair number of fires.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Did you stick with your parents most of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Ah-huh.</span> <span id="s476">Sure, sure.</span> <span id="s477">You know if I had any brothers or sisters, I don't know if we would have made it or not.</span> <span id="s478">It was so much easier because they shuffled me around from one parent to the other one and they were both parents together.</span> <span id="s479">And so I always had somebody protecting me.</span> <span id="s480">And they only had one person to take care of.</span> <span id="s481">But with brothers and sisters, I don't know if we would have been able to manage it.</span> <span id="s482">Because I have four children myself and I think about how difficult it was to travel or to go anywhere with them when they were small.</span> <span id="s483">And I just don't know how they could have done it.</span> <span id="s484">Anyway, the next town that I remember -- well, you asked me at one point how people helped us and how we lived in terms of food and everything.</span> <span id="s485">I remember that we went to another small town where we lived for maybe two months or so.</span> <span id="s486">I don't even remember the name of the town -- if it would come to me.</span> <span id="s487">was the name of the town.</span> <span id="s488">Just and the river is where it was.</span> <span id="s489">And from now on, I never lived in another city, except for Deruse (ph).</span> <span id="s490">We only lived in small towns.</span> <span id="s491">And I already told you about Deruse (ph) and finding our way through and finding our relatives.</span> <span id="s492">And the first time the Germans found us, they sent us to .</span> <span id="s493">That was the first time that we were registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: What happened to those relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Ah, those relatives.</span> <span id="s496">Those relatives most ingeniously, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s497">I call one of them, his name is .</span> <span id="s498">I call him my uncle, he's not of course.</span> <span id="s499">He is my father's second cousin who married my fathers first cousin, who was his second cousin.</span> <span id="s500">And who presently lives in New York and I call him my uncle.</span> <span id="s501">It has always been much easier.</span> <span id="s502">Most ingeniously, he said to me one day, oh Helene I knew it you know.</span> <span id="s503">I said to your dad, we have money, we will get out of it somehow.</span> <span id="s504">You have no money, but you have brains you'll get out of it somehow.</span> <span id="s505">So they did, from Laruse (ph) they vanished with their money to and then from to Cuba.</span> <span id="s506">And they spent the rest of the war in Cuba with families.</span> <span id="s507">I think the other family stayed in Cuba throughout the war and eventually went to Mexico.</span> <span id="s508">That families business has been tan, tanning furs, or tannery.</span> <span id="s509">And all business had been fur brokering and after the war and his family went back to New York, which is where I ended up.</span> <span id="s510">But that is the end of this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: So back to ?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Back to to where we stayed for about two months.</span> <span id="s513">We remember the first time that we got there, it was late at night and the food was piled up on the table.</span> <span id="s514">And so was the drink, and what we were drinking there, it was hot apple cider.</span> <span id="s515">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: We were in the South of France.</span> <span id="s518">Q: But whose house?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Oh somebody.</span> <span id="s520">Just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: ?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Just like that, somebody's house.</span> <span id="s523">You asked how people took care of you.</span> <span id="s524">People took care of you because there was this very very strong feeling about the pro and the cons the good guys and the bad guys.</span> <span id="s525">People took care of whoever happened to go by.</span> <span id="s526">They had such a strong feeling of -- with having my parents being involved with at one point.</span> <span id="s527">You know, and they started transporting food and stuff, I mean but anyway, a little later that comes in.</span> <span id="s528">Anyway, I remember these people in whose house we were supplying us with food and drink.</span> <span id="s529">And I remember that I fell asleep and I was, according to my parents very very drunk.</span> <span id="s530">And they put me to sleep and the next day somehow were found.</span> <span id="s531">Somehow clothing was found, I remember the clothing was found because it was not clothing that I could identify.</span> <span id="s532">And then I have a picture of me wearing this clothing.</span> <span id="s533">We set up with a little boy who was also from a Jewish family, who was my great friend.</span> <span id="s534">And he was only about four- five years old, maybe three- four years old.</span> <span id="s535">Anyway, we stayed there a couple of months and I remember this was the first time when I really remember my dad taking me out for walks and becoming the great philosopher, you know.</span> <span id="s536">We saw a field of daffodils one time; words could not have been any prettier.</span> <span id="s537">It was in an oak field tons and tons and tons and tons of oak and mistletoe growing from the oaks.</span> <span id="s538">And just tons and tons and tons and tons of daffodils.</span> <span id="s539">Oh gosh, this must have been 1941 right, because of the springtime.</span> <span id="s540">And it was so beautiful, I remember my father telling me that marriage was a terrible institution.</span> <span id="s541">And he was very, very lucky because he had found himself a very nice wife who had not conned things out of him.</span> <span id="s542">Not just the fact that she was his wife but, the only way to live is for two people who adored each other to live with each other, without the unsacred of marriage and on and on and on.</span> <span id="s543">In his very procommunist fashion we went on and started talking to me about politics.</span> <span id="s544">About how the communist regime was the only thing that made any sense, you know and blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s545">And I remember being very struck by how much sense this made daffodils.</span> <span id="s546">So then -- those are the sort of memories that I have about that time.</span> <span id="s547">Anyway then we were sent from to to and I think we were transported to if I remember correctly by bus.</span> <span id="s548">Just as I told you there were no more railroads because they were all taken over by the Germans.</span> <span id="s549">And they were used for military transport to people outside France.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: The Germans were ?</span> <span id="s551">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Did you know why, was there any reason?</span> <span id="s553">A: Because we were on the list of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: So they were some place?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: They put everybody that they could into concentration camps, in France.</span> <span id="s556">Most the concentration camps that they put people in were either too full or too far away.</span> <span id="s557">So what they did, and I think a lot of people don't realize that, is they invented concentration camps.</span> <span id="s558">And the places, the two places they sent us afterwards, I forget, was an invented concentration camps.</span> <span id="s559">They didn't have the horror of a place like .</span> <span id="s560">Plus there are these three levels of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s561">There were the ones that we never experienced were the death camps.</span> <span id="s562">Then there were the ones that I never experienced which was the and I guess to some degree the concentration camps in Germany and Poland were like that too.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">They weren't death camps because you weren't killed there, but you died there.</span> <span id="s564">You died of starvation and mostly you died of disease.</span> <span id="s565">Because you can deal with starvation to some extent, better than to deal with disease.</span> <span id="s566">And then there was the third kind which were like the ones that we were in.</span> <span id="s567">Where if you could manage somehow to get a little bit of freedom and to deal with the people in the town, you manage to survive.</span> <span id="s568">And then you were put under village arrest sometimes and house arrest other times.</span> <span id="s569">If you were put under village arrest, that was really good.</span> <span id="s570">If you were put under house arrest, that was pretty bad.</span> <span id="s571">Now since most of the people found their way to these camps -- for Eastern European Jews, who had moved to the South of France warmed there way, but still didn't speak French -- we did.</span> <span id="s572">We were accepted by everybody, everywhere that we went as being French speakers.</span> <span id="s573">I told you about that woman that I met who asked me, was I for Jews or Belgians.</span> <span id="s574">We were for Belgians, we were one of them.</span> <span id="s575">And so it was very different and I could go to school and make friends with my teachers and make friends with my school mates.</span> <span id="s576">We read the books and we get benefits of going to school.</span> <span id="s577">So my life was normal and then just totally disrupted.</span> <span id="s578">Was totally different, but at least there was a base, a connection in my life.</span> <span id="s579">I never felt unconnected.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: you talk about being a concentration camp, I'm trying to understand about how it was set up?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: It wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Also, so I don't interrupt you again, what's the difference for you between house and village arrest?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s584">House arrest under which I found myself in for a very short time, you had to stay in your house.</span> <span id="s585">You were really -- and the villages were very small.</span> <span id="s586">We are talking about a village here where a large village is maybe a 150 people.</span> <span id="s587">I mean 500 people is a large village and a 150 is pretty normal.</span> <span id="s588">You're talking about a village where -- which is very, very primitive.</span> <span id="s589">I mean some people have privies and not have to go out and use the fields.</span> <span id="s590">You're talking about people where some people have and some people have to stand behind the plow themselves plowing the field.</span> <span id="s591">You know when we get into the town that I went to in 1953, I was just 20.</span> <span id="s592">And they had just put in running water the year before and they were talking about now electricity.</span> <span id="s593">And you're talking about a town -- I mean it was 15 kilometers on one side, the fourth largest city in the country.</span> <span id="s594">You're talking about very, very primitive stuff here.</span> <span id="s595">So when your under house arrest in a place like that, you're going to go crazy.</span> <span id="s596">That is like being in jail.</span> <span id="s597">And the people who would oversee this house arrest were Germans because there were German patrols, very few of them.</span> <span id="s598">Which, had been installed in the villages.</span> <span id="s599">I keep saying towns, but villages is such a strange word to use in the United States, but I always mean village when I say town.</span> <span id="s600">These people were the ones that were supervising us, you know.</span> <span id="s601">And I don't know what the penalty was for breaking the law, but I imagine that it would be very severe.</span> <span id="s602">Like instant removal to a real concentration camp.</span> <span id="s603">Now I say here concentration camp but there weren't concentration camps, they were holding places.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">That is what they were, holding tanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: How many people were in these holding tanks?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Well, I don't know.</span> <span id="s607">I think maybe about 20 to 40 maybe.</span> <span id="s608">Q: All Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Ah-huh.</span> <span id="s610">All the people there not living there who were not Jewish, were townspeople.</span> <span id="s611">Now I remember where we lived and how it was.</span> <span id="s612">We lived in a house that belonged to the priest and I guess he had rented it.</span> <span id="s613">I don't know if he rented it to us or the Germans or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s614">But you seen pictures of Welch Villages where the street is like this and then the -- kind of a side street like this, with a wall and then the house is behind the wall and there's this walking place, then we lived in one of those.</span> <span id="s615">And next door to us, there lived an old lady who was suppose to be totally incontinent, the feces had made a whole in her bed and I remember the interest in that you know.</span> <span id="s616">An eight or nine year old this was fascinating thing to hear.</span> <span id="s617">And next to her lived a family who had a boy that was a couple years younger than I was and his name was and he was my great, great friend.</span> <span id="s618">And we went everywhere together, he is the one that would tell me stories about this incontinent lady.</span> <span id="s619">And we lived in a house with two big rooms and my parents put me in the front bedroom because it had curtains, no material to make any curtains or anything so in order for me to have my body in its nightgown or pajamas or whatever were exposed than for them to be in the front room.</span> <span id="s620">And I don't remember, but anything about the kitchen, except obviously we must have had a wood burning stove and in the back we had a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful garden.</span> <span id="s621">And we had some pear trees that were those pears that -- I can still smell them.</span> <span id="s622">And we had a huge plum tree, huge, huge plum tree and not plums, Italian plums.</span> <span id="s623">And behind the house, we had a bush and it just smelled so wonderful and we had -- there were almonds and there were walnuts now of course, nobody ate the corn in France at that time it was all for animals, if you could grow corn.</span> <span id="s624">And that's the town that we grew wheat but, the Germans of course took everything.</span> <span id="s625">I mean we grew all that stuff, we know but the Germans took it all.</span> <span id="s626">Anyway, I remember one time the bakery decided that he was going to save as much wheat as he could and hide it.</span> <span id="s627">And when a lot of people were cleaning and we clean enough that he didn't have enough sugar, but he said that he was going to bake cookies for the children.</span> <span id="s628">And which we were gone for five hours, outside the bakery but we all got a cookie.</span> <span id="s629">That was the only thing sweet that I ever ate during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Did the Germans, who guarded, were they ?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: I don't remember, I think I put a lot of that out of my mind and really buried it and refused to deal with it.</span> <span id="s632">Just as I refuse to deal with the fact that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s633">I don't know if I knew that I was Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s634">The first time that I remember knowing that I was Jewish they said that I was 13 or 14.</span> <span id="s635">And I think that I just buried all of that.</span> <span id="s636">Just didn't want to deal with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: But you must have seen soldiers, did they have dogs?</span> <span id="s638">A: Oh yeah, yeah, but I put it out of my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: So you can't remember it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: No.</span> <span id="s641">I can't remember anything except the pleasant things.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: ?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Um-hum.</span> <span id="s644">I remember my school teacher, I remember the school was divided into two parts, the boy's side and the girl's side and usually in schools then -- country schools like that the husband and wife would teach school.</span> <span id="s645">And I remember going -- when I went back to see them, I was 20 years old.</span> <span id="s646">I'd teach at this school and one of the teachers said "Ah, that's little Helene, who wasn't always very good."</span> <span id="s647">You know, I remember reading novels for the first time.</span> <span id="s648">I remember I was very young reading a Mid Summer's Night Dream.</span> <span id="s649">Which, I thought wonderful.</span> <span id="s650">But then I remember reading a story which really was not a child's story.</span> <span id="s651">And I remember the plot of it perfectly well.</span> <span id="s652">So then when I read it as an adult I said goodness, I really did remember that story, you know.</span> <span id="s653">What did we have to eat, I remember on my birthday in 1941 when I gathered about 25 kids that was -- I think is what the village had.</span> <span id="s654">And I brought them all to my house for my birthday.</span> <span id="s655">And my mother produced a couple of onions, which is all she had.</span> <span id="s656">But, it was okay.</span> <span id="s657">I mean I was very disappointed, I mean very, very disappointed, but it was okay we got the onions, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: When you talk about this time in the concentration camp, it doesn't sound much like a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: That's what I keep --</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Sounds like you had a nice little life.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: That's what I keep telling you it wasn't a concentration camp, we were under village arrest.</span> <span id="s662">Q: You had to live in this village until --</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: We could not move out of it.</span> <span id="s664">Okay.</span> <span id="s665">Now eventually we left and we tried to escape but when we came back we were put under house arrest.</span> <span id="s666">And that was very very bad.</span> <span id="s667">When we were in village arrest my father went out and -- you see my father was brough up on a farm when he was a child and he's very clever with things and he knows how to make things grow and to with machinery and make it do whatever he wants it to do.</span> <span id="s668">He's just one of these people that just seems to have a way with everything.</span> <span id="s669">And so he became friends with some of the farmers and he would work for them, of course it was for free.</span> <span id="s670">But it was never for free they would give him a pregnant rabbit, a duck with some eggs.</span> <span id="s671">Though we always had things, and food and at one point we had these neighbors who lived -- I guess that is when we lived in .</span> <span id="s672">We had these neighbors who were very Jewish, I mean the man was a chauffer, they were very religious and they had a grandmother who really couldn't .</span> <span id="s673">So my father decided to build her a little privy (ph) which she put in the little shed in the back, which she had to share with two goblins.</span> <span id="s674">Turkey goblins, which my father had gotten.</span> <span id="s675">Again from some farmers which and we had gotten a who we called Hecter (ph), I guess we called him Adolf, not Hecter (ph).</span> <span id="s676">And one day there was this wonderful feast and usually when they killed a pig, you know, the slaughtered a pig, the children from the house when the pig was slaughtered the kids would be allowed to stay home from school, but I wasn't.</span> <span id="s677">And I remember just hearing that pig just squealing and I was in school and I had to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Anyway, eventually I came back.</span> <span id="s679">And it was wonderful, people would recite poetry and people would get up on the table and let go and sing.</span> <span id="s680">You know, and there was a lot of wine flowing.</span> <span id="s681">There wasn't food, because we didn't have food because the Germans took much of that.</span> <span id="s682">But we did manage to secrete enough of the pig, you know.</span> <span id="s683">And then once in a while we'd kill a goose or something and render its fat and put the goose into the fat, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">And you would have meat to eat along with the goose fat.</span> <span id="s685">You could spread on whatever, potatoes or whatever vegetable that you had.</span> <span id="s686">So that is how we lived, we went to school and I played with the kids and I'd play with them after school and my parents talked to me and I read a lot of books and it was very disruptive, but I don't remember the bad things, I just refuse to remember the bad things.</span> <span id="s687">But I do that as a adult.</span> <span id="s688">I have a very very hard time remembering bad things.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: And wherever you went, it seems the people that lived in these villages were all very well</span></p> <p><span id="s690">?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Pretty much so, to us anyway.</span> <span id="s692">And , the mayor and his wife told my parents that they wanted to adopt me if anything bad would happen to my parents, they were going to pass me off as their child.</span> <span id="s693">And everyone in the village said that it was okay.</span> <span id="s694">They would ask me and since I spoke French, the Germans wouldn't know.</span> <span id="s695">And they gave me some sort of Catholic instruction so I could deal with that a little more easily.</span> <span id="s696">I still didn't know that I was Jewish, I just did know that I wasn't Catholic.</span> <span id="s697">Or a practicing Catholic.</span> <span id="s698">Because to me, there were only two religions.</span> <span id="s699">Either you were a practicing Catholic or you weren't.</span> <span id="s700">And you know, that was so common in Belgium and France at that time.</span> <span id="s701">Nobody was Protestant, nobody was Jewish, nobody was Moslem.</span> <span id="s702">You were Catholic and you practiced or you didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Did the adults, at this point have much information about what was happening in Eastern Europe that you were aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: No, at that time, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s705">My parents told me in 1942 is when they started becoming aware of what happened.</span> <span id="s706">I think that was true everywhere, wasn't it?</span> <span id="s707">Pretty much.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Through the radio or through other organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: We weren't in contact with any organization, only the free French.</span> <span id="s710">And they weren't really interested in anything that wasn't military.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: I also understand maybe that your parents had no connection with this but Southern France, there were efforts to get people over to Switzerland and Spain?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Some people did get over to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s713">Our neighbors, the chauffer playing neighbors, did get over to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s714">I believe they were and concentration camps.</span> <span id="s715">That's what my parents had told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Do you know why your parents decided that Spain was going ?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: I have absolutely no idea.</span> <span id="s718">Thinking about it, I would think that my parents would have thought that that was one step closer to the United States and it might have been easier to deal with the mountains that were already half way on than to have to start from the bottom and cross over.</span> <span id="s719">More difficult mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: But your dad wasn't involved in any organization -- you know crime -- communist organizations or any political organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: He was involved with the political resistance in a very, very small way, when we were living in .</span> <span id="s722">Somebody asked him and my mother if he could help bringing food out to the .</span> <span id="s723">And I remember that they went up most nights one of the two of them would walk.</span> <span id="s724">That was because they had a bicycle.</span> <span id="s725">And, they knew their way around.</span> <span id="s726">So they did do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Anything else that you want to tell me about France?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: No.</span> <span id="s729">Just that is a really good feeling with me -- it left a feeling of closeness and compassion.</span> <span id="s730">And I guess that is why when people ask me what I am, I don't tell them that I'm Belgium, I tell them I am French.</span> <span id="s731">Now of course, I tell them that I am American.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Were there -- in these villages that you were in under village arrest, were all the refugees Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: As far as I know.</span> <span id="s734">As far as I know.</span> <span id="s735">And the reason that I think so is because they all spoke a different language.</span> <span id="s736">They all spoke either Yiddish or German or Polish.</span> <span id="s737">And, I only spoke French and Russian.</span> <span id="s738">So I couldn't understand them at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: And you never had to pretend that you weren't German, which was ?</span> <span id="s740">A Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: So you were able to get into Spain?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: So we went on our way to Spain.</span> <span id="s743">I'll tell you that something that was interesting is the reason I went to Spain is because a point in time the Germans started emptying the villages of the Jews.</span> <span id="s744">And the first time that it happened I remember waking up in the morning and one to two families had just disappeared.</span> <span id="s745">And then the next night another couple families just disappeared.</span> <span id="s746">And then my parents said, oh time for us to disappear.</span> <span id="s747">So, we did at -- what my parents did is they would leave right after dark and I guess my father had already done a little bit of -- what's the word that I am looking for -- casing of the joint.</span> <span id="s748">And we would head out to the barn and we would hide in the barn in the hay.</span> <span id="s749">And in the morning we would leave, just before sunrise and go home.</span> <span id="s750">And we did this -- I think nine days in a row and one night for sure -- maybe two nights I remember being almost discovered because the Germans came by riffling through the straw in the barn where we were hiding.</span> <span id="s751">And that was the fourth time that I was really scared.</span> <span id="s752">I mean that was total terror.</span> <span id="s753">Total, total terror.</span> <span id="s754">Because I knew that was instant death.</span> <span id="s755">And-- but they didn't find us and we headed back to our house and I guess what had happened is that they came to our house and found that we weren't there and so we were to be deported the next day, and we left.</span> <span id="s756">And that is when we crossed the border the first time.</span> <span id="s757">As I said, we were found.</span> <span id="s758">And we were put into a -- we were put into this school yard which had barbed wire around it and as I said 14 of the 17 people were sent off to transports immediately, and we were not.</span> <span id="s759">And we left again, we were sent back to our house.</span> <span id="s760">We were kept in the school yard and I don't remember if it was overnight or one or two or three days.</span> <span id="s761">It served as no importance really as we were left there.</span> <span id="s762">And eventually we were sent back to a house and the moment that we were set free in our house we had left for the mountains again and that is when we crossed to Endora (ph) with these two men.</span> <span id="s763">And then we went to Spain and I told you about living in Spain.</span> <span id="s764">And when my parents-- when my parents got out of jail she was put into a pensoloni (ph) where she again was free to go around Barcelona but not free to leave Barcelona at all.</span> <span id="s765">And this pensoloni (ph) was pretty vile.</span> <span id="s766">You know men were making a profit as big a profit as he could now the feeding and his charges but nobody really cared.</span> <span id="s767">And there wasn't really anything to do, my parents played cards and learned English out of an English book.</span> <span id="s768">And I didn't go to school and I didn't remember what I did.</span> <span id="s769">I remember that I wasn't very motivated to do anything.</span> <span id="s770">And at a lost, lost of my time, lost of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: How long?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Months, but I don't remember how many?</span> <span id="s773">It's just very vague and very blurry and very unpleasant and all I remember is that the men's jail, the men got fed twice a day and they got fed a sort of watery-cabbage soup and the cabbage soup smell was all over the town of Barcelona, the city of Barcelona.</span> <span id="s774">I loved , I always had.</span> <span id="s775">I don't even remember seeing how beautiful that city was.</span> <span id="s776">It was filled with beggars there's at least three families of beggars per block because of the Civil War.</span> <span id="s777">It was -- I remember the market.</span> <span id="s778">Beautiful fish and shrimp and squid and octopus.</span> <span id="s779">But I don't remember vegetables of meat, but I remember the fish.</span> <span id="s780">It was just glorious, because I hadn't seen anything like that ever.</span> <span id="s781">Even from the seaports just absolutely miraculous with all that fish, you know.</span> <span id="s782">So this is about all that I remember Spain, not a pleasant memory at all.</span> <span id="s783">And then I remember being -- oh shortly after -- before we got to Spain before they even tried putting us into jail, they tried to repatriate (ph) us, send us back to France.</span> <span id="s784">So my mother tried to get me to run away and I remember her shoving and shoving and shoving me and tell me that I had to get away and she had given me the name and the address of the joint in Barcelona and she said that I have to get there somehow you have to get there because they would take care of me.</span> <span id="s785">And I didn't want to leave her and I remember which is far, it was incredible but I got back on the train with them and we got sent back to France and the guards at the border refused to take us in and sent us back to Spain.</span> <span id="s786">They were French and the French were being very cooperative with the refugees who had gone over the side, you know.</span> <span id="s787">So we went back to Spain and that is when we were put back into jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Now I remember you telling me when you were first put into jail you were ?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s790">That is because we were dealing with this family called the Hartoff (ph) and my mother wanted to send messages to my dad and so they had gotten a piece of chocolate somehow.</span> <span id="s791">A nice little piece of chocolate with a wrap around it maybe this big and it looked very small to me and it was small and the only thing that looked chocolate was this enormous and very tempting to me and I remember my parents would put little messages inside the wrapper and I would take the messages from one to the other back and fourth.</span> <span id="s792">Oh I remember how they got that piece of chocolate; my father said that he sold his wedding ring to get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Now this is a different family than the German family?</span> <span id="s794">A: No this is the family --</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: This is the family's house that you tried to burn down?</span> <span id="s796">A: Um-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: How long did you live with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: At least three months maybe more.</span> <span id="s799">At least until my mother got out of jail, about three months -- it was three to six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: The was before this?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: No after when my mother got out of jail and my father was sent to the .</span> <span id="s802">Q: So what happened next, you were in this for months --</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: And after that what happened is Quakers got this blah, blah, blah boat together, this convoy, they organized this convoy and the joint let my name -- made me a part of that convoy and I was shipped from Spain to Portugal to await the arrival of this boat and we were so were many other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: You went by boat?</span> <span id="s805">A: No I went by --</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: I mean ship --</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: No, okay, I was transported by train and I was sent to Portugal by train along with so many other children.</span> <span id="s808">And I think that we waited there until there were enough for a boat load -- about 250.</span> <span id="s809">Because I think altogether there were 500 of us and we went in two boats.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Just back tracking here, what -- as a kid you were so close to your parents, what was your feelings about leaving your parents to go to Portugal?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Close to my parents.</span> <span id="s812">But, I wasn't -- I hated my parents in a good healthy child-like way.</span> <span id="s813">I trusted them .</span> <span id="s814">I guess pretty normal feelings towards them and hated them bitterly because they put all these restrictions.</span> <span id="s815">I trusted them because I knew that they would always take care of me.</span> <span id="s816">I was pretty adventurous.</span> <span id="s817">I think that at that time I had learned like I really liked to live on the edge.</span> <span id="s818">I thought that was the only way to live and I came to realize much later in my life how other people have always lives is because I learned during that time that was the only way to live.</span> <span id="s819">As far as I was concerned there was no other way.</span> <span id="s820">There was no safety in anything and so that was the norm.</span> <span id="s821">And so I left my parents to go to Portugal an extension of the norm.</span> <span id="s822">If bad things had happened to me and to rescue me in some way.</span> <span id="s823">You know what I'm trying to say or is that too foreign?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s825">It looks like you're telling me that doing something like that seemed unusual, but you assume if anything went wrong, your parents would somehow --</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s827">Nothing was unusual, I wasn't clingy at all.</span> <span id="s828">And they weren't with me and so I guess I grew up with a healthy disrespect for adult supervision.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: What did you know of Portugal?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: No.</span> <span id="s831">What was there to be frightened of?</span> <span id="s832">What else was there left, you know.</span> <span id="s833">Compared to children who had seen much worst horror, there had more to be frightened of than I did.</span> <span id="s834">Those horrors of day to day, I never did you know.</span> <span id="s835">My life was totally but apart from 4, 5 times of fear, there wasn't that type of fear.</span> <span id="s836">I mean I had a girlfriend for a while that was four years old.</span> <span id="s837">That her maid hit her.</span> <span id="s838">That her family had hit her with a book case and the Germans came in and shot her parents in front of her.</span> <span id="s839">And she was 16 and had snow-white hair.</span> <span id="s840">She had something to be frightened of.</span> <span id="s841">I had another girlfriend then went from Finland to Italy.</span> <span id="s842">She started out at 4 or 5 and she had nothing to be frightened of.</span> <span id="s843">It was that kind of thing, you just kept going, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: So you went to Portugal and you went on this trip with a lot of kids?</span> <span id="s845">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s846">But not that many, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Where were they from -- how old were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: They were between the ages of 6 and 15, maybe 14.</span> <span id="s849">They were all from France and Spain.</span> <span id="s850">And I believe they had originally been from those countries and more likely from Germany and Poland and the Netherlands and they had winded there way to catch us with -- were able to gather them up for the Quakers' boats of which there were two.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Did you make friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Ah, did I make friends?</span> <span id="s853">Yeah, the way you make friends in a boarding school.</span> <span id="s854">You make friends with a lot of people but you didn't make close friends because there wasn't enough time.</span> <span id="s855">We were put in this convent where we all had one thing that we wanted to do and that was to make the nuns totally miserable for no reason but to amuse ourselves.</span> <span id="s856">Find toads and put them in their beds and tear up sheets and do bad things for the sake of doing bad things.</span> <span id="s857">Tell awful stories about those nuns, just awful stories.</span> <span id="s858">I don't remember any of them but I remember that was the order of the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: And you think maybe that was an expression of some control?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: It's hard to tell at that age, you know.</span> <span id="s861">I mean that is what you read in all the 19th century novels of kids of that age doing probably -- but I don't think that the war was related or more experience related --but more age related.</span> <span id="s862">Eventually we got on a ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Now were these European Quakers or American Quakers?</span> <span id="s864">A: I didn't meet any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: So who was in charge of you -- organizing this -- who were the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Damned if I know.</span> <span id="s867">You see I have no recollection of any supervisory other than the nuns.</span> <span id="s868">Eventually we got put on the boat and as far as I'm concerned nobody was in charge of us.</span> <span id="s869">All I remember is that the sailors thought that he was very amusing to have us and the sailors told me they were going to teach me proper American manners.</span> <span id="s870">Teach me how to say thank you to everybody and you know.</span> <span id="s871">So a European little girl sat down and curtsied everywhere I went.</span> <span id="s872">So I bowed and curtsied and then they taught me to say "fuck you" which was the first thing that I said to my aunt when I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s873">And I said that and I had no idea what I was saying to them.</span> <span id="s874">The innocence and they didn't speak English so, tell me that that boat was filled with bread baskets.</span> <span id="s875">But as soon as the bread was put out, it was eaten up.</span> <span id="s876">I remember and I don't know how this happened these two men to which we had crust were on my boat.</span> <span id="s877">And I remember we went by authorities and kids came up to the boat and the people came up to the boat and the people came up to the boats from little ships and climbed up the boat.</span> <span id="s878">And came with pineapples I never had eaten one and those two men had enough money to buy me sugarcane and pineapple which was the first time that I tasted either one of them.</span> <span id="s879">And I don't remember what they were doing on that boat with it.</span> <span id="s880">If it was in their way or if there wasn't enough room but I know that they were on that boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Do you remember how long the trip was?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: No, I don't.</span> <span id="s883">I remember that we arrived as far as I remember we arrived in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s884">So I guess it must have been -- I don't remember -- what's that city in Pennsylvania -- there is a port and I think we got to Pennsylvania and then we were put on a train and the train brought us to a school.</span> <span id="s885">So it must have been June.</span> <span id="s886">Must have been summer because school was out and up in New York State around Mt. Pleasant, just north of New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: In 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: June or July or August.</span> <span id="s889">You know it was summer time because school was out and it put us there and they set us up style to play outside on the playground.</span> <span id="s890">I remember seeing things that I never seen before.</span> <span id="s891">The slides that they had in those days.</span> <span id="s892">Just the two bars with no nothing between the two bars, you don't remember those slides?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yeah, just two bars and nothing in between.</span> <span id="s895">You know and you just went down the bars, they're fun and swing sets and things like that.</span> <span id="s896">My parents put down the address of there only known relative who is a cousin of my fathers who lived in Pittsburg.</span> <span id="s897">And sewn it in my coat pocket on my coat lining.</span> <span id="s898">And he was contacted and he said he would have me.</span> <span id="s899">But he really didn't think that he should.</span> <span id="s900">Anyway, should just have me come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">That is exactly what happened .</span> <span id="s902">Andre was contacted at the same time that he was combing these lists and I just arrived and he had called my cousin -- my mother's cousin to let me know where he was.</span> <span id="s903">So anyway, it was arranged that I should go and live with them.</span> <span id="s904">And it was a good arrangement because these were people that really knew me.</span> <span id="s905">And he was with my dad when I was born and he known me as soon as my dad had seen me.</span> <span id="s906">But you know, people thought of as our very closest relatives there daughter was -- ah, I don't know eight years old, my big sister so they took me over.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: You don't have any more memories of what that felt like , what you did -- did you play or you just don't ?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: I'm sure they had plenty of food.</span> <span id="s909">I'm sure that they had more food than I ever seen since the war begun.</span> <span id="s910">I don't remember any of that.</span> <span id="s911">All I remember is, I remember my life in New York after it was all over.</span> <span id="s912">I made friends.</span> <span id="s913">I was a little girl living in an apartment house, broken down and a grocery store was put in it.</span> <span id="s914">My local grocery store after I lived in New York as an adult, I remember going to school in New York.</span> <span id="s915">I remember a lot of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: What about --</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Before I went to live with my parents, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: When did your parents come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: 1944.</span> <span id="s920">Because in 1945 -- it might have been in 1945.</span> <span id="s921">The end of the war because I remember when the end of the war came and my father came to the school that day and he said we are going to have to go out and celebrate and we went out to the movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
