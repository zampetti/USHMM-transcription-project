March 20, 1990.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Interviewer: Elaine Snyderman I grew up as a small child in the city of Moscow.</span> <span id="s13">We lived in an area of many different kinds of families.</span> <span id="s14">There was no area in Moscow set aside for different backgrounds of people, they are all mixed, there is no division nor any nationalistic area at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">There was no such thing as community in Moscow, it is a very big city, very homogeneous.</span> <span id="s16">Not separate communities at all, it is only in America that we have seen this.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">In our family, I was an only child.</span> <span id="s18">My father was a doctor, and my mother is a doctor, but they have now retired.</span> <span id="s19">My mother is a gynecologist and my father deals with infections - infectious diseases.</span> <span id="s20">Actually he was not in the Ministry of Health, he was an administrator for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">We cannot say how our standard of living compared to our neighbors because we cannot say that we were living in an area with a certain income, so I cannot compare the way we lived in this manner.</span> <span id="s22">There may be fine, highly educated, people and right next door would be very poor people.</span> <span id="s23">The neighborhood was really very mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Our life, in comparison with our surroundings in Russia, was Good - not Bad.</span> <span id="s25">When I was living with my parents, we had a nice apartment, it was big, it was three rooms, I cannot describe it in detail.</span> <span id="s26">It was something like the apartment we live in now.</span> <span id="s27">But this was rare in Moscow.</span> <span id="s28">Usually people there live in tiny apartments.</span> <span id="s29">This was in a large building.</span> <span id="s30">Practically everyone in Moscow lives in a high-rise apartment, there is no such thing as individual houses in Moscow.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">The building was built in 1953, it was not too old.</span> <span id="s32">Actually, it was built shortly after I was born.</span> <span id="s33">Actually, I do not remember a lot from my childhood.</span> <span id="s34">I remember more about what it was like when I was older, in school - I mean, about fourteen or fifteen years old.</span> <span id="s35">Both my parents were working and I remember more about school than about my home.</span> <span id="s36">In Russia, unlike here, children can stay in school after their classes are over, until time for their parents to come home.</span> <span id="s37">I guess this is similar to what you call day care.</span> <span id="s38">Other than that, it was much like public school here.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">It was a very good school, and I felt I had a nice childhood.</span> <span id="s40">I graduated from a specialized English school.</span> <span id="s41">I started studying English when I was in the second form, second grade - when I was about eight years old.</span> <span id="s42">But, I was very slow in English.</span> <span id="s43">We studied English four or five days a week, about 45 minutes per class.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">It is difficult for me to remember anything extraordinary when I was growing up.</span> <span id="s45">I don't remember any special holidays or events.</span> <span id="s46">My parents were very busy, they worked very hard.</span> <span id="s47">Their salary was not very good but was good enough according by Soviet standards.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">I was supposed to help out around the home but I was not very good at this.</span> <span id="s49">I guess I was a bit lazy, but the house was empty all day and it was very small, so there was not much to do.</span> <span id="s50">My mother prepared the meals, she would stop on the way home, to pick up the food for the evening meal, this is very common in Russia.</span> <span id="s51">I don't remember what time we ate our dinner when I was a child, but when I was older, it wasn't too late, about 6:00 or 7:00 PM.</span> <span id="s52">Not too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">We did not really have a Jewish life in our home.</span> <span id="s54">But they don't let you forget that you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s55">On your passport it is written that you are a Jew - not Russian or Georgian, but Jew.</span> <span id="s56">My classmates in school knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s57">There was a Register Book at school where everything was listed, name, address, nationality, parents, all stuff relating to the student.</span> <span id="s58">In all the people in my class, I was the only one who was a Jew.</span> <span id="s59">I didn't feel too bad about this, no one made a big issue of it.</span> <span id="s60">Of course, when I was very young, maybe I felt some discomfort because I was not like others, because I did not understand what this was, but it was not a serious thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">My grandparents spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s62">They were around when I was very little and sometimes they spoke Yiddish together.</span> <span id="s63">Sometimes.</span> <span id="s64">They were much closer to the Jewish life before the Revolution.</span> <span id="s65">Both my grandfathers and both my grandmothers had good Jewish backgrounds, maybe not religious background, but they were brought up in the Ukraine, in Jewish neighborhoods.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">There are a lot of Jewish jokes in Russia, you know, Jews themselves like to make these jokes.</span> <span id="s67">But there was nothing seriously wrong in my childhood about my being a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">In my home, we did not celebrate any Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s69">The tradition was lost after the revolution, especially in the big cities.</span> <span id="s70">If they existed somewhere, it was not in the big cities, not in Moscow.</span> <span id="s71">In Kiev?</span> <span id="s72">maybe; in Odessa?</span> <span id="s73">maybe, but not in Moscow.</span> <span id="s74">There were very few religious Jewish families in the city, not just religion, Jews tried to forget their Jewish background because there was a feeling that there was no missionaries any more, just culture.</span> <span id="s75">Everybody was different but there were no differences from one another.</span> <span id="s76">This was a very strong feeling in the country, especially among educated Jews.</span> <span id="s77">Those who were living far from the capitols, such cities as Moscow and Leningrad, not very well educated because - well they were continuing to lead a Jewish life, but not in the cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Some of the first political discussions I became aware of were when I was about thirteen or fourteen years of age.</span> <span id="s79">I remember they talked about - people all around were criticizing Communism, the way of life, and the politics.</span> <span id="s80">This was after Stalin but people felt it was safe to make these criticisms in your own house, among your own friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">My parents had mostly Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s82">The Jews did have some common complaints that were different than the non-Jews, because of some persecution they experienced.</span> <span id="s83">No, not really persecution, more discrimination.</span> <span id="s84">To some extend, their opportunities were limited.</span> <span id="s85">My father definitely felt he had been held back in his field, because he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s86">It was difficult for Jews because Jews in general, were not allowed to have certain official positions.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">How and when this all began in Russia, I do not know.</span> <span id="s88">But then it began to be a common State policy against Jews.</span> <span id="s89">I do not know why, exactly.</span> <span id="s90">None of my parents had friends who were arrested or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">I do remember one thing about the "Doctor's Plot" back in 1952.</span> <span id="s92">My father had graduated from the Institute, what you call a University here, in 1953.</span> <span id="s93">Just after the doctors' case, so he was not allowed to enter the line of work that he wanted to.</span> <span id="s94">This was research, it was not logical, but he was sent to work in a village.</span> <span id="s95">This was not only because he was a Jew, most doctors were sent to work in villages, like a charity, in the country, for the country, so it was not an act of discrimination.</span> <span id="s96">By discrimination, it would be that he was sent to work at a research institute in Moscow, but then he was not allowed to enter.</span> <span id="s97">He was good enough, one of the best, but he had to practice in a small city.</span> <span id="s98">We can say it was discrimination; it was not really a tragic situation but he was disappointed.</span> <span id="s99">He was qualified but he was turned away.</span> <span id="s100">Of course, he was not the only one who was not allowed to enter, both Jews and other Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">At a very young age I decided that I wanted to be an architect.</span> <span id="s102">My parents were pleased with this decision.</span> <span id="s103">I have some talent in drawing and architecture is a very well established profession in Russia.</span> <span id="s104">I applied and was accepted into the School of Architecture.</span> <span id="s105">Of course, the government paid for my education.</span> <span id="s106">This was one of the best things in Russia.</span> <span id="s107">I was typical in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Our life in Russia was very smooth, very good.</span> <span id="s109">My wife and I decided two years ago (1988) that we would like to leave the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s110">My relatives left Russia, my cousin left first.</span> <span id="s111">Some other friends began leaving in the 70's.</span> <span id="s112">But, after school I ended my post-graduate course and then I had a very good job.</span> <span id="s113">I received my Masters Degree at the Moscow School of Architecture and then went to work at the State Company for Housing and while I was working I also did my research and dissertation for my PhD.</span> <span id="s114">This is not unusual in the Soviet.</span> <span id="s115">There are a lot of research centers where you can work and complete your degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">My dissertation was on housing, different technical devices that make things work better.</span> <span id="s117">All the architectural parts of housing.</span> <span id="s118">It has always been difficult in the Soviet Union to get housing completed quickly and efficiently to meet the total need.</span> <span id="s119">There is always a demand for cheap and typical housing.</span> <span id="s120">"Typical"- this is the policy of building in Soviet Union because typical, or standardized, housing is cheaper to build when the mechanical problems have been solved.</span> <span id="s121">If you are engaged in housing and the architecture of housing, this is what you are working toward.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">I was interested in all kinds of buildings, and I had many different projects.</span> <span id="s123">I had entered this company and so this was what I worked at.</span> <span id="s124">I worked there for thirteen years, it became boring.</span> <span id="s125">It did seem that I would be doing the same thing over and over, not because everything was boring, I managed to do some interesting things, I had fun with some small projects, but it is difficult to stay at the same point for years and years.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Those I knew, who had emigrated to the United States, no, no, a close friend of my parents went to Israel, but the friends of my age mostly went to the United States.</span> <span id="s127">My wife was also very interested in making a change.</span> <span id="s128">Things change so quick, I think I would have wanted to move on.</span> <span id="s129">The only problem was my parents.</span> <span id="s130">Don't forget, I have no brothers or sisters.</span> <span id="s131">I had been thinking of this for many years, since my best friend left in 1979 or 1980.</span> <span id="s132">Since then, we were seriously thinking about it.</span> <span id="s133">But, it was so far, it was so difficult to decide.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">My wife and I had different work situations, I had a very good career, and some recognition.</span> <span id="s135">I had a book published.</span> <span id="s136">I had some very interesting projects.</span> <span id="s137">I built a series of small, modest houses and then I participated in several competitions and won several awards.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">The State published my book.</span> <span id="s139">It was about residential interiors.</span> <span id="s140">It was written for the general public.</span> <span id="s141">They would learn how to arrange furniture, how to choose color for your apartment, what kinds of furniture there are, how to put together a kitchen, all kinds of things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">So the government was trying to encourage people to live better, with more comfortable things.</span> <span id="s143">Of course, there are a lot of facts about Russia that you do not know here.</span> <span id="s144">You hear that Russians are all so poor, this is not especially true, at least in Moscow.</span> <span id="s145">The standard of living for educated people in Moscow is kind of high.</span> <span id="s146">People are more interested in culture, they do not watch so much television.</span> <span id="s147">They are interested in literature, etc., of course, they do not have the opportunity to buy cars and houses and they spend more time in cultural pursuits.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">We had no problems when we made application to leave.</span> <span id="s149">No problems at all.</span> <span id="s150">This was in March of 1988.</span> <span id="s151">We got clearance for the States in June of 1988.</span> <span id="s152">Things were moving very quickly then.</span> <span id="s153">My parents were pleased with our decision.</span> <span id="s154">At their age, they felt making such a change themselves would have been very difficult.</span> <span id="s155">Yet they did not try to do this when they were younger.</span> <span id="s156">I would like for them to join us here, and they will apply.</span> <span id="s157">When, depends on our decisions.</span> <span id="s158">They will be in Washington late this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">We arranged and paid for our own transportation here and we arrived in November of '88.</span> <span id="s160">It took us several months to arrange everything and we came through Austria and Switzerland.</span> <span id="s161">Also, we stayed two and a half months in Austria and Italy, it was great, I worked there as a tour guide.</span> <span id="s162">I could use my knowledge of architecture in Rome and Venice.</span> <span id="s163">It was quite nice, we had a very good time in Venice.</span> <span id="s164">We stayed in Ladispoly, a little place near Rome where very many Russians live.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">It is difficult to describe our life here in America.</span> <span id="s166">Things are very different here.</span> <span id="s167">Everything is new and difficult.</span> <span id="s168">There is some feeling that we should learn more about our Jewish background, but not merely from a religious aspect.</span> <span id="s169">Our son wants to learn more, to do more.</span> <span id="s170">It is interesting to see a Jewish Community and to find Jewish organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">I have relatives here in Chicago, they have been here for eight years.</span> <span id="s172">They sponsored us so that we could come here.</span> <span id="s173">It did not cost him anything, but he sent a letter saying he could take care of us, as close friends.</span> <span id="s174">We liked Chicago because it is a big city and we came her also because we were a bit afraid of New York.</span> <span id="s175">There is not a good Russian community there (what does 'bad Russian' community mean?)</span> <span id="s176">--- Well, there are specials always on cable TV, we watched them and then I saw those very sharp characters and there are a lot of problems.</span> <span id="s177">There is a sort of Russian-Jewish Mafia there in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Architecture here in Chicago is very good, the technical field here is very good, we felt it might be easier to find jobs here.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">When we came to Chicago we stayed at my relatives house for a while, three weeks.</span> <span id="s180">My relative had applied through the Jewish Family Service here, so he referred me there.</span> <span id="s181">Also we went through HIAS, because they had contacted him when he came over and interviewed him.</span> <span id="s182">They contacted him to see if he was willing, or able, to be a sponsor.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">We started working in March.</span> <span id="s184">Our son was able to start into school right away.</span> <span id="s185">He had studied for two years in the special English school.</span> <span id="s186">He had a comparatively easy time at school, he had close friends that he knew.</span> <span id="s187">He also makes friends easily and is much more secure than others.</span> <span id="s188">It was not difficult for him.</span> <span id="s189">At first he went to a public school, but then we received a scholarship for a Jewish school, Hillel Torah.</span> <span id="s190">But, we feel that there is less education for him here than there was in the same grade in Moscow.</span> <span id="s191">He is now in the seventh grade and in Moscow the seventh grade is very serious - physics, chemistry - very technical.</span> <span id="s192">Very serious in literature.</span> <span id="s193">Lots of competition in sports in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">We don't feel there is a conflict between what he is learning at the Jewish school and what he learns in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">In Italy and Austria we got a lot of help from the Joint Distribution.</span> <span id="s196">Our way of life in Russia was very different, we did not have any money.</span> <span id="s197">We sold what we had.</span> <span id="s198">What we earned there went toward the necessities, not for a car, or things like that.</span> <span id="s199">We came on the standard route, Italy, Rome and then the United States.</span> <span id="s200">We worked there while our papers were being processed.</span> <span id="s201">When we arrived in Chicago, the Jewish Family Service paid for our apartment, they gave us food, they gave us contacts, they gave us medical insurance for a certain period of time - which was very good.</span> <span id="s202">The Family Service helped us, with school, with counseling and guidance.</span> <span id="s203">The supervisor we dealt with was very good.</span> <span id="s204">She was Russian, she had been here about fifteen years, her name was Ida Bichkopf, she was excellent.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Now I am working for the second week on my second architectural job.</span> <span id="s206">My first job was with a medium-sized architectural firm.</span> <span id="s207">I am now at Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">What I miss most about Russia is my parents.</span> <span id="s209">In Russia there is difference between Russian, Jewish or Georgian.</span> <span id="s210">Here we are all Russians.</span> <span id="s211">If I had Jewish friends still in Russia, I would be concerned about them.</span> <span id="s212">Things change very quickly and It is amazing for us, we were not concerned about ourselves when we were there, but the change has been so quick.</span> <span id="s213">Glasnost has been good in many ways, but Jews are having a more difficult time.</span> <span id="s214">I hope that our parents are not in any danger.</span> <span id="s215">I don't think that they would allow actions against Jews in Moscow.</span> <span id="s216">The population in Moscow is well educated and I don't think there is a large background there for this movement.</span> <span id="s217">I hope so, but things are completely different since we are here.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Pamjat'?</span> <span id="s219">-- they are difficult but I don't think they have real support.</span> <span id="s220">But, people are so afraid of everything, they are so full of anger against the government, against the system.</span> <span id="s221">They want to find someone to accuse with their oldest faults, their historical faults, the Jews are obvious, some of them were the highest, first Communists.</span> <span id="s222">Of course, they were thrown out completely from the party, and the high ranks of government, completely from the higher ranks.</span> <span id="s223">As a rule they were allowed to be engaged only in Science or Industry but not in official circles.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">ADDENDUM: I think that you are not right when you say that all Russians hate Jews.</span> <span id="s225">It is the common anti-Semitism that is everywhere else.</span> <span id="s226">For hundreds of years there have been many Jews in the Soviet Union so anti-semitism is higher there than it would be in China where there are no Jews.</span> <span id="s227">.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">You are wrong when you say they don't want us to leave, they are pretty good to them - "Go to your Israel" they say.</span> <span id="s229">It is not that they invited me because they wanted to convince me, not they, themselves, but there is in Russia an official point of view or policy and it is the official action that you are doing if you are an official on the Civic Council.</span> <span id="s230">So if you are an official you have to give the official party policy and opinion first and, on the other side, you want some things yourself.</span> <span id="s231">So they wouldn't even try to convince me now not to leave Russia but -it was a policy!</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Somebody convinced them that they must try to persuade people into not leaving, so they try to convince them, especially young people, not to go.</span> <span id="s233">Particularly the well-educated ones.</span> <span id="s234">Now they are concerned that a lot of well-educated people are leaving.</span> <span id="s235">I have an architectural degree and this is a very highly educated level.</span> <span id="s236">But they are now letting all Jews go.</span> <span id="s237">They didn't want us to leave simply because this is the official policy.</span> <span id="s238">I don't know why, I think they are concerned about the political base of Russia when so many people are leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">ADDENDUM, August, 1990.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">(You said something about your father suffering discrimination after the Doctors Plot, and after he finished at the Medical Institute in 1953.</span> <span id="s241">You said that he was sent to work at a research institute but then he was not allowed to enter.)</span> <span id="s242">I wouldn't say that it was a real suffering from the system but it was, of course, one of the cases of discrimination.</span> <span id="s243">Because, after graduation among the best my father was sent to a very prestigious research center, in Moscow.</span> <span id="s244">The best students are usually sent there for prestigious research work, to gain their Doctorate Degree and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">But it was just the period of the Doctors Plot, in 1953, so my father was not allowed to enter and the only reason for that was because he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s246">And he was sent to a small village to practice.</span> <span id="s247">Although most of the doctors in that period were sent to small villages for practice, so I don't think it was a real suffering or very cruel discrimination.</span> <span id="s248">I wouldn't say so, but it is unfair and it was a one of the cases of anti-semitism.</span> <span id="s249">That is what I would think.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">(You, yourself, felt that you had not experienced anti-semitism, but you knew that your father had?)</span> <span id="s251">Yes.</span> <span id="s252">(How come you didn't?</span> <span id="s253">how do you explain this?)</span> <span id="s254">You know, there was a certain circle in Moscow, now everything is changed, by the way.</span> <span id="s255">I am speaking about my time being after my Institute, after my School of Architecture, in certain circles of architectural institutions and offices and studios, where there is no problem of anti-semitism.</span> <span id="s256">Sometimes, it is a little bit exaggerated, the suffering that Jews came through, or are coming through, in Russia.</span> <span id="s257">I am not comparing it with the times now, because all this Pamjat' and all this Fascist stuff, it is disgusting, a very terrible thing.</span> <span id="s258">But, when I was young, after the Institute there was no such environment that you could say was unbearable for Jews.</span> <span id="s259">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s260">At least I didn't experience it.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">(Since you have been here, have you felt yourself changing in some ways?</span> <span id="s262">in adapting to the American way of life?)</span> <span id="s263">It is difficult to say, certainly we have changed, and changed a lot.</span> <span id="s264">We have changed in our attitudes toward life, in our attitude towards perspective of our life, in our - I should say - responsibility for ourselves, for me and for our family.</span> <span id="s265">Which I feel is much stronger here than in Russia.</span> <span id="s266">I feel much more responsibility for our family and for our future.</span> <span id="s267">(Why is that?)</span> <span id="s268">Because, the work situation is more tough, and though we are really much better, much better than in Russia, and we enjoy this life, I am aware that tomorrow I can lose my job or I should save some money for my retirement, for example.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">I should save some money or do something for my kid to enter college, or enter university, a problem that we didn't have in Russia.</span> <span id="s270">We want it to be a good university, a good college.</span> <span id="s271">Now we can't even afford to think about a good education.</span> <span id="s272">I mean, paying from our own pocketbook, with our own money.</span> <span id="s273">All this I call responsibilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">I am praying my parents will come here in a year or two, and I will be responsible for them.</span> <span id="s275">They should begin a new life here, they will have no money, no savings, and so I will be responsible for their life, more than I would be in Russia.</span> <span id="s276">Lots of things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">(Would you say you have some regrets?)</span> <span id="s278">No.</span> <span id="s279">I am not saying that.</span> <span id="s280">On the contrary, I say that maybe this is the real life what we are dealing with here.</span> <span id="s281">You know, in Russia, maybe you are more sure in your future - maybe.</span> <span id="s282">But, what future is there?</span> <span id="s283">It is minimum money, it is being under the yoke of full politics, that is the future that we had there.</span> <span id="s284">We won't think about that.</span> <span id="s285">We have known these problems, some of us, but some of the things in Russia we liked better.</span> <span id="s286">For example, education.</span> <span id="s287">The problem of education is solved much better in Russia than it is here, I think so.</span> <span id="s288">Maybe I will change my mind.</span> <span id="s289">But now, it seems to me that it is much better there.</span> <span id="s290">The free education is a very good advantage.</span> <span id="s291">I think it is a crucial advantage in Russia.</span> <span id="s292">That may be the only thing that I can regret in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">(At this point, we are summarizing, I thought I would give you the opportunity to make some sort of a statement, if you wish to, to sum up your observations and I am curious as to whether you found any kind of a kinship here, a linkage with other Jewish people, even though the practices here are different than the practices there.</span> <span id="s294">Or did you feel that these people have really nothing to do with you but they are offering opportunities to Soviet Jewish immigrants?)</span> <span id="s295">Certainly, all the environment in the United States makes me to understand that here belongs a certain group of people, which is very clear here, and you should know and should understand and feel yourself a part of the Jewish community - although you are not religious, or so.</span> <span id="s296">And certainly I feel myself more Jewish than I felt in the U.S.S.R. Because of the fact of some kind of discrimination or persecution or unfair attitudes, since I was a Jew - it is like a negative experience to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s297">Here, I have a positive experience of being a Jew, of belonging to a certain community, and I enjoy that!</span></p> <p><span id="s298">(Have you been to any Jewish weddings, funerals, or circumcisions in the Soviet Union?)</span> <span id="s299">No.</span> <span id="s300">(Was your father circumcised?)</span> <span id="s301">Yes.</span> <span id="s302">I was not.</span> <span id="s303">Because my parents were very far from any religious tradition.</span> <span id="s304">Although they did not forget that they were Jews, and they felt very deeply that they were Jews, but, they didn't seem that they were close to religious tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">(Now, your son has been circumcised here, would you consider being circumcised?)</span> <span id="s306">No.</span> <span id="s307">I didn't think about that.</span> <span id="s308">I didn't feel this was necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">(Your identity with the Jewish population, is it something that you can define any more than you have?)</span> <span id="s310">It is difficult to say, for example, when I read in the newspaper here, it always says the Korean community, Black community, another kind of national community and when I read that I felt that I have my own community.</span> <span id="s311">This is my own Jewish community, of the Jewish population of the United States.</span> <span id="s312">I did not feel that in Russia.</span> <span id="s313">In Russia, I simply had a stamp in my passport that I was a Jew and that is why I was not the same as any others.</span> <span id="s314">Here, there is a feeling that I have.</span> <span id="s315">I'm not sure if that is clear, or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">(Is there any other comment that you would like to make -In terms of the things we have discussed, or even something that we haven't discussed?)</span> <span id="s317">No, nothing, maybe you have something?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">(I think that you have answered most of my questions, and you are the kind of person I could ask questions of, indefinitely.</span> <span id="s319">Thank you.)</span></p></body></html>
