id="s12">Question: I'd like you to begin by telling me your name and your name at the time of the war, where you were born, and when you were born, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Sure.</span> <span id="s14">I was born on October 26th, '37 in a city called Debrecen in Hungary, and my given name was Veronica Suzannah.</span> <span id="s15">Or Hungarian, actually, it's Veronik Suzannah (ph).</span> <span id="s16">And my Hebrew name was Wiscolar (ph).</span> <span id="s17">My parents came -- both of them from religious homes, and while they were not Orthodox, they still kept very much the tradition, what you would call strong conservatives nowadays.</span> <span id="s18">And shortly or a couple of years after my birth, I assume my parents moved to a city that today is Romania called Kolozsvár or Cluj.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Actually, you didn't -- I don't you said your last name.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Oh, I'm so sorry.</span> <span id="s21">My family name was Moskovitz (ph) by birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Do you have any memories of Debrecen or you were too young?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My only memories of Debrecen is really my grandparents' house, which I am assuming I visited as a young child of three or four.</span> <span id="s24">Came to visit Grandma and Grandpa, and I had uncles and aunts there and spent wonderful times with them.</span> <span id="s25">Very pampered, very loved.</span> <span id="s26">It was very, very warm house.</span> <span id="s27">I remember my grandfather picking me up.</span> <span id="s28">They had this chandelier that hanging with little beads at the end, almost like a little skirt.</span> <span id="s29">And he used to pick me up so I can touch it and play with it.</span> <span id="s30">And I had really a lot of fond memories just remembering the furniture and remembering the smells of the kitchen and sitting around the table and eating and roaming around in the courtyard and playing outside.</span> <span id="s31">All of those memories are really kind of in my mind, very wonderful memories of visiting my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Did you have brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: I have an older brother, who is seven and a half years older than I am.</span> <span id="s34">And, of course, my older brother played a big role in my life, especially in those days.</span> <span id="s35">There were just the two of us, and because he was seven and a half years older, he had different interests.</span> <span id="s36">And aside from trying to pester me because he enjoyed seeing me screaming or laughing or whatever it was, really our relationship was like a younger sibling looking up to almost an adult.</span> <span id="s37">He was -- I almost always admired him, and I was in awe of him.</span> <span id="s38">He was -- the age differences were so great until we grew up to be adults.</span> <span id="s39">In adulthood, now that we are both adults, I consider him my younger brother.</span> <span id="s40">Because it turned out that I think I'm the more mature one and he's the softer one.</span> <span id="s41">So it's amazing how the roles switch later on in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">01:04:44</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What kind of business was your family in?</span> <span id="s44">Did your parents work, what kind of lifestyle?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Well, my father came from a little village near Debrecen.</span> <span id="s46">He was one of 13 children.</span> <span id="s47">There were -- actually, there were 15 children born to that family, and 13 of them grew up to adulthood.</span> <span id="s48">And they were of very modest means.</span> <span id="s49">My mother came from a much more prosperous background, but at the time of their marriage already times changed for the worse.</span> <span id="s50">And my grandparents didn't have what they had before, and so they had very little.</span> <span id="s51">My parents got married and for a while, they had a bakery.</span> <span id="s52">And then that fizzled away, and that's when they moved back to my grandparents' town, to Debrecen, where I was born.</span> <span id="s53">And from there, they picked up, and they went to Cluj because there was work in Cluj.</span> <span id="s54">And it turns out that my father in Cluj was just a laborer.</span> <span id="s55">They really lived in a very modest, modest life.</span> <span id="s56">They didn't have much, and my mother knitted a lot.</span> <span id="s57">And I don't know if she sold some of her knittings or not, but really at that time financially they were considered poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: I want to, I guess, ask you more about Cluj, because you were so young in Debrecen.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Did you have a sense of whether or not there was a strong Jewish community, if your family was friendly with neighbors who were not Jewish?</span> <span id="s61">I know that your family was religious, but I'm trying to get a sense of how they were integrated with community was.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: In the courtyard where we lived, it was kind of an apartment building that the front to the street, was a few stories high.</span> <span id="s63">But in the courtyard itself there was like what you would call a townhouse, one-level townhouses today, the attached homes.</span> <span id="s64">And it kind of surrounded, went like an L-shape.</span> <span id="s65">And we lived in one of those houses.</span> <span id="s66">Now, we had neighbors, most of them were Jewish neighbors.</span> <span id="s67">But we also had the manager of this courtyard, the manager of that apartment building who took care of the grounds and took care of the property, and he was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s68">We were very friendly.</span> <span id="s69">I remember playing with the children.</span> <span id="s70">I remember them putting up the Christmas tree and me helping hang up the walnuts on the branches of the tree.</span> <span id="s71">So the parents were very friendly.</span> <span id="s72">We lived in a community where, of course, there were quite a few Jewish families.</span> <span id="s73">Not Orthodox Jewish families, but modern Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">01:08:02 And yet, my parents were always very Zionistic, and they definitely saw to it that in spite of the fact that they didn't have a lot of money, so to speak, they raised us in a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s75">What would be like a Jewish day school today.</span> <span id="s76">My brother went to the Hebrew Gymnasium in Kolozsvár, and I was in the kindergarten that belonged to that school.</span> <span id="s77">And so he was already in the upper grades, and I was -- just before we were taken away, I was about to start first grade.</span> <span id="s78">In the kindergarten, of course, we learned about all the holidays and little Hebrew songs and Hungarian songs and dances and they read us stories.</span> <span id="s79">And everything that at that time they taught in a kindergarten.</span> <span id="s80">And I went to that kindergarten -- in the school, the children have to wear uniforms.</span> <span id="s81">So the uniforms were always navy and a white shirt.</span> <span id="s82">A navy uniform and a white shirt.</span> <span id="s83">That was the uniform for the Hebrew Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s84">The boys have to wear hats.</span> <span id="s85">And I think there was Star of David on the hat, if I'm not wrong.</span> <span id="s86">But even if it wasn't, by the time it approached 1943, everybody had to wear the Jewish star, no matter what, on the street.</span> <span id="s87">You could not walk out to the street without having the Jewish star sewn on your coat or sewn on your jacket or on your dress, depending on the season of the year.</span> <span id="s88">You really had to wear it like a badge on your chest.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Were you aware of any attacks, verbal or physical, on your family or on your brother or yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Only on my brother.</span> <span id="s91">I was not much aware of anything that was going on outside.</span> <span id="s92">I only was aware of the fact that I was totally forbidden to leave the courtyard where we lived.</span> <span id="s93">And I was always warned if I every set foot out of the courtyard, to make sure that I have on me something that has the Jewish star on it.</span> <span id="s94">Of course, being so young, my mother did not look forward to me setting out my foot outside the courtyard, no matter what.</span> <span id="s95">And that's understandable, but that was so impressed on me as a young child that I was really scared to step outside.</span> <span id="s96">And I liked to step outside, because when I stepped outside the courtyard in the basement of the building next door there was a candle factory.</span> <span id="s97">And I remember looking down there, I was fascinated how they made the candles.</span> <span id="s98">How they dipped it in wax with the wicks, you know, up and down going into the melted wax.</span> <span id="s99">And I was just fascinated by the whole process.</span> <span id="s100">So I looked to sit outside, you know, kind of stoop down and watch how they were doing those things, but I was really carefully monitored.</span> <span id="s101">I remember my brother coming home from school, and there was always an upheaval because he was chastised going to school, chastised coming back from school; he was taunted.</span> <span id="s102">And I must say, I had a very handsome brother that was not even -- initially was very handsome and the uniform looked great.</span> <span id="s103">But there were always -- harangued going to school and coming back from school and fist fights would ensue coming home.</span> <span id="s104">And also then in those days, people still rode in buggies and carriages and some buses and various transportation.</span> <span id="s105">So the kids really walked to school and came back from school.</span> <span id="s106">Nobody had cars, so nobody picked the children up.</span> <span id="s107">So it was a natural thing for him to walk to school and come back.</span> <span id="s108">And my father was a very ethical and moral man, but to some extent I think was very naive.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">01:12:06 And he felt that it's unbecoming a Jewish young man to fist fight.</span> <span id="s110">That this is not something that -- he didn't teach us that, and this against anything that we stand for.</span> <span id="s111">And that either you reason or you talk, but you don't fist fight.</span> <span id="s112">You are not a hooligan.</span> <span id="s113">If you fist fight, then you reduce yourself to the gutter level.</span> <span id="s114">And my brother came home one day, and he had somebody's footprint on his navy uniform.</span> <span id="s115">Obviously, somebody kicked him in his behind.</span> <span id="s116">And my father got so angry at my brother, and my brother was a very mild-mannered young man.</span> <span id="s117">But I guess there was just so much taunting that he could take and there on the way, and somebody physically attacked him.</span> <span id="s118">And somebody kicked him in his behind.</span> <span id="s119">And I think my father added his own hand to teach him not to get into brawls on the street, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s120">So, But I remember my brother who was very good at woodwork; he was very artistic young man.</span> <span id="s121">He paints and he sculpts and he does woodwork.</span> <span id="s122">He's an extremely talented young -- he was an extremely talented young -- now, he's an extremely talented young adult, older adult.</span> <span id="s123">I call him young adult, I should really call him older adult.</span> <span id="s124">And I remember him fashioning with -- from little wood, you know, handle and attaching a whip to it that was rolled in his hand.</span> <span id="s125">That was his protection going to school, so if somebody attacks him, he can whip this out.</span> <span id="s126">And that kind of left a very strong impression on me as a child.</span> <span id="s127">That and the fact that my father hit him.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: So you did become aware at this point that there were problems?</span> <span id="s129">I mean, it was different to be Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Can you remember other lessons you learned from your parents?</span> <span id="s132">You were talking about not to fight or . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Not really, with the -- I shouldn't say not really, you know.</span> <span id="s134">I think the lessons -- I think the lessons were in spite of all difficulties and in spite the horrendous times, they did not hide who they were.</span> <span id="s135">They kept very strongly the Jewish holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">01:15:08 They made sure that my brother became bar mitzvahed at such a difficult time.</span> <span id="s137">I remember my brother's bar mitzvah in the big temple; it was almost empty.</span> <span id="s138">And I remember standing in the Orthodox synagogues in those days, the women sat on top on the second level and looked down.</span> <span id="s139">And the men were downstairs.</span> <span id="s140">I remember standing between the railing and watching my brother chanting from his Haftorah.</span> <span id="s141">And no matter what, Passover was Passover; Rosh Hashanah was Rosh Hashanah; the Sabbath was the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s142">All of those traditions were kept to the bitter end.</span> <span id="s143">Nothing was really hidden away, and I think it gave me a sense of understanding and a sense of also some pride.</span> <span id="s144">I was not hidden way, all of those things were not hidden away from us.</span> <span id="s145">If anything else, it just made me stronger probably and more believing.</span> <span id="s146">That you just cannot allow anybody to trample over you.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: How much was your regular life, as you knew it, disrupted at that point in Hungary?</span> <span id="s148">It wasn't physically occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s149">How much did life change?</span> <span id="s150">Were there a lot of restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: There were restrictions on what -- between what hour and what hour you were allowed to go out on the street.</span> <span id="s152">Jews were not allowed on the street at every hour, every day of the -- every hour of the day.</span> <span id="s153">There were restrictions in terms of how often you were allowed -- between what hour and what hour you are allowed out on the street.</span> <span id="s154">I'm sure it was very disruptive to my parents, to my mother.</span> <span id="s155">My father, who was still working at the time, and then later on in '43 was taken to a forced labor camp.</span> <span id="s156">My mother being alone with two young children.</span> <span id="s157">Schools ceased to exist.</span> <span id="s158">We were not allowed to go to school.</span> <span id="s159">The Jewish school closed, and so we were primarily at home.</span> <span id="s160">My brother was very busy.</span> <span id="s161">Him and neighbors, they dug up a bunker in the front, in the courtyard, because there were a lot of sirens and a lot of running to the shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">01:18:07 And the shelter was really not below ground level.</span> <span id="s163">It was like a laundry room type of a thing, where people washed.</span> <span id="s164">And that was the shelter.</span> <span id="s165">And I remember that that affected me something fierce as a child.</span> <span id="s166">I was hysterical every time the siren sounded.</span> <span id="s167">I used to cry and scream.</span> <span id="s168">I was just so utterly shaken and afraid as a child from all these sounds.</span> <span id="s169">And that affected me later on in life, too.</span> <span id="s170">Because for a long time when at that point was silent and not screaming, but when we came to Israel and the sirens were going on because of the War of Independence, and there was never really complete peace.</span> <span id="s171">There was always that panic of will I make it to the shelter or won't I make it to the shelter?</span> <span id="s172">That always ensued, and at times it would just be a siren over an ambulance that sounded like a siren.</span> <span id="s173">But once you hear it, it's like it shakes you up completely.</span> <span id="s174">So . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Did you maintain a relationship with this family, this Christian family that the man, I guess, was the landlord or the superintendent of your building, once things got worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: I think we had a relationship, a cordial relationship in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s177">We were never -- the relationship was never such that we -- they came and visited and us, and ate in our house, or we visited them and ate in their house.</span> <span id="s178">Those kind of things did not exist.</span> <span id="s179">But until we were taken away, they lived there and we lived there.</span> <span id="s180">And until we were taken away, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Do you remember your parents talking about what was going on or how they tried to comfort you, or did they explain anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: I don't remember that any of this was discussed with me.</span> <span id="s183">I think my parents probably spoke between themselves, or they spoke to my brother, but none of this was shared with me.</span> <span id="s184">I was -- they felt probably that I was too young.</span> <span id="s185">And I'm sure those discussions took place between my brother and my mother, especially after my father was taken away to labor camp.</span> <span id="s186">He was the man in the house, and my mother kind of gave him instructions in case -- the fear was already there that we will be taken away.</span> <span id="s187">We will forced out of our house.</span> <span id="s188">That we will be forced to leave.</span> <span id="s189">Where?</span> <span id="s190">Nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">01:21:01 But my mother felt at the time that she needs to prepare my brother, because if she's out in the street and something happens, then she gave him instructions how to dress me, how many layers of clothing to put on me.</span> <span id="s192">I know that there was knapsack for each one of us prepared on the side to take with us, the necessities, changes of a few pieces of clothing, and eating utensils made out of something unbreakable.</span> <span id="s193">You know, one of those enamel dishes, and the eating utensils that we have to eat with and things like that were in the knapsack.</span> <span id="s194">And my mother put in -- I had a little baby umbrella.</span> <span id="s195">It was just like a little umbrella with pink roses on it, and she put that in the knapsack, too.</span> <span id="s196">It was my favorite little toy or whatever, and she put that in.</span> <span id="s197">And as she feared, that's exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s198">Because she was out in the street when they started rounding up all the Jews, and she had to beg for them to allow for her to come home because she had two children at home.</span> <span id="s199">She came back and all we did is pick up the knapsacks, and she took down the Mezuzah from the door.</span> <span id="s200">She threw away the casing; she just kept the content, which was a leather parchment about this size.</span> <span id="s201">Very long.</span> <span id="s202">This is all.</span> <span id="s203">She took it with her.</span> <span id="s204">Already prior to that, she flushed down her diamond in the toilet, because she felt she's not giving it to anyone but she didn't want it to be taken away from her.</span> <span id="s205">And on a nice April day, they came for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: And this was what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Well, before we move further on, you said that your father had been taken to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s209">How did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: They just simply announced it's almost like it was conscription to the army, that you have to go.</span> <span id="s211">There was no if, buts, and in between about it.</span> <span id="s212">They just rounded up all the men, and this was forced labor camp.</span> <span id="s213">They were not compensated for it.</span> <span id="s214">They were not paid.</span> <span id="s215">They made them work, and they gave them minimum food and shelter.</span> <span id="s216">And my father was taken away in '43, and during that time he came home twice for a couple of hours, a couple of days.</span> <span id="s217">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s218">And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">01:23:59 I remember him one Passover sitting around the table in the kitchen and doing the traditional Seder and with the big, white pillow, and my father had some white coat on that was the tradition that the father of the household wore all white during Passover.</span> <span id="s220">And then reading the Haggadah and doing this modest Seder, and the sirens started wailing.</span> <span id="s221">And at that time, already the bunker was dug up in the front yard in the courtyard, and all the neighbors and us were running, we were running down there for shelter.</span> <span id="s222">That kind of stands up in my memory.</span> <span id="s223">I remember my father coming home one day, and I think that was when he came home from the one vacation that he had from a labor camp.</span> <span id="s224">And I remember him kind of spreading his arm out so that I should run to him.</span> <span id="s225">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: When you mention the men being rounded up and you and your mother and brother were rounded up, was this by the Hungarian Police or Army or do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: It was the equivalent in Hungary, there was an equivalent hooligan troops, just like the Nazis.</span> <span id="s228">They were called Arrocross (ph) .</span> <span id="s229">And they were just as bad, and just as dastardly, bastardly, whatever you want to call them.</span> <span id="s230">And they were just all too happy to help.</span> <span id="s231">There was no big qualms about it.</span> <span id="s232">They came, they rounded us up, they put us on cattle vans.</span> <span id="s233">You know, like a big van, moving van like you would see nowadays.</span> <span id="s234">Women, children, older people, they were put up on the van.</span> <span id="s235">And I remember walking out of the little apartment -- all the apartment consisted of was a kitchen and a bedroom.</span> <span id="s236">That's it.</span> <span id="s237">And a little pantry.</span> <span id="s238">And I remember the door closing in and them boarding it up.</span> <span id="s239">Absolutely boarding it up so no one can enter.</span> <span id="s240">And we were taken away to a brick factory in Kolozsvár.</span> <span id="s241">The courtyard of a brick factory, they put up little huts.</span> <span id="s242">Four sticks of wood with a little fabric and some -- I don't even know what was on top.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">01:27:00 And those were the living conditions for the next month for all of these people, who for generations grew up in Hungary.</span> <span id="s244">Were born and raised and worked, and, of course, we lived in those huts for a whole month.</span> <span id="s245">Minimal food was brought in.</span> <span id="s246">If it rained, it rained.</span> <span id="s247">If it was dry, it was dry.</span> <span id="s248">I remember my mother opening the little umbrella that she stuck in my backpack, and that was what was kept over my head when it rained.</span> <span id="s249">It was just horrendous conditions.</span> <span id="s250">Horrendous conditions to see people who -- I was in my little eyes, in my little girl's eyes, just to see the doubts in most of the women and children because most of the men were gone.</span> <span id="s251">Taken to the brickyard factory.</span> <span id="s252">We stayed there for a month, and from there we were taken to Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Let me just ask you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: . . . some questions about this brickyard.</span> <span id="s256">Were there any sanitation?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Probably what was there for sanitation was for those who worked at the brickyard.</span> <span id="s258">And I don't recall whether they brought any other sanitation in or how, and what happened, I don't recall anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Do you remember what you did every day?</span> <span id="s260">Did you play with other kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Probably played with other kids in the courtyard, in the brickyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Was there any communication with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: No.</span> <span id="s264">At that point, my father was in labor camp.</span> <span id="s265">We were taken away.</span> <span id="s266">I don't know if the news arrived that we were forced away.</span> <span id="s267">I don't know what my father knew.</span> <span id="s268">I just know that when we were in Budapest, and we stayed in Budapest for two weeks in a large school, we came away from Cluj, about 300 people, 300 Jewish people.</span> <span id="s269">That's children, women and some men.</span> <span id="s270">And we were taken away to Budapest, and in Budapest we were joined with about 1,500 other Hungarian Jewish families.</span> <span id="s271">I had an aunt in Budapest who disguised herself as a Gentile.</span> <span id="s272">She was blonde, blue-eyed, and she was in one of Raoul Wallenberg's safe houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">01:30:16 She knew where my father was in labor camp.</span> <span id="s274">She smuggled some bread to him, and then we arrived at Budapest.</span> <span id="s275">And those arrived, I guess, my father learned that we are there.</span> <span id="s276">And he came, he was allowed a few hours to visit, so he left and he came to visit us.</span> <span id="s277">And I remember my mother -- and I had an uncle with us, his oldest brother, begging him not to return, to stay with us.</span> <span id="s278">And he said he cannot do it, he has to go back because if he's not going to go back, somebody else is going to get killed because he has not come back.</span> <span id="s279">And that he cannot have on his conscience.</span> <span id="s280">So they didn't have to worry much when they allowed somebody to leave for a few hours, because there was a threat provided with it, so that he knew that he has to come back.</span> <span id="s281">And if that was the last -- I don't even remember that episode so much.</span> <span id="s282">I don't remember seeing him, but I know he was there.</span> <span id="s283">And that was the last -- if I have seen him then, and I'm sure I have -- that was the last that I saw of him.</span> <span id="s284">And at that time, I was close to being -- close to six.</span> <span id="s285">Almost six years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: And you were staying in a school . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: . . . in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Either in a school or the main temple, I'm not positive now.</span> <span id="s290">But it was a large, either a large synagogue or a large school.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: You said you were there for . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Do you have any remembrances of what this place was like or what you were thinking or feeling?</span> <span id="s294">Do you have food?</span> <span id="s295">Who else was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: We were taken away from Kolozsvár together with my father's oldest brother, his wife, his son, and his daughter.</span> <span id="s297">And another sister who was single at the time.</span> <span id="s298">And we were all together, more or less.</span> <span id="s299">So the only children that were familiar to me at that time were my cousins -- my cousin.</span> <span id="s300">Now, she was two years older than me, and her brother was two years older than my brother.</span> <span id="s301">So they were sequentially older than us by two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">01:33:01 And they're the only ones, I know that there are lots of other children, because there was like 500 orphan children in this group that was deported out of Budapest.</span> <span id="s303">But I don't remember, I think I clung very closely to my mother.</span> <span id="s304">There was too much chaos, too much fear, and my mother was the barometer.</span> <span id="s305">Like for all children, I think mothers are the barometer.</span> <span id="s306">You look at your mother's face, and if she's smiling, then you're smiling.</span> <span id="s307">And if she's afraid, then you're afraid.</span> <span id="s308">And I am sure that a lot of things I have seen through my mother's eyes, or just by looking at her face.</span> <span id="s309">A lot of my feelings were connected to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Do you remember what you saw or what you were feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Probably just a lot of turmoil, a lot of unknown, a lot of fear of getting lost.</span> <span id="s312">A lot of that instability, that lack of confidence of what will happen.</span> <span id="s313">Where are we going?</span> <span id="s314">What's going to happen to us?</span> <span id="s315">That kind of a fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Maybe what you left behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: I don't even know if that entered my mind what we left behind.</span> <span id="s318">It's just, I think it's the fear of the unknown.</span> <span id="s319">It's the worry about what will happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Was there any communication with your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: You just lost touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Completely.</span> <span id="s324">We didn't know what happened to our grandparents until after the war.</span> <span id="s325">When the war ended and people started looking for each other, that's when we found out who is alive and who is dead, and who went back to Hungary and who did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Were you -- maybe not -- I don't know -- at the time, were you aware that this transport from the brickyard to Budapest was really a specially arranged transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I did not know.</span> <span id="s328">That is something that I learned about it later.</span> <span id="s329">I just later on learned that this was a special group, so to speak.</span> <span id="s330">A privileged group, that was gathered together, and they supposedly -- this is something that I learned later on.</span> <span id="s331">That I had no knowledge of at all.</span> <span id="s332">That this group was gathered together, and they collected everybody's belongings and money and jewelry and whatever everybody could offer, because the Germans needed trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">01:36:08 And Kastner, who was a lawyer, a Hungarian Jewish lawyer, dealt with Eichmann and pleaded with him to save this group of Jews to show to the world that what they are doing is not -- supposedly not happening.</span> <span id="s334">And because it was towards the end of the war, they were in such terrible need of money that they had accepted it.</span> <span id="s335">And this group supposedly was supposed to be transported to Turkey.</span> <span id="s336">But instead from Budapest in cattle cars, they took us to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Do you know how you became a part of this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Probably because twofold.</span> <span id="s339">First, my parents were always Zionists, and they were always active in the Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s340">Second, my uncle who was with us, he was a very important banker in Kolozsvár.</span> <span id="s341">He was wealthy, and he was well-to-do.</span> <span id="s342">And he had more connections, and he put us on the list, together with his family.</span> <span id="s343">And I think that was probably one of the most important things.</span> <span id="s344">But in this group, as I said before, not everyone had a connection, and not everyone was wealthy, it may seem.</span> <span id="s345">There was a good percentage of them who had the money, but they brought together with them 500 orphan children who did not have anybody to speak for them.</span> <span id="s346">And so there were many other people in the group, not just those who were privileged to be in the group.</span> <span id="s347">And in those days also, there were many movements.</span> <span id="s348">There were many organizations, Jewish organizations, that tried to save Jews in every which way they could.</span> <span id="s349">And like between all people, there are always differences of opinion.</span> <span id="s350">There were those who felt you should not deal with Nazis.</span> <span id="s351">There were those who felt you should do whatever you can to save the Jews.</span> <span id="s352">There were those who felt that just something bad will come out of it.</span> <span id="s353">There were those who felt that this is not the way to go.</span> <span id="s354">So even if they knew and they could go on with the group, they did not want to.</span> <span id="s355">It was a life that was unknown.</span> <span id="s356">Just like Kastner thought that we will all wind up in Turkey, and we wound up in concentration camps instead.</span> <span id="s357">And he himself, I think, put his life on the line every minute of the day when he entered this negotiations and traveled as a Jew all over the country for meetings and different things.</span> <span id="s358">His life was on the line constantly.</span> <span id="s359">His family was just in as much jeopardy as anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">01:39:04 And, you know, people claim he should have told everybody what's going on.</span> <span id="s361">He should have let the Hungarian Jewry know what's going on.</span> <span id="s362">The documentation shows that there are some people that escaped concentration camps who came back, and who reported what's going on, who told them what's going on.</span> <span id="s363">And nobody would believe them.</span> <span id="s364">Nobody would listen.</span> <span id="s365">It's easy to be a good judge, you know, after the fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Now, you started to talk about how you went as a group in cattle cars, you were sent to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: A couple questions: Did everybody from this school or temple in Budapest go on this transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s370">Everybody that was gathered there went on the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: When was this, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I tell you, about June.</span> <span id="s373">The beginning of June and of May, beginning of June, I would think, of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Tell me a little bit about the journey.</span> <span id="s375">Your family all went together except for . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: I don't remember anybody but my mother and brother with me.</span> <span id="s377">I'm sure that my uncle and aunt were there, but I was aware only of them.</span> <span id="s378">It was terribly crowded.</span> <span id="s379">There were no seats.</span> <span id="s380">People were standing, hoarded in.</span> <span id="s381">The only thing you could do is stoop down.</span> <span id="s382">There was no room in the train.</span> <span id="s383">And they had a pail, like what you wash the floor with.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">01:41:04 That was the sanitation, that was the bathroom.</span> <span id="s385">And it was terribly stifling hot.</span> <span id="s386">Cattle cars have small windows.</span> <span id="s387">It was just horrendous, and I don't remember how long it took, how many hours we rode in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Do you have any remembrance of what the mood was?</span> <span id="s389">People thought they were going to Turkey?</span> <span id="s390">Did they have expectations what things were going to be . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: I have the feeling by the time they were hoarded into the cattle cars, that they feared the worst.</span> <span id="s392">I don't know what they thought really, because I was so young at the time that even if the conversation was going on around me, I think my mind was working in a different direction.</span> <span id="s393">Either in denial of what was going on, or my mind went through imagination, you know, what a child imagines or plays in their head.</span> <span id="s394">It's very hard to tell; I don't recall back that far as to what I had.</span> <span id="s395">On top of it, during this journey I came down with German measles, so I was one sick child by the time I arrived to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s396">And my mother wrapped me up in a blanket that she had for me, a little pink and white blanket.</span> <span id="s397">And she carried me with that blanket; I was very small, luckily.</span> <span id="s398">Not that my mother was tall, believe me.</span> <span id="s399">But I was a small child, and she picked me up in her arms and covered me totally with a blanket.</span> <span id="s400">And by the time we got to the gate and there was a walking, marching from the train to the gates of hell of Bergen-Belsen, and I remember -- I don't remember.</span> <span id="s401">This is just stories that I remember that my mother was telling me.</span> <span id="s402">That they asked her if I am sick, and she said, "No, the child is only sleeping."</span> <span id="s403">They couldn't gauge how old I was, because I was small.</span> <span id="s404">Being totally covered, they couldn't gauge my age.</span> <span id="s405">And at that point as soon as we arrived to Bergen-Belsen, they separated the boys and the men from the women and the girls.</span> <span id="s406">So my brother was separated from us at that point, and he was taken -- he was 14 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s407">He was separated, he was with my uncle and his cousin.</span> <span id="s408">And I was with my mother and my aunt and my cousin, two aunts and a cousin.</span> <span id="s409">We were in these huge barracks with the wooden beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">01:44:02 Everybody sleeping next to everybody on a wooden slat, and barbed wires all over the place.</span> <span id="s411">No sooner did we arrive, I think we needed to march out of the barracks to be counted.</span> <span id="s412">And this counting went on day, noon and night.</span> <span id="s413">They were very meticulous, they constantly counted.</span> <span id="s414">I don't know why it was so important for them, but I guess they wanted to make sure that no one is missing.</span> <span id="s415">And the war went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Were you able to see your brother and your uncle . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s418">Not even through the barbed wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Were you mixed with prisoners who had -- who were already there, or were you kept together as a group from your transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s421">Honestly, I do not know.</span> <span id="s422">Maybe we were together as a group, I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Did they give you wear uniforms or you wore your own clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: No.</span> <span id="s425">Everybody wore whatever was on him.</span> <span id="s426">I don't remember -- I don't remember given uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Do you remember what the conditions of life were like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: The conditions of life were horrendous.</span> <span id="s429">I remember as a child they had what you see today, an outhouse.</span> <span id="s430">You know, how you have an outhouse and there is like a hole and everything goes in the hole?</span> <span id="s431">I remember like a semicircle, and these holes were there in the ground without any separation.</span> <span id="s432">Without any doors, without any privacy.</span> <span id="s433">Just like animals.</span> <span id="s434">And for some reason, I recall being there.</span> <span id="s435">It is so horrendous.</span> <span id="s436">I was brought up in such a modest way.</span> <span id="s437">My parents were such modest people, and I had never seen adults sitting on a toilet or doing their thing.</span> <span id="s438">And I remember somebody either bending down and his glasses fell off their eyes.</span> <span id="s439">I remember those glasses falling into the hole.</span> <span id="s440">And, you know, that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s441">Now, you know, in any person who -- this kind of stuck in my mind.</span> <span id="s442">And just understanding of what it means for someone who does not see to wear glasses and to lose them.</span> <span id="s443">And my mother glasses since she was a little child, so I know that this -- I know that she cannot -- she cannot exist without her glasses, you know.</span> <span id="s444">So that thought left such an impression on me.</span> <span id="s445">And the other big impression was when we were taken to the showers.</span> <span id="s446">We were taken to the showers, and if you can imagine a fence that is made out of wooden slats that are very tightly attached to each other.</span> <span id="s447">We were walking by this fence, and people were screaming.</span> <span id="s448">And I remember asking my mother, "Why are they screaming?"</span> <span id="s449">My mother said to me, "Because they recognize names that were written on the fence."</span> <span id="s450">Now, nobody had pens or pencils with them, but people bent down and picked up a piece of rock or chalky substance that was on the ground.</span> <span id="s451">And they smeared their names in the fence.</span> <span id="s452">Or wrote down dates when they were there, in case somebody else will come and recognize them.</span> <span id="s453">It's that feeling or maybe that faith that knowing that you may be going to your death, that maybe somebody else will come and recognize your name.</span> <span id="s454">Because the entire fence was scribbled with names, and people obviously recognized some names on those fences.</span> <span id="s455">Or they didn't recognize, maybe they thought they did.</span> <span id="s456">You never know what went on in people's minds, but the fear was tremendous.</span> <span id="s457">And we were taken into the showers where everybody had to get undressed.</span> <span id="s458">And I remember the horror for the first time in my life, that I have seen adults naked.</span> <span id="s459">I didn't even see children naked.</span> <span id="s460">I don't remember if I saw myself naked.</span> <span id="s461">I was just a little girl, and now I see children and mothers and grandmothers marching around naked into these showers.</span> <span id="s462">And people were screaming because they obviously did not think that those were showered.</span> <span id="s463">Obviously felt that this is the end of them, but we were showered.</span> <span id="s464">And we came out of it, which is so unbelievable that -- that that impression, that horrendous thing, it stays like a picture in your mind forever.</span> <span id="s465">And then we were taken back.</span> <span id="s466">And the other, of course, the counting that I already told you about, that they marched us out from the barracks constantly to stand in lines and count us, stand in rows.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">01:50:01 And the other horrendous impression was when they came with their leather boots and the German Shepherds with them.</span> <span id="s468">And bringing the food, which always looked to me like some kind of a dishwater with something floating in it that looked like some burgundy sausage or something.</span> <span id="s469">Something disgusting looking in it.</span> <span id="s470">That was the food, and a little bit of bread.</span> <span id="s471">I don't know, I really honestly I don't know how we survived.</span> <span id="s472">I really do not know how we survived.</span> <span id="s473">How we survived the hunger, how we survived the conditions.</span> <span id="s474">It's like it's hard, it's amazing.</span> <span id="s475">I remember also being marched out of Bergen-Belsen about eight months after being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: I think before we get to that next thing, could I ask you a couple of questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Do you remember, you know, the guards or the people in charge of you?</span> <span id="s479">Just impressions of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Just the uniformed Nazis with the German Shepherds barking just like their dogs.</span> <span id="s481">Their mean faces.</span> <span id="s482">They were very scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: They were mean to you as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s485">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Did you see anybody get hurt or beaten, anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Did your mother go to work in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Do you remember if there were any -- for fun, were there any . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s492">None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: I mean, as kid, I'm trying to figure out what you did all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Just we were in the barracks all day long.</span> <span id="s495">In the barracks.</span> <span id="s496">We were crying, telling stories, trying to -- I don't even know.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Do you know if there was any awareness of the Sabbath or of any holidays during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: I don't believe so.</span> <span id="s499">I don't believe so.</span> <span id="s500">Maybe quietly my mother sang something to me.</span> <span id="s501">I don't even know what day was following what day.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">01:53:12 There was such a loss of time.</span> <span id="s503">I don't know whether they knew really what day it was of the week.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Anything else you can remember about what your life was like there?</span> <span id="s505">Are there impressions, things that made you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Just the silence, the guards, the tower of the guards, you know.</span> <span id="s507">The barbed wires all around you.</span> <span id="s508">Everything is muddy, you know.</span> <span id="s509">It's -- that whole environment of a depressed environment, a depression on everybody's faces.</span> <span id="s510">Everybody looked very skinny, you know.</span> <span id="s511">Everyone lost their healthy weight.</span> <span id="s512">Everyone waiting around to die, basically.</span> <span id="s513">I don't think at that point anyone thought that we'll survive or that we will come out of it alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: That was the feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: I am sure.</span> <span id="s516">I am sure that no one believed that we will ever come out of Bergen-Belsen alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s518">So you were starting to say that about eight months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Eight months later, we were marched out of the camp all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s520">I guess the deal was made.</span> <span id="s521">And the payment, the final payment to the Germans was paid, I think, as we entered the Swiss borders in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s522">And we were marched out of camp, and I remember that we were marched out by fours, which means they were marching in groups of fours.</span> <span id="s523">And somebody in front, maybe there was a row that there were like three people.</span> <span id="s524">So this Nazi bastard with his dog was standing there, and pulled somebody forward.</span> <span id="s525">And from every line, he pulled somebody forward.</span> <span id="s526">So you were feeling that missing person.</span> <span id="s527">That happened in the front.</span> <span id="s528">And I was on the edge, and I remember pulling my arm from my mother's arm and pushing me forward, one line forward.</span> <span id="s529">I was horrified; I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s530">I was not next to my mother.</span> <span id="s531">And with the force that he flung me forward, I started crying.</span> <span id="s532">And it took a while for us to walk away a little bit before my mother asked the person next to her to switch places with me so that she can have me next to her.</span> <span id="s533">I remember that horrified moment.</span> <span id="s534">You know, you lose all the confidence -- the little confidence that you still have within you, you lose it because you are just thrown in front of your mother.</span> <span id="s535">But it was done in such a brutal way that it totally shook me up as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Did they tell you why you were being marched out of the camp or where you were going to, do you . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Not me.</span> <span id="s538">I don't know what they told my mother or where they are taking us.</span> <span id="s539">I don't know that she knew.</span> <span id="s540">I don't know that they talked about.</span> <span id="s541">We were just all marched out of the camp.</span> <span id="s542">We were taken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Did the boys join you?</span> <span id="s544">Did you see your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s546">The men, the boys who were there, they joined us.</span> <span id="s547">I didn't see my -- I don't remember seeing my brother until we got to Switzerland, but it's possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">01:57:06</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And this was all the same group who . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: The same group.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: . . . from Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Right.</span> <span id="s553">The 1.800 people that came with us from Budapest.</span> <span id="s554">That same original group of people.</span> <span id="s555">They must have struck a deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: And some of them you hadn't seen for a while in the camp, or you had all been together?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: We were in different barracks.</span> <span id="s558">Some of us were in the same barracks.</span> <span id="s559">Some of us were in different barracks.</span> <span id="s560">And don't forget I didn't know that many people.</span> <span id="s561">My mother knew many more.</span> <span id="s562">I was just a little girl.</span> <span id="s563">so I -- my world was my mother and my aunt and my cousin who were with me, and that was it.</span> <span id="s564">I can't remember -- I don't remember anyone else.</span> <span id="s565">My only memory of everybody else is after we have come to Israel, and those that my mother remained friendly with.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Let's stop right here, so he can change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: How are you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: I'm doing fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">02:01:08</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Let's pick up.</span> <span id="s574">You were marched out of the camp.</span> <span id="s575">You were temporarily separated from your mother, and then I guess she joined you in line.</span> <span id="s576">Then what do you remember happening after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: I remember being put on trains, a normal train.</span> <span id="s578">And riding and arriving in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s579">And I remember -- really, the fact that we crossed the border, that didn't not affect -- I don't recall that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: You can't recall the ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: I don't recall the ride.</span> <span id="s582">What I do remember is arriving to a place that looked like a palace.</span> <span id="s583">In my child's eye, I thought that we had arrived to the biggest palace, almost like in a dream.</span> <span id="s584">And I remember coming there, and the children were given toys by the Red Cross and being fed and being taken care of.</span> <span id="s585">And the name of the place was called Hotel Esplanade.</span> <span id="s586">And very shortly after arriving and probably being checked physically and medically and checking for lice and checking to see if everybody who needs medical attention and so forth, very shortly afterwards, they took all the children away.</span> <span id="s587">And we were brought to a -- up in the Alps, you know, like into like a farm area for recuperation.</span> <span id="s588">And just to get us a little bit healthier after all the ordeal of being in concentration camp for so long.</span> <span id="s589">At this point the Red Cross was there to help.</span> <span id="s590">The Schlakim (ph) , which are messengers from Israel, from Palestine at the time came to our aid.</span> <span id="s591">They were working very hard on receiving the proper certificates to enter Palestine, because we could not enter freely.</span> <span id="s592">And some semblance of normal life wanted to return.</span> <span id="s593">Now, that's what they wanted to achieve.</span> <span id="s594">So they took us into a -- as I said, it was probably like a farm.</span> <span id="s595">Almost like a kibbutz kind of a thing on the Alps.</span> <span id="s596">And they started process, they started to try to teach us according to the level that we were at, what we were supposed to start.</span> <span id="s597">And I don't even remember -- probably they tried to teach us in Hungarian, if I'm not wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">01:04:02 Now, in Switzerland we all learned a little bit of German because that was the spoken language in that area of the country.</span> <span id="s599">And each and one of us kind of picked up some German language.</span> <span id="s600">I remember sitting in the classroom, it was very frightening to me to some extent because here I was away from my mother.</span> <span id="s601">My mother was left in this big hotel with a lot of other women who were widowed, and all the children in all ages were gathered together.</span> <span id="s602">And teachers were brought from all over to try to teach us, and they tried to conduct classes.</span> <span id="s603">And I just remember me sitting in the classroom and totally gazing and not comprehending anything.</span> <span id="s604">It was like in a dream, I remember sitting there saying to myself that "This is school," but my mind was totally on other things.</span> <span id="s605">I could not concentrate.</span> <span id="s606">I don't remember that -- I can't recall if I learned anything.</span> <span id="s607">I probably remember just learning just a little bit of the ABCs, the lettering, the beginning of learning how to read.</span> <span id="s608">But to tell you that this was a formal schooling that I could recall or I can retain anything, probably very little because of the emotional upheaval that probably I felt as a child.</span> <span id="s609">The one thing for sure that none of us got was psychological counseling.</span> <span id="s610">That was not in anybody's agenda or even in their -- in anybody's thought that that was needed at the time.</span> <span id="s611">I remember the older children putting up a play of David and Goliath.</span> <span id="s612">I remember my brother playing the role of Goliath if I'm -- of David.</span> <span id="s613">And -- but I don't remember anything else from area, just the fact that there was a lot of cheese, which I hated.</span> <span id="s614">There was a lot of milk, which I didn't like to drink.</span> <span id="s615">Most people were so happy so see cheese.</span> <span id="s616">As a child, these were things that I did not like to eat.</span> <span id="s617">I did not like cheese, and I didn't like hard-boiled eggs, you know.</span> <span id="s618">I used to choke on them.</span> <span id="s619">There are memories of things that I really could not -- I guess I could not tolerate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">02:07:02 And other than that, really the time in Switzerland passed by, and before we knew it -- I also remember something that really stayed with me, is the fact that the Swiss people did not look upon us kindly.</span> <span id="s621">They were not friendly.</span> <span id="s622">They really did not like foreigners, and they -- I'm sure that this was very hard for them to get this many refugees in one of their hotels.</span> <span id="s623">And from there we were taken away.</span> <span id="s624">I don't know what mode of transportation, in all honesty.</span> <span id="s625">Probably by train again to Bari, Italy, and from Bari, Italy we were taken by a boat to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s627">I want to just stop you for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: To see if you can recall anything else about Switzerland.</span> <span id="s630">I appreciate that your mind was not on your classes . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Um-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: . . . at this farm school or whatever, but do you have any remembrance of what kind of classes?</span> <span id="s633">Did they give you any religious classes, any kind of classes that might help you prepare for living in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s635">I don't really recall.</span> <span id="s636">I recall other things that were very important.</span> <span id="s637">You know, in every classroom, there are children who are the bullies?</span> <span id="s638">In every classroom that there is the girl who is the queen and it's amazing.</span> <span id="s639">I remember being afraid of some of the kids because they were so demanding and being afraid emotionally from them.</span> <span id="s640">I was a very sensitive child.</span> <span id="s641">Interestingly enough, I grew in to be quite a strong adult, and even as a youngster life kind of prepared me to become quite a strong individual.</span> <span id="s642">But I remember the sensitivity of being easily hurt.</span> <span id="s643">I had a lot of worries for a six-year-old child.</span> <span id="s644">I had to worry that I'm alone.</span> <span id="s645">I had to worry that somebody will demand things of me that I won't be able to give.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">02:10:02 I had to worry about my safety.</span> <span id="s647">I had to worry about my existence.</span> <span id="s648">I had to worry where are we going?</span> <span id="s649">Where is going to be home?</span> <span id="s650">I had to worry if my father will come back.</span> <span id="s651">A lot of those things are constantly on my mind, and school was the farthest thing from my mind.</span> <span id="s652">I was really more concerned of how to survive in this kind of a jungle.</span> <span id="s653">I'm sure they prepared us.</span> <span id="s654">As I said, they had put up a play of David and Goliath, so obviously the themes of tradition and the themes of Israel and the themes of the Bible were brought back together.</span> <span id="s655">And don't forget a lot of these children have studied already in Hungary, and a lot of them went to the Hebrew Gymnasiums or went to other Hebrew schools.</span> <span id="s656">They had backgrounds.</span> <span id="s657">My brother knew how to speak Hebrew already.</span> <span id="s658">Not fluently, but he studied Hebrew.</span> <span id="s659">So he knew how to read and he knew how to write and he knew how to speak.</span> <span id="s660">I didn't know one word at that point.</span> <span id="s661">I was too young.</span> <span id="s662">I didn't have that in my background yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: When you say that you had so much on your mind as a small child, were there things that you remember doing to protect yourself or to just get by?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: I remember having to worry about what will I give to this girl that I will live in peace?</span> <span id="s665">I don't even remember who she was.</span> <span id="s666">But, you know, that concern, what could I give her or what could I make for her or whatever from the little that I knew how to make or give or whatever -- what did I have?</span> <span id="s667">But I had a lot of worries like that for my little survival.</span> <span id="s668">And I was very little physically, too.</span> <span id="s669">Not just age-wise, I was very little physically.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: But you had other strengths?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Obviously.</span> <span id="s672">That's very -- that's for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">02:13:03</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: It must have been quite nice to see your brother again?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s676">But you have to understand that the relationship between me and my brother was not the same as siblings.</span> <span id="s677">I would never go to my brother if I had a problem.</span> <span id="s678">Or if I had a fear, I could not talk to my brother at that age.</span> <span id="s679">For me, he loomed larger than life.</span> <span id="s680">He was a symbol, until I got married.</span> <span id="s681">It's not just as a little child, a six-year-old child, there was this age difference between us.</span> <span id="s682">We lived together for a very short period in our lives, and then we never lived together again.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Just maybe because he was also at this farm, you felt a little bit more protected since your mother wasn't there?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s685">Because he was busy with his age group.</span> <span id="s686">He was busy with his own survival.</span> <span id="s687">He had his friends from school.</span> <span id="s688">It was different, and I don't know, he loved me very much, but I don't think that he understood or that I understood what I needed or what he needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Now . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: We were never taught as children to communicate verbally and to express our emotions and our feelings or to speak up about them.</span> <span id="s691">This is all many, many, many years later, you know, that one learns through life to speak up.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: While you were at this farm, did you mother come and see you from time to time?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s694">No, we as kids I guess we were taken back to the hotel every once in a while.</span> <span id="s695">I don't remember my mother visiting.</span> <span id="s696">That I don't remember at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: But you did go to the hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: I think we went to the hotel and we saw them.</span> <span id="s699">It wasn't such a big distance, but it's a very big distance if you don't have with what to go.</span> <span id="s700">But I think every once in a while, we were taken back to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Did you make friends there?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Now, were you aware that ultimate plan here was to get to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">02:15:51</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: My mother -- you know, honestly, my mother wanted to go back to Hungary to look for the family, to look for her father -- for my father.</span> <span id="s706">To see if he is alive, and my uncle said no.</span> <span id="s707">My uncle was the oldest authority, and he said, "There is nothing to go back for.</span> <span id="s708">Hungary's finished.</span> <span id="s709">It's done with.</span> <span id="s710">We are going to Palestine, and when we get there, we'll look for them.</span> <span id="s711">And if they're alive, they'll come out.</span> <span id="s712">And if they are not, we are not going back there.</span> <span id="s713">That's it.</span> <span id="s714">There is nothing to go back for."</span> <span id="s715">Luckily, my mother listened, and so we went to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: How long do you think you were in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Eight months.</span> <span id="s718">It took a long time for them to be able to obtain the proper certificates to enter Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Was there any consciousness of the war ending in Europe while you were in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: I am sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: But not for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Not for me.</span> <span id="s723">I just remember one thing in Switzerland that was amazing.</span> <span id="s724">You know, when I said to you that a child always gauges their mood according to her mother?</span> <span id="s725">And I remember in a crowd standing outside, it was like on the top of the stairs.</span> <span id="s726">My mother was standing, and I was standing next to her.</span> <span id="s727">They were listening to news on the radio out loud, and everybody started crying.</span> <span id="s728">And my mother was crying, and, of course, I immediately started crying because as soon as she cried, I cried.</span> <span id="s729">What happened?</span> <span id="s730">What happened?</span> <span id="s731">What happened?</span> <span id="s732">And my mother telling me that President Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s733">I didn't know who President Roosevelt was.</span> <span id="s734">But the news that he died created such a sorrow in everybody, if they would have only known how little he has done, if anything at all, to save them.</span> <span id="s735">But everybody was so sure then that he was doing his utmost.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Is there anything else that you can recall about those eight months in Switzerland?</span> <span id="s737">Or who took care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: No.</span> <span id="s739">I don't even remember who took of us.</span> <span id="s740">I'm sure there was some older individuals who took care of us.</span> <span id="s741">I don't even remember so much the room or the bed where we were.</span> <span id="s742">It was definitely 1,000 percent improvement over Bergen-Belsen, and it took me many, many years to go back to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">02:19:04 And I visited with my husband Switzerland, and we were in Montreuil, I said to him, "I think the hotel is supposed to be in this area."</span> <span id="s744">And I said, "I wonder if this hotel still exists, and if it exists, is it big or is it small?"</span> <span id="s745">Because, you know, when you look as a child, some thing looks humongous and you don't remember.</span> <span id="s746">Well, I called my brother in Israel and asked him, and he said, "Yes, in Köln (ph) above Montreuil is Hotel Esplanade.</span> <span id="s747">It still exists.</span> <span id="s748">You go out there."</span> <span id="s749">Well, we took the train, which is like a Venicula (ph), it's almost like a mountain-climbing train.</span> <span id="s750">And I cannot tell you -- I just sat there and cried.</span> <span id="s751">I can't explain the emotions.</span> <span id="s752">I didn't way one word, but as the train climbed higher and higher, the tears just rolled down my eyes.</span> <span id="s753">And when I got to the hotel, when we finally got there, indeed, the hotel was a huge hotel.</span> <span id="s754">A very elaborate hotel, it's not a wonder that in my eyes it looked like a palace.</span> <span id="s755">Because, as it turns out, the lady who greeted us at the place, she said, "This hotel was once upon a time the winter playground for all the royalties of Europe.</span> <span id="s756">They used to come here for ice skating and for skiing and for all sports activities, winter sport activities."</span> <span id="s757">And this was really like a palace.</span> <span id="s758">And she showed us a movie about the history of the hotel.</span> <span id="s759">She says, "You are not the only refugees.</span> <span id="s760">There are many of them who have come back to visit through the years."</span> <span id="s761">It ceased to exist as a hotel nowadays.</span> <span id="s762">During the war they wanted to tear it down because nobody came to the hotel.</span> <span id="s763">And then they kept it as a refugee center.</span> <span id="s764">The refugees that were brought out of the war passed through this hotel.</span> <span id="s765">Now, they showed us this movie, and they showed also movies about all these royalties used to come and ice skate and ski over in this area.</span> <span id="s766">And after the war, after the refugees have left, again they wanted to tear down the hotel and they decided to keep it.</span> <span id="s767">And now they use it for an organization, a worldwide organization, for sane armament.</span> <span id="s768">These are people who are obviously pacifists who come there for conferences during the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">02:22:01 And they live very much like on a kibbutz, because they cook and they share in the cooking, washing the dishes, serving, taking care of the rooms and so forth.</span> <span id="s770">Everybody really shares in the upkeep.</span> <span id="s771">And I don't know for how long, for a month or two months during the summertime, they keep it for conferences like that for sane armament.</span> <span id="s772">But, indeed, the hotel was a very elaborate, large, large hotel.</span> <span id="s773">So it wasn't just in my child's memory, but as an adult, it was quite interesting to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Now, you were somehow taken to Bari?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Do you know how long you were there before you got on a ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Do you -- was there a large group with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: The entire group, the original group, were all taken Bari.</span> <span id="s780">Put on this Viadole (ph), I think was the name of the boat.</span> <span id="s781">Viadoran (ph), if i’m not mistaken was the name of that boat, and we were taken with this boat to Palestine.</span> <span id="s782">It was not a luxury boat.</span> <span id="s783">I don't even remember how many days it took us to sail from Bari to Israel, to Palestine at the time.</span> <span id="s784">But when arrived to Palestine, I remember getting off the boat, and we were given some nuts and I think an orange.</span> <span id="s785">My two hands filled up -- one orange filled up two hands.</span> <span id="s786">And I remember that my brother, my father's youngest brother, he was only living relative who lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s787">He left to Palestine when he was very young, and he was there from the age of 19.</span> <span id="s788">So he had went in the '30s to Palestine with his wife.</span> <span id="s789">And he was like the welcoming committee.</span> <span id="s790">But we were taken from there to Aclite (ph) , which is a British concentration camp kind of thing, in Palestine itself.</span> <span id="s791">In Aclite (ph) you were disinfected and checked for health, for this, for other reasons.</span> <span id="s792">And we were the first alia (ph) after the war to arrive to Palestine that had permits to enter.</span> <span id="s793">I think every boat after us were taken to Cyprus.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: What month is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: This was in September.</span> <span id="s796">So we were -- September 3rd, 1945, to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: The mood on the boat must have been pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">02:25:00</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: I am sure the mood was good.</span> <span id="s800">The conditions on the boat were not good.</span> <span id="s801">And I don't know how good the mood could have been on the boat, because they were going to a place that was unknown.</span> <span id="s802">They were going to a place that was not free.</span> <span id="s803">They were going to a place where it was under British mandate.</span> <span id="s804">They knew darn well that the relationship between the Arabs and Jews was not good.</span> <span id="s805">They were hoping.</span> <span id="s806">And don't forget there were a lot of women without their husbands with two children, three children.</span> <span id="s807">Generally two or one, who came together with nothing.</span> <span id="s808">The clothes on their back, no money, no husband, no prospects, no jobs, no profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Do you remember your impressions when you got off the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: My only impression was it was sunny.</span> <span id="s811">It was a country full of light, you know.</span> <span id="s812">And seeing an orange made a very big impression on me.</span> <span id="s813">And in a very short time after we were in Aclite (ph) , we were dispersed.</span> <span id="s814">I was sent with three other children, give or take one girl, a brother and a sister.</span> <span id="s815">She's a year younger than me; he is two years older than me.</span> <span id="s816">And another young boy.</span> <span id="s817">We were sent to one kibbutz.</span> <span id="s818">My brother was sent to another kibbutz.</span> <span id="s819">My cousin was sent to a third kibbutz.</span> <span id="s820">And her brother was sent to the fourth kibbutz.</span> <span id="s821">So we were not together.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: And my mother stayed in Haifa in a hotel for women.</span> <span id="s824">So this time we were separated for good for a long time.</span> <span id="s825">I was taken to Halba, which is close to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s826">My mother stayed in Haifa.</span> <span id="s827">My brother was taken to Neva-Tan (ph), and my two other cousins to the French kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s828">And that was -- that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s829">And at this time I found myself in a kibbutz, all by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Were you scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: I'm sure.</span> <span id="s832">How comfortable could I have been?</span> <span id="s833">At this point I was already seven and a half years old.</span> <span id="s834">Think of it, I was seven and a half years old, so I missed first grade; I missed second grade.</span> <span id="s835">And I just started first grade.</span> <span id="s836">That was the first time that I remember going to school and starting to learn how to read and write.</span> <span id="s837">On top of it I arrived to a kibbutz that nobody spoke Hungarian.</span> <span id="s838">I spoke very little German, and I definitely did not speak Hebrew.</span> <span id="s839">So the communication was very difficult, but like all children, you quickly learn -- you quickly learn a new language when you are forced to learn it.</span> <span id="s840">But again, the communication with my mother and father was very difficult, because I didn't know how to read and write.</span> <span id="s841">I just started to learn how to read and write in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s842">My language skills could not have been great at that time.</span> <span id="s843">And like all first graders, you can imagine how well I wrote and how many spelling mistakes.</span> <span id="s844">My mother did not know how to read Hebrew, and I didn't -- I couldn't read her Hungarian letters to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">02:29:06 And nobody could read them to me either.</span> <span id="s846">So it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s847">My brother wrote to me in Hebrew, which I couldn't read either.</span> <span id="s848">But that could -- at least somebody could read it.</span> <span id="s849">So it's a little bit comical, but it was a quite difficult communication.</span> <span id="s850">And I didn't see my mother very often because the circumstances in Israel were so difficult at that time.</span> <span id="s851">These were the times of the uprising, this was pre-War of Independence.</span> <span id="s852">Traveling was not easy.</span> <span id="s853">People traveled with armored vehicles, and they traveled only in caravans.</span> <span id="s854">You didn't see a car riding freely on the road, you were only safe if you traveled in caravans and in armored vehicles.</span> <span id="s855">So really I think I saw my mother twice a year during this while period, and I was there for three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: What was your life like then?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: The kibbutz life was okay.</span> <span id="s858">I mean I'm sure it wasn't easy for me emotionally, but it was okay.</span> <span id="s859">There was a lot of -- I think I can attribute there was a lot of caring.</span> <span id="s860">I think we got something, somebody cared about us.</span> <span id="s861">I think we got that sense -- that sense did come through.</span> <span id="s862">I think going to school every day, and from very early young age they teach you to work a little bit to keep you busy, and to keep you a productive individual.</span> <span id="s863">It kept us very busy and very active and not allowing too much, you know, for day dreaming.</span> <span id="s864">And every child was assigned to a family.</span> <span id="s865">Unfortunately for me, I was assigned to the shoemaker in the kibbutz, who came from Poland who was a widower, and who had a daughter a year older than me.</span> <span id="s866">So I was not assigned to a family where there was a mother and a father.</span> <span id="s867">I was assigned to a family that there was only a father, and since he had a daughter who was a year older than me, he just didn't know how to be a parent for both of us.</span> <span id="s868">He was a good man, but, you know, if you have a choice between your own daughter and somebody's else's daughter, it's a big difference.</span> <span id="s869">So, but that was the way it was.</span> <span id="s870">But, generally speaking, I think there was lot of positive things in the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s871">A lot of, you know, a lot of things that were taught that were very positive and very nice, and the holidays were always celebrated in a very nice manner.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">02:32:01 This was not a religious kibbutz at all, but all the Biblical holidays were celebrated on -- in a freer way.</span> <span id="s873">That you felt -- I felt very much that I belonged, so there was a lot of caring.</span> <span id="s874">I know I missed my mother, I know I fantasized a lot.</span> <span id="s875">I fantasized a lot about my brother, and that is strange, that's even more.</span> <span id="s876">Because here he was already he went into the Navy, and I always worried whether he is going to get killed or is he going to be alive.</span> <span id="s877">And so my brother, again, loomed larger than life in my eyes in those days.</span> <span id="s878">And I seldom saw him, very seldom.</span> <span id="s879">So really with the exception of living together in Hungary, we never again lived together in the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Were there a lot of other children on this kibbutz who were essentially in your predicament?</span> <span id="s881">Who had come here, who had been separated from their . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s883">Yes.</span> <span id="s884">In fact, that's what I said to people, you know, at times when they asked me.</span> <span id="s885">I was one of the fortunate ones, I had a brother; I had a mother.</span> <span id="s886">My friends, the two brother and sister, they had a mother and they had each other.</span> <span id="s887">Then the children from Tehran came.</span> <span id="s888">These were children from Russia and from Poland, primarily Polish children, who came without a soul.</span> <span id="s889">They lost their parents.</span> <span id="s890">They lost their siblings.</span> <span id="s891">They lost their uncles, their grandparents, everything in the war.</span> <span id="s892">They were sole survivors.</span> <span id="s893">So at that time, as much as one wanted to feel sorry for oneself, I think there was always somebody who was in a worse position than we were.</span> <span id="s894">And these children came with no one, and the kibbutz absorbed them into families.</span> <span id="s895">They became their families, literally.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Were you conscious of that at the time?</span> <span id="s897">What were you thinking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: I was very conscious of it at the time.</span> <span id="s899">I was always very -- very, very sensitive to other people's feelings and other children's feelings as much as I was sensitive to my own.</span> <span id="s900">I was very sensitive, very caring, and I think I also rationalized it was a very good way of protecting myself.</span> <span id="s901">I rationalized, so -- there are people that have less than you, so it's okay.</span> <span id="s902">It wasn't the end of the world.</span> <span id="s903">I think that's what kept my sanity, that I was able always to see maybe the better side of things instead of the worst side.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">02:35:08 I just feel I was very fortunate as a child, because, in all honesty, when I think back that none of us ever, ever got any psychological counseling or help or group session or -- it wasn't even talked about.</span> <span id="s905">Everybody just went about their lives going on, it really didn't come back to haunt me until I had children of my own.</span> <span id="s906">I didn't realize the feelings that I stored inside until I had my own children.</span> <span id="s907">Because, you see, as I saw them growing up and I realized the ages, the circumstances, that's when I had a difficult time to reconcile with what I went through.</span> <span id="s908">Because you see your children, how vulnerable they are at such a young age and how needy they are, it's very hard.</span> <span id="s909">On the other hand, it made me very strong.</span> <span id="s910">It made me able to slough off a lot of things and be able to face life.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Did you develop close relationships in that kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: I'm sure I had friends.</span> <span id="s913">How close relationships, nothing that was overwhelmingly comfortable, you know, in hindsight.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Did you have fun?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: I had a good time.</span> <span id="s916">I had a pretty good time.</span> <span id="s917">I had a good time, but I think I had -- I was also a very serious child.</span> <span id="s918">I probably carried a lot of worry on my little shoulders, I'm sure of that.</span> <span id="s919">I remember I always had a recurring nightmare.</span> <span id="s920">It turned out that a siren was going on and everybody was rushing for the shelters, and I couldn't run and I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s921">My legs wouldn't carry me.</span> <span id="s922">And I was crawling on all four in front of the dining room, and everybody was passing me by.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">02:38:04 And I just -- my legs were paralyzed, I could not walk.</span> <span id="s924">So I know where it comes from.</span> <span id="s925">But for many years I had this recurring nightmare, same thing all over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: What do you think you were . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: It was my fears of survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Do you think that you generally felt safe finally in this kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: I felt safe, but I know that I also probably put up a good facade.</span> <span id="s930">I remember when Israel was declared a free state, we were sleeping.</span> <span id="s931">I must have been -- 1948, I was 11 years old.</span> <span id="s932">And we were awakened, we were sleeping, we were awakened all to come out and dance, and everybody was very happy.</span> <span id="s933">And they announced at the same time that Haifa was conquered, and I became hysterical.</span> <span id="s934">Because I did not understand that it was conquered by the Israelis.</span> <span id="s935">I was positive that my mother is finished with, because that's where she lived.</span> <span id="s936">I was positive that if Haifa was conquered, my mother must be dead.</span> <span id="s937">So that happy occasion where everybody came out and they were dancing, and they brought out from the freezers the little apples that they were saving for a special occasion, I don't know.</span> <span id="s938">And everybody was really in such a joyous mood.</span> <span id="s939">It took me time from being awakened in the middle of the night to understand the consequences and the ramifications of this news.</span> <span id="s940">So that wasn't easy either.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Why don't you just kind of tell me briefly what happened after?</span> <span id="s942">You were on the kibbutz for three and a half years.</span> <span id="s943">Palestine became Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: And you were at that point rejoined with your family or with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: My mother remarried.</span> <span id="s947">I never met the man that she remarried at that point.</span> <span id="s948">My mother just announced to me in a letter that she has remarried, she has gotten remarried and that they would like me to come home.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">02:41:05 And it was good news and bad news for me.</span> <span id="s950">It was good news because finally I'm going to be with her.</span> <span id="s951">It was bad news to me because in my little mind I probably conjured up this image that if my mother is going to remarry, I have decided in advance that I'm going to hate this individual, and I will not -- he cannot replace my father.</span> <span id="s952">At that point my mother knew very well that my father is no longer alive.</span> <span id="s953">And she consulted with my brother, who was in the Navy, who was also closer.</span> <span id="s954">The Navy was in Haifa, so they saw each other quite frequently.</span> <span id="s955">And she introduced the man that she was going to marry to my brother, and my brother was all for it.</span> <span id="s956">But nobody consulted me, and nobody introduced me.</span> <span id="s957">I was far away, I was not near Haifa.</span> <span id="s958">And so I was brought back to Haifa from the kibbutz, and I left the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s959">And I came back to Haifa, swearing to myself that I'm going to really hate this man and I'm not going to obey him.</span> <span id="s960">This was what went on in mind at that time, but really in no time at all I realized what a nice individual she married.</span> <span id="s961">And he was a survivor also, who lost his wife and two children in the war.</span> <span id="s962">And his oldest daughter was my age, and she had my middle name, Suzannah (ph) .</span> <span id="s963">And so he was quite a nice father to me; I think he loved me dearly.</span> <span id="s964">And that had a very good effect on my life.</span> <span id="s965">He was a good family man.</span> <span id="s966">He was extremely, extremely sensitive.</span> <span id="s967">But at the time that I came back to Haifa, I felt estranged from my mother.</span> <span id="s968">I mean she was important to me, but I no longer felt that need to be that close.</span> <span id="s969">Or I think I had also a lot of anger in me probably that was never verbalized.</span> <span id="s970">But by the time I got back to Haifa, started school, and then things were done in very haphazard way.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">02:44:10 I arrived to Haifa, I was at that time in the fourth grade.</span> <span id="s972">And they decided since I was older -- and I was probably a fairly decent student.</span> <span id="s973">I wasn't a super student, but I was good, average student.</span> <span id="s974">They decided that oh, it's time to make up a grade.</span> <span id="s975">So I went for half a year in the fourth grade, and in the middle of the year, I transferred to the fifth grade.</span> <span id="s976">I think they would have done much better if they would skipped fourth grade altogether and put me in the fifth grade right in from the start, so I will have an equal opportunity to start at the same level.</span> <span id="s977">But by the time I started fifth grade in the middle of the year, I was totally lost again.</span> <span id="s978">And this time they lost me from math forever, I was not a big mathematician.</span> <span id="s979">And I think from multiplying and dividing, I got into fractions.</span> <span id="s980">And I never learned the basics of how to deal with fractions in the beginning of the year, and I think it was extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s981">Extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s982">I got into a very good grade.</span> <span id="s983">I got into a good grade in terms socially, it was very compatible and terrific.</span> <span id="s984">But academically, especially in math, I had a lot of difficulty that dragged on and on.</span> <span id="s985">I always needed a private tutor.</span> <span id="s986">Somehow I could never catch up to what I lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: So you finished school.</span> <span id="s988">You grew up in Haifa with your newly constituted family?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Right.</span> <span id="s990">I grew up in Haifa.</span> <span id="s991">In the years that I was growing up, elementary school was through eighth grade.</span> <span id="s992">There was only elementary school and high school.</span> <span id="s993">There was no middle school.</span> <span id="s994">So you went for eight years to elementary and four years of high school.</span> <span id="s995">And when I finished elementary school, the eighth grade, it was by my mother's recommendation that I should maybe look into a technical high school, where I could learn a profession and I can finish my high school diploma.</span> <span id="s996">At first I didn't want to hear about it, but then I decided that that's a very good idea.</span> <span id="s997">And I went and I looked at a school, and I liked it very much.</span> <span id="s998">It was very creative, and I was a very creative child.</span> <span id="s999">I guess I had a lot of creativity in me that I didn't even know that existed.</span> <span id="s1000">And I went to the school, and that's where I really blossomed, because we learned a lot of things that were of interest.</span> <span id="s1001">You know, we learned how to sew and how to embroider and how to knit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">02:47:02 And a lot of the creative handwork and crafts -- excuse me -- and I succeeded quite nicely in the school, and that helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s1003">By the time I finished my high school diploma there, I had a profession also.</span> <span id="s1004">And I went back for an extra year for a teacher's seminary, so that I became an arts and crafts teacher.</span> <span id="s1005">And soon thereafter, I got married.</span> <span id="s1006">As soon as I finished really my teacher's seminary.</span> <span id="s1007">Finished it in late June, and in August I got married of that year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Well, I don't know if this question is a little bit off the point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: It's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: But how long did it take you to feel like kind of on solid ground again after all the uprooting of your life in Europe, and then even your first few years in Israel or Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: In Israel itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: You know, I'm sure there was a point at which . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: I think through high school, I felt fairly confident.</span> <span id="s1014">Solid ground, never.</span> <span id="s1015">I don't think -- I'm on as solid ground as anybody could ever hope for now in my life.</span> <span id="s1016">But I will never feel on solid ground in this lifetime.</span> <span id="s1017">I feel -- I don't dwell on it.</span> <span id="s1018">I really don't dwell on it, because I like to dwell on the positive versus the negative.</span> <span id="s1019">Even as a child, Passover time, they used to all bring up everything that happened in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1020">You know, they talk about the exit from Egypt and, you know, our forefathers coming out of Egypt.</span> <span id="s1021">And they started in about what happened, how they rounded us up, how this one walked through Italy.</span> <span id="s1022">The other one went to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1023">You know, everybody brought up their story, and it used to drive me crazy as a child.</span> <span id="s1024">At that point, I said, "We are already in Israel.</span> <span id="s1025">We are already in freedom.</span> <span id="s1026">Why do we have to talk about it?"</span> <span id="s1027">I realized why we had to talk about it, of course.</span> <span id="s1028">And many times I blamed myself because of that, that I didn't ask all the questions while my parents -- while they were alive.</span> <span id="s1029">I didn't want to deal with it, so I did not ask all the questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">02:50:03 And really I was in Israel the other day, and I sat with my brother and my cousin who was with us in concentration camp, we were discussing it.</span> <span id="s1031">And everybody has just almost awakened to ask the questions, and nobody has parents anymore to ask them from.</span> <span id="s1032">While they were alive, none of us wanted to deal with it.</span> <span id="s1033">Okay?</span> <span id="s1034">So, yes, you say you're confident, and maybe you pretend to be confident, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1035">But I -- as I said, I dwell on the positive, and I think about, you know, in a positive way.</span> <span id="s1036">But to say I'm on solid ground, I'm not afraid that tomorrow somebody's going to tell me to pack up and move.</span> <span id="s1037">But I will never say that it cannot happen again.</span> <span id="s1038">There are times when we joke or we sit around and talk, and, say, in case of emergency -- I use it, in case of emergency, something disastrous would have happened to us.</span> <span id="s1039">Let's see, what can we do?</span> <span id="s1040">What are the skills that we have?</span> <span id="s1041">What is it that we can do to survive?</span> <span id="s1042">It's always in the back of my mind somewhere.</span> <span id="s1043">God forbid that I should have to.</span> <span id="s1044">I'm not looking forward to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: I'm wondering whether the lack of absolute confidence or security is part of the human condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Very possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Certainly tempered by your experiences and what you went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: And then also, many years in Israel, which is -- you know, which has been a volatile place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: It has been a volatile place to live, but on the other hand, I have to tell you I think if I would have grown up in any other country but Israel, I would have been emotionally a much sicker person.</span> <span id="s1051">I think there was something in Israel that I have to give a lot of credit to.</span> <span id="s1052">There was something permeated in the air, in the atmosphere, in the surrounding.</span> <span id="s1053">I always felt safe in Israel when I was growing up, in spite of all the goings on.</span> <span id="s1054">And I think what -- there was something permeating the air, and I think the message that I heard was we love the children.</span> <span id="s1055">They are our future.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">02:53:05 You are important.</span> <span id="s1057">And I'm not talking me, physically, as an individual, but rather all the children.</span> <span id="s1058">The children were cherished, not just by their parents, but by the neighbors.</span> <span id="s1059">By the people on the street.</span> <span id="s1060">There was something healthy in the air.</span> <span id="s1061">There was something health going on, in spite of the pain, in spite of everything else.</span> <span id="s1062">In spite of the fact that there was no psychological counseling and no group therapy and no this and no that.</span> <span id="s1063">Maybe the group therapy was that they allowed us to grow up, to be children as much as possible.</span> <span id="s1064">That you were in the youth movement.</span> <span id="s1065">You were encouraged to participate.</span> <span id="s1066">We were encouraged to dance.</span> <span id="s1067">We were encouraged to enjoy ourselves.</span> <span id="s1068">There was something very healthy going on in the atmosphere that gave us some confidence, even if it was a false sense of confidence by some, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: But felt some of those...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1071">I felt safe.</span> <span id="s1072">I felt safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: You talked a little bit about when you made the transition from the kibbutz to Haifa, how you felt distanced from your mother and you felt angry.</span> <span id="s1074">Had you a few questions.</span> <span id="s1075">Had you by necessity developed your own kind of strength and independence, and almost in self-defense, were you angry at your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Maybe my mother wasn't -- you know, it took me a long time to grow up, to realize, to understand the circumstances of her life were not easy.</span> <span id="s1077">She was not the most communicative person.</span> <span id="s1078">And there were instances, I think, especially one that I recall that I was greatly disappointed by her.</span> <span id="s1079">She was supposed to come and visit me on a kibbutz, and there was only one bus a day that came with the caravans.</span> <span id="s1080">And I was waiting and waiting for her, and she never showed up.</span> <span id="s1081">And don't forget, there was no place to call.</span> <span id="s1082">I mean there no telephones.</span> <span id="s1083">There were no -- the grocer and some other -- the pharmacy had a telephone.</span> <span id="s1084">Nobody had phones at home.</span> <span id="s1085">So you couldn't pick up the phone and say, "Dear, I am sorry I couldn't come.</span> <span id="s1086">This and this happened."</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">02:56:03 So I had to wait for the mail to arrive as to why she didn't show up.</span> <span id="s1088">Well, she didn't show up because she traveled from Haifa to Tel Aviv, and she had a few hours to kill.</span> <span id="s1089">And she visited a friend, and she missed the bus.</span> <span id="s1090">And I couldn't get over it.</span> <span id="s1091">I couldn't get over it.</span> <span id="s1092">I'm not sure that I have gotten over it, because obviously I still mention it.</span> <span id="s1093">And my mother, may she rest in peace, she's dead since '79.</span> <span id="s1094">That kind of a thing, it remained with me.</span> <span id="s1095">That maybe I felt it was more important for her to visit her friend.</span> <span id="s1096">I know it was not, and I'm sure that she was sorely disappointed that missed the bus.</span> <span id="s1097">I can imagine her feelings.</span> <span id="s1098">But in those days, you just did not communicate and say, "You have no idea how sorry I am or how upset I was, that I didn't -- and I'll make it up to you."</span> <span id="s1099">Whatever.</span> <span id="s1100">The facts were stated, and that was it.</span> <span id="s1101">My mother didn't -- she was a sensitive person, but she didn't know how to communicate in a sensitive way.</span> <span id="s1102">And so things like that and some other little episodes that caused, we had a good relationship with each other, but it wasn't a close, close warm relationship.</span> <span id="s1103">I hear sometimes people talk about their mothers, how much they miss them and how much -- how close they were.</span> <span id="s1104">How devastated they were.</span> <span id="s1105">Everything, you know, because their mother passed away.</span> <span id="s1106">I was very hurt when she passed away.</span> <span id="s1107">I loved her dearly.</span> <span id="s1108">I wasn't devastated, I hurt for her.</span> <span id="s1109">I hurt for the life that she had.</span> <span id="s1110">I understand her.</span> <span id="s1111">And in a way, I have forgiven for this or that little thing, you know.</span> <span id="s1112">Our lives, the circumstances were horrendous.</span> <span id="s1113">I would not have wanted to be the mother in those years.</span> <span id="s1114">It was much easier to be a child.</span> <span id="s1115">Much, much easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Let's stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">03:01:01</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: You know, I think it seems that when your mother didn't show up on your kibbutz, it must have been very, very frightening because you had already lost one parent.</span> <span id="s1121">You had been separated from your mother from time to time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: What that meant in those days, it's not the same thing.</span> <span id="s1123">It's not something that you can even comprehend in terms of your daily life today, because it wasn't the missing of the bus or the -- the pain that went with it was so overwhelming.</span> <span id="s1124">The disappointment was so great, because you were a child alone in the kibbutz, and I probably have not seen my mother for six months.</span> <span id="s1125">And she just did not show up.</span> <span id="s1126">And it wasn't that she could come back with the next bus that will come the following day.</span> <span id="s1127">Because she had only that weekend, she had to go back to Haifa because she was working.</span> <span id="s1128">She was alone, she needed to make a living.</span> <span id="s1129">So the comprehension of nowadays where you could pick up a phone and you can call, and so what if she missed not coming?</span> <span id="s1130">So she will come next week.</span> <span id="s1131">That was not there.</span> <span id="s1132">When she missed that bus, there was this child that was still standing there waiting for her and conjuring up the imagination of being hugged and kissed and loved.</span> <span id="s1133">She just didn't show up.</span> <span id="s1134">And in the end, it took another six months, it wasn't so simple for me as a child.</span> <span id="s1135">I didn't have somebody to tuck me in and hug me every day.</span> <span id="s1136">So the disappointment was horrendous, and it obviously had to be horrendous if I still speak about it at 58 years old.</span> <span id="s1137">I should have gotten over it long ago, but this explains a little bit that I'm trying to think why was that little bit of estrangement between us.</span> <span id="s1138">It wasn't an estrangement, we were friends in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">03:04:06 But in some ways, that warmth that we had for each other on my part changed.</span> <span id="s1140">Something changed in formula.</span> <span id="s1141">I guess she was needy in one way; I was needy in another way.</span> <span id="s1142">It's hard to explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Maybe you could summarize for me what happened after high school.</span> <span id="s1144">You got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: I got married in 1957.</span> <span id="s1146">August '57.</span> <span id="s1147">To a young Israeli-born individual whose parents also came from Hungary, but they were in Israel before the war, in the '30s.</span> <span id="s1148">And so there was a sabra, and my husband right from the beginning spoke about the fact that he is -- he wants to come to America.</span> <span id="s1149">Because he felt that there was a future, there is something that he -- he felt the need to go.</span> <span id="s1150">That he needs to go, he needs to explore.</span> <span id="s1151">He needs to find himself.</span> <span id="s1152">And, of course, I never took him seriously, because neither one of us came from homes that could afford this luxury of going anywhere.</span> <span id="s1153">And I really didn't think we'll ever come to America, but so I let him talk.</span> <span id="s1154">But little did I know that at that time, I didn't know my husband well enough.</span> <span id="s1155">Now, I would believe him, but in those days, I did not.</span> <span id="s1156">And he really made arrangements.</span> <span id="s1157">He had an uncle in the United States in New York, and he made arrangements through a friend who was in New York to arrange for the papers and for his uncle to loan him the money to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1158">And once we'll get here, we'll work and we'll give him back the money.</span> <span id="s1159">And within six months, we were in the United States.</span> <span id="s1160">So little did I know what I hit me.</span> <span id="s1161">We arrived in New York, and we worked in New York, the two of us.</span> <span id="s1162">I worked in a sweat shop sewing doll clothes, and my husband who finished the technical high school just like me, went to work as a tool and die maker in Brooklyn, New York.</span> <span id="s1163">And we were looking for a way of solving the situation.</span> <span id="s1164">Our friends talked us into teaching Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">03:07:00 I had a teacher's certificate anyway as a teacher, and my husband decided to try it.</span> <span id="s1166">And we got a job as Hebrew school teachers in Schenectady, New York.</span> <span id="s1167">During the summertime, not to remain in New York for such a long time, we went to -- we got a job in a camp.</span> <span id="s1168">It's called Camp Ramah (ph), which is a Hebrew-speaking camp.</span> <span id="s1169">And really that was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1170">We spent the summer there, we learned a lot.</span> <span id="s1171">And during the winter, we taught Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s1172">And at that point, we have decided that there has to be a purpose why we came.</span> <span id="s1173">We could not just leave Israel, leave our friends, leave our parents, leave the home, and spend some time teaching Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s1174">That wasn't enough.</span> <span id="s1175">So Simon started seriously studying for his SATs, and trying to learn by himself how to do -- how to take the tests and how to score.</span> <span id="s1176">And a year later, we felt that Schenectady, New York is too isolated a place for us.</span> <span id="s1177">This is just not -- wasn't the right place for two young people.</span> <span id="s1178">We were very, very lonely and alone there.</span> <span id="s1179">And after spending another summer in the summer camp, we got a job in Quincy, Massachusetts, which is south of Boston, 15 miles south of Boston.</span> <span id="s1180">And we went to teach there in a very lovely congregation, and Simon applied to BU and was accepted as an engineering student.</span> <span id="s1181">And so our life was set.</span> <span id="s1182">We both worked full-time as Hebrew school teachers, and Simon went to school.</span> <span id="s1183">And he graduated within four years, aeronautical engineering.</span> <span id="s1184">Then once that was done, we moved to New York.</span> <span id="s1185">At this stage of our lives in 1964, we were married about seven years or so, and we really -- already beforehand we really wanted to have children, start a family.</span> <span id="s1186">I couldn't have any children.</span> <span id="s1187">And so as a result, we started to look into adoption which was impossible.</span> <span id="s1188">In Boston they had the blue laws.</span> <span id="s1189">Only Jewish children can a Jewish couple adopt, and you could not adopt a child out of your faith.</span> <span id="s1190">We went to New York, we applied again for adoption.</span> <span id="s1191">The situation was very similar in those days and very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s1192">So Simon worked for Grumman Aircraft for two years, and I went back -- I left the Hebrew school teaching, which was a good job and wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">03:10:04 But I really desired a more creative job, and I wanted to design dresses.</span> <span id="s1194">Just really what.</span> <span id="s1195">I learned, and I was a dress designer for a children's manufacturer in New York.</span> <span id="s1196">When we realized that we will never be able to adopt a child in New York, two years later Simon looked for a job in California, Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1197">Everybody told us that it's much easier to adopt children in Los Angeles, and that's the place for us to go.</span> <span id="s1198">And so we took off, literally took off.</span> <span id="s1199">Simon got a job through the Wall Street Journal with Litten Industries, and we arrived in Los Angeles, total strangers again.</span> <span id="s1200">The wandering Jews.</span> <span id="s1201">We arrived in Los Angeles, we did not know a soul.</span> <span id="s1202">I think we were in motel when we applied for adoption through the Los Angeles County of Adoption Agency.</span> <span id="s1203">And we started working: Simon at Litten; me as a dress designer.</span> <span id="s1204">Worked very hard, the two of us, to make end meet.</span> <span id="s1205">And nine months later we got our son, our first child.</span> <span id="s1206">And we named him Terrence, a nice Irish name.</span> <span id="s1207">And we gave him a Hebrew name, Alonim (ph) , which is an oak tree.</span> <span id="s1208">Nice and strong.</span> <span id="s1209">And actually we call him Terry or Alonim, depending on what the mood is.</span> <span id="s1210">And today he's 28 years old, he's married.</span> <span id="s1211">He lives up in Vermont with his wife.</span> <span id="s1212">And he has no children, and I don't think he desires to have any.</span> <span id="s1213">Later on, we adopted a little girl, and we named her Corey Tamar, but actually she's called Tammy.</span> <span id="s1214">So she's not using any of formal names.</span> <span id="s1215">Everybody calls her Tammy, and she's 24 years old.</span> <span id="s1216">And she's engaged to be married, and she's finishing her Master's Degree in social work at Boston University.</span> <span id="s1217">And a year from now in October, she'll get married to a wonderful young man who is at Yale Law School.</span> <span id="s1218">And the two children really -- the two children with us formed our little family.</span> <span id="s1219">And we raised them in California partially, and then Simon got a very good job over here in Washington and we moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">03:13:00 Terry was four and a half years old, and Tammy was seven months old.</span> <span id="s1221">And we moved to Washington.</span> <span id="s1222">So I arrived with two little kids in a brand new area.</span> <span id="s1223">Again, not knowing almost anyone.</span> <span id="s1224">But before long, you know, we made friends, and we realized really that it doesn't matter where you live.</span> <span id="s1225">It's the friends that you make in the place that counts.</span> <span id="s1226">Every strange place is strange at first until you make some friends.</span> <span id="s1227">And now we have so many friends, we don't have time for everybody.</span> <span id="s1228">And we live out in Potomac.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: I guess you learned to be very adaptable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1231">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Because you had been uprooted . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: So many times.</span> <span id="s1234">I have moved so many times that it's really hard to count already.</span> <span id="s1235">Even within the city, you know, you live in one dwelling; then you move to another and you move to another.</span> <span id="s1236">And you go to summer and you come back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: What were your biggest surprises when you arrived in New York?</span> <span id="s1238">Was it what you expected?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: No.</span> <span id="s1240">No.</span> <span id="s1241">New York overwhelmed and scared me.</span> <span id="s1242">Number one, we arrived to New York in February, which is not the nicest month of the year to arrive.</span> <span id="s1243">Second, the dirty snow on the ground and the dark brick buildings which I was not -- my eyes were not used to.</span> <span id="s1244">All the buildings in Israel are painted white or off-white or, you know, they are light colors.</span> <span id="s1245">And I'm used to this tremendous sunshine shining on top of these bright buildings.</span> <span id="s1246">I felt closed in, it frightened me.</span> <span id="s1247">It really frightened me.</span> <span id="s1248">It took time.</span> <span id="s1249">Not a long time because we had to bounce on our feet, and we had to start going.</span> <span id="s1250">And we didn't have two pennies to rub together, two cents.</span> <span id="s1251">And if I tell you I used to go to work, I had ten cents to go on the subway one way.</span> <span id="s1252">In those days it was ten cents.</span> <span id="s1253">Ten cents to go down to work, and I had ten cents exactly to come back.</span> <span id="s1254">And on Saturdays, the train stopped somehow on a different avenue.</span> <span id="s1255">Same street, but different avenue.</span> <span id="s1256">It didn't stop -- the train didn't stop in the same place.</span> <span id="s1257">I remember being very confused and overwhelmed, and I was ready to leave the subway station.</span> <span id="s1258">But I wasn't sure where I was, and I -- in my little broken English, I spoke to the police officer.</span> <span id="s1259">And I said, "Are you sure that it's here?</span> <span id="s1260">Because if it's not here and I cannot get to work, I have only ten cents to go home.</span> <span id="s1261">And I won't be able to get there."</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">03:16:01 I remember him putting his hand in his pocket and giving me another ten cents, just in case.</span> <span id="s1263">Which was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Was a New York or the United States culturally shocking to you?</span> <span id="s1265">Just the way people lived -- or treated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: I didn't go too much into the culture.</span> <span id="s1267">I just was overwhelmed, for instance, surprised.</span> <span id="s1268">We arrived to Simon's uncle, who was from Hungary, and his wife was also from Hungary.</span> <span id="s1269">We arrived and they were eating and watching television.</span> <span id="s1270">I found it terribly rude.</span> <span id="s1271">You know, I couldn't understand this.</span> <span id="s1272">I could not comprehend this.</span> <span id="s1273">Because, first of all, when we left Israel, they didn't have television so that's one detail.</span> <span id="s1274">But second, when guests or somebody -- stranger came to the house, then you sat and you talked to them around the table.</span> <span id="s1275">You didn't look at television.</span> <span id="s1276">I mean the cars and everything, everything was a bit overwhelming at first.</span> <span id="s1277">But in our own modest way, you know, we scaled things down.</span> <span id="s1278">We knew how to look inward and to know what we could afford and what we cannot afford.</span> <span id="s1279">I mean it wasn't that difficult for me to say -- we were not needy as much.</span> <span id="s1280">You know, we could easily say, "Well, we're not going to buy another skirt or another pair of pants or another shirt, because we just can't afford it this year.</span> <span id="s1281">It's okay, we'll do it next year."</span> <span id="s1282">And it next year came and we couldn't afford it, we'll say, "Well, that's okay, we'll do it the following year."</span> <span id="s1283">But both of us were very grounded, and we had very strong priorities.</span> <span id="s1284">We knew where it's at, we knew we had a goal.</span> <span id="s1285">Once we decided that we have a goal and Simon has to go to school and we are going to make it, not matter what, we always looked at the right things.</span> <span id="s1286">And to be very honest with you, we have many friends who came from Israel, and most of them got some help from home.</span> <span id="s1287">We really did it on our own.</span> <span id="s1288">Our parents could not afford to help us.</span> <span id="s1289">We helped our parents, we used to send money home, too.</span> <span id="s1290">Especially Simon's parents, because his father was ill, and he could no longer work.</span> <span id="s1291">Looking back then, we didn't think it was not fair.</span> <span id="s1292">We did not think that it is overwhelming -- we didn't think we were that unusual.</span> <span id="s1293">We really took it that this is fine, and everything that we did we felt, well, this is a step -- just a little step better than what we had before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">03:19:05 Every little success or every little achievement that we achieved, it was great.</span> <span id="s1295">Both of us are very optimistic people, and we really always felt that our cup is more than half full.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: After fleeing Europe for Israel, did you ever feel conflicted about leaving Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s1298">I felt so conflicted about leaving Israel, I never liked, for instance, my Hebrew name, Rifka, that I go by.</span> <span id="s1299">I felt so conflicted that I purposely did not use my Hungarian name, which I happen to like, Vera.</span> <span id="s1300">It's a much easier name to go by in the United States.</span> <span id="s1301">My family calls me by that name.</span> <span id="s1302">But I was so proud that I came from Israel that I said no, I'm going to use my Hebrew name; I'm not going to use -- I totally eliminated my first name even as a middle name.</span> <span id="s1303">I felt very, very bad that we left Israel at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: What -- is there anything that you can think of that really got you through all these early difficult experiences?</span> <span id="s1305">Any sort of survival skills?</span> <span id="s1306">Any special strengths or courage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: I think primarily it was the courage to bear, to try, to ask.</span> <span id="s1308">To -- not to be afraid.</span> <span id="s1309">To -- the worst could happen so somebody will say no to you.</span> <span id="s1310">I wasn't that afraid of rejection, or at least I thought that I may not take it that personally.</span> <span id="s1311">Especially on things that were not emotional.</span> <span id="s1312">You know, to dare a little bit.</span> <span id="s1313">That's not to say that I was that courageous or that -- I'm sure that I had my fears, and I had my uncertainties and my feeling of not belonging in certain places.</span> <span id="s1314">It really takes time to belong to an area or to belong to a community, or to belong anywhere.</span> <span id="s1315">A lot of people, a lot of Israelis are here for many, many years, and they love living here and so forth, but they feel a certain sense of not belonging.</span> <span id="s1316">I no longer have that.</span> <span id="s1317">I know that I have an accent.</span> <span id="s1318">I know that everybody can immediately detect that I was not born here, but I'm not afraid to speak my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">03:22:02 And I feel totally comfortable in the United States.</span> <span id="s1320">I feel very much at home.</span> <span id="s1321">I don't have those conflicts anymore.</span> <span id="s1322">Because you have to make up your mind, it's either you belong or you don't belong.</span> <span id="s1323">If you don't belong, at least we have a free country.</span> <span id="s1324">Nobody's holding a gun to my head.</span> <span id="s1325">One can pick up and go back, and over there I speak without an accent.</span> <span id="s1326">But I feel totally comfortable here, and I must say that maybe with one or two exceptions that I don't even want to recall or I don't even remember, I feel that I have always been treated fairly in America.</span> <span id="s1327">I really don't ever feel uncomfortable or not belonging or that somebody made me feel -- or was anti-Semitic to me.</span> <span id="s1328">I know it exists.</span> <span id="s1329">I mean nobody is blind to the facts of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Do you think that your strong grounding in religion was important to you throughout all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1332">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1333">I'm not a religious person, but I sent my daughter to the Jewish day school, because I felt that she needs that grounding, too.</span> <span id="s1334">She needs to know.</span> <span id="s1335">I started with my son, we took him out, which I later on, I regretted.</span> <span id="s1336">But that was because they did not have a school established yet, and I didn't see in my blurred vision, I didn't see that that will come.</span> <span id="s1337">And it was just really too difficult physically, the driving back and forth, back and forth to school.</span> <span id="s1338">So he went to public school, but she went to the Jewish day school.</span> <span id="s1339">But I tried to instill in them all the values of Judaism, because Judaism to me, it's not how religious you are; it's a way of life.</span> <span id="s1340">It's how you live your life.</span> <span id="s1341">What kind of a person you are.</span> <span id="s1342">How you treat other people.</span> <span id="s1343">How you behave towards another person.</span> <span id="s1344">What kind of examples you set for your children.</span> <span id="s1345">That's what Judaism is for me.</span> <span id="s1346">It's not just a religion, it's really a way of life.</span> <span id="s1347">And I could not be anything but Jewish, no matter what.</span> <span id="s1348">I'm very proud of being who I am.</span> <span id="s1349">I have no problems with myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">03:25:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Are there certain images that you haven't mentioned that -- that you have mentioned, that 50 years later still haunt you from the years of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: No, not anymore.</span> <span id="s1353">Not anymore.</span> <span id="s1354">As I said, now that the children are grown up and they're wonderful, and I have a family which I adore, not anymore.</span> <span id="s1355">I think when I raised them as they grew up, a lot of the things that I did not deal with as a child came back to haunt me.</span> <span id="s1356">Came back to bother me, came back to -- that I needed to talk about.</span> <span id="s1357">And for a while I went for help for that.</span> <span id="s1358">All the things that happened, all the things that I was telling you about, being in a kibbutz and being with -- and the early childhood, and the fears of childhood of being in camp, and being taken away from home like this, and being uprooted in such a rude way.</span> <span id="s1359">Another thing that I have to tell you which I forgot completely and that's something that you ought to know, you remember when I told you when we left Hungary, my mother took out the parchment from the Mezuzah?</span> <span id="s1360">She carried it to our concentration camps with her, and she had it in Israel.</span> <span id="s1361">She never put it in a case and she never hung it on the door.</span> <span id="s1362">And while she was alive one summer and I visited, she gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1363">And she said, "One day when you have a home of your own, you should put it on your door."</span> <span id="s1364">While I had a home in California, I never put it up.</span> <span id="s1365">I had a home, two homes, here in Potomac, a townhouse and a house.</span> <span id="s1366">I never put it up.</span> <span id="s1367">And we finally moved to this present house, and I said, "This is it.</span> <span id="s1368">This is the time to put it up."</span> <span id="s1369">I don't know why all these years, I did not.</span> <span id="s1370">I said, "This is the time that we are going to dedicate this Mezuzah and we are going to put it up."</span> <span id="s1371">And actually, I have a very good friend who is Rabbi Wallberg from Aziz, Israel.</span> <span id="s1372">And when I told him the story about the Mezuzah, they surprised me and they brought me a very -- I said, "I'm looking for a Mezuzah that is large enough for this parchment.</span> <span id="s1373">It's so long."</span> <span id="s1374">And he brought me a beautiful marble Mezuzah, and we dedicated the Mezuzah inside, indoors, not outdoors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">03:28:06 Because it was too precious for me to hang it outdoors.</span> <span id="s1376">I have a smaller one outside.</span> <span id="s1377">And so we hung that Mezuzah, and I'm sure that one day I will give it to my daughter.</span> <span id="s1378">This is the family inheritance.</span> <span id="s1379">That's it.</span> <span id="s1380">No more, no less.</span> <span id="s1381">But it's an important inheritance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Let me ask you sort of a strange question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: It's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: The fact that you were part of really a very privileged group to get out of Hungary . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: . . . even though you had to make an ugly detour.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: You got to Switzerland and you got to Palestine safely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Did you ever feel a little bit guilty about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: Not the least bit.</span> <span id="s1392">Why should I feel guilty?</span> <span id="s1393">Because I survived?</span> <span id="s1394">Thank God that some of us survived to tell the story.</span> <span id="s1395">We could have all died just the same.</span> <span id="s1396">And you would have never had me sitting here telling this to you.</span> <span id="s1397">I'm not apologetic.</span> <span id="s1398">I think that he deserves all the kudos in world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Kastner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">He got a raw deal.</span> <span id="s1402">And now they are commemorating a forest in his name.</span> <span id="s1403">He got a very raw deal.</span> <span id="s1404">His daughter got a terrible deal.</span> <span id="s1405">And, you know, it says, "He who saves one soul is as though he saved the world."</span> <span id="s1406">He saved 1,700 souls.</span> <span id="s1407">What does he deserve?</span> <span id="s1408">He put his life on the line every day during that war, and he put in jeopardy everybody's life.</span> <span id="s1409">He tried his best.</span> <span id="s1410">I cry for all the people who did not survive.</span> <span id="s1411">My father did not survive.</span> <span id="s1412">I have aunts and uncles and cousins who never came back.</span> <span id="s1413">People with broken lives.</span> <span id="s1414">If he would have died, would it have saved them?</span> <span id="s1415">Thank God that some of us survived.</span> <span id="s1416">Whether it's me or somebody else.</span> <span id="s1417">I should feel guilty?</span> <span id="s1418">I feel sad that there are such human beings in this world that are this inhumane, that are capable of murdering without reason, killing without reason, and hating so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">03:31:04 You know, it's amazing to me that we who really have gone through so much with capacity to love.</span> <span id="s1420">I don't have the capacity in me to hate.</span> <span id="s1421">I only have the capacity to be compassionate for somebody else, whether it's a person like me or somebody else, a different color, a different race, different religion -- I don't care.</span> <span id="s1422">And I'm not alone, I know that most people are good.</span> <span id="s1423">We brought it upon ourselves?</span> <span id="s1424">I don't want to hear this.</span> <span id="s1425">There are too many decent human lives lost, too many beautiful people.</span> <span id="s1426">Not just them who died, but the potential of what they could have become and the families that they could have brought up to this world.</span> <span id="s1427">Not the least bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: This is your only question.</span> <span id="s1429">During childhood which was really disrupted, do you now, having thought about this for a long time, see that it took a toll on you?</span> <span id="s1430">Or that it maybe, the reverse, strengthened you, but that you see sort of a long-term impact on you and how it affects the way you live today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: You know, when I raised my children, I -- maybe I was a little more overprotective of them than sometimes maybe would have been healthy, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1432">I live very well.</span> <span id="s1433">We did very well for ourselves.</span> <span id="s1434">Simon went into his own business and he did very well.</span> <span id="s1435">We live a very charmed life now.</span> <span id="s1436">I don't have financial worries.</span> <span id="s1437">I don't have to worry about working or not working anymore.</span> <span id="s1438">In fact, it was very funny, I stopped at Bridges of Georgetown today, and a young girl, maybe 18, she comes over.</span> <span id="s1439">She says, "My, you look nice today.</span> <span id="s1440">We skipped work today, didn't we?"</span> <span id="s1441">she said to me.</span> <span id="s1442">And I thought to myself -- I didn't answer, but I thought to myself it really takes a certain audacity, first of all, to turn to a customer to assume.</span> <span id="s1443">And I really wanted to say, "Actually, I'm not working.</span> <span id="s1444">I don't have to if I don't want to."</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">03:34:05 I worked plenty throughout my life, but I was thinking it to myself.</span> <span id="s1446">On the other hand, I don't ever take anything for granted, and I never forget where I came from.</span> <span id="s1447">And I always think that I know where I'm going, but I never pretend that I was born into this or this was just something that came to me rightfully so.</span> <span id="s1448">I really appreciate every day, and I thank every day for what I have and that I'm able to give instead of receiving.</span> <span id="s1449">It's a great feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Anything else you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: Well, the only thing that one can add is that I hope throughout this experience, I'm just afraid that it's only those who are already human beings and who already are kind and already are understanding are the ones that will look at these tapes or that will take the time to study it or to learn or to go into the museum.</span> <span id="s1452">But if it can change one hard heart to be compassionate to a fellow human being, it was all worth it.</span> <span id="s1453">To put it on tape, not to live it -- not to have lived it.</span> <span id="s1454">To put it on tape.</span> <span id="s1455">It's really one just can hope that we -- always I hope we learn something from it, but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s1456">It always worries me when the statement of hatred come out.</span> <span id="s1457">Whether it's from this end or that end, it frightens me.</span> <span id="s1458">All the extremes who have no tolerance for somebody else who's a little bit different than you are, it really frightens me.</span> <span id="s1459">So one can just hope for the best, and I think a lot of education needs to be done.</span> <span id="s1460">A lot, a lot of education.</span> <span id="s1461">That's all that I can add.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: You're very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">03:36:55 This family photo of my grandparents on my father's side and their 13 children were taken probably in the late '20s, early '30s.</span> <span id="s1465">My father is the second one from the left at the top row.</span> <span id="s1466">My grandparents are sitting between two of the little children.</span> <span id="s1467">They actually had given birth to 15 children; 13 survived to adulthood.</span> <span id="s1468">And some of them survived the war, and quite a few of them perished during the war.</span> <span id="s1469">This is a picture of my grandfather on my mother's side, Egnot Blythe (ph).</span> <span id="s1470">He was the father of my mother.</span> <span id="s1471">He gave birth -- or his wife gave birth to eight children who all survived to adulthood.</span> <span id="s1472">And actually, five of them survived the war.</span> <span id="s1473">Three of them with their families died during the war.</span> <span id="s1474">This a picture of my mother and father, Irana Blythe (ph) and Wilmoth Moskovitz (ph).</span> <span id="s1475">This is on their wedding day in Debrecen, the year approximately 1928.</span> <span id="s1476">This is their wedding day.</span> <span id="s1477">They actually look like a handsome couple.</span> <span id="s1478">This is a picture of me.</span> <span id="s1479">At that time, my name was Veronica Suzannah, and I'm standing in front of the tree.</span> <span id="s1480">What you don't see in this picture, actually my father was standing behind the bushes, looking at me.</span> <span id="s1481">And I'm all dressed up with a little outfit that my mother knitted.</span> <span id="s1482">My mother always knitted little outfits for me and different things, and I just loved to wear them.</span> <span id="s1483">So there I am with my little doll and myself.</span> <span id="s1484">And the city is Debrecen, and I must be here about three years old.</span> <span id="s1485">This picture of our family was taken in 1942 in Cluj.</span> <span id="s1486">This is our family: my brother who is seven and a half years older; I must have been close to five years old in this picture.</span> <span id="s1487">Andy my father, Wilmoth; my mother, Irana and my brother whose Hungarian name was Tibor and his Hebrew name is Hyne (ph).</span> <span id="s1488">This picture was taken in the apartment building that I lived.</span> <span id="s1489">This was a neighbor, a young Jewish girl, who I played with quite a bit while we lived in Cluj.</span> <span id="s1490">And you can see me dressed in like a little navy uniform and an apron that was very much the fashion of the day, and that's how I was sent to school.</span> <span id="s1491">I had various navy dresses that looked like little sailor dresses in various colors.</span> <span id="s1492">But that was the fashion, and, of course, a big bow in my hair.</span> <span id="s1493">And she's doing her homework, she was older than me.</span> <span id="s1494">I was just pretending.</span> <span id="s1495">I was still in kindergarten, I didn't know how to read and write.</span> <span id="s1496">But that picture remained, and she never survived the war.</span> <span id="s1497">That family never survived unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1498">This picture was taken in 1945 in Switzerland after we were liberated from Bergen-Belsen, and it depicts the background of Switzerland, of course.</span> <span id="s1499">And my brother, Tibi, myself and my mother standing in front of a beautiful fountain in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1500">That was just before we were taken to Bari, Italy and from there to Israel, to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1501">This picture is of me and my brother, Hyne.</span> <span id="s1502">This is already we changed our name to Hebrew names, and this photograph was taken in Israel, I think in 1945 or '46.</span> <span id="s1503">My mother had us pose specifically so that she can send back pictures to surviving relatives in Hungary so they can see that we alive and we are well in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Conclusion of interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0352 PAGE 52</span></p></body></html>
