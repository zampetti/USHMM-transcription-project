from the grass- the flowers I ate.</span> <span id="s1113">And, next it came night and we got into a town again.</span> <span id="s1114">And uh...we had at that time, we had women soldiers too.</span> <span id="s1115">S.S. women.</span> <span id="s1116">And where we were staying, I saw a wagon with two wheels, with a Platte [a platform board] on the top.</span> <span id="s1117">I said to my friend, "You know what?</span> <span id="s1118">We can get some food.</span> <span id="s1119">We take that wagon, we tell the women soldiers to put their loop sacks on the wagon, we might get some food from them."</span> <span id="s1120">He says, "Yeah, ok."</span> <span id="s1121">So we were standing to the last, we took the wagon.</span> <span id="s1122">We said to the women soldiers, "Put your bags on it."</span> <span id="s1123">"Oh no,no,no!"</span> <span id="s1124">- "Put your bags on it."</span> <span id="s1125">- So they put their bags on it, but we didn't get nothing from it.</span> <span id="s1126">But at least, we had a little...we were the last ones in the whole group, -just in case.</span> <span id="s1127">Finally, we came into a town called Neunburg am Wald [Neunburg vorm Wald].</span> <span id="s1128">Neunburg vorm Wald and...

and they took them out to the place where two hundred people were shot - to dig them out and to have a real burial in a cemetary.</span> <span id="s1228">That's what I have that picture of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Of the two thousand that began the march, how many survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: About five hundred.</span> <span id="s1231">I don't know after we run away - [before] there were still about five hundred.</span> <span id="s1232">But what happened after we run away I don't know.</span> <span id="s1233">So uh.</span> <span id="s1234">.</span> <span id="s1235">from there on, we were staying on this place where we run away and were liberated.</span> <span id="s1236">And I knew which window was where they threw to us the bread.</span> <span id="s1237">So we went upstairs to give thanks tp those German people for the bread.</span> <span id="s1238">There was a woman with two children - her husband was in the war.</span> <span id="s1239">She says to us, "Do you have where to stay?"</span> <span id="s1240">So we say, "no."</span> <span id="s1241">So she says, "Here, I'll give you a room to stay."</span> <span id="s1242">So, we went into that room.</span> <span id="s1243">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: You and Moishe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1246">We went into that room and uh...she says," would you like to take a bath?"</span> <span id="s1247">So we said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1248">So she says, "Here's the bathtub."</span> <span id="s1249">And we took a bath.</span> <span id="s1250">Food, she didn't have.</span> <span id="s1251">But she give us something to eat.</span> <span id="s1252">But then after we took a bath, we were very tired, we layed down.</span> <span id="s1253">After we got relaxed, we went to the American authority and we said that we are so-and so and so and that we don't have any food.</span> <span id="s1254">Of course, they give us and we brought it into the place where we lived and we give it to the German woman.</span> <span id="s1255">We says, "Here's food.</span> <span id="s1256">And you cook us whatever there is."</span> <span id="s1257">And later on, was established - because all of a sudden there were at least about fifty of us in that place - in that little town.</span> <span id="s1258">So, we went to the American authority again to establish the refugee camp.</span> <span id="s1259">There was a refugge camp so we could get food - as a refugee camp.</span> <span id="s1260">So, we were there for about, oh I would say after the war - about two months or three, maybe.</span> <span id="s1261">Then we.</span> <span id="s1262">.</span> <span id="s1263">we got up to look for relatives in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1264">Where did we go?</span> <span id="s1265">We went to Bergen Belsen.</span> <span id="s1266">Bergen Belsen is on the English side.</span> <span id="s1267">So we came to Bergen Belsen, I find my cousin there.</span> <span id="s1268">And he didn't find nobody but he found himself a girl there.</span> <span id="s1269">And he married this girl, he made a wedding there.</span> <span id="s1270">- I went outside to organize some food, liquer and things like that and as I'm coming with all these goodies into the camp - there were English soldiers who were watching the camp.</span> <span id="s1271">As I'm coming in with the goodies, what do you think the English soldiers did?</span> <span id="s1272">They confiscated everything that I had.</span> <span id="s1273">Can you imagine that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: No reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: No reason.</span> <span id="s1276">Confiscated everything what I had: salami, bread, and liquer and everything what I had.</span> <span id="s1277">Because, for cigarettes and coffee you could get anything you wanted after the war.</span> <span id="s1278">So now, I don't have again for the wedding - nothing.</span> <span id="s1279">So, were three of us -no- four of us, but that Moishe was staying with a girl and three of us, we went back again to the city.</span> <span id="s1280">Again with coffee and with cigarettes and chocolates, we organized again.</span> <span id="s1281">This time, we didn't go through the main gate.</span> <span id="s1282">We cut a hole through the fence and that's how we got in.</span> <span id="s1283">And we made him a wedding, a beautiful wedding.</span> <span id="s1284">Then, I organized a..</span> <span id="s1285">.</span> <span id="s1286">`bout thirty people to go home - to Romania.</span> <span id="s1287">That time it was again Romania.</span> <span id="s1288">So, as we... I organized everything, we went to the train and we got a wagon and everything and as we go to Czechoslovakia the train stops and, what do you think?</span> <span id="s1289">It's Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s1290">They come to the train, and they want to rape the girls.</span> <span id="s1291">As I know a few words in Russian, so I don't know, by luck or what - they went away.</span> <span id="s1292">I had with me Hungarians and Romanians.</span> <span id="s1293">The Hungarians were from Budapest, I had people from Budapest and I had people from Romania, which we went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: So you did get home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1296">So, here I'm coming home -
