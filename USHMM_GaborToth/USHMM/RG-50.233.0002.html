with your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s6">My name is Inge Auerbacher.</span> <span id="s7">I was born in a little village in Southern Germany called Kippenheim It’s a little town at that time about 2,000 people, very close to the borders of France and Switzerland and we had about 60 Jewish families living there.</span> <span id="s8">We were all quite Orthodox in a modern way.</span> <span id="s9">We went to the Synagogue on Friday nights and Sabbath, and we were really a very nice community.</span> <span id="s10">Most of the Jewish people had little stores there or were cattle dealers and that is a profession that a great many Jews in Southern Germany were involved in.</span> <span id="s11">In fact, my grandparents, the grandfathers actually on both sides, my mother’s side, my mother’s father and mother.</span> <span id="s12">On that side, my grandfather was cattle dealer there and my grandfather from my father’s side was also a cattle dealer and skin and hide business.</span> <span id="s13">I did not know my grandparents on my father’s side; his parents, they had died before my parents got married and my father was one out of six children; my mother one out of two.</span> <span id="s14">And I did know my grandparents from my mother’s side with whom I had a very close relationship.</span> <span id="s15">They live about four or five hours away in an even smaller village than the one I was born in.</span> <span id="s16">That village was called Jebenhausen, when mine was Kippenheim.</span> <span id="s17">In fact, my grandmother’s, the village where my grandparents lived had famous person roots there too, by the name of Albert Einstein.</span> <span id="s18">Albert Einstein had spent quite a few summers in that little village, I believe his grandmother or aunt and uncle, somebody in that family had a little bakery there, and he visited quite often.</span> <span id="s19">I don’t recall ever seeing him there.</span> <span id="s20">Of course he was quite grown at that time already and somehow it was not even known that he was such a famous man.</span> <span id="s21">I mean he was a little boy at that time and nobody ever spoke about that again.</span> <span id="s22">I only found out about this much later.</span> <span id="s23">I did not play with any non-Jewish children in my village.</span> <span id="s24">I mainly spent my time with Jewish children and anyway I only spent about four or five years in my village.</span> <span id="s25">It was, we had a good relationship with the people in, the Christian people in Kippenheim, but we lived separate lives and a good co-existence.</span> <span id="s26">But there was always some undercurrents of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s27">That’s what my parents told me too.</span> <span id="s28">We had a very large house, about 17 rooms.</span> <span id="s29">We had servants.</span> <span id="s30">Some of, I don’t remember that much of my little village, just mainly some things about going to the Temple, the holidays; I was the last Jewish child born in that little village and one of the main events that I will never forget is Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s31">Actually I don’t remember November 9.</span> <span id="s32">Nothing much happened really on that day.</span> <span id="s33">I remember November 10 and our Synagogue was demolished.</span> <span id="s34">It was not set aflame because the neighboring houses, there were a lot of Christian neighboring houses and they were afraid that they would burn too.</span> <span id="s35">But it was completely ransacked.</span> <span id="s36">My mother saw how the Ten Commandments were thrown from the top, they were set on top of the building and how they were thrown down.</span> <span id="s37">I remember the day of the 10th.</span> <span id="s38">My grandparents had come to visit us and my grandfather got up early in the morning to go to Temple to morning services; he was a very Orthodox man.</span> <span id="s39">My father and my, we actually still in bed and the bell rang and the police came in and they said that all Jewish men are now under arrest and that my father should dress immediately and report to City Hall.</span> <span id="s40">Then I remember when my father left, our house was stone.</span> <span id="s41">All the windows were broken in the entire house and my mother and I and my grandmother had to find shelter in a nearby shed.</span> <span id="s42">We had like a courtyard and there was like a little area in the courtyard that was used as a storage area and we hid in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Who were throwing the stone?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Some of, some boys.</span> <span id="s45">Who, I mean I really didn’t even see them.</span> <span id="s46">We just heard the noise, you know, when the, in fact when the stone were being thrown I remember we were standing, I believe it was the living room, and they were looking at the chandelier in our living room and they said, oh look at this!</span> <span id="s47">The chandelier is still standing, it’s still hanging and they threw a big brick inside the house and it nearly hit me and my mother just pulled me away.</span> <span id="s48">That’s when we went for the neighboring shed and the servant girl was with us at that time, but she was afraid and she ran away.</span> <span id="s49">Then they were knocking at the door, there was a big, we had this courtyard and a big door in front of it and we heard them knocking and rattling the doors and but luckily they did not come in.</span> <span id="s50">The boys, we were told later, some of them were some young boys from neighboring towns and perhaps some from the town.</span> <span id="s51">I did not see them do this.</span> <span id="s52">But as I said, my mother looked through the broken window and she saw how the Ten Commandments were thrown down.</span> <span id="s53">And here in the shed we stayed for many, many hours until it was quiet.</span> <span id="s54">In the meantime, all the men who had reported to the City Hall and the ones who were in the Synagogue were arrested.</span> <span id="s55">So my grandfather never came home that day.</span> <span id="s56">They took all these men to Dachau, the first concentration camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s57">Then we went to a neighboring house, a Jewish house, where also all of the windows were broken and to find some shelter and we came.</span> <span id="s58">I think we stayed, my mothers that.</span> <span id="s59">I do not remember it that we stayed overnight with friends.</span> <span id="s60">And then we went back to the house and of course everything was filled up with broken glass, the whole house and the windows had to be boarded up because it was winter of course and it was quite cold already.</span> <span id="s61">November is already cold in Germany.</span> <span id="s62">And my father had been a disabled war veteran of World War I.</span> <span id="s63">He was wounded on his right shoulder quite badly and he could not raise his right arm and he was quite a good patriot, I mean he loved Germany, so my grandfather he said he was born in this country, he would never leave it.</span> <span id="s64">He loved his little village of Jebenhausen and he was very happy there.</span> <span id="s65">And my father always said why should we leave here?</span> <span id="s66">I mean I fought for this country; I was wounded for this country; I mean nothing is going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s67">We were very good citizens like, I mean Americans here, if you are, if you were born in this country or even if you become a citizen, you pledge allegiance to that country and we pledged our allegiance to Germany.</span> <span id="s68">We had hundreds of years, my family had lived in Germany.</span> <span id="s69">I fact, one of Germany’s most famous poets and writers was Berthal Auerbach, who made the Black Forest famous.</span> <span id="s70">He name was Moses Baruch Auerbacher.</span> <span id="s71">He live about a hundred years ago and he become world famous.</span> <span id="s72">His books were published in many languages including English.</span> <span id="s73">He wrote a lot about the Black Forest.</span> <span id="s74">Well, after a few weeks that my grandfather and my father were in Dachau, they came back.</span> <span id="s75">My mother had bought a bogus ticket to Trinidad, and she went to some SS headquarters.</span> <span id="s76">I don’t remember exactly the neighboring town, and she begged for his release and that she had tickets for us to leave and she did get my father out at that time and soon afterwards my grandfather came out too and then we heard of all of the terrible things that happened to them in Dachau and one of them my father related that he had to…they had to stand for hours on end in the courtyard in the exercise area in Dachau with their striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s77">Of course all of their clothes were take away and in fact to transgress a little bit my…and one of the SS people…police people from the village in Kippenheim came to my mother’s…our house and he brought a basketful of ties and belts and he said oh, here are the remnants of your men, so my mother thought for sure everybody had been killed by now.</span> <span id="s78">I mean these are the clothes, the ties, the belts and I believe some shirts and things and, but anyway when they were there of course they had to give up all their clothing and wore the striped uniform.</span> <span id="s79">And they had to stand at attention for 10-12 hours at a time and if somebody tried to blow their nose…it was quite cold in…I mean the suits were a flimsy kind of pajama type of suits, they were hosed down with cold, ice cold water and this happened one to my father.</span> <span id="s80">Now my grandfather had a very bad heart condition and of course this made it even worse.</span> <span id="s81">He was not an old man, he was in his early sixties at that time and when he came out of the camp he died very soon afterwards of…actually it was a combination of a broken heart physically and mentally.</span> <span id="s82">He was just so disappointed in the country that he loved and that this could happen to him and he saw the writing on the wall, but he would never leave it.</span> <span id="s83">He said I was born here, and I will die here no matter what happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Do you remember what your father looked like when he came back from Dachau?</span> <span id="s85">Do you remember anything particular about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: I remember just one thing.</span> <span id="s87">It was quite kind of cold in the house and I don’t know, I think we had enough coal or something to heat one or two rooms and I remember, I was a tiny little girl at that time, I was not even four years old, I remember sitting on my potty, I remember that I my prayer book in my hand, I’m praying for my daddy to come home again.</span> <span id="s88">I could not read or write at that time.</span> <span id="s89">I remember when he came, he threw a stone at the boarded up window.</span> <span id="s90">He didn’t ring the bell and he came.</span> <span id="s91">I don’t remember what he looked like, no I did not, but I know my parents talked in hushed voices, I mean that I should not hear what happened and he told my mother, now it’s really time.</span> <span id="s92">We must leave Germany.</span> <span id="s93">There is no way that we can stay here.</span> <span id="s94">And my mother started to write some letters to relatives in America.</span> <span id="s95">There were a few who had done quite well, especially an uncle of his who became quite well-to-do in America, and the letter, the answer we received from the family was well, we have a bad recession and depression here and you would only add to the number of people unemployed and you better stay where you are, and that was the answer.</span> <span id="s96">And we just could not get the affidavits, the papers to come here because my father needed to have a higher affidavit.</span> <span id="s97">He had to have a sponsor who was willing to have enough money that in case he could not work, there would be no welfare for us; we had to have our own money and my father needed more because he was a disabled war veteran so they figured that he may not get a job here and we would become a burden to the country.</span> <span id="s98">So that made it even harder.</span> <span id="s99">And in the meantime some of my relatives, my father’s sisters, two of them, had gotten papers to go to Brazil and they did leave.</span> <span id="s100">They managed to get out and a brother of my mother, her only brother, received papers from an uncle of my aunts to come to America, so they managed to get here.</span> <span id="s101">And my uncle fought in the American Army in World War II while he was here.</span> <span id="s102">We did not get out.</span> <span id="s103">So after 1938, after Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass, after that program we decided we have to find some way to get out.</span> <span id="s104">so we sold the house at a very cheap price and moved in with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s105">And then my grandfather died.</span> <span id="s106">And it was around…that was in 1939.</span> <span id="s107">I remember the best time for me of my childhood was in this little village of Jebenhausen where we had moved in with my grandparents and I had many Christian friends, and my grandparents were the last Jewish family living in this tiny little village where more Jews had lived before.</span> <span id="s108">They had moved away and become big industrialists in the neighboring town of Girpingen.</span> <span id="s109">I had a very nice time with Christian children and I remember many times I would be the cheerleader walking up and down the hill singing the songs of the day which were Nazi songs and I would be the one who would be the cheerleader leading them on.</span> <span id="s110">I did know what the real meaning behind these songs were, but I was so caught up with the charisma and the chemistry of this day, of this tremendous upheaval and I didn’t know that these people, one of their primary ideas was to hate the Jews!</span> <span id="s111">We must get rid of the Jews!</span> <span id="s112">The children there did not make me feel bad.</span> <span id="s113">They did not call me any bad names and they were really my friends and some of them are still my friends today.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Did you know that you were a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: I knew that I was Jew, yes.</span> <span id="s116">But it…somehow it did not occur to me to think that I was really any different.</span> <span id="s117">I mean nobody talked to me from these children you know, why do you do this and that.</span> <span id="s118">I knew that they celebrated Christmas and in fact I was a little envious of them because it was a very beautiful holiday.</span> <span id="s119">Always they received many toys and the Christmas tree and so many of those decorations and all and we didn’t have that and that was kind of an enviable time for me because everybody was celebrating and of course my grandparents tried very hard to make me feel good about Hanukkah and sort of to make me feel proud that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s120">I was brought up in a very good Jewish home; an observant Jewish home in a modern kind of way.</span> <span id="s121">I mean during Sabbath, it was really Sabbath.</span> <span id="s122">We did not do any work, we were not allowed to write or do any manual labor, etc.</span> <span id="s123">It was…all of the things of the Sabbath, I mean the way we celebrated was the regular observant way.</span> <span id="s124">There was no Synagogue in Jebenhausen, so we walked to the neighboring town of Girpingen to go to a prayer service and we were not allowed to take the bus.</span> <span id="s125">So we walked the three kilometers back and forth through the woods…there was a road through the woods, and the Synagogue in Girpingen in the neighboring town, had been completely burnt to the ground.</span> <span id="s126">So there was like an apartment in converted into a prayer area.</span> <span id="s127">In fact at that time they didn’t have a rabbi any more and my father made the service.</span> <span id="s128">He was very good in Hebrew and he led the service for the people.</span> <span id="s129">In 1940 I began my school career.</span> <span id="s130">And Jewish children were not allowed to go to the school in their town.</span> <span id="s131">There was one school for the State of Wuerttemburg.</span> <span id="s132">That was in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s133">So I had to travel, in fact I had to get travel permission papers to take the train.</span> <span id="s134">First I had to walk the three kilometers to the train station and then take the train to Stuttgart, which was another hour, and then walk by myself to the school.</span> <span id="s135">In the beginning, my father took me with a bicycle and he took me to the train station and then he had…and then the law came out that all Jewish people had to do some work…kind of a slave labor and my mother had to sew in a corset factory, a women’s undergarment factory and my father became the cutter.</span> <span id="s136">Although he never did this kind of work before, he had at that time, I mean before all of this happened, he had his own textile business selling dry goods.</span> <span id="s137">Mainly wholesale and retail to different hotels and also private people.</span> <span id="s138">He sold different things.</span> <span id="s139">Linen and dry goods.</span> <span id="s140">And after they had to do this slave labor, I had to travel all by myself to the school and it became quite difficult when we had to start to wear the star, the yellow star and that became a huge problem.</span> <span id="s141">And my father said to me…in fact the star…I was such a little girl still.</span> <span id="s142">I was six years old and from the age of six in Germany all the people had to wear the yellow star with the word Jew on it.</span> <span id="s143">My star covered most of my left side, I mean I was still a little girl and he said when you sit down on the train, sit in such a way that you can normally cover up the star.</span> <span id="s144">In other words, like bent over on your left side.</span> <span id="s145">It had to be worn on the left side over my breast, you know on the left side.</span> <span id="s146">And so I did this and I was always nervous because there were these rowdy school children who would go from one town to the next by train and they would be very fresh and they would stare and people always tried to have conversation with me in the train.</span> <span id="s147">Why are you going all alone to…traveling by yourself and by the age if six to go all by yourself to a school so far away.</span> <span id="s148">I mean why don’t you go in your own town?</span> <span id="s149">And it was very hard to answer them.</span> <span id="s150">They made me very nervous and scared.</span> <span id="s151">I remember in the morning when I took the train there was always a very mean policeman who would be sometimes at the station and that really gave me a scare in the morning.</span> <span id="s152">I had to get up very, very early in the morning to make the train and I remember once a woman, a Christian woman, she realized that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s153">She left…when she left, she left a bag of rolls in a paper bag right next to my seat.</span> <span id="s154">She didn’t say a word, but she left that for me.</span> <span id="s155">And to me she…I mean she was resisting what was going on but in a silent way, but nevertheless she had the heart to think of that Jewish child who might wanted to eat those rolls; she wanted to do some kindness to that Jewish child, but very afraid to talk to me, but she realized she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s156">I remember also at that time I had to take the train…the car I think it was third class.</span> <span id="s157">In Germany you had second and first class trains.</span> <span id="s158">I remember a group of prisoners…they may have been Russian prisoners or Polish, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s159">But they were also herded to somewhere and how they would sit in the compartment and sharing a cup of something or other, some food, they shared one cup will contain a drinking out of it all at the same time, going from one to the other and they were with a watchman.</span> <span id="s160">That was in the same compartment.</span> <span id="s161">It kind of struck something in me.</span> <span id="s162">I mean I had never…I had come from a very, very tiny town and I had never been really anywhere, not many miles away from my home, and seeing things like that, it just made me extremely nervous and afraid that people were mistreated so badly you know, that people could do this to other people and these were not Jewish people.</span> <span id="s163">In 1941 the transports to the so-called East began.</span> <span id="s164">And my school was almost, I mean all of the children of the school, almost all of them, were in those first few transports.</span> <span id="s165">My grandmother and also my parents and myself, we received our papers for transport to a place called Riga, Latvia.</span> <span id="s166">Of course, really did not know where these transports were going.</span> <span id="s167">We found out later.</span> <span id="s168">And my father did not trust this whole thing and he said you know, I will try to see if we can get out of the transports.</span> <span id="s169">So he wrote a letter…he made my mother actually write a letter to the Nazi headquarters in Stuttgart to the Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s170">And he had a picture taken, I remember that very well, of his wounds, and somehow the letter worked.</span> <span id="s171">We got out of this transport.</span> <span id="s172">And I remember going with my father because I had travel papers and he also had because he was supposed to accompany me in the beginning of going to school; he had the papers to go…the permission to go from one town to another.</span> <span id="s173">It was not permitted anymore to travel by train, bus or anything without papers.</span> <span id="s174">It was very hard to get the papers.</span> <span id="s175">And I only had them because I had to go to school.</span> <span id="s176">And I remember going with him to the Gestapo headquarters for my grandmother and they wouldn’t even see us.</span> <span id="s177">Not at all.</span> <span id="s178">We could not get her out of the transport and she was sent in the …it was about December…on one of the first transports to what was called the East.</span> <span id="s179">And of course those people, almost all of them from that transport were shot in the forest near Riga, the ghetto there.</span> <span id="s180">And most of the people from my school also were in that transport.</span> <span id="s181">As far as I know, I am the only child who survived from the State of Wuerttemberg in Southern Germany.</span> <span id="s182">Now we had to leave…</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Can I ask just one question?</span> <span id="s184">Your father was able to write this letter; he had a picture of his wounds…</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: We still have this letter by the way.</span> <span id="s186">We have the letter of request to be out of this transport and somehow they let us go because of my father’s disability.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: But not your grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Not my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: You then made the trip to try to convince them to…</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s191">We went to the Gestapo headquarters in Stuttgart, but we were not even allowed to see anybody at all.</span> <span id="s192">We were forced out of my grandmother’s house.</span> <span id="s193">The house was confiscated, and we were told that you had to move into Jewish houses into Jewish houses in the neighborhood town of Girpingen, which was a bigger town and there we were in a Jewish house, owned by Jewish people, and had a small apartment there.</span> <span id="s194">And we stayed there until the August of 1942, when again we received the orders for transport and then we were sent to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s195">Now my whole school career was about six months.</span> <span id="s196">I never finished my first grade because the school was closed in Stuttgart when all the children were taken away anyway and the teachers were taken away, it was closed.</span> <span id="s197">And then we were sent to Theresienstadt (Terezin) in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s198">I remember how such a transport went.</span> <span id="s199">The police came to our…actually the transport papers had an order of maybe six pages with all the things we could and should not take.</span> <span id="s200">And the statement said we should not take any sharp utensils.</span> <span id="s201">They did not want us probably to kill ourselves, I mean they were going to do the job themselves.</span> <span id="s202">Good shoes, some provisions for a journey of two or three days and even we took along I think a sewing machine and all different kinds of things and I made sure that I took along my doll’s clothing.</span> <span id="s203">That was packed away.</span> <span id="s204">My doll was the most important thing to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: What was the name of your doll?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: My doll’s name is Marlene .</span> <span id="s207">She was named after Marlene Dietrich, whom I idolized.</span> <span id="s208">I loved movie stars and so did my mother and she showed me once an album with a picture of her in it and that…I said that’s going to be my doll’s name.</span> <span id="s209">She was given to me on my second birthday from my grandmother and I still have her today and I donated this doll to the Holocaust museum in Washington recently, with great trepidation, because I really dragged her through everything.</span> <span id="s210">Now the transport notice said all of these things we could take along.</span> <span id="s211">We had to assemble in a school gymnasium in Girpingen, the people who were in the transport, and mainly the people who were in my transport were disabled war veterans and old people.</span> <span id="s212">And we were searched in the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s213">And I remember I had my doll in my arm.</span> <span id="s214">I would not relinquish her at all.</span> <span id="s215">And I remember one of the people, the SS people who searched us, took a look at my doll and lifted her head.</span> <span id="s216">She was like…her head had been once broken and they put a new head on and therefore she was put together with rubber bands and you could lift the head up.</span> <span id="s217">So he looked inside her hollow body.</span> <span id="s218">It was a celluloid doll.</span> <span id="s219">That’s the kind of dolls you had at those times and he saw that I didn’t have any…I wasn’t hiding anything inside so I made a really big noise there and I wasn’t going to give my doll up.</span> <span id="s220">And I was the youngest child in this transport and then he let me have my doll.</span> <span id="s221">Then he saw a wooden pin pinned to me.</span> <span id="s222">And he tore that from me and he said in German [“du brochest net fur du ingege”] in real [swabian] dialect.</span> <span id="s223">In other words, you don’t need this where you are going.</span> <span id="s224">So he tore it from me.</span> <span id="s225">That was the last childish thing I had besides my doll.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: What was the pin?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: It was a little Dutch Boy pin.</span> <span id="s228">A wooden pin that my mother had given me.</span> <span id="s229">And I remember my mother said we have to two or three different layers of clothing although it was summer.</span> <span id="s230">Because you never know what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s231">So she put on me a few dresses and forth.</span> <span id="s232">It was really hot.</span> <span id="s233">But you know you have to have some more clothing on you because you never knew what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s234">At least you would have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Did you dress your doll in more than layer?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: That I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s237">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s238">But later on, incidentally, when the transport left, which I will talk about later from Terezin, my doll was sewn a ruksack, a duffel back which she wore and stuffed it with her clothing to prepare her for transport.</span> <span id="s239">Unfortunately that was lost.</span> <span id="s240">And from there we were transported to the gathering place in Stuttgart, to a place called Kiletzburg, where the people from the other towns were assembled.</span> <span id="s241">Everybody from Stuttgart from the Wuertemberg always, the transport left from one area that was called Kiletzburg, it was two large halls which were used at one time for flower shows and here we were about 1,200 people approximately, all assembled.</span> <span id="s242">And we stayed there a few days.</span> <span id="s243">There were not beds; they had some folding chairs and we were just lying on the floor and people were making a lot of noise at night.</span> <span id="s244">In fact, there is a movie out of one of the transports still available today, actual footage out of Kiletzburg.</span> <span id="s245">And I was the youngest of those approximately 1,200 people of the whole transport.</span> <span id="s246">There were mainly old people, as I said some disabled war veterans and veterans who were awarded the Iron Cross that my father had also.</span> <span id="s247">He was awarded the Iron Cross.</span> <span id="s248">And from here we were shipped out by train, it was actually a regular train, it was not a freight train to Terezin.</span> <span id="s249">We were sealed off, I mean there were guards guarding every door and we were very, very crowded.</span> <span id="s250">The trip took about a day and a half; something like that.</span> <span id="s251">And I remember one thing, whenever I got nervous as a child I would get sick to my stomach.</span> <span id="s252">And I remember I was throwing up in the train and there was no water and it was really a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s253">Very crowded.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: You were in a seat or were you standing?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: We were in a seat, but very crowded.</span> <span id="s256">We arrived in a place Boschewitz.</span> <span id="s257">At that time there were no trains; the tracks did not go inside the camp.</span> <span id="s258">And the doors opened and…but one thing I remember coming into this Czech countryside.</span> <span id="s259">I saw all these signs, I mean the windows were opened.</span> <span id="s260">I mean you could see through the window, let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s261">All these strange looking letters, the countryside became so strange and it was a different language and I could barely read German, I had only six months of schooling and it was such a nightmare kind of thing.</span> <span id="s262">I’m going into a fairyland.</span> <span id="s263">I mean all different languages and a different way of writing; it was no longer German.</span> <span id="s264">And the names of the towns that we were approaching.</span> <span id="s265">Anyway we arrived in Bauschewitz and we were told to get out of the car…out of the train…the SS was screaming ‘drop everything”.</span> <span id="s266">So we had to drop everything.</span> <span id="s267">And at that time already, whatever we brought along had been confiscated.</span> <span id="s268">I mean we never…none of these things ever arrived in the camp except my father had invented a little pushcart and one day he saw somebody pushing this little pushcart through the camp and my father said tht’s mine, and somehow he got this little thing back.</span> <span id="s269">It was like four wheels and you could collapse it.</span> <span id="s270">Anyhow my father got it back later.</span> <span id="s271">Many times people would see clothes on some other people wearing it.</span> <span id="s272">We were allowed to wear our own clothes.</span> <span id="s273">Anyway, we arrived in Bauschewitz and we had to march for about maybe two miles or something in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Is this during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: It was during the day.</span> <span id="s276">I remember that my parents put me in the middle; they were on either side of me.</span> <span id="s277">I had my doll in my arms; that’s all that was left and a bedroll something.</span> <span id="s278">They let us keep the blankets or something that we had rolled up.</span> <span id="s279">That, they let us keep.</span> <span id="s280">And our tin cups and some containers that we were told to buy ahead of time.</span> <span id="s281">So like the Army, Army dishes, we had some of that.</span> <span id="s282">And I remember the SS was standing there and screaming at us to march and they had whips in their hands and I remember how people were beaten and they were already…they couldn’t march.</span> <span id="s283">Some of them were very old people.</span> <span id="s284">They fell to the ground and we never saw them again.</span> <span id="s285">I don’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s286">We all marched to an underground area where we were searched again.</span> <span id="s287">And my mother had taken along a thermos bottle and she put it outside one of the doors and said when we come back there I’m going to get it.</span> <span id="s288">Of course we never got back there.</span> <span id="s289">We were sent to some underground cell.</span> <span id="s290">Terezin was an old fortress town surrounded by huge red walls and underground cells and so forth.</span> <span id="s291">Big barracks, brick barracks and houses, actual houses because it became, it was an army garrison and people actually had lived there.</span> <span id="s292">Civilians had lived there too and they were thrown out before we came.</span> <span id="s293">I mean those houses, the old houses were completely empty.</span> <span id="s294">There was room actually for about 6,000 civilians and at any one time 60,000 people would be crammed in there.</span> <span id="s295">And from there we were sent to a huge fortress called Drasnacasenk, to the attic.</span> <span id="s296">It was a huge attic and it was airless, it was hot, it was dark.</span> <span id="s297">In fact, I was there recently and it looked exactly the same way.</span> <span id="s298">Some people started to jump out of those little windows.</span> <span id="s299">My father saw one day a man from my transport hanging out of the window.</span> <span id="s300">He said how can you do that?</span> <span id="s301">And then he promised him he wouldn’t do it again and the next day he was dead in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s302">I remember stumbling over dead bodies.</span> <span id="s303">There were some white sheets covering some things…I mean there were bodies underneath.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: This was in the attic?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: In the attic.</span> <span id="s306">It was really very…I mean we had nothing.</span> <span id="s307">We were sleeping on the stone floor.</span> <span id="s308">I remember one good soul who came to us, a Czech woman, who had never seen us before and she asked some people if there is a child in the transport.</span> <span id="s309">So the fingers pointed towards me.</span> <span id="s310">Look, I know a room in this fortress where they have the children and maybe it would be better for you to be there.</span> <span id="s311">Of course I didn’t want to go because I…there were so many thousands of people walking around in this attic and also in the whole fortress was a huge area and all speaking all different languages, mostly Czech, some German and I was really afraid to be left alone.</span> <span id="s312">I just wanted to be together with my parents.</span> <span id="s313">Everything was so strange.</span> <span id="s314">I mean there was very little area, just a small area where you could wash yourself.</span> <span id="s315">It was like a public room and everybody was rushing around and screaming and nervous and standing waiting for the food and always orders being given and everybody was just hopeless and walking aimlessly around.</span> <span id="s316">I mean you were just in like Dante’s Inferno.</span> <span id="s317">That’s what it looked like.</span> <span id="s318">And I went into that little room and she gave me, this Mrs. Rinder, who incidentally died in Auschwitz with her entire family.</span> <span id="s319">She had a little son by the name of Tommy who was about a year or two younger than I.</span> <span id="s320">She gave me part of her son’s mattress.</span> <span id="s321">There was like different parts of the mattress.</span> <span id="s322">Either she cut it or whatever, she gave me a piece a part of a mattress that I could have something to sleep on in that little children’s, in the children’s room.</span> <span id="s323">In there they had double deck beds.</span> <span id="s324">Many of the children were sick with scarlet fever and of course I caught it too very shortly afterwards.</span> <span id="s325">I remember we used to go in the morning, before I was sick, we used to line up in the courtyard and they marched us around.</span> <span id="s326">I mean they tried a little bit to keep us busy.</span> <span id="s327">I remember how I learned to count in Czech because each of us had to count [1-10 in Czech she is saying] that’s how I learned to count to 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Who is watching over you?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Jewish people were watching over us.</span> <span id="s330">But I got so homesick that I remember when I got sick, I mean actually sick with scarlet fever, there was an epidemic there at that time and I caught it immediately.</span> <span id="s331">And after about 10-12 days, whatever the incubation period was,.</span> <span id="s332">I had it.</span> <span id="s333">And I was, I had a very high fever, it must have been 102-103 fever and I tried to locate my parents and to find them in this maze of people it was incredible.</span> <span id="s334">I just ran away from the room and I went up to the attic and I stumbled over everyone and I did find my parents.</span> <span id="s335">But soon afterwards I was taken to the, what was called the so-called “hospital”.</span> <span id="s336">And it was a building with rooms and they did have some beds there.</span> <span id="s337">But there were so many sick children that it was called the [Hoen ___________ hospital.</span> <span id="s338">Not only for children, but it was also for adults.</span> <span id="s339">They had a separate area for children.</span> <span id="s340">And there were two children in every bed.</span> <span id="s341">Some of them were sleeping in the floor.</span> <span id="s342">The walls were covered with flies.</span> <span id="s343">There was only one small, either one or two small windows that I remember that you had to climb up to see your parents because the parents were not allowed to come inside because it was an isolation area and we had a certain whistle that my father used to have like [and she demonstrated it].</span> <span id="s344">When I heard that I knew it was my father outside and I’d climb up to that window and some people would help me.</span> <span id="s345">They would lift me up that I could see my parents and scream out to them.</span> <span id="s346">And the Czech children also they would scream up to their parents.</span> <span id="s347">They would say maleno kingle, maleno kingle.</span> <span id="s348">Come to the small window.</span> <span id="s349">That was in Czech.</span> <span id="s350">I remember these things that I didn’t know what they were saying, but now I know what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Was your doll with you in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: The doll was not with me in the hospital, no.</span> <span id="s353">I could not take anything.</span> <span id="s354">And I stayed in the hospital from the end of August to December and I had a variety of illnesses, double middle ear infection, I had jaundice and measles, one after the other.</span> <span id="s355">I mean I was supposed to die.</span> <span id="s356">The doctors already told me parents that it was really very hopeless, I had lost my voice already and I was covered with sores all over from the dirt.</span> <span id="s357">Nobody washed me.</span> <span id="s358">I couldn’t take care of myself and whatever little food I had I couldn’t eat because I was so full of fever all the time, I didn’t know what to do with it and I had trouble washing myself and very little water.</span> <span id="s359">There was really very little care.</span> <span id="s360">I mean there were some very good nurses there.</span> <span id="s361">They had some wonderful doctors, but very little medicine.</span> <span id="s362">There were just too many children.</span> <span id="s363">I shared my bed with a younger child who wet the bed all the time so the bed was constantly soiled, and I was in this wet bed constantly.</span> <span id="s364">So finally I got out.</span> <span id="s365">But in the meantime, transports I had heard were leaving for the East.</span> <span id="s366">We were shipped out and we were very afraid that we would be separated from our parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: You were still seeing your parents during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Only through the window.</span> <span id="s369">They were not allowed in.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Every day you would see them or…</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yes, I think most every day they would come.</span> <span id="s372">But in the meantime my mother had to start working.</span> <span id="s373">She worked at first to work in washing typhus laundry.</span> <span id="s374">In the meantime also they were shipped to another area of the camp for disabled war veterans.</span> <span id="s375">They were in the room with maybe 30 people, double deck bunk beds of course.</span> <span id="s376">No furniture.</span> <span id="s377">Nothing.</span> <span id="s378">There was one small oven for the winter.</span> <span id="s379">I remember when I was released from the hospital, my hair had been cut before because I was covered by lice and almost completely cut off and they dunked me in some kind of infecting solution in a pail like, a little pail whatever it was to clean me up a little bit.</span> <span id="s380">And they it was cold.</span> <span id="s381">I remember when I was released it was just before my, it was my eighth birthday and that was December 31, 1942 because in August of 1942 were sent out.</span> <span id="s382">I was eight by then.</span> <span id="s383">And then came a call to this room of disabled war veterans where men and women slept together and the three of us slept on the top bunk bed and we stayed there also some time; a few months more and then we were shipped out again.</span> <span id="s384">Moved to another room on the same block.</span> <span id="s385">Also where the disabled war veterans lived to a little room with another family from Berlin.</span> <span id="s386">They had also a daughter exactly my age who was two months older.</span> <span id="s387">Her birthday was on October 21.</span> <span id="s388">I remember it very well.</span> <span id="s389">Their name was Abraham.</span> <span id="s390">And the father was also a disabled war veteran.</span> <span id="s391">He walked with a limp.</span> <span id="s392">And the father was half Jewish.</span> <span id="s393">The mother, the father’s mother was non-Jewish and the father was.</span> <span id="s394">That’s why the name Abraham.</span> <span id="s395">And the mother, Ruth’s mother was completely Jewish.</span> <span id="s396">But Ruth was brought up as a devout Christian.</span> <span id="s397">She was never brought up as a Jew.</span> <span id="s398">And I remember how she prayed.</span> <span id="s399">She would always fold her hands and she was not…and that was very strange to me because Jewish people do not do that.</span> <span id="s400">They had some services, some Christian services there too.</span> <span id="s401">We had some people in Terezin of mixed marriages (Misch…) [mischlinge] and she attended some of those services with her father and her father made sure that she was not brought up as a Jew.</span> <span id="s402">And he was very proud of that.</span> <span id="s403">Although she was basically Jewish, because the mother was completely Jewish.</span> <span id="s404">Her name was Ruth Abraham from Berlin.</span> <span id="s405">Now we lived with them for more than a year in the small, tiny, tiny little room where six people lived.</span> <span id="s406">I mean three of us and three of them until ’44.</span> <span id="s407">When, I mean there were transports to Auschwitz many, many times during that time and the transports were selected according to the whims of the SS.</span> <span id="s408">Always around 1,000 people.</span> <span id="s409">And whenever Eichmann came to the camp, you knew very well that another transport would go.</span> <span id="s410">Many more transports would go.</span> <span id="s411">Ruth and I attended the underground classes.</span> <span id="s412">The so-called beshefticum classes which were held in different areas, sometimes in the children’s home, sometimes in a barracks.</span> <span id="s413">We both attended those and we didn’t have official school books and really not official teachers.</span> <span id="s414">We were taught by people who remembered anything.</span> <span id="s415">I had for instance some English lessons.</span> <span id="s416">Some people who remembered English, or Hebrew or whatever they could teach us.</span> <span id="s417">Our parents also they drilled us to do the times table, for instance.</span> <span id="s418">It was very important to keep our minds a little bit busy and to learn poems.</span> <span id="s419">For instance, Ruth’s father was a very good poet and he made her recite poems.</span> <span id="s420">I mean to memorize these poems.</span> <span id="s421">The same with my mother.</span> <span id="s422">She was a good poet too and you always for birthdays, that was our birthday gift to our parents to recite a poem.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Do you remember a poem you recited?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: I don’t remember, not really.</span> <span id="s425">I don’t remember at this point.</span> <span id="s426">My birthdays were celebrated in a fashion, for instance, I got a new outfit for my doll sewn from rags or I got a small potato cake the size of a child’s palm with a tiny hint of sugar on it, just made from a mashed potato.</span> <span id="s427">Potatoes were like diamonds.</span> <span id="s428">In fact, I wrote in my book, I am star about diamonds on the snow, how my father had gotten some potatoes.</span> <span id="s429">He would go around, my father didn’t have an official job.</span> <span id="s430">Sometimes he would get some coal dust and he would bring it to the old people.</span> <span id="s431">I mean they couldn’t get it for themselves for the, you know for the heating of the small ovens and they would give him a piece of bread for it or some potatoes.</span> <span id="s432">[End of side 1.</span> <span id="s433">Set counter to zero for side 2].</span> <span id="s434">It was really forbidden.</span> <span id="s435">You could be sent out either to a small fortress which was a prison for the prison about a mile away or be sent to Auschwitz immediately if you were caught.</span> <span id="s436">Because in the camp we had the ghetto police, mainly, actually made up of Jewish people who were policing the area.</span> <span id="s437">Also you had surrounding the camp you had the Germans or Czech gendarmes guarding the camp, armed with guns.</span> <span id="s438">Then I remember she had gotten some of these potatoes and we had a few pounds of these and they were really like diamonds because we did not get enough food.</span> <span id="s439">I mean the rations were very small.</span> <span id="s440">I don’t have to, I believe, go into it.</span> <span id="s441">I mean we know what concentration camp food was like and so a potato became the mainstay or an extra portion of soup, watery soup that we got.</span> <span id="s442">Of course in the morning it was just a murky liquid called coffee.</span> <span id="s443">We had to stand three times a day in line in the big fortress courtyards to get our food</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: You would stand in line?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: I would stand in line, too.</span> <span id="s446">Yes.</span> <span id="s447">In fact, the children’s kitchen was somewhere else from the adults and the food was very much the same.</span> <span id="s448">I mean children did not get very much more.</span> <span id="s449">I mean there was hardly ever any milk, and if there was, it was for, it was so watered down or children with TB and things like that who got sometimes a little bit more.</span> <span id="s450">Almost everybody had it anyway.</span> <span id="s451">And there was a rumor going around that we were going to have an inspection in our block and the inspection was by women, ausewiber they called them.</span> <span id="s452">An especially very mean SS women who would search the area.</span> <span id="s453">We would have to leave the buildings and if even one cigarette or one potato would be found, that would be the end.</span> <span id="s454">So we were sleeping on the potatoes and we didn’t know what to do with these potatoes.</span> <span id="s455">So my father found a plan and he found an old suitcase and put some of these potatoes in and was the death of night and you actually a curfew.</span> <span id="s456">You weren’t supposed to be out of the houses and the lights were supposed to be out.</span> <span id="s457">There was a full moon.</span> <span id="s458">So he had a plan to put these potatoes under a pile of rags, that they should not freeze.</span> <span id="s459">In the, what was called die soigelings heim where some of the babies were kept in this building and in the courtyard there was this big heap of rags.</span> <span id="s460">And he took…in the middle of the night he ran out and he fell and all of the potatoes were on the snow.</span> <span id="s461">So he picked them up and he hid them under this pile of rags.</span> <span id="s462">Now in the meantime, these women came and we were told to get out of the houses and assemble.</span> <span id="s463">And I remember I was so afraid with my doll that one of them would break him, I don’t remember if I left the doll there or if I took the doll with me.</span> <span id="s464">But it was dangerous take anything with you because they thought you were hiding something and that’s how we saved, and then a day later when the coast was clear; they didn’t find anything, then they…we got the potatoes back.</span> <span id="s465">I remember the worst day for me was a day in 1943.</span> <span id="s466">It was November 11.</span> <span id="s467">The rumor went around that people were missing; that people had escaped.</span> <span id="s468">And perhaps some people did escape.</span> <span id="s469">But of course it was very hard to get out because you had to jump from the high walls.</span> <span id="s470">And if you did, you broke most of your bones and who would help you then.</span> <span id="s471">And even if you did get out in one piece, who would help you when you got out?</span> <span id="s472">People didn’t know anybody on the outside to give you some food or where to go, etc. and I mean you had the SS guarding the place, so it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s473">And we were herded out one cold November morning.</span> <span id="s474">Always something happened between 9th, 10, or 11th of November, starting from Kristallnacht on.</span> <span id="s475">Every November 9th, 10th, 11th, we were always afraid something terrible would happen to us.</span> <span id="s476">We were herded outside of the camp to a place called Bauschewitz Kastle, the Bauschewitz Revine.</span> <span id="s477">And everybody in the camp had to go.</span> <span id="s478">Sick or half-dead, everybody was marched out.</span> <span id="s479">And we were standing in little groups and I remember Heindel, one of the worst and meanest SS men kept on walking around and counting and beating people when they lost their way and we didn’t get food all day.</span> <span id="s480">There were no bathrooms there.</span> <span id="s481">It was just a horrible, horrible day.</span> <span id="s482">It was now I know what was supposed to happen on that day.</span> <span id="s483">I think that they really did not only want to count us.</span> <span id="s484">Probably what they wanted to do is either shoot down, Babi Yar style or send the whole transport to Auschwitz on that day.</span> <span id="s485">Because news had leaked out to the British radio.</span> <span id="s486">And that we were all standing there, about 50,000-60,000 people.</span> <span id="s487">It was raining.</span> <span id="s488">I remember our feet sank into the mud.</span> <span id="s489">It was just an awful day.</span> <span id="s490">Mice were running around in that field and that news had leaked out and consequently orders came from Berlin to let us go back to the camp.</span> <span id="s491">And we went back in the death of night, maybe 11:00-12:00 And they were beating us.</span> <span id="s492">We were holding on to each other.</span> <span id="s493">They said no.</span> <span id="s494">Men and women should be separate.</span> <span id="s495">We wouldn’t let go of each other.</span> <span id="s496">My mother was beaten up very badly that day.</span> <span id="s497">One of the butts of a rifle went right into my mother’s back because we would not separate.</span> <span id="s498">We were holding on to each other and we went back to the camp.</span> <span id="s499">And soon afterwards you had this commission from the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s500">And I remember it very well.</span> <span id="s501">The whole place had to be cleaned up.</span> <span id="s502">Certain streets had signs on them…To School…To Playground.</span> <span id="s503">A band shell was erected in the park, a park that we were never even allowed to go to and children were given some better food just as the commission went by.</span> <span id="s504">I think I saw the commission but we were not allowed to go out of our houses.</span> <span id="s505">I just saw them from far away.</span> <span id="s506">A film was made at that time to show supposedly the good conditions of the place.</span> <span id="s507">Soon afterwards when the commission had left, everything went back to where it was before.</span> <span id="s508">And the transports began again.</span> <span id="s509">In fact, the worst transports were in 1944, in the fall.</span> <span id="s510">It was during the High Holidays in September and October.</span> <span id="s511">And I remember how the people even fasted on Yom Kippur and afterwards went on the transport.</span> <span id="s512">I remember how they put on their boots, etc. and prayed with their last breathes, so to speak, God Help Us.</span> <span id="s513">I remember one of the prayers Alvenu Malkenu, God Help Us.</span> <span id="s514">I mean they did not know where they were really going that this was a worse place even than where we were.</span> <span id="s515">That this was going to be their death.</span> <span id="s516">They did not know it, but you always feared things would be worse somewhere else.</span> <span id="s517">We were not told about Auschwitz, although the camp elders did know about it.</span> <span id="s518">[Leobeken] the people knew about this place…knew about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s519">And it was that time when Mrs. Rinder and her whole family was shipped out.</span> <span id="s520">I mean the camp was almost completely empty.</span> <span id="s521">Ruth and her parents were shipped out.</span> <span id="s522">Just before they were shipped out, all of the disabled war veterans had to go the SS headquarters and the selection took place.</span> <span id="s523">And my father when he came home he said “Well I was told to go the girl with the typewriter, and I saw her…them put a red circle around our name, and I think we don’t have to go”.</span> <span id="s524">And surely enough, that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s525">And the Abrahams, who had…I mean they were really not even...I mean he was half Jewish, they should have helped him.</span> <span id="s526">And my father said “Why didn’t you tell him, why didn’t you do something?”</span> <span id="s527">He said “Well, you are all going to come sooner or later, wherever we’re going”.</span> <span id="s528">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s529">So the whole family was sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s530">I remember, for instance, disabled war veterans who had very important parts, I don’t need to go into certain things, genitals shot off.</span> <span id="s531">I remember one who even took his, my father told me, he dropped his pants to show them that he was wounded so badly and he had all these catheters in and out and even he was shipped off to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s532">I mean the selection was very brutal and you really were not safe just because you were a disabled war veteran or even if you were a highly decorated war veteran.</span> <span id="s533">I mean there were transports with EK-1 Iron Cross, one transports who were shipped out in mass or sometimes only doctors, sometimes.</span> <span id="s534">It depended exactly what they wanted.</span> <span id="s535">Old people, young people, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s536">And I remember also during the…to transgress a little bit.</span> <span id="s537">Some things that come back to me.</span> <span id="s538">I mean that was really the saddest time for me because I had really loved my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s539">We were like two sisters and before she went, we had identical dolls and she gave me…</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: She had a Marlene doll?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: She had the same doll I had.</span> <span id="s542">Exactly the same kind and before she left, she gave me her doll’s clothing that her mother had sewn for her.</span> <span id="s543">And I think I still have a few things left from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: What was her doll’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: That I don’t remember, but she gave me her doll’s clothing.</span> <span id="s546">She said, you take care of it for me.</span> <span id="s547">And one of the things that I remember was seeing this meanest SS man Heindel.</span> <span id="s548">I remember going with my father in the courtyard and there was a tree with some kind of berries on it.</span> <span id="s549">But I mean we never had any food.</span> <span id="s550">My father said come on, pick something.</span> <span id="s551">And as soon as I started to pick something Heindel came into this courtyard and we thought, that’s it.</span> <span id="s552">We would be shot.</span> <span id="s553">I saw Eichmann.</span> <span id="s554">He walked into the children’s quarters where I had my underground classes and I remember hiding the little notebook that I had.</span> <span id="s555">I hid it under a table.</span> <span id="s556">And I remember when he walked in, there were about three of them…three or four of them, we were really not supposed to look at their faces.</span> <span id="s557">It was forbidden to look into an SS man’s face.</span> <span id="s558">You had to have your head bowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Who told you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: We were told by a teacher.</span> <span id="s561">And it was a law.</span> <span id="s562">I mean whenever you walked o the street, you were never supposed to look at an SS man.</span> <span id="s563">Your head had to be bowed.</span> <span id="s564">You would…they should not make any eye contact.</span> <span id="s565">But knew it was Eichmann.</span> <span id="s566">I mean I looked up a little bit and, you know, I was told later that one of them was.</span> <span id="s567">We were told to be completely quiet.</span> <span id="s568">But one of the saddest things that I remember was when my grandmother was shipped out on the transport.</span> <span id="s569">That is something and today that we’re making this tape, is her birthday, and that is a day that we keep as a memorial because we do not know when she was shot.</span> <span id="s570">This is April 11.</span> <span id="s571">And we light a candle for her every April 11.</span> <span id="s572">That is her memorial.</span> <span id="s573">I remember when she was in the transport and how we went to Stuttgart before she was transported in the railway station.</span> <span id="s574">As I said I had the travel papers that I could be there with my father.</span> <span id="s575">And she slowly, slowly went down the train station.</span> <span id="s576">Of course, the night before my mother and her said goodbye and it was just the most tearful thing.</span> <span id="s577">Somehow she knew that this was going to be a finality.</span> <span id="s578">And how she slowly went down the steps and I would never see her again.</span> <span id="s579">She sent a few cards from the trip to Riga and we still have them today and she writes on them “with God’s help we’ll see each other again.</span> <span id="s580">I love you,” you know, your Mother and so forth.</span> <span id="s581">She probably had to dig her own grave so we heard and she was shot by Einsatzgruppen, these massive killing forces in probably what was called the Rhumbellee Forest near Riga a few weeks after she had arrived in Riga in Latvia.</span> <span id="s582">And that was it.</span> <span id="s583">My aunt and uncle had lived in Frankfurt and they were shipped out also during that time, around 1941.</span> <span id="s584">First to a camp called Gurst cau de Gurst in France.</span> <span id="s585">We were…all my whole village where I was born were shipped…I mean the ones who did not make it to America, or somewhere else, went to Cau de Gurst in France.</span> <span id="s586">And from there they were shipped out to different places; to Auschwitz and so forth.</span> <span id="s587">And my aunt and uncle were shipped to Lodz to the Lodz Ghetto, Litzmanstadt.</span> <span id="s588">We still have also a little note that they wrote in script.</span> <span id="s589">They said ungroff, meaning in Hebrew gruff means hunger.</span> <span id="s590">Uncle hunger has come.</span> <span id="s591">You know, to tell us we should send packages and at that time, we could still in 1941 we could send packages to the ghetto in Lodz in Poland.</span> <span id="s592">And we even have a little note that they did receive something.</span> <span id="s593">And one my aunt scribbled that she became a widow [and in german] in small letters that widow on it in script-like and from there my cousin and her mother…my uncle died in the Lodz Ghetto and they were shipped out…I really don’t know where.</span> <span id="s594">It could be Chelmno, I believe they were gassed in Chelmno.</span> <span id="s595">And of course we lost many more people in the war but those were the closest.</span> <span id="s596">Many more.</span> <span id="s597">Many, many more.</span> <span id="s598">More than 13 people at least.</span> <span id="s599">When we came back from the camp, when we finally liberated, May 8, 1945, I remember the transports had just before had come from other camps because Eichmann wanted to exterminate the last Jew living and gas chambers had been built already in Terezin.</span> <span id="s600">Only the doors had been missing.</span> <span id="s601">It was in the last days of the war and people were shipped in from Auschwitz, from Riga, from all over the place on death marches.</span> <span id="s602">And I remember how these poor people came.</span> <span id="s603">They were barefoot, they were in rags, they looked like skeletons and then finally it dawned on us what had been going on the other camps.</span> <span id="s604">It had been a secret to us that gas chambers and places like that existed.</span> <span id="s605">I mean we were starving in the camp, but we were not killed in Terezin.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Did you get any letters from Auschwitz from anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Nobody.</span> <span id="s608">Nobody.</span> <span id="s609">Nobody.</span> <span id="s610">Then the last day of the war I remember it was evening and I was kind of a precocious child and I climbed the barricade.</span> <span id="s611">And all of a sudden to see what was going on because I saw a lot of movement…I heard a lot of movement…trucks moving outside of the camp.</span> <span id="s612">And bits of burnt paper flying through the air.</span> <span id="s613">And they were burning the documents because the Nazis were living right outside of the camp; the personnel.</span> <span id="s614">And all of a sudden I heard a tremendous noise and I touched my head to see if my head had blown off.</span> <span id="s615">And a hand grenade had been thrown into the camp just a few houses away and I mean it nearly killed me.</span> <span id="s616">They were throwing hand grenades a few…as they were leaving the camp.</span> <span id="s617">And then my father said we must find a hiding place.</span> <span id="s618">I was a soldier in World War 1, and I know how these things are.</span> <span id="s619">We must go underground.</span> <span id="s620">So we found a cellar, a dark cellar and somebody had a tiny little candle and we were all huddling there and waiting and waiting.</span> <span id="s621">And about ten minutes to nine somebody went upstairs to see what was going on.</span> <span id="s622">And he said the Russians are here, we are liberated.</span> <span id="s623">And that was a tremendous relief, but we could not leave the camp because we had a tremendous typhoid epidemic.</span> <span id="s624">Then we waited for a bus to come to pick up from Stuttgart…they picked up out of a transport of about 1,200 people, 13 people had survived.</span> <span id="s625">And of course I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s626">My parents and myself we had survived out of those 13.</span> <span id="s627">We went back to…we were first in a DP camp in Stuttgart and then we went back to my grandmother’s house.</span> <span id="s628">People of course had lived in it and they prepared a room for us.</span> <span id="s629">Then we went to the Mayor and lo and behold my mother looked on the floor and our oriental carpet was in the Mayor’s office.</span> <span id="s630">She heard a familiar chime and it was our clock that had found its way there.</span> <span id="s631">The bedroom set had found its way to an SS man’s place.</span> <span id="s632">And then in…we lived there about nine months and we came to America in May of 1946 on the Marie Perch the second Displaced Person’s boat that came to the United States after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: When you weren’t in the underground school studying, what else would you be doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Well, I would find the other children.</span> <span id="s635">We had a whole band of kids from the block that I lived on.</span> <span id="s636">We would go the garbage dump to find anything that was still edible.</span> <span id="s637">We would take potato peelings…rotten potatoes, bring them home, we would pick dandelion leaves to make a salad.</span> <span id="s638">I mean we had no vinegar or anything like that.</span> <span id="s639">We never saw an egg in three years.</span> <span id="s640">I never saw real milk.</span> <span id="s641">I never saw a piece of meat in three years.</span> <span id="s642">The bread was very poor bread, made, I believe out of chestnuts, part of it.</span> <span id="s643">It spoiled very quickly and we ate it actually quite fast.</span> <span id="s644">In fact, when we got the bread rations, my mother would make a mark on the bread that we should not go further than that on that day, otherwise we would cut into the next day’s bread.</span> <span id="s645">We would have nothing left.</span> <span id="s646">When a transport would come in…an incoming transport, sometimes these people brought some onions and some garlic with them and was absolutely like diamonds, like potatoes were diamonds.</span> <span id="s647">And sometimes we would find these people and they would give us a tiny little onion or a clove of garlic and we would put that on the bread.</span> <span id="s648">And believe me, I didn’t brush my teeth for a few days just to keep that taste in my mouth.</span> <span id="s649">I mean there was no toothpaste anyway, but just to keep clean somehow.</span> <span id="s650">I mean we had…we could not really take showers.</span> <span id="s651">Maybe once every eight, nine months or something, some community showers.</span> <span id="s652">Otherwise you got water from polluted wells and you drank the same water that you washed with, you drank too.</span> <span id="s653">That’s why so many people got sick.</span> <span id="s654">And my father was also in the garbage dump and he would find sometimes some boiled bones…some horse bones.</span> <span id="s655">We never had any real meat.</span> <span id="s656">And he would cut the gristle off.</span> <span id="s657">We would cook that again.</span> <span id="s658">We would take any fat that came out of that and take the gristle and eat it.</span> <span id="s659">I remember my best friend…I mean how we had a little bit of gristle and my girlfriend was brought up in a very, very proper good home, how she was so hungry that she stole some of my…some of our gristle.</span> <span id="s660">I saw it happening and…I mean she was not the type of person to steal from anybody.</span> <span id="s661">But when people are hungry, they will steal to stay alive.</span> <span id="s662">Some books had gotten into the camp, but they were not read.</span> <span id="s663">They were used as toilet paper.</span> <span id="s664">That I remember.</span> <span id="s665">As toilet paper…books!</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Did you as children like to dream and kind of fantasize.</span> <span id="s667">Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Always.</span> <span id="s669">Always.</span> <span id="s670">We dreamt to make up always about food.</span> <span id="s671">we dreamt about food from day to night.</span> <span id="s672">I mean who would think of the most lavish meal.</span> <span id="s673">I mean there were cakes that were miles high with chocolate and whipped cream and in fact, when we got out of the camp, one of the first things somebody brought was a big bowl of whipped cream and we didn’t know that our stomachs could not digest such a heavy meal.</span> <span id="s674">But my mother and I, we just dug unto that.</span> <span id="s675">We ate the whole thing up.</span> <span id="s676">It was a big dish of whipped cream.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: And then you were sick</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: And then we were sick.</span> <span id="s679">Yes.</span> <span id="s680">You could not digest such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Was there a time when you were prepared for a transport to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: I think we had some numbers at times…there were a few times that we were and somehow it was called off or something.</span> <span id="s683">I mean there was nothing that you could do to get out of it, to stay out of a transport.</span> <span id="s684">It was strictly on the whims of the SS who told the Jewish Elders like Epstein or we had different Elders, Adelstein, Epstein and the last one was Murmelstein.</span> <span id="s685">This was the only one who survived.</span> <span id="s686">The others were killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s687">And they were told ro prepare lists of people.</span> <span id="s688">And whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s689">And mainly the children.</span> <span id="s690">I mean the children were not supposed to live.</span> <span id="s691">My life is a miracle.</span> <span id="s692">I don’t know why I’m here today.</span> <span id="s693">It was…people are always asking me, what did you do to survive?</span> <span id="s694">I didn’t do anything!</span> <span id="s695">It was pure luck!</span> <span id="s696">Absolutely pure luck.</span> <span id="s697">Not because I was more beautiful or more intelligent.</span> <span id="s698">I believe my girlfriend was a wonderful artist and was much more gift than I, and she did not make it.</span> <span id="s699">And so many of us didn’t either.</span> <span id="s700">There were very few children at the end of the war in Terezin.</span> <span id="s701">They said that there were about a hundred, perhaps there were more.</span> <span id="s702">Now they say perhaps a thousand.</span> <span id="s703">I did not see a thousand children after the war at liberation time that were under the age of, let’s say, 15 or 14, young children I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s704">Not teenagers.</span> <span id="s705">But young children, let’s say between…up to about 13 or so, very, very few were there at that time.</span> <span id="s706">Very few.</span> <span id="s707">And most of us were sick at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s708">When I came here I was also very sick and I…from malnutrition.</span> <span id="s709">I was in the hospital many years and it took me 10 years of my life to get myself together again physically, not mentally.</span> <span id="s710">Mentally, I was, thank God, always very strong, but physically it took many, many years and again…</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: All of those months with infectious diseases.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Yes, again loss of schooling.</span> <span id="s713">I lost about eight years of schooling in my life.</span> <span id="s714">The first time I ever really went to school, was high school, which I finished in three years, and then college.</span> <span id="s715">I had to stop college also because I became sick again.</span> <span id="s716">That’s another story.</span> <span id="s717">But I finished college and I am a chemist today.</span> <span id="s718">I’ve done research with many prominent doctors.</span> <span id="s719">I worked with Meyer Friedman who was the father of cholesterol work; the father of the Type A personality, he coined that word.</span> <span id="s720">I worked on that book when he wrote it.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Did he name it after you?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: No, not quite, but I am a type A, I suppose.</span> <span id="s723">I am very active in Holocaust lecturing and against prejudice; it has become really my life’s work besides my work at…my real work, I mean where I make my living.</span> <span id="s724">I spend many free…I mean whatever free time I have I spend teaching the Holocaust and my voice against bigotry.</span> <span id="s725">It is very important for me to speak out.</span> <span id="s726">And I do practice what I preach.</span> <span id="s727">I live in a very integrated neighborhood.</span> <span id="s728">I live next door to an Indian family from Guyana, who are Hindu, and my next door neighbor on side is this Hindu family and the other a Black family from Haiti.</span> <span id="s729">And we live very happily together.</span> <span id="s730">We learn from each other and that is exactly perhaps why these things happened in Germany because people don’t…they really didn’t want to know about other cultures and were persuaded by one ridiculous man, I mean completely insane man, to follow his footsteps.</span> <span id="s731">And I think if we learn more about other people, and I did travel a lot in my life already and learned about different cultures.</span> <span id="s732">Moslem; I’ve been into so many Mosques and Hindu temples and that we really are all one.</span> <span id="s733">I work in a hospital and I know that all blood…we…blood has one color, and the color is red.</span> <span id="s734">Never ask did the blood come from a black person, an oriental person or whatever.</span> <span id="s735">It only depends on the blood type.</span> <span id="s736">But all blood is red and it has the same components for every people.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: One other question.</span> <span id="s738">Did you have any impression of the Soviet soldiers when you saw them?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Well I remember they were quite rowdy.</span> <span id="s740">I remember one of them, he saw me, and handed over the barricade a huge (to me it seemed like huge) it probably was a regular piece of bread, with a mountain of butter.</span> <span id="s741">And I’ll never forget the taste of that first real piece of black bread, sinking my teeth into this delicious butter.</span> <span id="s742">That was a Russian soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Did you contract typhoid?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: No.</span> <span id="s745">I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: But you still had to stay</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yes, we had to stay.</span> <span id="s748">Because there was a quarantine for the whole camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: You said a bus came from Stuttgart?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: They sent a bus to pick up the survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Stuttgart sent it?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Stuttgart did, yes.</span> <span id="s753">Yes.</span> <span id="s754">Sent the bus.</span> <span id="s755">Some months later in the summer.</span> <span id="s756">July or something like that it was.</span> <span id="s757">In ’45, after our liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s759">PAGE 1</span></p></body></html>
