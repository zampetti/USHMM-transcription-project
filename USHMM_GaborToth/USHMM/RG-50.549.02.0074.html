will be the good s -- good language.</span> <span id="s36">It was the to -- different schools it we -- I attend to the fi -- first -- first of all he ask me which language I prefer, Russian or German, because it was [indecipherable] I preferred German.</span> <span id="s37">Th-The reason I attend to the private s -- g-gymnasium Mikoyrai, what was practically run by the evangeli -- og -- evangi -- no -- the li -- evangelism ch-church, you know?</span> <span id="s38">And most these people, the student would attend was from the German family, they speak home German.</span> <span id="s39">That what there is, on that I was a very poor student with the German.</span> <span id="s40">Every year I have a student, you know, which teach me during the vacation.</span> <span id="s41">Usually my parents with another parents, you know, hired the student from the Germany, and to -- during the two months we sent for vacation, two or three guys, and tal -- two or three months we talk German only.</span> <span id="s42">If we say between us one word Polish, the guy beat us because he thought [indecipherable] that we’re st -- talking something against him.</span> <span id="s43">Th-The reason when I come home I start talk to my mother, you know, the German.</span> <span id="s44">And -- and this was -- was very good because this -- th-thanks to this I survive.</span> <span id="s45">It was many times this, during the German occupation that I survived.</span> <span id="s46">The first -- first day when the German arrived, you know, on the [indecipherable] place, you know, they stop me, the French gendarmerie did, was the French gendarmerie and I was so upset, you know, because W-Warsaw survived -- surrendered, it was the first or second day, and the ger -- the -- they [indecipherable] the people you know, to cover the holes, which was where -- was for the [indecipherable] the bombs.</span> <span id="s47">And he ca -- ask me.</span> <span id="s48">You have to work in [indecipherable] what for?</span> <span id="s49">And I -- very friendly German, I talk with him, what for?</span> <span id="s50">[indecipherable] and he told -- he told me [indecipherable] me this, I’m sorry for you.</span> <span id="s51">I was so surprised that this way.</span> <span id="s52">He think probably that I am German.</span> <span id="s53">It was the de -- the reason that many time during the action -- I remembered another time, during the German occupation, I have lot of friends, you know, what speaking for German [indecipherable] you know, and once during there was the people g -- wa -- catch the people to -- to German.</span> <span id="s54">We have -- we carry in the pocket, you know, the big sign, and [indecipherable] this was a sign [indecipherable] German member for the na-national [indecipherable] the national socialist [indecipherable], but I will put in the pocket and this way we -- we so like drunk, and to -- oh, you go away.</span> <span id="s55">It was the second time I survive, you know, like young people drink?</span> <span id="s56">Risk, make a lot of risk.</span> <span id="s57">How many times they dri -- they going with the, you know, with the guns during -- because we make a lot of sabotage, lot of working against th-the Nazis.</span> <span id="s58">We make many, many different action.</span> <span id="s59">The action -- the first my -- action was like in 19 -- 1940 or ’41, we put the ha -- to -- German got out, the Polish got out, you put the -- no, it wasn’t a bomb burst, it was like a material would make a fire, what would burn the German tr-tr-trucks and the Polish trucks.</span> <span id="s60">You -- it was my first action.</span> <span id="s61">And then later we blow that -- I was trained, and we bl-blow that train.</span> <span id="s62">The same time I attend to the Polytech Institute because in the m -- in the beginning the German close the old school, and later they opened the school only for the technician school, you know, they need -- they don’t -- they need only the people to work, the working people that there is on that -- they opened the school for the technician and this -- this way we working with -- and I attend to this -- this Polytechnic Institute, I study mechanic engineering.</span> <span id="s63">It wa-was not engineering [indecipherable] engineering, they call it technical, the engineering was too high educated for the Polish people, the Polish like -- supposed to be slaves.</span> <span id="s64">But the same time wa -- working -- was al-always belong to the underground army, until I was trained like a miner, and my specialist was the blowing the train.</span> <span id="s65">I-It was during the action what we did few times, it was action, the -- one day, the same day or the same time was to blow out the train in many places, that’s [indecipherable] it was this organization, and I was trained, you know, the blowing the train.</span> <span id="s66">We trained [indecipherable] the trains would bring supply for that -- wou-would bring supply to the east front, or we blow the train, which was most important, they could [indecipherable] special train would bring the German soldier from the east front to vaca -- for vacation to Germany.</span> <span id="s67">There was th -- it was most difficult because this train has a very strong -- very strong, you know, safety purpose.</span> <span id="s68">On the beginning, on the end of that train, there was a se -- se -- machines gun.</span> <span id="s69">Additional, this train has in the front of the machine gun, the locomotive, two cars who are loading with the -- with the sand, you know, to prevent the -- if they were blowing the -- preferred they would be blowing the empty -- the cars, not the -- not the locomotive.</span> <span id="s70">There was -- we find this, they will make a method that was special delayed, they will blow up not the empty train, but the train with the -- with the soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Me -- Mr. Madejski, one of the things that strikes me, listening to you, and that I noticed watching the video of your previous interview --</span></p>

id="s186">A: Th-This time was very difficult, you know, because we didn’t have -- we didn’t have -- see the people was being wrong, something wrong.</span> <span id="s187">We didn’t pay attention, you know, therefore, these people we didn’t pay attention practically was [indecipherable] everybody -- everybody was in the big trouble, you know, that everybody was very friendly one towards each other.</span> <span id="s188">Only the worst people what was -- this what was a Volksdeutsche which signed the list was German.</span> <span id="s189">But these people we know right away where they are and later the German, they move you different part they make like a -- like it was ghetto for the ger -- for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s190">They start making, we call ghetto this time for the German, because they afraid living between the Polish people.</span> <span id="s191">They make, you know, they -- they take out -- evicted the people, the Polish people from the houses and they take the apartment for the -- for the German people.</span> <span id="s192">And was whole area in Warsaw, you know, when was only for the German.</span> <span id="s193">The same thing for the German was a -- the tram -- train -- you know, the -- not train, the str -- str [indecipherable] the strass -- the street trains, you know, what was the -- was especially for German only and -- and [indecipherable] which was not for the German.</span> <span id="s194">The first two -- the first two parts and the first -- first platform was for German only, nobody can come in there, no Polish people, because they afraid because they -- the people, the Polish people fighting different way.</span> <span id="s195">For instance, you know what the pickpocket, the thiefs, it was a specialist.</span> <span id="s196">They coming and with the -- with the [indecipherable] with the -- something knife, got the guns, you know, and steal the German -- steal the German -- the -- the guns, you know, the -- the reason that nobody can for -- the Polish peoples stay on the fr-front platform, it is only for the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Now you had said earlier that, you know, you’ve become fluent in German, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s200">Because I’ve heard stories, of course, for -- about

time, when it was very difficult to the wa -- Catholic church, come the people from different religion, not only the Catholic, come to different religion because they thought God is one who have to pray to the God this way will -- probably will be -- help us.</span> <span id="s339">And the religion keep the people very close, very close together.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So you didn’t

id="s350">And low educated people, if you take a look, th-the people which -- the Arabs, which you know, fanatic, working, fighting with the -- with Israel.</span> <span id="s351">Take a look these people, the level of these people is very, very low.</span> <span id="s352">I only surprised that how -- big final thing they find this to any people which make a -- a September 11, you know, blow the

problem when he attend to the school, he was a very, very good student and he have some problem but he was throw away once year from the school, you know, when it was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s748">I don’t remember, the third or fourth grade, you know, very young.</span> <span id="s749">This time he was too stupid to lie, you know, and this he discuss with th -- his teacher, and

in the beginning I use the German a lot because I didn’t speak too good English, you know, and all instruction the German -- the -- the books from the Philips when I went for -- for medical Philips [indecipherable] books in three languages.</span> <span id="s758">Was English, Ger-German and -- and -- and Dutch.</span> <span id="s759">The Dutch is difficult, English I didn’t know too perfect, you know, that I use the German.</span> <span id="s760">And I speak -- but later, slowly, slowly, slow, I switch to -- to English, but when -- the first time I was in Poland, what I said, after this 18 years, from the Poland I go what I thought in the beginning to Austria to visit my cousin, my wife cousin, that in the a-airport I starts -- in the -- in the Vienna I start talk to the German.</span> <span id="s761">And after the whiles, it come back.</span> <span id="s762">But I don’t think that would be able to now because I don’t use any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: How do you feel now toward armed conflict in the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: This is very, very difficult situation.</span> <span id="s765">This is very difficult situation, I don’t know how this -- everything will be finish.</span> <span id="s766">Is very difficult situation because is too many terrorists, too many terrorists and this -- this terrorist is not terrorist pri-problem.</span> <span id="s767">The ter -- the problem I think is the fanatics, and the -- the lot of leaders which you know, bring the young people to the -- to the fighting [indecipherable] I -- I feeling now how was the leader, we as young boy during the German -- during the German occupation and this young people was bring to this action b -- at home by the older people.</span> <span id="s768">But we’re fighting, we’re feeling, we -- we -- we’re feeling we’re trusting, we know what we’re fighting for.</span> <span id="s769">In the same way I think lot of young people -- because if you take a look at these terrorists are young people, the same the youth, the brave -- we no [indecipherable] wars, because we was patriot, but these people, I think they -- like you [indecipherable] wars, and this the reason that the -- this the -- the reason that they fighting, they are fanatics.</span> <span id="s770">They are fighting maybe they did it or something, what about.</span> <span id="s771">I tell you the example, th-the very s -- the very simple example.</span> <span id="s772">In 1936, I think I was student, and this time was fight in the Spain between communist and Franco.</span> <span id="s773">And lot of people from Poland -- not a lot, but some young student, tried to run away from Poland, go to the Spain for fighting.</span> <span id="s774">One, oh, I will be fighting with the -- against the Franco, I go be -- are you going to Franco, fight against the communists, you know the people just would like to do something, you know?</span> <span id="s775">Have so much energy they tried to do something.</span> <span id="s776">And this is the same -- same situation here, and this, I think is similar situation because this terrorists what is coming, they’re coming from different country, even if the Afghanistan, even if the -- in the Iraq, they coming the people, and not only the people which living over there, coming the -- the terrorist from different -- from different country.</span> <span id="s777">You know about this.</span> <span id="s778">And this is -- this is the problem.</span> <span id="s779">This is a very difficult situation, I don’t know how [indecipherable] survive this is very, very difficult situation.</span> <span id="s780">Bush, my opinion going right way, but he is -- has very, very, very difficult job, because with the partisan, what is partisan is very difficult to win.</span> <span id="s781">I know how during the German occupation, the German and th -- cannot win the partisan, and the -- the Russian, which is a much stronger, much [indecipherable] would try -- try fighting with the Afghanistan and they go away from the Washingt -- Afghanistan they cannot win this, and th-the problem is he -- not simply -- not easy.</span> <span id="s782">United State have a good politic because they tried to involve in that -- to bring a de-democracy by the people which living over there, but still there’s too many fanatics.</span> <span id="s783">This is a problem and the -- th-the problem, education over there, the level of education, the people [indecipherable] not very high.</span> <span id="s784">They know how reading and writing, but this -- this only everything, and this the reason that they still -- th-the reason that they still going to the -- to the order of [indecipherable], or this -- or the -- this own priest, you know, I talking priest, but [indecipherable] this little -- that priest, you know.</span> <span id="s785">And this [indecipherable] his own business, not the business the country, not the business nothing, so it’s -- they know if there will be democracy, they lost the power, they lost everything, because of democracy will not accepted the -- the fanatics.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: So you think war is all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: The -- listen, it’s no -- is not another way, no.</span> <span id="s788">What -- what you can do another way with these people?</span> <span id="s789">You -- you not fighting, they would kill you to the end, what you -- will you wait -- you wait [indecipherable] when you waiting for the end?</span> <span id="s790">You can not waiting.</span> <span id="s791">You -- is coming the moment that you have to -- if somebody beat you there, you have to oh, thank you, beat me again, thank you, beat me again?</span> <span id="s792">You cannot stay like this, you have still go against this.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Well, some people who were involved in warfare, people such as yourself, later on became
