in Poland and only Germans, they are build houses and from them we make the living.</span> <span id="s392">So he didn’t steal from them.</span> <span id="s393">If he came with a plan from the engineer, so we gave him a little less than the engineer marked, but we didn’t took the money for it because in the other side a Gentile got the same lumberyard and if we wouldn’t give him cheaper, he wouldn’t come to us.</span> <span id="s394">So then I came to my friends who told me, we need somebody to help us.</span> <span id="s395">So I went for three months to them, because this is another town Woot is another town, and I helped them.</span> <span id="s396">So when the war start we got afraid.</span> <span id="s397">The Germans [indecipherable] a-asked th-th-the materials, they came

beginning and --</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Everything I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Can you describe --</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: A Friday --</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: -- exactly what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: A Friday in the morning I was washing the floor and I heard like noise.</span> <span id="s412">This place when -- where we lived was close from a highway.</span> <span id="s413">I opened the door, I saw horses, wagons, soldiers, and I wasn’t afraid.</span> <span id="s414">I stood in the door and I looked.</span> <span id="s415">They were all passing, and I was standing and looking.</span> <span id="s416">But they didn’t anything to us, nothing.</span> <span id="s417">For hours they walked and walked and walked and walked.</span> <span id="s418">So I got tired, I walked into the house.</span> <span id="s419">My mother lived across the street.</span> <span id="s420">She came over and she said, you know, I am afraid to stay here.</span> <span id="s421">Let’s go to my youngest sister’s in-laws, they live more the Jews together, let’s go to them.</span> <span id="s422">What the Jews gonna do?</span> <span id="s423">We will be between them.</span> <span id="s424">So I said, that’s a good idea, but let’s wait for a few days, let’s take a little bit with us, we can walk out like this.</span> <span id="s425">I got a small baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: You had a baby by then?</span> <span id="s427">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: When was your baby born?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: My baby was born ’39 -- ’39, January 25th.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: What was your baby’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Yankov, after my father.</span> <span id="s432">And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Did you wait a few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yes, and I got the radio in the door and I heard in the radio Alexandria was a special place for the [indecipherable] Hassidim, they got [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s435">So I heard on the radio Alexandria is to -- lost -- how you saying, they -- they chased them out from over there.</span> <span id="s436">So I opened the door and I looked, I saw Jews.</span> <span id="s437">Womens childrens, with packages -- not like today, suitcases, packages.</span> <span id="s438">I stood and I stopped one and I said, what’s going on?</span> <span id="s439">She said, don’t you know?</span> <span id="s440">They chased us out from the city.</span> <span id="s441">They had to leave everything, only what I had behi -- be -- be -- close to the hand, that stuff I took.</span> <span id="s442">And we don’t know where we are going.</span> <span id="s443">I was thinking maybe the people don’t know what they talking, but how to believe?</span> <span id="s444">So I got a neighbor in the same house.</span> <span id="s445">He was a educated man and he read the papers, listened to the news.</span> <span id="s446">I said, Mr. Shejak, come out, take a look.</span> <span id="s447">He was in the back.</span> <span id="s448">Take a look what’s going on outside.</span> <span id="s449">He came out with his wife, with his two sons.</span> <span id="s450">He stopped one man, he stopped another man, he stopped a third man.</span> <span id="s451">He said, it’s no good.</span> <span id="s452">They have to leave.</span> <span id="s453">So I walked over to my mother and I said to mama, you know what’s going on?</span> <span id="s454">Alexandria, the Jews from Alexandria are moving out, they can’t stay any longer there.</span> <span id="s455">So she said okay, let’s go.</span> <span id="s456">Yeah, in the meantime, we heard airplanes.</span> <span id="s457">I didn’t saw the bombs, but people said they throwed down either a bomb or two, but I didn’t hear it and I didn’t saw it.</span> <span id="s458">So I took th-th-the important things and we went to mine si -- younger sister’s in-laws.</span> <span id="s459">And we stood there.</span> <span id="s460">Over there we heard bombs and they had shooting, they had [indecipherable], we had everything.</span> <span id="s461">But a few days when the Germans settled in Lódz was a little quiet so we went back home.</span> <span id="s462">On way, on two days, they hanged 10 Jews.</span> <span id="s463">This was in a cheaper neighborhood, but the most poor Jews lived this -- in this neighborhood.</span> <span id="s464">And the Jews was the most religious, and a few rich.</span> <span id="s465">So the 10 Jews hanged a few days to show the Jews in Lódz what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s466">So that time was time to run out to -- to Russia, and I was the one, but I said to my whole family, even to my older brother, I still have a few dollars.</span> <span id="s467">From the bank I couldn’t take out, but was a Gentile family, I don’t know if they were anti-Semitic or not, they dealed with Jews to make a dollar.</span> <span id="s468">So she said, I can go into the bank.</span> <span id="s469">Give me the book and I will bring.</span> <span id="s470">I think she bringed a little bit, how much she took for herself, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s471">She gave me a few dollars, that I remember like now.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A2: Zlotys.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Zlotys, yeah.</span> <span id="s474">So I said to my mother and to my brother, let’s take a little bit [indecipherable] possibly, and let’s go to Russia.</span> <span id="s475">So my mother said, the childrens wouldn’t say kaddish after [indecipherable] and I don’t want to eat treif and I don’t want to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s476">So I got a small baby by myself, I couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s477">I should, I was able, but I was staying with the family.</span> <span id="s478">So later, my youngest sister went to see Russia.</span> <span id="s479">So she was with a very nice Gentile man, and she was -- she was pregnant the time.</span> <span id="s480">And she was laying by the border a few days and she came back and she said to me, Chanka, forget about Russia, you don’t know what’s going on over there.</span> <span id="s481">The Germans are staying there too, and they’re [indecipherable] together with the anti-Semitishi Polacks and they’re beating the Jews to death, they’re taking away everything.</span> <span id="s482">I said to her, let them take away everything, but let’s come alive to Russia.</span> <span id="s483">We are gonna build up a little bit and we will be alive.</span> <span id="s484">But she said I’m not going any more.</span> <span id="s485">She got the baby in the ghetto, was terrible.</span> <span id="s486">I was working in the [indecipherable] do you know what’s on there?</span> <span id="s487">This was the educated boys, they stepped in in the police and you were working for the SS.</span> <span id="s488">They knew the -- which places to show them to take out the leftover -- th-th-the -- everything from the Jews, so they ma -- they built up our beautiful can-cantina and the SS came down t-to eat and they -- some they came to eat, was outside a 200 girl -- womens -- girls, because they need workers and I was standing in the line.</span> <span id="s489">I don’t know if this is from God, or this was luck, or my father, they picked me and I worked in the canteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: So when did you go into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: To the ghetto, 1940.</span> <span id="s492">1940.</span> <span id="s493">The ghetto was closed 1940.</span> <span id="s494">From the beginning I was doing business, I bought cheese for my dau -- for my sister’s in-laws and I bring them in.</span> <span id="s495">I have a block to [indecipherable] to make only sweet stuff.</span> <span id="s496">So how much I asked, for the cheese, he gave me.</span> <span id="s497">So I was thinking, tomorrow I [indecipherable] ask double.</span> <span id="s498">So tomorrow I came, was no more cheese, was closed the ghetto and that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: What was it -- can you describe in the beginning the ghetto, what -- what your living conditions were like, who were you living with, how much room did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: A room.</span> <span id="s501">You got one room for a whole family.</span> <span id="s502">So my mother was with three childrens, I was with the baby, my sister with her husband with a baby, my brother with the wife with a baby.</span> <span id="s503">But this was a big room, we managed.</span> <span id="s504">We were together.</span> <span id="s505">Later, my yo -- my younger brother saw it’s not good, we gonna die anyway, from starvation.</span> <span id="s506">So he signed himself to go to work.</span> <span id="s507">So his wife went over to her mother, while my brother went to Poznan.</span> <span id="s508">This was the worst place what they killed the Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Wh-Which brother was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: This was Moishe, the third one.</span> <span id="s511">So Moishe wrote us a letter.</span> <span id="s512">He said, I [indecipherable] you know Koplevich.</span> <span id="s513">This was a neighbor, a good friend.</span> <span id="s514">In the war, people what they maked the nice living, but in the wartime we got mixed up, we didn’t know what to do, so she sent with her husband back to Tomaszów Mazowiecki with -- with the merchandise, with -- with the clothes, with everything.</span> <span id="s515">So he died there with the clothes, and we died here they didn’t got clothes, so he -- th-th-the boy was starving, so he signed his name to go to -- to go to Poznan.</span> <span id="s516">So over there he died, and my bur -- my brother buried him.</span> <span id="s517">So my brother got luck.</span> <span id="s518">A German girl falled in love with him -- he was a very religious boy, but he changed later.</span> <span id="s519">She brought him back to ghetto.</span> <span id="s520">But in the ghetto was a place what nobody was able to go in, only Rimkowsky with the police, with the SS.</span> <span id="s521">She brought him into this place.</span> <span id="s522">She walked over to Rimkowsky, she said, I want you to give him a good job.</span> <span id="s523">And don’t send him out.</span> <span id="s524">And he gave him a good job and he helped us a little bit, yes.</span> <span id="s525">But anyway, the ghetto liquidate, he went with his wife and the child, they didn’t came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Okay, we’re at 1940 --</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: This was 19 -- 1945 and the ghetto

this is very close to Russia, 24 hours from the Russia border.</span> <span id="s556">So I was watching a couple, they were standing outside and they got a little bit hot water in a thermos, and they got cold hand, they were -- so his pants was on the floor, he wasn’t able to pick up her pa -- underwear, so I said, I will -- gonna walk out and I will see to -- what I can do to get -- I walked out.</span> <span id="s557">The man was dying in -- in -- in -- in -- so I pulled up the pants.</span> <span id="s558">I told him, hold the pants and walk into the place because they gave them little rooms from the Polish people.</span> <span id="s559">And to her, I helped her pick up th-the pants.</span> <span id="s560">Almost -- she didn’t drop that, but I wasn’t able to -- to carry them.</span> <span id="s561">And my job was to give them three times a day, soups.</span> <span id="s562">So believe me, I’m not making my name nice, or myself nice.</span> <span id="s563">I put in in each soup a hamburger.</span> <span id="s564">We had to make for them a hamburger, but I put in another one.</span> <span id="s565">They blessed me.</span> <span id="s566">I was afraid, I told them, go, go.</span> <span id="s567">Go, don’t bless me, now go, go, because I was afraid the manager will hear.</span> <span id="s568">But he found out, but he did nothing to me, anything.</span> <span id="s569">I don’t know what happened to him, they took him out with his wife.</span> <span id="s570">He was [indecipherable] Rabinovich, he was a nice man.</span> <span id="s571">And he didn’t tell me anything, he saw what I’m doing.</span> <span id="s572">So I worked on [indecipherable] a few months.</span> <span id="s573">So my sister got a friend, the mother and the father, I don’t know if they died, or they killed them, so the two girls were left in the house and they were starving, cold.</span> <span id="s574">The water was freezing in the houses.</span> <span id="s575">I got frozen water in my house, too.</span> <span id="s576">My little boy was laying in bed, locked it outside, the lock and I put a coloring book on a -- a tray, but his -- [indecipherable] was so --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: [sobbing] was running.</span> <span id="s579">And I told him, I said, Yankovek, if somebody will knock in the door, don’t answer.</span> <span id="s580">He was so smart, he was so afraid.</span> <span id="s581">He didn’t answer it.</span> <span id="s582">But the doctor, I told him for I’m putting the key because he got a little hole in the right side in the lung.</span> <span id="s583">So the doctor came, he took the key, he opened him -- examined him, and he said to -- he said, Yankovek, don’t eat up your mother’s bread, because your mother’s gonna die and who is gonna take care of you?</span> <span id="s584">Because he couldn’t eat his soups because he was sick, so I gave him my piece of bread.</span> <span id="s585">But from that time on he didn't want it.</span> <span id="s586">He said, Mama, I am afraid, I don’t want it.</span> <span id="s587">I said Yankovek, I have food, I’m eating.</span> <span id="s588">I’m eating carrots, I’m eating vegetables, I’m eating.</span> <span id="s589">Well, to make short the story I -- the canteen got closed, the kitchens, they maked a little less, we got a -- a little more so [indecipherable] how it was [indecipherable] yeah, they start to send out from Lódz, the ghetto, the people.</span> <span id="s590">So every day we got less at work.</span> <span id="s591">One time I looked down and I’m by myself.</span> <span id="s592">But I had to prepare the potatoes for tomorrow.</span> <span id="s593">And I took out the pails from the potatoes to the garbage.</span> <span id="s594">I saw a man is walking down, but I wasn’t afraid because the light was -- wasn’t [indecipherable] anyway.</span> <span id="s595">So I don’t think -- I wasn’t thinking if it’s a Jew or [indecipherable] a Gentile, or nothing.</span> <span id="s596">I did my work and I closed the door.</span> <span id="s597">And I was wearing wooden shoes and a scarf over my head and a black coat what I got for my wedding.</span> <span id="s598">And I had to pass the cemetery.</span> <span id="s599">Today if you would give me the whole world money, I wouldn’t walk on a cemetery, but that time I was so careful because was costas, you know, like -- like growing hard [indecipherable] like little peas.</span> <span id="s600">So [indecipherable] so I [indecipherable] touched my coat.</span> <span id="s601">So I was afraid [indecipherable] so I took my coat like this and this way I walked, so nothing touched me, and I came out to the road and I came home.</span> <span id="s602">My mother was sitting and saying [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s603">We -- we got a [indecipherable] from [indecipherable] this was a very big [indecipherable] I wer -- this wasn’t -- he lees -- lived in Tredia.</span> <span id="s604">We were on his grave.</span> <span id="s605">They lived in -- 21 year in Israel and she was praying for me to come home to the baby.</span> <span id="s606">So I came home, I bringed with me a little bit.</span> <span id="s607">I’d bring with me a little bit.</span> <span id="s608">If they would catch me, they would give me right away to the Germans, but I wasn’t thinking of anything.</span> <span id="s609">I bring -- I got in that dress a pocket in here, a pocket in here, so I got the -- a little meatball in here, a little meatball in here, something else, maybe two.</span> <span id="s610">So I gave my mother and I gave a half to my sister’s boy, little boy and to mine.</span> <span id="s611">Later, they liquidate over there, too.</span> <span id="s612">So, if I walked out to work, I wasn’t sure if I will come back because they -- how you say [indecipherable] so if -- they was looking for people.</span> <span id="s613">So they hop from the street, so I never was sure if I will come back.</span> <span id="s614">But I don’t know, maybe because I was good to my parents, I came home.</span> <span id="s615">One time was [indecipherable] loss, only police and firemens, high officials with the wives, they could stay.</span> <span id="s616">So I got a neighbor on the first floor-- not educated people, they didn’t know an-any Yiddishkeit, and we were friends with them.</span> <span id="s617">Her husband was a fireman.</span> <span id="s618">Well she -- and I got -- received a letter to come with my little baby out from -- from Lódz to death.</span> <span id="s619">In the meantime, she came up and she said, Chanka, will you do me a favor?</span> <span id="s620">My husband is very sick.</span> <span id="s621">I think he has pneumonia, I can’t leave him alone.</span> <span id="s622">Go to the matzos -- they are -- they were baking matzos, so only the police and the firemens need to go to the matzos.</span> <span id="s623">So I came there on Dunkelman, not on my name, on her name.</span> <span id="s624">And he came to look.</span> <span id="s625">A man -- he became a policeman and he was our neighbor and he showed me a list, he said, I would like to break my -- my legs.</span> <span id="s626">I have to go to take a few womens with childrens.</span> <span id="s627">I saw my name, but I didn’t told him anything.</span> <span id="s628">So I was walking with this [indecipherable] because he was a policeman.</span> <span id="s629">And her -- her father was -- they lived upstairs [indecipherable] bring down their sick father, they throw them into the wagon.</span> <span id="s630">And we were staying back in -- baking the matzos.</span> <span id="s631">But later we got afraid they gonna take us too.</span> <span id="s632">So we walked out and I walked into -- excuse me, a toilet and -- and this was in the winter, it was very cold, and this was frozen.</span> <span id="s633">And I looked in, was dark, and I was staying on that, but I feel something in the back, but tot -- I didn’t touch it, I didn’t get -- I was staying til was a little bit -- I hear th-th -- th-th-the [indecipherable] and I was staying there til [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s634">And I maked up with my sister, if the window will be open a little bit, I can come in.</span> <span id="s635">If the window wouldn’t be open, I can’t -- shouldn’t come in.</span> <span id="s636">So a policeman came in to take me.</span> <span id="s637">So the janitor didn’t saw me and a neighbor was taking in my little boy to hide him.</span> <span id="s638">So he was sure I am gone.</span> <span id="s639">So he said no, this woman with the baby is gone.</span> <span id="s640">So they walked away.</span> <span id="s641">But I came and my sister falled asleep and she forgot to open the window.</span> <span id="s642">So I was walking back.</span> <span id="s643">I came again, the window is closed.</span> <span id="s644">But I came again, the little window was open.</span> <span id="s645">And I came in [indecipherable] she kissed me, she hugged me.</span> <span id="s646">They took out Chaim, her husband, they took out everybody.</span> <span id="s647">Thank God you are here.</span> <span id="s648">What’s going to happen with us, what’s happen together.</span> <span id="s649">I said listen, this is not [indecipherable] we have to something.</span> <span id="s650">She said, what can we do?</span> <span id="s651">To drink poison?</span> <span id="s652">I said the best thing would be.</span> <span id="s653">The best thing.</span> <span id="s654">But anyway, in the evening I went back to the place to bake the matzos under Dunkelman’s name.</span> <span id="s655">So I met there a girl what her husband was a janitor.</span> <span id="s656">And on this place were doctors from Czechoslovakia and he maked a living from them because he bringed the -- the vegetables, the potatoes, the coals for them, and they paid him.</span> <span id="s657">So I told a lie, I said listen, I am living with my sister, with my brother-in-law and we can’t get along and I would like to find a place to go to.</span> <span id="s658">She said, come over to my house.</span> <span id="s659">I have three beds.</span> <span id="s660">I’m lonely.</span> <span id="s661">So this girl took me in and I was sleeping with her a few days, but we both got in fight and we both packed two sacks and they get -- and they went by themselves to that.</span> <span id="s662">And they got a good life because it got all the doctors from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s663">They maked the living from them.</span> <span id="s664">And she was working for the matzos.</span> <span id="s665">So I was alone in the house.</span> <span id="s666">They came into the house, they asked me for the people [indecipherable] I said they come later, later, but la -- I couldn’t, I was afraid to stay there, so I went back to my sister.</span> <span id="s667">But I forgot the meantime to tell you.</span> <span id="s668">One time I went to work and I came home and I got only my little boy in the house.</span> <span id="s669">They took out my family.</span> <span id="s670">And my little boy, they left a piece of bread, maybe an inch and a half on the window.</span> <span id="s671">He was kissing the piece of bread not to eat, only to feel like the crumbs.</span> <span id="s672">So my little boy was two years old, he said Mama, don’t eat up Laiva -- Laiva’s bread, he will come back.</span> <span id="s673">He’s hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: So that time, they liquidate the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: When was that, what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: This is -- was 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: What month?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: A month.</span> <span id="s680">[indecipherable] Before they liquidate the ghetto, my brother Moishe worked in the [indecipherable] radio.</span> <span id="s681">This was the best job in ghetto, like with the police.</span> <span id="s682">He was very good to us.</span> <span id="s683">So, in the ghetto they put us in, in our house, downstairs was a movie.</span> <span id="s684">So on the roof was a little wall, and I got black material because we got afraid of the money, so we work materials.</span> <span id="s685">So I bought a material, was -- was on one side shiny, on the other side was -- this was an expensive material.</span> <span id="s686">So I there was putting in a few dollars in case we gonna go to work because we were thinking they’re going to send us to work, so they will sell this to the Gentile people, we will have a piece of bread for us, for the childrens.</span> <span id="s687">So we took a pail of water, I got a bread, and my sister got a bread and we went up on the roof and we covered ourselves with the black ma -- mala -- material under the wall, and I said quietly, Yankovek, do you want a piece of bread?</span> <span id="s688">He was speaking Polish.</span> <span id="s689">He said, no Mama, I am afraid.</span> <span id="s690">We wouldn’t have it tomorrow and the Germans gonna kill us.</span> <span id="s691">No more, be quiet, don’t talk.</span> <span id="s692">So we were laying and I heard some noise on the steps.</span> <span id="s693">I was thinking they coming to take us, but Moishe came.</span> <span id="s694">And quietly he called us, and we heard Moishe.</span> <span id="s695">Moishe said, be quiet, you need bread, I have a kilo bread.</span> <span id="s696">I said, Moishe, we still have a bread.</span> <span id="s697">If you need the kilo bread -- no, he said, save the kilo bread, but don’t go down because [indecipherable] now downstairs and catching the ch -- the childrens from all over.</span> <span id="s698">So we were still s-staying down the wall, til was quiet.</span> <span id="s699">My brother came and he told us we can come into the house.</span> <span id="s700">So we came into the house, they put the childrens to the beds.</span> <span id="s701">We have ourself are tired, frozen, cold, okay.</span> <span id="s702">A-And to work -- no, no more work.</span> <span id="s703">We were waiting for Moishe to come to tell us what to do.</span> <span id="s704">But all night Moishe didn't came.</span> <span id="s705">Another night Moishe came in the dark and he said, maybe for tonight you should go up again on the roof, because it’s not clear.</span> <span id="s706">We don’t know what -- what’s going to happen, maybe they gonna take us, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s707">So we went up again on the roof, house was quiet, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s708">So in the morning very early he came and he said, bring down the childrens, put them to bed.</span> <span id="s709">So we went -- yeah.</span> <span id="s710">So mine sister went into the [indecipherable] and he gave her all the breads for my mother with the childrens, because they didn’t got -- close the carts.</span> <span id="s711">They didn’t -- they didn’t got the time to close off first everybody.</span> <span id="s712">So she brought up four breads, I don’t remember, or five breads, a little bit flour, a little bit this, a little bit this.</span> <span id="s713">So we said to each other, now we are eating up our brother, sister and our mother.</span> <span id="s714">But not long was taking, a few days and we had to leave the ghetto.</span> <span id="s715">We were -- they sent us over to the other side.</span> <span id="s716">So we walked into my s -- sister’s in-laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: What month was

were sitting a few days.</span> <span id="s722">Came in a gentleman to look at this place because they had saved 800 people to stay in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s723">So my sister was asking him a favor, to let us stay in the basement.</span> <span id="s724">So he walked out because he was afraid and he didn’t tell us, I think he didn’t answer, he walked out, that’s all.</span> <span id="s725">Later came in a policeman, but not -- not to take us, to talk with us because he saw he is in dangerous position too.</span> <span id="s726">He said, you know, I had very bad news.</span> <span id="s727">They sending us to a place where over there they’re gonna kill our childrens first, our parents and later they’re gonna kill us.</span> <span id="s728">But we had to go by ourselves with our childrens to the trains and to go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s729">But my little boy was feeling he is going to die, because he loved me and I gave away a bread for our can of conserviate meat.</span> <span id="s730">Do you know what I mean conserviate?</span> <span id="s731">This was lot like sardines, let’s say, meat.</span> <span id="s732">So I said, Yankovek, I would like to give you a piece of bread with meat.</span> <span id="s733">No, Mama, I can’t eat.</span> <span id="s734">He couldn’t eat and he didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s735">So we were on trains from cattles.</span> <span id="s736">No windows, nothing.</span> <span id="s737">Now that you couldn’t breathe.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: This is you and your son, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: My little

sister and our brother, they were so touched to each other.</span> <span id="s744">She cried the whole way, he died in the train.</span> <span id="s745">What happened to this little girl, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s746">Was so crowded we couldn’t breathe, we couldn’t move, nothing.</span> <span id="s747">Finally we came out to Auschwitz the middle of the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: How -- do you know how many days you were on -- on trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: On th-the -- the train was going a day and a night, half a night, yeah, it came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Did they give you any food?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Ah, food.</span> <span id="s752">I’m telling you they pushed us in to die there because wasn’t able to breathe, my little boy couldn’t breathe.</span> <span id="s753">I was pushing a little bit the people away, it was a selfish, to make a little bit air pocket [indecipherable] little boys.</span> <span id="s754">So when the opened the wagons to come out, Jewish people -- Jewish mens worked us.</span> <span id="s755">They called them -- how the name was?</span> <span id="s756">How --</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A2: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Ah, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s759">They were -- now, when I’m thinking over, I’m not mad at them because they were -- they saw the dead for the eyes and they knew we are going to that, so they took away all everything from us to save a little bit for them.</span> <span id="s760">They got girlfriends there, they were suffering, but living, but we were expecting the same thing.</span> <span id="s761">So they took away everything from me, and I stood with my [indecipherable] with my sister, so I got the ring, the wedding ring, I got afraid, I throw it away, because they were beating to death.</span> <span id="s762">I got, I think, five sterling pounds [indecipherable] but I got my wedding, I was saving.</span> <span id="s763">I throw this away.</span> <span id="s764">My father gave us each 20 dollars gold.</span> <span id="s765">We throw this away.</span> <span id="s766">So meantime we were staying and thinking with my sister, what to do.</span> <span id="s767">I saw [indecipherable] here, came in, came close to us, a good looking woman, not too old, in her late 50’s.</span> <span id="s768">And she said to us, take me for your mother.</span> <span id="s769">I will watch your childrens.</span> <span id="s770">Maybe you’ll get sent you to work, I will take care on your childrens and we will be a family.</span> <span id="s771">And my sister and I said okay.</span> <span id="s772">So this woman stood with us.</span> <span id="s773">Later came to us the mans from the trains and he said, give the two childrens to the lady, you come with me.</span> <span id="s774">So the lady took the two little boys by the hands, and I said to my little boy, Yankovek, I will come to see you.</span> <span id="s775">He said, I still have the voice in my ears, Mama, you never came to me.</span> <span id="s776">You afraid for the Germans.</span> <span id="s777">I said, Yankovek, I will come.</span> <span id="s778">I will break iron.</span> <span id="s779">I will come to see you.</span> <span id="s780">I never came.</span> <span id="s781">I never see him no more.</span> <span id="s782">So this man put us to young people what he send to work.</span> <span id="s783">This was a little bit a mensch.</span> <span id="s784">So he was thinking he can save us.</span> <span id="s785">So he put us -- but I cut my hair, they cut off [indecipherable] hair.</span> <span id="s786">I don’t know how it was, somebody came over and he cut off my hair.</span> <span id="s787">And my sister didn’t recognize me so she start to scream, who has my sister.</span> <span id="s788">They said your sister is standing by you.</span> <span id="s789">No, this [indecipherable] I said, and now you’re crying about hair?</span> <span id="s790">I don’t care how I look.</span> <span id="s791">So I took off my coat, I throw it away because the coat got full.</span> <span id="s792">And I was staying.</span> <span id="s793">And I met a teacher, but I got a night school with her, Socha, such a nice lady.</span> <span id="s794">So she said, we will be together.</span> <span id="s795">I said, Socha, I am happy.</span> <span id="s796">I am so happy I am thankful to God to be with you together with my sister.</span> <span id="s797">And we stood together and came a lady close to us and she called us the names, but I didn’t recognize her.</span> <span id="s798">And this was our cousin [indecipherable] yeah, she didn't got the baby.</span> <span id="s799">In ghetto she got the baby.</span> <span id="s800">So she sent her mother with the baby she got -- they got a big store, they got good pinozo.</span> <span id="s801">And she was a educated woman too.</span> <span id="s802">So she sent her mother to Piotrków Trybunalski.</span> <span id="s803">Over there wasn’t the Third Reich, so she was thinking with the money her mother will save the baby, she’s a young woman, she will go to work.</span> <span id="s804">So she said to me and my sister, can I be with you together?</span> <span id="s805">I said, it’s a honor.</span> <span id="s806">I am happy you saw us, because I wouldn’t recognize you.</span> <span id="s807">You put us dresses I can tell you s -- years, and I wouldn’t never get through.</span> <span id="s808">Dresses, long to the ground, big like this, no hair.</span> <span id="s809">We looked like -- like he called us, Jerusalem putin.</span> <span id="s810">So in a few minutes, not long, Mengele came with the -- how the name from her?</span> <span id="s811">I’m forgetting.</span> <span id="s812">She was the worst woman I -- I -- Mengele with his helper, I will remind my name.</span> <span id="s813">He was wearing white gloves to here, not deep, short gloves.</span> <span id="s814">He got a little stick in his fingers and he turned around like this, we had to take off the dresses, naked.</span> <span id="s815">He looked over the body, if we don’t have anything on the body.</span> <span id="s816">It was two sides, he said -- sec -- how you saying, selected -- sele -- one on this side, and one on this side.</span> <span id="s817">So me and my sister maked up we don’t care, but let’s go together.</span> <span id="s818">So my sister went to one side and I went to the other side.</span> <span id="s819">But I was that time still with my mind.</span> <span id="s820">When he turned with the back [indecipherable] I moved and I was by my sister.</span> <span id="s821">But this cousin got afraid, so she was over there.</span> <span id="s822">And the -- Socha, when I tried to move, I said Socha, do.</span> <span id="s823">So she did the same thing and she went over with us.</span> <span id="s824">So we are together.</span> <span id="s825">I says, and now I don’t care.</span> <span id="s826">If we gonna go to the gas chambers let’s go together.</span> <span id="s827">If we’re gonna go to work, let’s go together.</span> <span id="s828">But this cousin, I never forget what she told me.</span> <span id="s829">She knew she is going to the gas chambers, but she couldn’t make.</span> <span id="s830">So they took us to take a shower and they took them to the same place, but the other group they pushed in in a place that was glass windows.</span> <span id="s831">So they saw it’s no good, so they breaked up the door.</span> <span id="s832">So they pushed in more people what they got to go to work.</span> <span id="s833">So my sister was so smart, she said, Hannah come closer here [speaks Polish here].</span> <span id="s834">So we went all the [indecipherable] my sister a -- a little bit farther, but I saw that was going on.</span> <span id="s835">So they locked the door, we didn’t saw them any more.</span> <span id="s836">Us they put in in cold water, and in the water was charko, this is the name in Polish.</span> <span id="s837">But this was a chemical, charko.</span> <span id="s838">The smell was like from matches, when you lighting a match.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Sulfur, like sulfur.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s841">So they gave us a bath there and they gave us again dresses, again big -- I don’t know, one’s got a dress til here, naked the bottom.</span> <span id="s842">I got a dress til [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s843">They gave me a pair of shoes, I’m suffering still to-today.</span> <span id="s844">Hollander -- do you know from Hollander shoes, what they harm is about?</span> <span id="s845">They gave me --</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: [indecipherable] the clogs --</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: But they wasn’t too big, so -- and I was walking in them.</span> <span id="s848">So I have til today, sick my -- my -- my feet.</span> <span id="s849">So they took us on place, again a -- a bath -- again a shower, again a shower, agai -- maybe 10 showers in one day.</span> <span id="s850">Every minute out the dress, everyone out the dress.</span> <span id="s851">This was Mengele and Erma -- Erma, I never forget her.</span> <span id="s852">So the last moment, they gave us a cup of soup, they put in five, like this, not like this.</span> <span id="s853">Like a line.</span> <span id="s854">So the first girl took the pot.</span> <span id="s855">The pot maybe was about two quarts, or two and a half a quart.</span> <span id="s856">So my sister said Hannah [speaks Polish] run and take a little soup from the -- but I was waiting til she’s gonna share.</span> <span id="s857">But the other one catched, the other one -- so my daughter -- my sister said, Hannah, I can’t catch for me and you, I gonna catch for myself, catch too.</span> <span id="s858">But when I runned over, I had to clean with my hand the rest, that’s what I got.</span> <span id="s859">So I said to my sister, listen, if we gonna stay in Auschwitz a few days longer, we gonna drop dead here anyway.</span> <span id="s860">Let’s stay in a group from young people, and we will see what’s gonna happen.</span> <span id="s861">She said that’s an idea.</span> <span id="s862">And so she went with us.</span> <span id="s863">We stood in the group, they murdered us again with baths, again with showers, again with baths, til they bringed us a kilo bread, a piece of bologna and a piece of margarine.</span> <span id="s864">So my sister said, now Hannah, we are going to walk, and SS mens walked with us about 20 minutes, and I walked in the shoes.</span> <span id="s865">And I saw trains [indecipherable] and I was okay, but I don’t know maybe the di-di-di -- they bring us that -- to other gas chambers, let’s be a train.</span> <span id="s866">But the c-cattle trains.</span> <span id="s867">They pushed us in.</span> <span id="s868">We ate up the bread and on the -- with the [indecipherable] with the margarine.</span> <span id="s869">They put in a pail in case, excuse me, for the need.</span> <span id="s870">And a SS man was sitting in each [indecipherable] watching us, but when he walked out, he locked us outside.</span> <span id="s871">But anyway, we didn't got anything to do.</span> <span id="s872">We didn’t ate, we didn’t drink, we didn’t have nothing to do.</span> <span id="s873">So he was coming back in an hour, he ate something [indecipherable] he came in, he was sitting in wa -- but I -- thirsty I was.</span> <span id="s874">So we got very little windows like in here, but more buts -- pardon me, smaller.</span> <span id="s875">So was raining, I sticked out the tongue and I -- I got a few drops rain.</span> <span id="s876">So girls behind me were pulling my short little hair, but I didn’t pull, I don’t care, I am not going away til I dra -- have to get a few drops of water.</span> <span id="s877">Okay, I was sitting, sleeping, sitting, we were traveling a few days, maybe a week with no food, with no water, with nothing.</span> <span id="s878">We came to a place -- we came to a place, so he gave us striped dresses.</span> <span id="s879">He gave us straw sacks and straw to make like -- like mattresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Mattress.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: So I said to my sister, at least we will have where to lay down.</span> <span id="s882">But he was a murder.</span> <span id="s883">He start to beat -- t-to beat us up to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Do you know the name of this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: The place?</span> <span id="s886">Valdersluss, yes.</span> <span id="s887">So he showed us to be good, if not he is -- can -- is able to do the same thing what Auschwitz, va -- he was a murder, but they hanged him anyway, yeah.</span> <span id="s888">So he gave us two days not to go to work, so we furnished everything, like he said.</span> <span id="s889">He gave us underwear, like [indecipherable] you understand what I said to him?</span> <span id="s890">Like an undershirt, but longer a little bit, let’s say to the knee.</span> <span id="s891">Later he gave us a band, like a brassiere, but no brassiere, so we were -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: The -- the Lagerführers?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: I don’t know the name, no I -- I -- we didn’t -- we didn’t know a -- nobody didn’t know the name.</span> <span id="s896">We got a Oberscharführer, he was a little bit better, but he was afraid of the Lagerführer.</span> <span id="s897">The Lagerführer was a murder.</span> <span id="s898">The face, when you looked at his face, you was able to see the murderskeit.</span> <span id="s899">The Oberscharführer -- and he wasn’t -- he talked a [indecipherable] poli -- nice, he said, [indecipherable] it’s gonna come a time you will be free.</span> <span id="s900">But when he was, he was s-screaming, cursing, calling bad names, yeah.</span> <span id="s901">He was a old man, the Oberscharführer, he was in his 70’s, but the Lagerführer was a young -- ab-ab -- in his 40’s -- 30’s -- late 30’s.</span> <span id="s902">So two days, two SS mens came and they put us in five, like this, in five, and he said -- he talked to us nice [indecipherable] like Germans.</span> <span id="s903">He said, and now we are going three kilmetre to the place what we going to start to walk.</span> <span id="s904">And behave yourself, I wouldn’t beat you, only you have to walk.</span> <span id="s905">Because the Lagerführer will come to see.</span> <span id="s906">Okay, we walked -- yeah, in the morning he gave us like eight ounces bread with a coffee.</span> <span id="s907">The coffee was not coffee.</span> <span id="s908">Okay, so the bread yeah, and here we got the cabinets.</span> <span id="s909">Found a piece of -- of wire, a piece of string.</span> <span id="s910">So w-we put everything here and this was our cabinets.</span> <span id="s911">So we went to work.</span> <span id="s912">So the first time he told us to dig holes.</span> <span id="s913">Later we found out this is going to be shelters.</span> <span id="s914">But the Lagerführer came into ours and he didn't like we took small amounts on the shovel.</span> <span id="s915">He showed us to pick up a shovel full.</span> <span id="s916">If he would stay with us, nobody would be alive, but we got luck, he stood an hour, a half an hour and he left, so we go back to little bit, little bit.</span> <span id="s917">Okay.</span> <span id="s918">But was very cold.</span> <span id="s919">And I cried to myself.</span> <span id="s920">So Socha came over to me, she said, why you crying?</span> <span id="s921">I says, Socha, I am freezing.</span> <span id="s922">I don’t care any more alive.</span> <span id="s923">She said, Hannah, my mother told me [speaks Polish here] Do you understand this?</span> <span id="s924">The whole body will became like the nose.</span> <span id="s925">So she came two hours later and asked me, I said, still not [Polish].</span> <span id="s926">But I became [Polish], yes.</span> <span id="s927">I worked in the cold winds, in the cold snows and the cold rains.</span> <span id="s928">My dress was never dry, all the time wet.</span> <span id="s929">I was sleeping in it to dry, but never dried.</span> <span id="s930">So we worked there, we got the soup, and we came home, we got the soup.</span> <span id="s931">He stood -- this he did wa -- right.</span> <span id="s932">Of course, the Jewish capos, they gave us the top, the water, for them they saved the bottom, th-the -- the [Polish] the -- the vegetables, or the [Polish].</span> <span id="s933">But he stood so she had to mix.</span> <span id="s934">So I got a little potato, a little bit cabbage, a little bit [indecipherable] okay.</span> <span id="s935">But if he wasn't, then they [indecipherable] so we got water.</span> <span id="s936">So I worked in this place, in a salt mine, in a salt mine.</span> <span id="s937">I was digging out [indecipherable] from the water to full up iron wagons, the name was from the wagons [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s938">This is like little trains, one was touched to the other, and they were on lines and -- yeah, lines.</span> <span id="s939">So I got five or six together and I had to full up all the six and to push them to the place.</span> <span id="s940">Later I kept over, yeah, and I had to come back.</span> <span id="s941">But I -- when we came to work, right away he said [speaks foreign language here] and I have til today neuralge in my head, neuralge in my gums, neuralge in my ears, because the wind, the rain, all the time wet.</span> <span id="s942">But over there I didn’t suffered.</span> <span id="s943">I never got a headache, I never got a toothache.</span> <span id="s944">They pulled mine teeth there with -- with -- what’s that st -- plines -- plienses.</span> <span id="s945">I didn’t got blood poison, I didn’t got anything, they put the camp, I think, six in the bottom for -- yeah.</span> <span id="s946">If the girls were screaming, he pulled more.</span> <span id="s947">So I was thinking, get away, it’s no good, so I was holding like this, so he pulled only six and four, okay.</span> <span id="s948">What else we got.</span> <span id="s949">Yeah, later they took us to a salt mine.</span> <span id="s950">This place was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s951">The man [indecipherable] was bringing us down with the elevator, was a man in his late 80’s.</span> <span id="s952">He said, my God [indecipherable] 50 years here, I never bring down womens.</span> <span id="s953">God be with them.</span> <span id="s954">We came down, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s955">That th-the [indecipherable] better for us than to -- okay, he came over with the lamp in the front, he showed us what to do.</span> <span id="s956">So he picked me to push up -- they got prepared in the daytime, I think [indecipherable] were prepared for us.</span> <span id="s957">So was -- the salt was cut in pieces, big pieces, smaller pieces.</span> <span id="s958">So sliding [indecipherable] was going up on electricity.</span> <span id="s959">But I had to go so fast, if not this piece what I moved first would come back and kill me.</span> <span id="s960">So I was a little bit with energy and I pulled fast up.</span> <span id="s961">But I had to stop a little bit, so that one time it got up but a watchma -- SS man, but he didn’t pushed us so fast.</span> <span id="s962">But he watched us if he heard walking, because in the salt mine you heard walking because was quiet, he said [speaks foreign language here].</span> <span id="s963">So when I heard, so I pushed up.</span> <span id="s964">To work a whole night, to push up pieces, about 10 - 15 pounds was vi -- I would -- I would drop dead.</span> <span id="s965">So I finished a night, thank God.</span> <span id="s966">We got wooden shoes, outside was snow.</span> <span id="s967">The snow sticked to the -- to the wood, so we wouldn’t able to walk sn -- nice.</span> <span id="s968">So the SS man beat up.</span> <span id="s969">If this one don’t [indecipherable] I don’t know how my husband is forcing me to keep up kosher.</span> <span id="s970">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s971">So when walked, the five, we walk -- we watched each other, because if one from the five was a little crooked, he beat up all the five.</span> <span id="s972">So we were holding us fast and thank God we made home [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s973">But what I saw, I never forget.</span> <span id="s974">But -- but I don’t know what kind people, the Germans were educated people, high educated people, how they can do this, to kill people alive with kicking.</span> <span id="s975">So I working in salts mine a few days.</span> <span id="s976">Another day they gave me something else, another day he gave me something else, but we had to take off the dresses, was very hot.</span> <span id="s977">But water we bring with us because the salt was making thirsty, but no food.</span> <span id="s978">In the nighttime no, but in the morning when we came we got our soup with the piece of bread and he told us to go to bed, to sleep.</span> <span id="s979">But I saw the salt mine is not good either.</span> <span id="s980">So I was a businesswoman.</span> <span id="s981">I put in a few piece of salt in my -- in mine cabinet, and I was thinking with my sister we gonna change salt for something else because we didn’t got salt there.</span> <span id="s982">So I’d a -- a cousin from mine sister’s husband came over and she said, do you have salt?</span> <span id="s983">I said yes.</span> <span id="s984">She said, I have a few customers, they working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s985">I will bring you bread.</span> <span id="s986">[indecipherable] took out the whole -- the whole how you say [Polish] and I gave her.</span> <span id="s987">Til today she isn’t showing up.</span> <span id="s988">If she is alive, let her be alive, I don’t care.</span> <span id="s989">Okay.</span> <span id="s990">Later they took us [indecipherable] was very hard.</span> <span id="s991">Again li -- to put the full up the [speaks Polish]</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A2: The lorries.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: The lorries.</span> <span id="s994">So dirt, not from the water, dirt, stones, and we -- I wa-was full of -- got five, six, and they told me what, to push them and to empty them and come back.</span> <span id="s995">So I worked with my sister, and my sister, she was looking only for news.</span> <span id="s996">Then she saw -- then she saw a man, she stopped him and she asked him, do you think we will come out from here?</span> <span id="s997">The one man said to us, yes, but fight.</span> <span id="s998">I said, what do you mean fight?</span> <span id="s999">From where can -- where can I take food to eat?</span> <span id="s1000">Grass, was grass.</span> <span id="s1001">I would eat grass, was grass.</span> <span id="s1002">So this man got a friend, so my sister talked to one and I talked to other one.</span> <span id="s1003">A few days later I met one, I said, where is your friend?</span> <span id="s1004">He’s gone.</span> <span id="s1005">A few days later this other one didn’t came, so we didn't got to ask anybody, okay.</span> <span id="s1006">But the man what he walked [indecipherable] with us, he was not dead.</span> <span id="s1007">He said [speaks Polish] to take a break, a few minutes.</span> <span id="s1008">He said, I don’t care if [indecipherable] you Lagerführer.</span> <span id="s1009">If he will come, I will talk to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: -- I will talk to him.</span> <span id="s1012">But he didn’t came.</span> <span id="s1013">So later he told us, okay, go back to work.</span> <span id="s1014">So we start again to fill up the dirt.</span> <span id="s1015">Believe me, they didn't -- they didn’t need the work, only to -- to murder us.</span> <span id="s1016">Only to murder us, okay.</span> <span id="s1017">One time they took me to another group.</span> <span id="s1018">So this SS man was alone, if he -- if he wa -- if so -- if the SS was alone, was much better.</span> <span id="s1019">If was two or three, was [indecipherable] one was showing off to the other he’s taking better care.</span> <span id="s1020">So he said one thing.</span> <span id="s1021">I want you to be quiet.</span> <span id="s1022">I will take you into a room.</span> <span id="s1023">If you will stay in the room, I will watch outside if the Lagerführer is coming.</span> <span id="s1024">And he kept us a whole day in the room because raining and snowing and this was in the woods.</span> <span id="s1025">And we had to -- to clean the woods, to pick up the little branches to put together.</span> <span id="s1026">So we were sitting in the room a whole day til was dark, he took us home.</span> <span id="s1027">Okay.</span> <span id="s1028">And now, on the same place we came every day to work, so was many nations there.</span> <span id="s1029">But other nations, they got better than we had.</span> <span id="s1030">So we saw our clean -- came from -- from garbage, but clean, new.</span> <span id="s1031">Was foo -- food.</span> <span id="s1032">And we got in the back little cans from the meat, I don’t know from where we took them.</span> <span id="s1033">So everybody walked over and fi -- and I did, too.</span> <span id="s1034">Later they called the -- up Lagerführer and they told him what we did, but he didn’t -- he didn't said anything to us.</span> <span id="s1035">When we came home -- so my sister was very smart, she said mum -- Hannah don’t stay in the first line and don’t stay in the last line, so we will -- we will be able to see what they are doing with the first line.</span> <span id="s1036">So who got the can, he was giving over the head, because he knew with the can -- so I was very fast, I throwed away the can.</span> <span id="s1037">So he saw everybody was throwing away the cans, but anyway, he hit me, til today I have my ear damaged, but not bad.</span> <span id="s1038">I’m -- I can hear, I’m not deaf.</span> <span id="s1039">Okay.</span> <span id="s1040">[phone ringing, tape break].</span> <span id="s1041">I’m ca -- taking a little mag -- from everything, because to sit, to talk from everything, you will sit with me two years, and no writer is able to write a book if he wasn’t in there.</span> <span id="s1042">In between the camps was [speaks Polish] a difference.</span> <span id="s1043">Some camps got a little better, some camps got bitter like worse than death.</span> <span id="s1044">So a woman cut up a piece from the undershirt and she was making a band around the head.</span> <span id="s1045">And this Lagerführer checked all the time after the laundry, the -- the underwear.</span> <span id="s1046">So he saw a shirt cut off a piece.</span> <span id="s1047">So when we came back from work he’s -- he didn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s1048">So I saw and now is something going on.</span> <span id="s1049">So I took mine towel, because I was freezing, I put on my towel, and I was afraid if he is going to check and see me with the towel, is he going to kill me?</span> <span id="s1050">I was so fast, I throwed away the towel.</span> <span id="s1051">[indecipherable] else did the same thing.</span> <span id="s1052">But he is going to go into my room and he s -- will see I didn’t got the towel, so he will find me, so he will say what I did.</span> <span id="s1053">I did not right, but I -- I did too.</span> <span id="s1054">So finally in a few minutes, he found the woman with the little piece on the hat.</span> <span id="s1055">And he took it in and he let us in.</span> <span id="s1056">So I looked -- I looked -- in one second I was in the house and I took from another bed a towel and I put on my bed the towel.</span> <span id="s1057">So I took from an old woman, a very nice, intelligent woman, a old woman, I took the towel from her.</span> <span id="s1058">So I said to her, listen, he would believe you, because you were -- you was in the kitchen, so don’t cry.</span> <span id="s1059">If somebody took, he will save -- he will try to save his life.</span> <span id="s1060">She understood me.</span> <span id="s1061">I took the t -- I took the towel.</span> <span id="s1062">So he gave I don’t know how many with a rubber pipe on her two muscles, naked muscles.</span> <span id="s1063">The cuts was deep more than a quarter of a inch.</span> <span id="s1064">This woman was screaming a half a night, the rest of, I think she died.</span> <span id="s1065">Because I tell you the truth, to go to look, I wasn’t able.</span> <span id="s1066">To help, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1067">So I was thinking, she’s dying now, later I will die.</span> <span id="s1068">I walked out of th -- and to work, I came back, she wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1069">I think she died [indecipherable] throwed her to -- to -- to someplace and that’s it, okay.</span> <span id="s1070">This was one.</span> <span id="s1071">And now Erma and Mengele took me to work.</span> <span id="s1072">I was watching them very careful because I was afraid of the two murders.</span> <span id="s1073">They got a shepherd, a German shepherd.</span> <span id="s1074">He was trained like a SS man.</span> <span id="s1075">They didn’t told him anything, only they looked.</span> <span id="s1076">He went to this woman what they looked.</span> <span id="s1077">He didn’t left her before he -- she was dead.</span> <span id="s1078">In the most was Hungarian womens, because the Polish we were able to suffer, but not the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s1079">The Hungarians got a little better than we got, not in the camp, before the war.</span> <span id="s1080">With education, with life, with everything.</span> <span id="s1081">They got a -- a better life than we got.</span> <span id="s1082">So the whole time I heard screaming [indecipherable] the Polish people, they didn’t cry, they didn’t scream, only Shema Israel, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1083">So with us was a little girl from 14 years.</span> <span id="s1084">Up to the wall what he took me, I will explain to you, but I don’t know how to say.</span> <span id="s1085">In German the [indecipherable] we got branches with leaves, with wire and we was tying to each other and making a carpet to cover the roofs against the air raid.</span> <span id="s1086">So this little girl was with us.</span> <span id="s1087">So Erma took a piece of paper and she maked a little bag and she put in black whole peppers.</span> <span id="s1088">She went to -- over to the little girl and she gave her peppers to eat.</span> <span id="s1089">From the beginning the girl was crying Mamashi, Papashi, Bubbashi, Zeidashi, God.</span> <span id="s1090">Later she throwed her down and she opened her little bag and pushed her into the mouth.</span> <span id="s1091">And the little girl had to swallow this.</span> <span id="s1092">Later she kicked her with her feet to the wall, and she tooked us out of this place to another place.</span> <span id="s1093">Okay, what else?</span> <span id="s1094">I -- I -- I’m telling you the -- the most things, because to tell you stories, we never get through, because I’m talking with my husband and I would -- don’t believe in it.</span> <span id="s1095">I said Nathan, this is true?</span> <span id="s1096">This can happen?</span> <span id="s1097">To be six wa -- weeks with no water and not to take a bath a whole year?</span> <span id="s1098">This can be true?</span> <span id="s1099">My husband said, I can’t believe by myself, but I went through.</span> <span id="s1100">Later -- yes.</span> <span id="s1101">I was in a block, the col -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the rooms what we all -- blocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: How many people in a room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: A thousand.</span> <span id="s1104">They pushed in how ma -- how many they put?</span> <span id="s1105">We were laying like herring, pressed.</span> <span id="s1106">In the nighttime the Ukrainians came in to take off that you wouldn’t -- shoes too.</span> <span id="s1107">So we were w-walking barefoot to [indecipherable] and the snow.</span> <span id="s1108">Screamed?</span> <span id="s1109">They would kill us.</span> <span id="s1110">So they -- to come in in the night and they took off the shoes from us.</span> <span id="s1111">So over there was a girl from Czechoslovakia, her name was Pessella.</span> <span id="s1112">Believe me, I didn't make my life a [indecipherable] I didn’t, and I wouldn’t be able to make.</span> <span id="s1113">But if you would Pessella here and you would give me a knife, I would able to stay to [indecipherable] small pieces for months til she would die.</span> <span id="s1114">Such a murder, with -- from the Germans you wouldn’t able to find, never.</span> <span id="s1115">She was beating us to death.</span> <span id="s1116">So in the nighttime they took us out for say l’appel.</span> <span id="s1117">Say l’appel they were counting us.</span> <span id="s1118">Rain, snowing, we were staying hours til the SS man came to count us.</span> <span id="s1119">So when the SS man came, she showed off.</span> <span id="s1120">She said the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1121">You understand this?</span> <span id="s1122">What are tibel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A2: Devil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: The devil will kill us.</span> <span id="s1125">He said [indecipherable] because he got mad, because she [indecipherable] us, you Jewish too.</span> <span id="s1126">He said, [indecipherable] you too.</span> <span id="s1127">So she closed her pisk.</span> <span id="s1128">So the SS man took us to work.</span> <span id="s1129">So I was thinking with my sister not to go into this block any more, because this was -- I -- I more than truly killed her.</span> <span id="s1130">I more than truly.</span> <span id="s1131">I never saw in my life such a murder.</span> <span id="s1132">And she was fat.</span> <span id="s1133">Big [indecipherable] they got everything.</span> <span id="s1134">They got the mens, they got sex, they got everything there.</span> <span id="s1135">Only th-the -- the -- the stubovas, blochovas, the [indecipherable] they make the life, they are, yes.</span> <span id="s1136">They were making a life on our -- on our -- they were eating us up.</span> <span id="s1137">They didn’t gave us this ration what he gave us.</span> <span id="s1138">The Pessella was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1139">Nice hair, no, but she was a murder, my God.</span> <span id="s1140">How can be between Jews such a [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s1141">Okay, I more than sure they killed her.</span> <span id="s1142">Hundred percent.</span> <span id="s1143">Even she went back to Czechoslovakia, over there the -- killed her, because this was the worst blochova [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1144">So I walked into another block.</span> <span id="s1145">Was a lock -- they didn’t recognized if you belonged here, you belonged there, only they count every time the -- yeah, numbers we had.</span> <span id="s1146">So I walked in with my sister to another block.</span> <span id="s1147">Not a -- a-all of them were good, but not like Pessella.</span> <span id="s1148">They were beating -- they got sticks from five, six meters and they’re all giving over the heads like this and another one got the a -- a -- open head.</span> <span id="s1149">But Pessella was the worst.</span> <span id="s1150">So I was sitting with my dau -- with my daughter, God bless her til 120 -- with mine sister, my sister died in spring, after the war.</span> <span id="s1151">We were [indecipherable] the 15th of April liberated and my sister got TB all over the body.</span> <span id="s1152">So they took her to Sweden and she died June the 17th, 1945, 27 years old.</span> <span id="s1153">So that smart girl, how she worked for our parents.</span> <span id="s1154">She was the best from all of us, from our parents.</span> <span id="s1155">For each holiday I asked a coat, a dress, shoes, but not she.</span> <span id="s1156">But what she did when I was outside, she put on -- she was very close to me, she put on my dress.</span> <span id="s1157">And I walked in the street and I saw she’s wearing my dress.</span> <span id="s1158">Not in the street I wouldn’t make nothing.</span> <span id="s1159">When I came home, I start to fight with her.</span> <span id="s1160">So my father said, do me a favor, take a few dollars and go outside, buy material and make for yourself a dress and a coat.</span> <span id="s1161">You know what this girl did?</span> <span id="s1162">She took the few dollars, she bought for my father -- this was for special Hassidic people, a [indecipherable] summer -- summer coat, let’s say and for my mother a coat and she got 80 cents left over, she bought Skombra.</span> <span id="s1163">Skombra was the best sardines in our country, we got good sardines, better than we have here, from [indecipherable] the good.</span> <span id="s1164">So this was 80 cents, so she bought for 80 cents father -- for my father the Skombras.</span> <span id="s1165">This what she did for our parents and for our small, little boy.</span> <span id="s1166">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1167">I was working, I gave in the money, but all the time I asked, I need a dress, I need shoes, I need a coat and I got.</span> <span id="s1168">But she never asked, never.</span> <span id="s1169">But when she went out, she put a -- she put on mines.</span> <span id="s1170">So I said, I can be the good one too.</span> <span id="s1171">I am th-th-the -- the bad one because I am asking for clothes, we didn’t got enough money.</span> <span id="s1172">And you don’t want it, you [indecipherable] you wearing mines.</span> <span id="s1173">So we got a fight all over this, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Any other stories before liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Before liberation?</span> <span id="s1176">Oy, I will prepare, I will prepare more.</span> <span id="s1177">I have so much.</span> <span id="s1178">Sometimes when I’m not sleeping, I’m thinking over if this is true, if such educated, high educated people like the Germans, they were the first educated people.</span> <span id="s1179">China was the first, but the modern country was Germany and they were able to do people like that.</span> <span id="s1180">But one thing I will tell you when [indecipherable] when I was liberated, I wasn’t able to walk, I was laying on the floor.</span> <span id="s1181">So I was liberated by the British.</span> <span id="s1182">So a soldier gave me a newspaper and I was so dumb, I didn't save this newpas -- newspaper.</span> <span id="s1183">In the newspaper I read about 400 years ago, this same thing happened to Frankfurt am Main.</span> <span id="s1184">They throwed out the childrens from the windows, they throwed out the furnitures from the windows.</span> <span id="s1185">The -- the chambers in [indecipherable] you still able to see what they put in the Jews.</span> <span id="s1186">So the -- th-the walls having openings.</span> <span id="s1187">So in the wintertime they were freezing, they got typhoid, they got lice and they didn’t got nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1188">So were two mens, Adolf Stoecker was Hitler.</span> <span id="s1189">Adolf Stoecker and who was the other one, Nathan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A2: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: I do rem -- remind myself.</span> <span id="s1192">The other one was secretly going to rich friends and collecting money, three quarter from the population from Frankfurt am Main died, but the leftover, he took out from the chambers, you can see the chambers still today in Wiesbaum , this is very close to Frankfurt am Main, I was there, I saw it.</span> <span id="s1193">And he gave each a little bit money and he told them to go to look to the apartments if they are empty, to go in and he helped them to go in a little business to build up again a life.</span> <span id="s1194">Petmilch was the good one.</span> <span id="s1195">Adolf Stoecker was Hitler, Petmilch was saving the rest, few Jews what they left -- were leftover from the get -- from the chambers, no gas chambers, only chambers they were laying with no food, with no a -- with no sanitary.</span> <span id="s1196">They died of typhus, they died from starvation.</span> <span id="s1197">A few got leftover, so he took them out and he saved the few Jews, Petmilch.</span> <span id="s1198">And I got the newspaper and why I didn’t save the newspaper like this, but I was very sick, very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Tell us more about the liberation, the day of liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1201">They took us one time to carry stones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: This is the British?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: I was in Bergen-Belsen, and I was re -- by the British in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1204">Frankfurt was America, but Bergen-Belsen was the British.</span> <span id="s1205">We didn’t got so good after war by the British here, we didn’t got enough wood.</span> <span id="s1206">So we were carrying five bricks, three, four, five blocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: This is after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: No, this was before the liberation.</span> <span id="s1209">So some girls got weak.</span> <span id="s1210">I got weak by myself.</span> <span id="s1211">So they let down the bricks.</span> <span id="s1212">You know what they did to them?</span> <span id="s1213">They punished them, they had to put the -- the hand to -- in the back and to carry the bricks in the back.</span> <span id="s1214">And if they wouldn’t able to bring to the place the ba -- there, they punished them, I don’t know them any more and I didn’t -- I didn’t see them any more.</span> <span id="s1215">Okay, this is what.</span> <span id="s1216">Later, they took me to dig trees.</span> <span id="s1217">So I was digging trees with the woods.</span> <span id="s1218">So I was very careful, the wood -- the -- the trees were batti -- 10 me-meters high, eight meters high, very high.</span> <span id="s1219">So sometimes we got SS la -- SS men started -- helped a little bit.</span> <span id="s1220">We got a big stick with a hook to put in the hook in the tree and to pull, but to make to fall [indecipherable] wood.</span> <span id="s1221">But some of them were murders.</span> <span id="s1222">They rushed you, so you forgot that the bu -- that the tree falls [indecipherable] and they -- they killed her.</span> <span id="s1223">So I was careful, I was watching which way the tree is going, so I was standing on the other side.</span> <span id="s1224">And I runned away and I left the stick with the hook in the tree.</span> <span id="s1225">So one time he came over to me and he said, don’t do this again.</span> <span id="s1226">If not I will punish you.</span> <span id="s1227">You must take out the hook before the tree is falling.</span> <span id="s1228">Okay.</span> <span id="s1229">I said danke schoen [indecipherable] okay.</span> <span id="s1230">Later, a few days later we got a nice little bit -- a -- nice trees were prepared and I didn’t know they’re burning over there the bodies [indecipherable] in Bergen-Belsen we didn't got gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1231">But we were putting the trees like this.</span> <span id="s1232">In the middle, we put in the dead bodies.</span> <span id="s1233">So when I passed with the group to work, I saw mens working.</span> <span id="s1234">So one was screaming Lodz [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1235">So old man said Lódz, I said Lódz.</span> <span id="s1236">And he told me the name.</span> <span id="s1237">This was one place what they got the nice ta -- beautiful s -- woolen sweaters.</span> <span id="s1238">Very rich, modern Hassidic people.</span> <span id="s1239">So I asked him if he is, and he said yes.</span> <span id="s1240">When I passed back, he was dead.</span> <span id="s1241">He worked so hard there, okay.</span> <span id="s1242">So later, they piled up the dead people til -- til [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1243">So they got me to bring the dead people closer.</span> <span id="s1244">So they put in blankets -- I had to put in blankets, four girls.</span> <span id="s1245">What I saw, I am falling.</span> <span id="s1246">I -- I-I am fall.</span> <span id="s1247">So I said to the three girls, listen.</span> <span id="s1248">Listen, let’s look around.</span> <span id="s1249">If we will see nobody, run away.</span> <span id="s1250">He is dead anyway.</span> <span id="s1251">So we left the dead body, we runned away.</span> <span id="s1252">But where can I hide?</span> <span id="s1253">Every day they were looking for -- fo-for the girls to carry the dead body to bring there to-to -- to the trees.</span> <span id="s1254">So every time we did the same thing.</span> <span id="s1255">How long we were able to -- how -- not to pick up on, to reach off -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1256">So the -- the blanket got a hole, so he falled out, the dead.</span> <span id="s1257">So we runned away again.</span> <span id="s1258">We couldn’t pick up the dead, we couldn’t do anything, we runned away.</span> <span id="s1259">But we got [indecipherable] after we did [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1260">Later -- yeah, one time I saw a man with a little knife and he cut the muscle from the dead out.</span> <span id="s1261">But I wasn’t smart enough to think he’s gonna eat ous -- this, or to cook, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1262">Later I saw another one, he cut the belly, he took th -- a liver.</span> <span id="s1263">At that time I wasn’t afraid of the dead, I wasn’t afraid of -- of anything, nothing was bothering me.</span> <span id="s1264">Okay.</span> <span id="s1265">After we -- so, we got concentration Bergen-Belsen, a city Bergen-Belsen, a military camp Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1266">So brought us over to the military camp.</span> <span id="s1267">So at least we got showers.</span> <span id="s1268">So one day was for the mens to shower, one day was for the womens and we got sinks to wash a little bit [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1269">And, excuse me, I got diarrhea because I was running to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1270">And a English soldier gave me -- from a can, was very fat, cabbage with th -- with -- with fat, and I ate this and I shouldn’t because I was in sad shape.</span> <span id="s1271">So I got very, very bad diarrhea.</span> <span id="s1272">And I was sitting in the woods and I took three breaks like this and I got a can [indecipherable] was like graham crackers.</span> <span id="s1273">So ge -- ga -- ba -- he gave us in the morning for breakfast two crackers with a little bit chocolate cocoa, but I will tell you what the Jews did to the cocoa.</span> <span id="s1274">The kitchens what they cooked the -- th-the cocoa for us, they didn’t put in this what the English give them, they sold to the Germans for diamonds and for money.</span> <span id="s1275">And for us they give a little bit water.</span> <span id="s1276">The crackers, the two, they had to give us.</span> <span id="s1277">Okay.</span> <span id="s1278">We were marching, because we were starving, later they put out garbage cans, but clean ones, new ones, with meat, with noodles, what this was staying a whole day outside, was mushy, but I didn’t got [indecipherable] I ate.</span> <span id="s1279">But our Jews, listen, it’s not -- it’s good to go to the synagogue, the Jews, not to eat from one plate, on a separate plate that nothing will take the bigger piece.</span> <span id="s1280">The Jews make the [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s1281">Th-the -- the Jews, but they were still a little bit healthier, they walked into the kitchens to work, so they make money, they sold to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1282">They took diamonds and gold and everything.</span> <span id="s1283">The rabbi from England, he took home a whole set with gold and diamonds.</span> <span id="s1284">I wasn’t afraid, when he came in, the doctor, I was very sick.</span> <span id="s1285">So I got luck, a doctor from Holland, a very young man, he was in the army, he came in and he saw I have water a-all over my body.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Where -- where was this now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: In the town of Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: In -- in -- in this -- not town --</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: The military?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: -- in boy -- in the military.</span> <span id="s1292">So he said to me, I will bring pills for the water, but for the iron I don’t have pills in here.</span> <span id="s1293">So I said to him, the Germans runned out on the drugstores, so they emptied the drugstores [indecipherable] the rabbi -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the doctors go to the drugstores to take the leftover what they left.</span> <span id="s1294">He looked at me and he didn’t answer me.</span> <span id="s1295">But he left a note for the blochova.</span> <span id="s1296">Blochova was the leader from the -- from the house.</span> <span id="s1297">She was still in good shape after they were talking about her too, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1298">She was from Pietkow -- a note to give to the rabbi from England.</span> <span id="s1299">Kaplan was the rabbi, he was the army rabbi, to give me a white bread, to give me a little bit milk and a little bit meat.</span> <span id="s1300">So the rabbi came to see me.</span> <span id="s1301">See, he brought for me a piece of meat and a potato, a little bit soup, and he told me, he said listen, this is kosher, this is teah, but no Shochet.</span> <span id="s1302">I said to him, and now I don’t care about anything, I would like to go out from bed.</span> <span id="s1303">If I would be able to walk out from bed, I would help myself.</span> <span id="s1304">So I -- the potato I ate, the soup I drank, but the meat was so dry and hard, like a rock.</span> <span id="s1305">So I said, thank you, Rabbi, I can’t even eat it.</span> <span id="s1306">He said, I’m sorry, I don’t have a grounder, I can’t do anything more.</span> <span id="s1307">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1308">Okay.</span> <span id="s1309">So the doctor came in and he ask me, I said, yes, the rabbi [indecipherable] me a meal, but a meal I can’t eat because the meat is so hard and dry, I couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1310">So he left another note.</span> <span id="s1311">This doctor sent home a prescription to his family -- the war was still going on [indecipherable] for iron pills, and he gave me iron pills what his family sent to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1314">Hoita shtabi.</span> <span id="s1315">Every day I said to him, Doctor, hoita shtabi.</span> <span id="s1316">So I walked in the street when I got a little bit better, I still got what -- I still wa-was bit like this.</span> <span id="s1317">So he walked with friends, he stopped me and he stopped the friends.</span> <span id="s1318">He said to them, this lady said to me every day hoita shtabi.</span> <span id="s1319">Take a look.</span> <span id="s1320">Isn’t she looking good?</span> <span id="s1321">Okay.</span> <span id="s1322">But this way I went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: What does that expression mean that you -- the hoita shtabi, what is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Today I gonna die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: I met a girl and I met my brother’s -- a friend and they were planning to go to Poland to see if we have left over something.</span> <span id="s1327">I said, I will go with you, and I went and I was sick and we traveled two weeks.</span> <span id="s1328">But, in each city we had to go to see, let’s say like in there the [indecipherable] like the mayor.</span> <span id="s1329">So we went in to the mayor and we asked him to give us food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: -- okay.</span> <span id="s1332">So we went in to the mayor.</span> <span id="s1333">We ask people where he is located, they told us, we went to him.</span> <span id="s1334">He gave us food, bread, bologna or salami and -- and not butter, margarine.</span> <span id="s1335">So we walked into a store to try to say [indecipherable] I don’t have.</span> <span id="s1336">So the man said, please go out.</span> <span id="s1337">I gonna check that.</span> <span id="s1338">So she was afraid, she was bringing more than t -- we got on the -- on -- on -- on the piece of paper.</span> <span id="s1339">Okay.</span> <span id="s1340">We finished this, we went to another city again to the -- the mayor.</span> <span id="s1341">So we got food to eat til Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1342">We came into Czechoslovakia, the police took us by the border.</span> <span id="s1343">I saw people with yellow stars and I was like this, he said, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s1344">This is the people what they did to you.</span> <span id="s1345">We put them the yellow stars and give [indecipherable] working, like you.</span> <span id="s1346">Okay.</span> <span id="s1347">So we asked them we would like to come into the city.</span> <span id="s1348">He said no, you can’t come into the city, you have to see a doctor before.</span> <span id="s1349">So I got luck.</span> <span id="s1350">They took me in to a doctor, but he came with a -- two days before from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1351">He saw I am sick and I told him I am going to Poland.</span> <span id="s1352">So I got the wooden shoes, but

<p><span id="s1632">Q: And for how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: I stood til my husband got sick.</span> <span id="s1634">My husba -- I got a good place, I worked on a very -- m-my little son, we didn’t got nothing else to do, my husband was teaching him Hebrew songs, I was teaching him Polish songs.</span> <span id="s1635">He was a cute little boy, I dress him beautiful.</span> <span id="s1636">So the la -- the landlady took us to her summer place to show -- so over there was a man that he was a manager in a factory.</span> <span id="s1637">So they called him, come here [indecipherable] Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1638">So he came over and I said, Maxie, say the four questions from Pesach.</span> <span id="s1639">He said.</span> <span id="s1640">He says, my God, you want a place to work?</span> <span id="s1641">I said, [indecipherable] sure I would like to go because I don’t like to go the je -- the Jewish commi -- Federation every week for the 25 dollars.</span> <span id="s1642">He doesn’t min -- mean that -- he asking me [indecipherable] sleeping with your husband, I lost my head ca -- tell him I’m sleeping in my own bed.</span> <span id="s1643">I said, mine God, what I should do?</span> <span id="s1644">I like to go to work.</span> <span id="s1645">He said, you can go to work from two years.</span> <span id="s1646">But in this factory they got a registered nurse.</span> <span id="s1647">So I had -- I could take my boy to the factory.</span> <span id="s1648">This boss from the factory was a born American man, but his father was a Russian man.</span> <span id="s1649">So this man was so nice to me, a father and a brother can’t be nicer.</span> <span id="s1650">He --</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: Howard Dixtane.</span> <span id="s1653">Scranton Garment is the factory, the name.</span> <span id="s1654">1100 -- 1100 -- I forgot the street name.</span> <span id="s1655">Scranton Garment.</span> <span id="s1656">So he took my little boy to his bedroom because my -- Maxie didn’t like to touch the childrens.</span> <span id="s1657">So I -- I asked him if I can bring the childrens for sleeping on a big bed like this, and he didn't mind.</span> <span id="s1658">So I said [indecipherable] don’t call me mister, call me Howard.</span> <span id="s1659">I said, Howard, I -- my smich -- today my speech is good, but that time you can imagine -- can I bring my carriage for Maxie?</span> <span id="s1660">He said yes.</span> <span id="s1661">So Maxie was sleeping in his carriage, I raised Maxie and I raised Malka in this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: When was Malka born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Malka was born --</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A2: ‘52.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A2: ’52.</span> <span id="s1667">In Scranton, Pennsylvania in a Catholic hos-hospital she was born, yes.</span> <span id="s1668">Later my husband got sick and I still -- I was making nice money from the beginning the man what he took me in, he is dead, but [indecipherable] he gave me such a hard time.</span> <span id="s1669">I told him I can’t sew, I don’t know sewing.</span> <span id="s1670">And this was an electric machine, I never saw an electric machine.</span> <span id="s1671">I took a stop -- I put on round.</span> <span id="s1672">And the girls didn’t know I’m Polish because Scranton is coal mines, most are Polish, so they heard my Polish, so they were friendly to me.</span> <span id="s1673">So he bringed me to bri -- make sleeves, a seam.</span> <span id="s1674">This he showed me, I was able -- but he didn't told me this is coming in shades.</span> <span id="s1675">This was coming one, one, two, two.</span> <span id="s1676">So I took one, two, one, three, one, four, was a -- a picnic.</span> <span id="s1677">90 pair sleeves, til I came blue wi-with navy.</span> <span id="s1678">So I checked with the Polish girl, what I’m doing?</span> <span id="s1679">She said, don’t worry, give the whole 90.</span> <span id="s1680">So the girls ripped apart and they put together, and she said -- they talked Polish, nobody would be able to understand them, but I understood.</span> <span id="s1681">She said, take one, one, two, two, to take there.</span> <span id="s1682">But across me was sitting a girl, she was Italian.</span> <span id="s1683">She looked like Jewish, I was thinking she is Jewish.</span> <span id="s1684">So she was squealing and he came over, he gave me a hard time.</span> <span id="s1685">He said, do you think we making -- we making -- money’s coming from the sky?</span> <span id="s1686">You’re taking 75 cents from nothing?</span> <span id="s1687">I cried.</span> <span id="s1688">So Ho-Howard Dixtane came over and he told the girls in English to tell me he isn’t the boss, he is the boss, not to cry.</span> <span id="s1689">What I gonna tell you?</span> <span id="s1690">In six weeks I received a check for 45 dollars.</span> <span id="s1691">I walked into the office, with my English and I said, 20?</span> <span id="s1692">45?</span> <span id="s1693">She said, Hannah, you maked 45 dollars.</span> <span id="s1694">I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1695">I said 20, I have to receive 20 dollars.</span> <span id="s1696">25.</span> <span id="s1697">Hannah, go home.</span> <span id="s1698">You made 45 dollars.</span> <span id="s1699">So I was thinking, if I’m able to make 45, I will make more.</span> <span id="s1700">So I start to rush.</span> <span id="s1701">I was making 110 dollars in Scranton, Pennsylvania for Howard Dixtane, but my husband -- yeah, and I bought a home by the park.</span> <span id="s1702">My childrens went to the Hebrew day school now and a private school because I didn't like the Polish people to get my childrens to a public.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: What street was your house on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: My house?</span> <span id="s1705">On Vine Street, close to park.</span> <span id="s1706">Beautiful, six apartments.</span> <span id="s1707">We worked very hard.</span> <span id="s1708">Malka was nine years old she was helping us to put floors.</span> <span id="s1709">I maked a beautiful home because my childrens went to the Hebrew day school with rich childrens, so I know they will be ashamed to invite friends, so I built up first a home for them.</span> <span id="s1710">I put carpets wall to wall, we met a friend, not a friend, he was from the same city and I told him I’m working here.</span> <span id="s1711">He said you can come and take furnitures, you will pay off.</span> <span id="s1712">I made it, I did, he put on th-the carpets, I got a beautiful home.</span> <span id="s1713">So little by little my husband got very sick.</span> <span id="s1714">He got -- he got emphysema and -- and asthma.</span> <span id="s1715">He choked.</span> <span id="s1716">And he worked on a place what they got union, he make more money than I did.</span> <span id="s1717">So they send him to -- to Penn State hospital and he got over there a checkup and they said Nathan, if you got a checkup in here there’s nothing wrong.</span> <span id="s1718">But I saw the man is choking, he can’t eat.</span> <span id="s1719">So I got -- we got a -- a doctor, his name is Bornstein, I don’t know if he’s alive.</span> <span id="s1720">His wife was from the same city from what I was.</span> <span id="s1721">A very rich daughter they got fap -- they made beer, how you say it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: A brewer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: She was a rich -- a very rich daughter.</span> <span id="s1724">So he became our friend.</span> <span id="s1725">He didn't took a penny from us.</span> <span id="s1726">So I went over on Saturday and I cried for him.</span> <span id="s1727">I said, Dr. Bornstein, tell me, what should I do?</span> <span id="s1728">He said [indecipherable] Nathan is sick.</span> <span id="s1729">Even I have to report from [indecipherable] you go to California, Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1730">I said, Doctor, I don’t -- I can’t go to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1731">I don’t have the money to buy a -- a nice -- nice section a home.</span> <span id="s1732">I don’t want to bring my childrens to the colla -- pardon me.</span> <span id="s1733">So he said, you know, I am reading now a magazine from Tucson, Arizona.</span> <span id="s1734">Over there you can buy very cheap a nice home.</span> <span id="s1735">I took the -- Maxie.</span> <span id="s1736">I was sitting -- I didn't got -- I didn’t got school in here, but I’m reading and writing [indecipherable] I can see.</span> <span id="s1737">So I call the same agent what I bought from him and he gave me 12,000 dollars on the little house.</span> <span id="s1738">The big one I got sold.</span> <span id="s1739">I said, Nathan, let’s take.</span> <span id="s1740">My husband said no, he’s gonna look for another agent, maybe he will take more.</span> <span id="s1741">I lost 3,000 dollars, I -- but I called back the same, it was a very nice man, he gave me 9,000 dollars, I took the 9,000 dollars, I took -- I bought a station wagon.</span> <span id="s1742">My son got, 16 years old, license and he was driving six days to s -- to Tucson, Arizona.</span> <span id="s1743">I gave them a good time, even I didn’t got the money.</span> <span id="s1744">I spend a few hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s1745">Every night we took another -- how was the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A2: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A2:[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s1752">A: We went to the nicer motels.</span> <span id="s1753">We paid that time 15 dollars a night.</span> <span id="s1754">This was to me, a fortune.</span> <span id="s1755">We took with us, swimming pool.</span> <span id="s1756">My children swing -- were swimming good because we si -- my husband took them to the Jewish community center, I became a member and Malkava got trap -- trof -- trophies from swimming, from jumping, Maxie got trophies from swimming and jumping, they both are good swimmers, thank God.</span> <span id="s1757">My Malka’s two childrens are good swimmers.</span> <span id="s1758">Okay, so I gave them a good time, we traveled six days.</span> <span id="s1759">So they looked fa -- so we bought -- I wa -- they -- we walked into the stores, they picked what they liked and we got in -- on -- on the highways we got tables, and I got a paper tablecloths, and tho -- I pleased them to buy the stuff what they liked and we were eating.</span> <span id="s1760">One day Maxie said, in Holiday Inn is a sale today, you can eat how much you want, I don’t think -- two dollars or three dollars.</span> <span id="s1761">So I walked in with my husband, and I said, listen, it’s not kosher, we wouldn’t eat, let them eat.</span> <span id="s1762">So the two childrens, they got wild.</span> <span id="s1763">They were running back and forth and eating and eating and eating and eating.</span> <span id="s1764">I paid, I don’t know six dollars or five dollar.</span> <span id="s1765">So a man from this place came over to us and he said, so we have kosher salami and we have kosher bologna and you can have something to eat in here.</span> <span id="s1766">So we took bologna and salami the kosher.</span> <span id="s1767">bread, we were eating and I took -- I bought more on the way and they got a good time and we went.</span> <span id="s1768">Later we go -- go -- going to the stores.</span> <span id="s1769">We were going to cities, and the stores, but one time we got a little accident.</span> <span id="s1770">We walked into a little city not far from Tucson, Arizona, but this was only black.</span> <span id="s1771">And we came into a hotel with black [indecipherable] and I was afraid to walk out and I was afraid to stay.</span> <span id="s1772">But I was thinking with my husband, we will sit the whole night and watch wi -- the childrens, we will pay for the night and tomorrow we gonna walk out, but was Saturday.</span> <span id="s1773">But we got so tired we fall asleep too.</span> <span id="s1774">In the morning we pay them and we asked

tire, I think, we stopped in this little city.</span> <span id="s1780">So we got fixed the car and we traveled -- we trave -- [tape break] -- we went to Tucson.</span> <span id="s1781">My Maxie was lonesome for the friends from Scranton, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s1782">He went back to our friend.</span> <span id="s1783">I paid him not much and he finished the high school in Tucson, Arizona.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: What year was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: This was -- who knows?</span> <span id="s1786">Maxie was 16 when he went back.</span></p> <p><span

Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: So he went back and he finished high school.</span> <span id="s1793">So we were residents in Tucson, Arizona, so I got very cheap college, so I bought him to Tucson, he got mad because his friends went to Penn State and he was thinking I gonna send him, but I said, Maxie, I don’t have the money, Daddy’s sick, I’m the supporter.</span> <span id="s1794">Over there I made 110, in here I’m making 50 dollars.</span> <span id="s1795">Is one factory in the whole city, so you ha -- must go here.</span> <span id="s1796">So he got his [indecipherable] here, he was mad, but he went to -- to the university.</span> <span id="s1797">Okay.</span> <span id="s1798">Malka finished the high school in Tucson, Arizona.</span> <span id="s1799">Malka was a honor student, she got a scholarship.</span> <span id="s1800">My son got 20 points from psychology.</span> <span id="s1801">From this he got free from Vietnam, but for spite he didn’t worked in the university like he worked in the high school, so he make B plus, so Malka was fighting with him, she said, don’t you know that Mama’s sick?</span> <span id="s1802">Can’t you make the plus?</span> <span id="s1803">He said, I don’t want to be the best student.</span> <span id="s1804">But anyway, he traveled.</span> <span id="s1805">When he got Bachelor degree, he walked out from the university and he traveled to Europe and he got a friend in Holland.</span> <span id="s1806">The friend went for a doctor there.</span> <span id="s1807">I don’t know why he went to Holland, but he -- yeah, so when he walked out from, the dean of the men called me, he said, Mrs. Kalman, Max walked out and he’s gonna go to Vietnam.</span> <span id="s1808">And Max left Tucson, Arizona.</span> <span

cancer, I got operation that time.</span> <span id="s1811">He said, what I can do, I will do.</span> <span id="s1812">I gonna call up the dean of the men, but this wasn’t enough.</span> <span id="s1813">So th-the -- the first letter was 10 days, tomorrow I got another letter in two days.</span> <span id="s1814">So I announce on the radio, and I look on -- for Max Kalmanowicz all over.</span> <span id="s1815">So he came over, he said, what’s the matter with you people?</span> <span id="s1816">I said, Max, where are you?</span> <span id="s1817">In [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1818">Stay.</span> <span id="s1819">Wait for a man til he will take you to the police, or he will bring the policeman to you.</span> <span id="s1820">Then come with the policeman to Tucson, Arizona.</span> <span id="s1821">If not you’re gonna go to Vietnam, you can -- you can -- you are not able to ha -- to -- to -- to -- to carry a gun.</span> <span id="s1822">He got scared.</span> <span id="s1823">He listened to me, he came to Tucson, Arizona with the policeman.</span> <span id="s1824">But God bless my daughter and my husband, they didn’t tell me, he went to Phoenix, Phoenix is the capital.</span> <span id="s1825">And over there the dean of the men took out from Scranton, his record from the high school and he got the 20 points from psychology, he got free from the army.</span> <span id="s1826">Okay, so later Maxie went back to -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1827">So yo -- he wrote me a letter from Holland.</span> <span id="s1828">He said, Mum, I’m coming back to the university.</span> <span id="s1829">And I s -- I wrote him right away back, he -- I -- I will take maybe some [indecipherable] or what.</span> <span id="s1830">I said listen, don’t make this for me.</span> <span id="s1831">Do this for you.</span> <span id="s1832">If not you’re going to go to a factory like I and Dad, and I don’t want it -- you to go to a factory.</span> <span id="s1833">In our country I wouldn’t go to a factory, I was able to do something else.</span> <span id="s1834">But in here my language and my writing is no good so thank God I found a good factory.</span> <span id="s1835">He came back, he went back to school, he got the second degree, how is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A2: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: Huh?</span> <span

yeah.</span> <span id="s1842">And over there they gave him a job, but was too much for me, 5,000 dollars a year rent and board and clothes.</span> <span id="s1843">So they gave him a job in Bellevue Hospital and he worked with retarded childrens.</span> <span id="s1844">And Malka got married and I left Tucson, Arizona, I sold the house and I moved to Israel because I got to please my husband.</span> <span id="s1845">He said about the States, I gonna stay in -- in America?</span> <span id="s1846">No.</span> <span id="s1847">I’m going to Israel.</span> <span id="s1848">So I sold and I went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: How long did you stay in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: 21 year.</span> <span id="s1851">So Maxie wrote me -- no, sent me a cassette and he said Mama, if you not taking me out from this hospital, I will take -- became retarded like the childrens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: You agreed to come and take him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: So I took my husband, we closed our house -- I got my own house, and we went to s -- to Maxie, to home.</span> <span id="s1854">I come home with the key to try open, the door is open, Maxie’s home.</span> <span id="s1855">Maxie, why you didn’t wait?</span> <span id="s1856">I received a letter from the doctor, but Maxie worked under the doctor.</span> <span id="s1857">And he said Maxie the place is still open, and if you like, come back.</span> <span id="s1858">He didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1859">He -- he changed, he is now making commercials and writing movies.</span> <span id="s1860">But not -- not much money, he isn’t making much money.</span> <span id="s1861">The commercials was good, but 10 years ago.</span> <span id="s1862">And now the big places are closing, so he doesn’t have a day, two days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: And then when did you return from Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Here?</span> <span id="s1865">About three years ago.</span> <span id="s1866">My husband got a heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: So I call my childrens.</span> <span id="s1869">And I was very sick, I was three days in bed.</span> <span id="s1870">He was calling, I wasn’t able to go to the phone.</span> <span id="s1871">My doctor -- they called my doctor, she said to the nurse, go over, take a look what’s happened to Chanka.</span> <span id="s1872">But in the meantime I dressed myself and I walked out and I was afraid to pass the street because I was shaking.</span> <span id="s1873">So I asked a lady, I said, are you crossing this street?</span> <span id="s1874">She said yes.</span> <span id="s1875">She said, are you -- where are you going?</span> <span id="s1876">I said, I’m going to the [indecipherable] such a nice woman, she said, I’m going to the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1877">She saw I can’t walk, so she bring me to the [indecipherable] and in the [indecipherable] we had to wait for our end the line.</span> <span id="s1878">She opened the door and said mis -- Dr. Rosenzeuk, take in this woman because she is sick.</span> <span id="s1879">I brought her in.</span> <span id="s1880">I told her I’m going there, but I brought her in because she -- when she saw me she said, Hannah, the doctor called me.</span> <span id="s1881">So in the meantime my brother died, the same day.</span> <span id="s1882">I said, Maxie, don’t tell nothing to Malka, Malka’s sensitive.</span> <span id="s1883">She came right away because I am in bed and Daddy is in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1884">He said, Mum, I have to send Malka, Herzkel died, I have to go to bury him, because he doesn’t have nobody.</span> <span id="s1885">So Maxie went to New Haven to bury my brother, and Malka to 120, both 120, Malka came the same day.</span> <span id="s1886">She paid 1300 dollars because was no room, she took first class, was only place, and she took a car, was Friday, and she came to me.</span> <span id="s1887">She said, Mama, you’re not alone.</span> <span id="s1888">She said, Mama, I would like to go now I said no, Malka [indecipherable] because now I’m afraid because the highway in both sides are Arabs and I don’t know -- and we don’t know the way, nor we can see a map, nothing.</span> <span id="s1889">Malka, we will have to wait til in the morning.</span> <span id="s1890">So she said, Mama do you have what kind this guy gave you to the stomach, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A2: Vodka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: Not

<span id="s1927">She called up Dr. Maas.</span> <span id="s1928">If she wouldn’t call I would have had to wait a few days.</span> <span id="s1929">And she told -- she called Max back, so she said, take your daddy right away morning -- eight o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1930">Such a good doctor, a good natured doctor you never met in your life.</span> <span id="s1931">A daughter

start a little bit from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2004">Because our people died with the war.</span> <span id="s2005">If somebody would be alive, don’t forget from us, talk from us.</span> <span id="s2006">Even on weddings, all over, if I would be younger, stronger, healthier, I would do.</span> <span id="s2007">My Maxie’s professor from New York, from the new school, asked me -- me -- Maxie, because Maxie took off to bring us from the airport.</span> <span id="s2008">He said, my parents are coming for Israel.</span> <span id="s2009">He said, Max, bring up your parents.</span> <span id="s2010">Let them speak in here because we got a -- a professor [indecipherable] and he said lies.</span> <span id="s2011">I was able to -- to see the lies.</span> <span id="s2012">So he said, my parents are not speaking well English.</span> <span id="s2013">Bring them up.</span> <span id="s2014">My parents are longer than your parents they’re not speaking well English.</span> <span id="s2015">But Maxie begged us, he [indecipherable] us.</span> <span id="s2016">I said, Maxie, I am nervous, I am afraid, I will cry.</span> <span id="s2017">Don’t take me, don’t take me.</span> <span id="s2018">But the professor begged Maxie a few times to bring him down.</span> <span id="s2019">I will tell you another story.</span> <span id="s2020">In Tucson, Arizona, a professor from the university, [indecipherable] was how you saying with a -- with a Reform rabbi -- A2: A discussion.</span> <span id="s2021">Discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: -- a discussion.</span> <span

do the same thing.</span> <span id="s2025">And she got a mother, so her mother watched the childrens, she went to the university.</span> <span id="s2026">She became a laborant -- she was a in labortoium.</span> <span id="s2027">She was from the best [indecipherable] testers.</span> <span id="s2028">So I took her, I said Hannah, your English is better, come with me.</span> <span id="s2029">What I can tell you?</span> <span id="s2030">I stood up with my broken English and I said, you are professor and you not ashamed to bring lies like that?</span> <span id="s2031">He didn't answer, he went [indecipherable] I went over to the rabbi, I said, why you came here, Rabbi?</span> <span id="s2032">Why you came here?</span> <span id="s2033">Can’t you answer?</span> <span id="s2034">The rabbi respect me later like I would be a queen.</span> <span id="s2035">I said, Rabbi, don’t go any more.</span> <span id="s2036">If somebody will come, talk about Israel, send somebody what he knows what’s going on.</span> <span id="s2037">Don’t go any more.</span> <span id="s2038">What can I tell you, a girl was sitting close me.</span> <span id="s2039">She said stop.</span> <span id="s2040">I said, do -- you don’t like it?</span> <span id="s2041">Change your place.</span> <span id="s2042">You like lies, go closer.</span> <span id="s2043">This man had to stop.</span> <span id="s2044">He said such lies.</span> <span id="s2045">Only I can --I-I -- I said, mine God, how can a professor stay and talk to people such dumb like you?</span> <span id="s2046">No, that’s what I told him, with my broken English.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: Is there any message you’d like for your grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: Yes, we are leaving -- my husband made tapes and my daughter will still -- and mine grandson got Bar Mitzvah and I forgot -- I don’t know, my daughter told him.</span> <span id="s2049">I risk my life.</span> <span id="s2050">I told you I worked in the canteen in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2051">And I opened the ki -- the kitchen seven o’clock, I prepared to make the fire, everything.</span> <span id="s2052">So came to me a man.</span> <span id="s2053">He was black like you would paint with black paint.</span> <span id="s2054">This man was wearing smutters on his feet, he didn’t have shoes.</span> <span id="s2055">Was bitter cold, 28 below zero.</span> <span id="s2056">He got a cold with a gargle -- you know what a gargle, but [indecipherable] and he came with a pot.</span> <span id="s2057">I don’t know from where he know the place, and he start to ask me a favor, to give him a little bit soup.</span> <span id="s2058">His wife is laying in bed and his children’s fever’s up.</span> <span id="s2059">He was dead already too.</span> <span id="s2060">He start to bless [indecipherable] I got afraid, because I shouldn’t do this.</span> <span id="s2061">But I filled up the -- the pot and I put in a raw potato, a piece of meat, I don’t -- what I got, and I told him right away [indecipherable] three days this man came seven o’clock and after no more, this man died.</span> <span id="s2062">So on the Bar Mitzvah, God bless my grandson til 120, he talked about me, what I did to this man.</span> <span id="s2063">So my daughter is talking with him, yes, because I didn’t told him.</span> <span id="s2064">Mine husband find a piece of bread from the di -- it was prichis, you know what prichis?</span> <span id="s2065">That’s like an -- you know, from na -- fell down to my husband’s bed a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s2066">So my husband was thinking and thinking, to eat or not, to eat or -- he said, this is somebody else life.</span> <span id="s2067">My husband gave back this piece of bread.</span> <span id="s2068">We told our daughter this.</span> <span id="s2069">My grandson was telling this story on his Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s2070">I risk my life in concentration camp, too.</span> <span id="s2071">I was throwing a onion to them.</span> <span id="s2072">If a SS man would caught me, he would kill me right away.</span> <span id="s2073">Right away.</span> <span id="s2074">I can tell you again, no writer in this world, to me, to read a book from concentration camp is a nothing.</span> <span id="s2075">Only if a man what he was in concentration camp and he was in ghetto from 1939 til 1945, yes, this book you should read, this is true.</span> <span id="s2076">But not all the camps were the same.</span> <span id="s2077">Was worser and a little bit milder.</span> <span id="s2078">I was in the worst.</span> <span id="s2079">I was Auschwitz, I was in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2080">Bergen-Belsen was a camp not to talk.</span> <span id="s2081">Six months, I was six there, at Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2082">How I survived, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2083">My daughter -- my sister died.</span> <span id="s2084">My daughter til 120.</span> <span id="s2085">She died in Sweden.</span> <span id="s2086">So what else you da -- you remind me a little bit because I’m a little, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">Q: No, and just anything else before we close?</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: Ask me about, because I’m a little [indecipherable] not -- not ma -- not myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: Okay, no, well you’ve -- you’ve -- I just want to thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: One thing I will tell you again.</span> <span id="s2091">How many minutes we have?</span> <span id="s2092">Not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Just one or two, just a couple minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: I walked to open the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2095">I saw a little boy with a big tallis, and the little -- was very cold.</span> <span id="s2096">The little boy cried.</span> <span id="s2097">I took from him the tallis because his hands was red like fire.</span> <span id="s2098">And I said, little boy, where are you going with the little tallis.</span> <span id="s2099">He said, th-they shot my mother, they killed my mother in Pabianice, this was very to Lódz.</span> <span id="s2100">I was thinking the little boy doesn’t know what he’s talking.</span> <span id="s2101">I took him with me to the kitchen, because I wa -- and this little boy start to tell us stories, another girl came, another girl came.</span> <span id="s2102">And he said, oh, you don’t know what’s going on in Pabianice.</span> <span id="s2103">They killed all the Jews.</span> <span id="s2104">They killed the j -- th-the -- the children.</span> <span id="s2105">So we start to believe a little bit.</span> <span id="s2106">So in this place where I worked, a man was like not normal.</span> <span id="s2107">He wor-worked with the pot over the head over.</span> <span id="s2108">The only time I said to him, can’t you work like a human being?</span> <span id="s2109">He said, if you would went through what I would, you would be mummashigo.</span> <span id="s2110">I said, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s2111">I was digging a hole and I put in my son alive, and I had to walk away.</span> <span id="s2112">I looked at him, I said, how can be this true?</span> <span id="s2113">You not normal.</span> <span id="s2114">This I said to the man.</span> <span id="s2115">He was not normal, he was not, I can tell you.</span> <span id="s2116">Because to then through thing like this, but I was thinking and sitting and coming home and telling this.</span> <span id="s2117">They said no, this can’t be true, this can’t be true.</span> <span id="s2118">But in a few days later we got the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A2: [indecipherable] people, they could do everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: That’s what the man told me.</span> <span id="s2121">The SS man told me to dig a grave, I dig.</span> <span id="s2122">And he put in my boy, and my boy was screaming, [speaks foreign language] Daddy, why you leaving me?</span> <span id="s2123">The SS man, he was hitting him with the gun, and he wasn’t -- he -- he lost his memory for a few days.</span> <span id="s2124">He didn’t know anything about what’s -- what to happen to him til they brought him to Lódz.</span> <span id="s2125">So this man told me the story, I didn’t believe him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: Well, I want to thank you for taking the time to do thi --</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: Time is nothing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: -- to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: -- I am happy you’re taking things like that.</span> <span id="s2130">And don’t stop working, because the people what they lost their lives in concentration camp, they begged us to tell people what the Germans did to them.</span> <span id="s2131">And we should go on with this, because our generation are dying.</span> <span id="s2132">A day later, a month later.</span> <span id="s2133">We are old.</span> <span id="s2134">We are going.</span> <span id="s2135">The jung jen -- young generation should take over, and not to stop.</span> <span id="s2136">Not to stop.</span> <span id="s2137">History repeats and God forbid if this gonna happen again, and America is going down big anti-Semitism too.</span> <span id="s2138">They have Germans walking around with Hakenkreuzens, I saw it on my own eyes in -- in New York.</span> <span id="s2139">Not to walk out from the houses, what’s hap -- gonna happen in your house.</span> <span id="s2140">No concentration camps, no out, here in my house.</span> <span id="s2141">If they’re gonna kill me, in the house, no walking out.</span> <span id="s2142">[tape break] The people from concentration camp what they died, before they died they said these words, the leftover people, what you gonna be alive, not to forget to talk to the American people, what you went through, how they are died, not to

<span id="s2144">Don’t go out from the houses.</span> <span id="s2145">And please listen to me and to somebody else, because we can find still smarter people from concentration camp, but I have
