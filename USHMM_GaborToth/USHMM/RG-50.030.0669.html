much older were they from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Three years.</span> <span id="s50">There were three years between each of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s52">And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Where was I born?</span> <span id="s54">A place called Gunderstein in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Gunderstein.</span> <span id="s56">And what major city is that closest to?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Oh, it's probably 60 miles from Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s59">Northern Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Northern Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Northern Germany.</span> <span id="s62">And how would you describe your family?</span> <span id="s63">What was your father's occupation?</span> <span id="s64">What was your mother's?</span> <span id="s65">Did you have a large extended family?</span> <span id="s66">Tells us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: I will start with my grandfather, my father's father, who started out as a Jewish peddler with a tray around his neck selling stuff from it, and he walked from what is now Czechoslovakia to Hamburg and established an export/import business and got very rich and very successful.</span> <span id="s68">Fortunately, he died before the Nazis could take away all his money and his houses.</span> <span id="s69">And it was really his money that provided my parents with the money to -- they were school people.</span> <span id="s70">They always had boarding schools.</span> <span id="s71">And they got the money from my grandfather to do it.</span> <span id="s72">My mother was one of the very early physicians and became a psychoanalyst.</span> <span id="s73">She studied with Dr. Freud, and he became friends of the family.</span> <span id="s74">I remember that his daughter, Anna Freud, was also a psychoanalyst, used to come and visit frequently and was a close friend of my mother -- of my mother's.</span> <span id="s75">So that that's how -- then my father had a PhD in Art History, and they decided to go into education.</span> <span id="s76">They believed in what was then a very novel idea and progressive idea that they would have a co-educational boarding school.</span> <span id="s77">And as the school grew, they moved from one place to the other until they finally ended up in aplace called Mariendahl (ph), which was a large school, became a large school.</span> <span id="s78">I went to school there with about 200 students, and the school still exists in --</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: In Gunderstein?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: No, this is in -- it's also in Hamburg, but it's a different place.</span> <span id="s81">Gunderstein was the second school they had, and then Mariendahl was the third one.</span> <span id="s82">After that, of course, the Nazis came in 1933, and my parents were both Jewish, so it was clear that this wasn't going to last very long, and for a while the school continued because we had the Nazi minister of education's daughter in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: So that --</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: What was her name?</span> <span id="s86">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Her father's name was Kerrl, K-E-R-R-L.</span> <span id="s88">I don't remember her name.</span> <span id="s89">I was about 10 or 12 at that time.</span> <span id="s90">And then my mother decided that the Nazis were going to be there for a long time.</span> <span id="s91">Well, my father thought they were just a passing problem.</span> <span id="s92">And we prepared to go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s93">And what is all this growling?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s95">I want to interrupt just for a second.</span> <span id="s96">No, no, no, it's okay.</span> <span id="s97">You can keep the taping going.</span> <span id="s98">Just to say that if there's audio on the tape it has some growling.</span> <span id="s99">We have too lovely poodles who are guarding Mr. Bondy, and we have a choice of whether or not they are in the room and bark, or whether they're here and just have a low-level growl.</span> <span id="s100">So for ambient audio noise, we have preferred the latter choice.</span> <span id="s101">So just to give future people who, you know, future listeners, an idea of why the growling is there; it's friendly growling.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s104">Can we back up just a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: I'd like to find out something.</span> <span id="s107">Do you have an earliest memory, of what you would think would be one of your earliest memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: I was a passionate soccer player, and I remember playing soccer in Germany.</span> <span id="s109">And once the Nazis came in, they decided that Jewish kids couldn't play soccer.</span> <span id="s110">So my earliest, earliest memory is not being allowed to play soccer anymore, which was a great blow to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s112">For any boy, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: {Laughter}</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Tell us a little bit about your home life.</span> <span id="s115">If your mother was a psychoanalyst and your father was, had a PhD in Art History you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: -- and was involved in education, were they at home often?</span> <span id="s118">Did you have a close relationship?</span> <span id="s119">Were you brought up by nannies?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: We were pretty close, but they were running a boarding school, which means that we all lived in one big dormitory.</span> <span id="s121">They had an apartment at one end, and my sisters and I lived at the other end of the corridor.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: And we had a pretty close relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: What was your father like?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: What kind of a personality did your father have?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: It's hard to tell.</span> <span id="s128">He was a very pleasant person, had a lot of friends; very serious about education.</span> <span id="s129">He was very much affected by his service in the first world war.</span> <span id="s130">He was wounded in the first world war.</span> <span id="s131">I guess that's how he met my mother was studying medicine in Vienna.</span> <span id="s132">And he was transferred, and at one point in order to be near her joined what was called the Camel Corps, and I guess it was what is today Palestine.</span> <span id="s133">Of course, one of the problems that comes with being in a boarding school is that you share your parents with a lot of people.</span> <span id="s134">Of course, we didn't know any other -- any -- anything else.</span> <span id="s135">We had a Bavarian -- I guess she wasn't a nurse -- caretaker, who took care of us while they were busy.</span> <span id="s136">All I can remember about her is that she was extremely Catholic, while we were probably extremely nonreligious and, but she was very nice and stayed with us till we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: About the first world war.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: About the first world war, did your father tell you about how he came to be wounded?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: He was an artillery officer, but he very rarely talked about the war.</span> <span id="s141">He talked about meeting my mother and things like that, but did not talk much about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: About his experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: One of his brothers was killed in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: And the two other brothers, who were very successful.</span> <span id="s146">One was called Cacord (ph) who -- I don't know if you're interested in this -- who started a school in Germany for Jewish immigrants, prepare them for emigration.</span> <span id="s147">He was probably wrong because he felt that they should learn carpentry and various other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: I'm listening even as I am handing my colleague the writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: He was -- the school -- he was arrested and put in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: The uncle of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: My uncle, yeah.</span> <span id="s152">And eventually, I don't know how he escaped or was released, and walked across Europe and came to the United States and became a full professor at William and Mary, and then after the war went back to Germany and became the head of the Hamburg University.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Unusual on many counts.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: That's an unusual destiny on many counts.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: You know, very few Jews went back to live in Germany after the war, and to have such a prominent place in the life of a university and the city is --</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I remember that he also when he went back he wrote a -- what you call those columns where you answer people's problems in the newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Oh, sort of an agony aunt.</span> <span id="s160">He would do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yeah, he did that for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Did he enjoy it?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: I guess so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Did you ever read his columns?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">{Laughter from both}</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of how German your family was.</span> <span id="s168">You mentioned just briefly your grandfather had come from Czechoslovakia, which wasn't Czechoslovakia --</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No, it wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: -- until 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Well, where he came from was what's called Bohemia then and was part of the Austrian Empire.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Was he German speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: He was from an German area in Bohemia.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And your mother was from Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: My mother was born in Austria.</span> <span id="s178">She took her medical training in Czechoslovakia and, but she was Jewish and she spoke perfect German.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: And do they see themselves more German than Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Never spoke Jewish.</span> <span id="s181">I never learned Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Never learned Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yiddish, no.</span> <span id="s184">Never spoke anything but German, and later French, and that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Did you -- when the Nazis came to power, you would have been nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: In 1933, I was 9 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: That's young, but would it -- young for the question I'm going to ask, but do you remember your parents having discussions about the Nazis coming to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What was the tone of those discussions?</span> <span id="s190">Did they talk amongst themselves or did they talk to you about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Well, they explained antisemitism, which was a very strange concept to me, partly because I'd been brought up without any religion and didn't really realize that I was Jewish until I was probably ten years old.</span> <span id="s192">They talked about the danger of the Nazis and that they might have to do something about it, leave, or -- and they -- my mother was a psychoanalyst, so they believed in talking to children very openly, and so we pretty much knew by age 10 what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Do you remember how your sisters reacted?</span> <span id="s194">Did you talk amongst the siblings about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: My oldest sister was six years older than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: So she was a teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: And she was much more conscious when we left Germany of leaving her home and leaving her, and she had about the time she was 18, she was engaged to a young man who came with us to America later on, and she started a school</span></p> <p><span id="s198">also, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: What were the other kids in the school like when the Nazis came to power?</span> <span id="s200">Did you feel that in the classroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: The school, they were anti-Nazi and very protective of my parents.</span> <span id="s202">I don't think -- at least that's a long time ago -- I don't think any of them turned out to be Nazis.</span> <span id="s203">I know that one or two joined the SA in order to protect the school, but we didn't really run into Nazis until probably 1935 when the State started appointing teachers to the school, and they were of course Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: You said this was a private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s207">And it was largely funded by the money your grandfather had earned?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Well, yeah, until the school started, and then it was funded by tuition.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s210">And you said he died before his --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: He died before -- I think he died in 1933, which was just the beginning of the Nazi time in Germany, and they did not -- any Jewish push did not start until one or two years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Let's back up a little bit later.</span> <span id="s213">I didn't realize you knew him.</span> <span id="s214">What kind of relationship did you have with your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s216">He died when I was nine or 10.</span> <span id="s217">I knew he had a beautiful house in Hamburg, as we visited occasionally, and my mother's mother -- my original grandfather was blind and died early.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Your maternal grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: My maternal grandfather.</span> <span id="s220">She remarried and eventually died in Theresienstadt, both she and her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Your grandparents, Your step-grandfather and your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: And my grandmother, yeah.</span> <span id="s223">I had -- it was amazing, I had two cousins.</span> <span id="s224">He was a chemist, and she was a social worker.</span> <span id="s225">They went to Theresienstadt for six years, and he survived because he was in charge of delousing, and she survived because she took care of one of her children.</span> <span id="s226">But they told these stories; it always amazed me that every morning she would knock on his window to let him know that she was still alive.</span> <span id="s227">And they came to this country and had a very successful life here.</span> <span id="s228">He came -- he worked for, I forgot what company in Pittsburg, a chemical company, and did very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Was it Dupont?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s231">I didn't hear you.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Was it Dupont?</span> <span id="s233">Was it Dupont?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: No.</span> <span id="s235">No.</span> <span id="s236">It was something, somebody else in Pittsburg, I don't remember the company.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s238">Let's go back then to when your parents become increasingly concerned about that the Nazis have come.</span> <span id="s239">Your father thinks it's passing.</span> <span id="s240">Your mother thinks, no, they're going to be here for a while.</span> <span id="s241">How did things evolve?</span> <span id="s242">How did they develop at the school and in your parents' plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Well, by that time, by 1935, Jews were not allowed to direct schools anymore, and my mother planned that we would go to Switzerland, and there were a lot of Jewish refugees in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s244">And my parents started a school.</span> <span id="s245">It was in a place called Gland, which was about halfway between Geneva and ?</span> <span id="s246">Lausanne?</span> <span id="s247">.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: G-L-O-N?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: G-L-A:-N-D.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Gland.</span> <span id="s251">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Gland.</span> <span id="s253">And in the beginning the school was made up mostly of German refugee kids who had escaped to Switzerland, and the school was quite successful, but we stayed there on the -- three years, and then in 1936 we came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: I'm a little bit confused by the dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: 1938.</span> <span id="s256">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s258">Do you remember anything about your leaving Gunderstein?</span> <span id="s259">Do you remember any details about when you left or how you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: I was two or three years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: No, I meant when you left Germany to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: When I left Germany, yes, we were very worried about getting over the border into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s263">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Did you go by car?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Did you go by car?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: We went by three different cars.</span> <span id="s268">Had very little trouble at the border.</span> <span id="s269">We claimed that we weren't Jewish because they were letting -- I can remember that I was very embarrassed because somebody asked me to take down my pants to prove that I wasn't Jewish, and I was only about 10 or 12, so it was very embarrassing, but probably worth it.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: {Laughter}</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: And we started a school in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: What I'm interested in is the detail of leaving Germany.</span> <span id="s273">Why would it have been three cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: We took some other Jewish students with us, and we thought that the Swiss would be more likely to let us in if there were small groups rather than one --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Larger group?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: -- larger group.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: So it wasn’t three cars in a row?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: No, it wasn’t three cars in a row.</span> <span id="s279">We went at different times across the border.</span> <span id="s280">The Swiss were very anxious in those days about letting too many Jews into the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Were you and your parents and sisters in one car or were you split across the three?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: I was in a car with my father and one sister, and my mother was in a car with another sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: And were you concerned?</span> <span id="s284">Do you remember if you were concerned about whether they'll make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s286">But that was a time of great concern anyway, all the way around.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Did your parents have assets?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Assets?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: They had inherited a fair amount of money from my grandfather, but when you left Germany in those days you were allowed to take a thousand dollars and -- a thousand marks, I guess it was -- and everything else was confiscated.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: So they had inherited money, but did they have a house of their own?</span> <span id="s292">Did they have a building?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: All that was lost.</span> <span id="s294">We had some friends in Switzerland who helped in the beginning until the school got started, but we had almost no money at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s296">And while you were in Switzerland was there discussion of what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Oh, yes, of course, particularly since most of the students were from Germany and had relatives in Germany and relatives in concentration camps, and it was always discussion of what was going on in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Had those students come from your school, your parents' schools, the ones --</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Some of them did.</span> <span id="s300">Some of them were children of people who had come to Switzerland and --</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: And one question that kind of goes back a little bit: Your mother, as a psychoanalyst, did she have her own practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: She never practiced.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: She never practiced?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: She practiced her trade in the school by seeing every child -- hey, stop growling -- she -- she -- the schools really were partly successful because she was there and working with every child --</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Individually?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: -- in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s308">Yeah.</span> <span id="s309">1938, why would your parents decide to leave Switzerland?</span> <span id="s310">It was a safe country.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: There was several reasons.</span> <span id="s312">One is that the Swiss were very dubious about having Germans, and they were sending people back to Germany at the time.</span> <span id="s313">Secondly, our visa had run out, and we were actually very lucky.</span> <span id="s314">In those days if you were Jewish you had a "J" in your German passport, and American immigration laws in those days meant that if you were Jewish it took three or four more years before you could get, while they were perfectly happy to take non-Jewish Germans, and we had a friend at the German Consulate in Geneva who made sure that we had passports without a "J" in it, which gave us an early immigration visa to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s316">I see.</span> <span id="s317">So for all those reasons -- so that when you left, do you remember leaving Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: How did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: We went by car to France and took a ship -- I believe it was ?</span> <span id="s321">La Sauve?</span> <span id="s322">to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Did you speak French at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: I spoke pretty good French then because I'd lived in the French part of Switzerland for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: And who was on this trip?</span> <span id="s326">Was it just your parents and sisters at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: There were two other former students who came with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: And your sister's fiancé?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: And my -- he had already -- he was non-Jewish, and he was able to get a visa for America, so he was already in America by the time we got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Going back to when you were still in Germany and then also in Switzerland, your school had non-Jewish kids in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: But was your social life confined to the people in the school?</span> <span id="s333">Did you have any other contact with Germans, non-Jewish Germans outside of the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s335">Of course, I was very young, but, as I said, I played soccer a lot, and we played other teams from other parts of Germany, and people came in from the area.</span> <span id="s336">There was no prejudice against Jews at the time.</span> <span id="s337">If there was, it was not apparent, and so we had a lot of Germans who would --</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: By the time you leave Europe you're in France --</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Switzerland.</span> <span id="s341">And then you go to France.</span> <span id="s342">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Well, we just drove through and sailed from France.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Did you feel German anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: I didn't.</span> <span id="s346">I think was too young to really feel German.</span> <span id="s347">My sister, my oldest sister felt very much that she had lost her home when she left.</span> <span id="s348">I didn't really.</span> <span id="s349">I never felt particularly German, and having learned French in Switzerland, and so I actually all my life I haven't felt particularly German?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Your language, you know, how you spoke with your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: German.</span> <span id="s353">Until the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Until my sister's children would scream, "English, please," when we were talking German, so that we eventually started talking German.</span> <span id="s355">My parents always had a very strong accent because they'd left when they were already adults, and I guess I had a minimal accent so.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Well, I mean, the value of having another language in the house is the kids never understand what you're saying.</span> <span id="s357">And sometimes that's important.</span> <span id="s358">Where did you come to the United States?</span> <span id="s359">Where did you arrive, and where did you settle and why?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: We arrived at New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: And at first all six of us lived in one hotel room.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Do you remember the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Do you remember where?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I just remember that there were six of us in the hotel room.</span> <span id="s367">{coughs) -- excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s369">Do you want some water?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: No.</span> <span id="s371">I'm all right.</span> <span id="s372">I'll get some in a minute.</span> <span id="s373">And I was -- I was sent to an awful school and didn't like it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Was this in Manhattan?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: I was in -- it was a -- I can't remember what kind of school it was.</span> <span id="s376">I was only there for about six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Was this in Manhattan?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: It was in Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: It was Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: But my parents very soon started a school in Windsor, Vermont.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Aah,</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: The school was called the Windsor Mountain School.</span> <span id="s383">It was called the Windsor Mountain School all the way through until it closed in 1987 or '86, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And how did they come to choose Vermont as the place to have the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: They had various friends, and one of them was a writer named Dorothy Canfield Fisher, who was quite a famous writer at the time, and she lived in Arlington, Vermont, and said there was this place that would be very good for the school.</span> <span id="s386">So we moved to -- the school then eventually moved to Manchester, Vermont, and then to Lenox, Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: To Lenox, Massachusetts?</span> <span id="s388">That's quite a change.</span> <span id="s389">I mean, it's quite a change from city life in New York to, I assume, town life in Vermont.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: We, I guess, were never really invested in New York, and plans were always to move out back into the country, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: So it didn't feel like much of a change?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: It didn't feel like much of a change, huh-uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: What do you remember, and what can you tell and describe about those years right after you came, from 1938 through, through -- we'll come to the time when you become a Ritchie Boy.</span> <span id="s394">But, you know, you're a teenager now, and you have American society.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Well, I went to a local high school because our school wasn't working yet.</span> <span id="s396">Then I went to the Windsor Mountain School for my last two years of high school.</span> <span id="s397">I had a scholarship at a place called Wagner College in Staten Island, but after three months, because I was a German National, they asked me to leave, and through various friends, and because I was a great soccer player, I got accepted at Swarthmore, and I stayed in Swarthmore for four years and graduated from Swarthmore.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: I think much better than Wagner College.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Much better than Wagner College, yes.</span> <span id="s400">And then I was the, I think, the first -- this was after the war of course, and they had to take the veterans.</span> <span id="s401">I got a master's degree at ?</span> <span id="s402">Bridmall?</span> <span id="s403">, which I think I was the first man to get a degree in Bridmall.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: What was your degree in?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Modern European History.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: As a kid, well, sort of a young teenager adolescent coming to American, do you remember your first impressions of what this place was like, what the people were like, what society was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Very hard to remember.</span> <span id="s408">I think I was most worried about learning the language and learning to fit in.</span> <span id="s409">It wasn't that difficult because when the Windsor Mountain School started, there were only about eight students.</span> <span id="s410">It later became much larger, so that we all had sort of a ready-made --</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: But before then you were in this school which wasn't successful for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: I was only there for about six months.</span> <span id="s413">It was a Lutheran school, and it was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: I can't really remember why I hated it, but I think it was regimented it, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Was it strict?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: It was strict, and I didn't think we were learning anything in the classes.</span> <span id="s420">And, of course, by the time I was 15 or 16, I'd been through a fair amount of changes in my life, so that I was probably more conscious of the world around me than the people my age there, and that kind of bothered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Could be very lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: I was lonely, because I didn't speak English very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: This was three months after we arrived in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: You mentioned that your parents had the friend in Vermont who was a well known writer.</span> <span id="s426">Did they have a circle of people already in the United States that were part of a social circle?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: They had, for instance?Tomus Mun?</span> <span id="s428">was a friend of theirs, and various other writers.</span> <span id="s429">One of the first students was the daughter of Karl ?</span> <span id="s430">Sutmeyer?</span> <span id="s431">who was a German writer, and there was a whole group of German and American intellectuals who supported the school and they helped us get going.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Well, it's unusual in many ways because most people who came in the United States didn't have such a circle, and it suggests that -- I don't mean the term in any negative way -- but an elite kind of social circle that had come from Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: It certainly was easier for us than for many other German refugees.</span> <span id="s434">I don't -- you were probably not alive in those days, but there was a very strong antisemetic strain in America at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: And coming from Germany, that was particularly --</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: You felt it?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s439">It was -- it wasn't clear at Swarthmore, which is a Quaker school, and therefore obviously not -- but there was antisemitism in the area where we lived and you could sort of sense it.</span> <span id="s440">Maybe we were overly sensitive about it.</span> <span id="s441">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Well, the question I would have would be, did you remember instances where you could see it?</span> <span id="s443">You know, things like that are very hard --</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Just remarks, but nothing physical or people would talk about kikes or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: They would say such things?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: They would say such things, using those words?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: That's how I learned that word.</span> <span id="s449">It was somebody -- and I can remember asking somebody what does it mean, and they explained it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Yeah, something that at that time was socially acceptable.</span> <span id="s451">No ostracism.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: And it really is a big change in this country from the antisemitism that existed at that time to the pretty much total acceptance that exists now.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Do you remember when you felt that change happen or was it really gradual?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: No, it was gradual.</span> <span id="s455">And, to be honest with you, I never felt particularly Jewish.</span> <span id="s456">The only reason that I would tell people that I was Jewish is that I felt to explain what the Germans did and that I wasn't ashamed of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s457">But most of my life nobody asked, and I was always blond and not particularly looking of any kind of -- so that it never -- in many years it was never mentioned.</span> <span id="s458">I mean, and the fact that we were not religious, of course, made a big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Well, you anticipated one of my questions, which was did what you experience, you know, being Jewish whether, whatever relationship you would have to it, the outside world in Germany certainly, you know, shaped your destiny.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Absolutely, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: And I wondered whether or not you felt more interested in Judaism as a result, where you may not have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Not really?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: My parents were, I guess what was called then free thinkers and had absolutely no religious -- I mean, I don't think I ever heard them talk about God or any kind of religion.</span> <span id="s465">And it wasn't until the Nazis that the Jews became a race, you know.</span> <span id="s466">And so that when I grew up it was a religion.</span> <span id="s467">And since we weren't religious, then it didn't play any part in my life really.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Are there other things that you think are important for someone to know about your early years here in the US as a young teenager going to the school, meeting American kids, being exposed to this different environment?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: When you're young enough you adopt very quickly.</span> <span id="s470">I guess I was 13 or 14 when I came here, and really adopted very fast to -- and of course we all wanted to adopt to the American.</span> <span id="s471">I remember that we made a point of speaking English and not somehow standing out as immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: What kind of contact did your parents have with the relatives who stayed behind in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: We had very few relatives that left behind in Germany.</span> <span id="s474">As I said, my mother's mother died at Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s475">There were -- my mother's brother and his wife fled the Nazis in Austria, and then in Czechoslovakia, and they went to Romania, and then decided they weren't going to run anymore and killed themselves.</span> <span id="s476">They had two adolescent children, two boys, who somehow made their way.</span> <span id="s477">One of them came to this country as a -- he was kind of a language genius and became a professor at ?</span> <span id="s478">Broome?</span> <span id="s479">The other one had a very -- he went from -- he went to England during the war, joined the Czech Air Force, got shot down over Italy, spent two years in a camp, went back to Czechoslovakia after the war, got caught by the</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Oh, my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Who were suspicious of him because he had served in the Czech Air Force.</span> <span id="s483">With the help of Eleanor Roosevelt, Sinclair Lewis, Dorothy Thompson, various other people, we got him out of Czechoslovakia, and he taught at my school for the next 15 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Amazing.</span> <span id="s485">And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: ?</span> <span id="s489">Getivena?</span> <span id="s490">.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: ?</span> <span id="s492">Getivena??</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s494">I think he wrote a book or somebody wrote a book about his very difficult life.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: It certainly sounds that way.</span> <span id="s496">When he was shot down in Italy, he was in an Italian prisoner of war camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: He was in an Italian prison of war camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Which is probably why he survived it.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: That probably was a lot better than a German prisoner of war camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: What did you study at Swarthmore?</span> <span id="s501">What would you graduate in?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: European History.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s504">So your bachelor's --</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Modern History.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: So your bachelor's and your master's were in gold subjects?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s508">I wrote a -- my master thesis was about the Yalta Conference.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Oh, really.</span> <span id="s510">How interesting.</span> <span id="s511">How interesting for lots of reasons.</span> <span id="s512">Why did you choose that?</span> <span id="s513">Why did you choose modern European history?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Well, I guess I was very interested in what was going on in the world.</span> <span id="s515">I had spent, oh, four years in the Army, and that made it even more important for me to know what was going on.</span> <span id="s516">At one point I had wanted to teach modern history, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s518">Now, I'm a little bit confused by chronological.</span> <span id="s519">You arrive in 1938.</span> <span id="s520">Let's say, between '38 and '39, you get settled from New York to Windsor, Vermont.</span> <span id="s521">At that point it's 1939, World War II happens, Poland is invaded.</span> <span id="s522">Your parents set up the school in Vermont.</span> <span id="s523">For two years to go to a local school, and then you finish your high school in, at your own parents' school.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: That would be what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Probably '42 or '43 somewhere around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s528">So your college life is post-war?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Well, I had one year in college before I joined the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: And that was at the Wagner College?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: First, I was half a year at Wagner College and the other half at Swarthmore.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s533">That's was the bridge I wanted to come to.</span> <span id="s534">So you have that half year at Wagner.</span> <span id="s535">You transfer to Swarthmore.</span> <span id="s536">Why don't you finish the college, the full four years at Swarthmore?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: At once?</span> <span id="s541">No, you interrupted it.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: I interrupted it.</span> <span id="s543">I had three and a half years, four years in the Army, and then I went back to Swarthmore.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s545">Why did you interrupt it?</span> <span id="s546">Was it your choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: I was 18, and I loved skiing, and somebody told me if you join the mountain troops you'll do a lot of skiing.</span> <span id="s548">So I volunteered for the mountain troops, which were in a terrible place called Camphill, Colorado, and I spent about eight months there until I was transferred.</span> <span id="s549">I suddenly got orders to transfer to Camp Ritchie.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Tell me, tell me a little bit about those eight months in Colorado.</span> <span id="s551">Why was it terrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: It was cold.</span> <span id="s553">The Army had just started to train mountain troops and didn't really know what they were doing.</span> <span id="s554">The camp itself had probably 100 wood stoves, which gave everybody which stayed -- the smoke stayed in the camp, and we all got rheumatism and various bumps and bruises and --</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: So it was cold and not well heated, not efficiently heated?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Each barrack had a stove at the end that spewed out, was a wood stove, and was not very warm in the barracks, and we never did any skiing.</span> <span id="s557">We hiked a lot with backpacks, and I was very glad to get out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: What I remember from my reading of the US military forces in World War II is that before it had been much more of a professional army, and World War II brought in civilians, and in many ways was a great leveler, or people from totally different backgrounds were thrown together.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: That's correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Did you experience that?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s562">When I first went to the mountain troops, for instance, most of the people were college guys who, people who had started college, wood skiers, and volunteers, and then they didn't get enough people.</span> <span id="s563">And they started send draftees, for instance, from Georgia and various other southern states who were absolutely totally miserable.</span> <span id="s564">I can remember that this one guy, he was a sharp shooter and was very proud of it, but it was so cold that you had to wear gloves, and he refused to wear gloves, and his hands kept freezing to the trigger, and we tried to explain it to him.</span> <span id="s565">But eventually he went to the hospital because he had, was just one of those --</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: It's a detail, but it ends up being very crucial for somebody who was a sharp shooter.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s568">And he couldn't do it without gloves, and he didn't feel he could.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Were you the only one who came from Germany who was in that mountain camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Did you guys talk much about with one another?</span> <span id="s572">Did you get to know one another very well?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Oh, we got to know each other, but at that time I spoke perfect English.</span> <span id="s574">And in those days the Army didn't want any noncitizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Were you a citizen by that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: No, I became a citizen of Leadville, Colorado, which was right near the camp.</span> <span id="s577">And I was -- I guess I was 18 or 19 when I became a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Did it mean something?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Did it mean something when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: I'd been living in the United States for a while, and being in the Army, it was nice to be a citizen, but it wasn't a terribly big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And now you say Camp Ritchie happened.</span> <span id="s583">It sounds like that transfer sort of fell from the sky.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Yes, it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: So someone in the Army must have known your background.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Somebody found out I'm sure, and there were -- when I talked to the people at Ritchie, there were a lot of people like that.</span> <span id="s587">So I was younger than most because many of the German emigrees were older when they came to this country.</span> <span id="s588">They also were suddenly called out.</span> <span id="s589">Somebody in their service records found that they spoke German or French, and so we got transferred to Ritchie.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So now where in Ritchie.</span> <span id="s591">Tell us what Ritchie was, where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Ritchie --</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: As much detail as you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Ritchie was a very strange camp.</span> <span id="s595">It was near Baltimore.</span> <span id="s596">Actually, it was in the Catoctin Mountains, and almost everybody had a different mother tongue than English.</span> <span id="s597">Many of the people were older than I was.</span> <span id="s598">And it was -- we learned how to interrogate prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Well, if you could walk me through a few, some of the details.</span> <span id="s600">Do you remember what it was like when you got there?</span> <span id="s601">Who you first talked to, some of the officials, how they put in one place rather than another place?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: All right.</span> <span id="s603">I don't really remember much of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: It's 50 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Ritchie was more comfortable than the --</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Colorado?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Colorado.</span> <span id="s610">And it was strange because people either spoke French or German or Japanese, and there was relatively rigorous training in how to interrogate people, what not to do, for instance.</span> <span id="s611">In the three years that I interrogated people, I never touched a German prisoner, even when I interrogated a concentration camp guard that you wanted to rip apart with your hands, we never touched them, and I don't think any of the other interrogators ever touched German prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: So that was something that you learned very early on?</span> <span id="s613">That was one of the rules?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Absolute rules.</span> <span id="s615">Don't touch.</span> <span id="s616">You can play whatever intellectual trick you want to play on them to make them talk, but you can't touch them.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Can you remember anything else about that training, how to become an interrogator, a prisoner of war interrogator?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: There are two things: You had to learn the makeup of the German army, what divisions, who was commander, what division, and so on.</span> <span id="s619">And they were very strict about not torturing anybody ever.</span> <span id="s620">I can show you a picture of --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s622">I'd love to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: -- to prove that I was young once.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: {Laughter}</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: That's me.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Where?</span> <span id="s627">Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: (Indicating)</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: These are German prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: So this is when you're already over in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s633">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Now, when you -- okay, so the training lasted how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Eight weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: And what kind of -- do you remember what kind of a feeling you got there?</span> <span id="s637">Were you -- were you enthusiastic about this assignment?</span> <span id="s638">Did you feel it had some particular meaning?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: I thought that I was going to be able to do more -- I felt very strongly, having come from Germany, that it was all -- our views were passivists, that I couldn't let other people do it for me because it didn't, didn't seem right at the time.</span> <span id="s640">So, as I said, I volunteered.</span> <span id="s641">Once we were finished with Ritchey, we were assigned to various divisions as a team.</span> <span id="s642">I was in the 79th Division and stayed with the 79th Division all the way through Europe.</span> <span id="s643">You can see where we went somewhere here.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s645">So can you tell me a little bit about --</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: See.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s648">You were -- it looks here on this map that you come from the English Channel through France.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: We came through the English Channel.</span> <span id="s650">We landed in Normandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: On D-Day?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: D plus 18 hours.</span> <span id="s653">So it was close.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: So was it not even a full day after the first landing?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: No, that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Can you tell me what you saw when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: A lot of dead people.</span> <span id="s658">And I'd never seen dead people before in my life, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: I can't imagine what the feeling -- I would have been scared out of my wits.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: I was.</span> <span id="s661">I was.</span> <span id="s662">Two things.</span> <span id="s663">Two things that I remember very well is crossing the channel.</span> <span id="s664">I was extremely seasick.</span> <span id="s665">It was small boats, a small flat-bottom boat, and I can remember that somebody said there's an German plane that's going to attack us.</span> <span id="s666">I said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s667">I hope it hits us."</span> <span id="s668">I was so seasick, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">{Laughter by both}</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Did you know that you were part of this invasion of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s672">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: When did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: We -- because I was an interrogator by that time, we were informed probably three weeks before the landing what day the landing would be and where we would be landing.</span> <span id="s675">Of course, we weren't allowed to stick our nose out of the camp after that --</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: -- and it was heavily surrounded.</span> <span id="s678">It was in, I think it was in South Hampton.</span> <span id="s679">And so we knew.</span> <span id="s680">And actually the landing was supposed to be a day earlier than the 6th of June, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Hang on just a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">{interview interrupted}</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: This is a continuation of the USHMM interview with Mr. Eric Heinz Bondy.</span> <span id="s684">And we were talking about, about the landing at Normandy and when you learnt of it and how the camp was closed afterwards, presumably to prevent news of this leaking out, and I interrupted you in the middle of you telling me.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: What was I saying?</span> <span id="s686">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: I think it was something about the boat going over.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s689">I was very sea sick on the boat, and the landing itself was kind of traumatic because I had never seen a lot of dead people, and there were a lot of dead Americans, either in the water or on the beach, and that was the beginning of about a year and a half of warfare.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: What happened to you?</span> <span id="s691">What were your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: What were the experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Yeah, after you landed.</span> <span id="s694">What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Oh, we were very busy.</span> <span id="s696">The idea was that German prisoners would talk best if you talked to them within ten minutes of their capture 'cause they were psychologically still traumatized.</span> <span id="s697">So we were very close to the front lines always, and we started right away interrogating prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: So you didn't face combat?</span> <span id="s699">Even though you were close to the front lines, you weren't involved in combat?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Not actually.</span> <span id="s701">We always carried guns and occasionally somebody was shooting at us, and we would shoot back, but we were not combat soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Do you remember the very first person you interrogated?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: No.</span> <span id="s704">I ended up interrogating probably, oh, two or three thousand people over the next two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: So I don't remember them too well.</span> <span id="s707">I can remember that if somebody didn't want to tell me what I wanted to know, I would say, well, see that solider at the door.</span> <span id="s708">He's from Poland.</span> <span id="s709">He just lost his parents in Poland.</span> <span id="s710">Would you rather talk to him or to me?</span> <span id="s711">And they usually would rather talk to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Do you have a memorable interrogation, you know, somebody who, you know, from those 2,000 that you would have interrogated?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: I have to admit that I had pretty strong feelings about the Germans, and particularly ranking officers.</span> <span id="s714">I remember probably -- there was nobody who was really exciting.</span> <span id="s715">There was one general who knew the division commander of the division I was in.</span> <span id="s716">They had somehow gotten together, and he was very upset by the fact that I treated him like everybody else.</span> <span id="s717">And the general came down to say hello to him, but we didn't treat him any better than anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: What can you tell us about those interrogations?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: About the interrogations, about -- you mentioned that your own feelings were pretty strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Well, where I was, the information we were looking for was usually pretty simple, like, what division are you from, what orders did you have to attack, where were you supposed to attack, how many people were there.</span> <span id="s722">I mean, they were all very direct questions connected to the tactical situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Military questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Military questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Do you remember the place where you had your first interrogation?</span> <span id="s726">Was it in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: It was in France, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Was it close to Normandy?</span> <span id="s729">Was it in Normandy?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: It was probably in Normandy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Yeah, did you meet any soldiers your own age?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s735">The Germans by that time had lost a lot of people on the Russian front, and they were drafting 17, 16, sometimes 15 year olds into the Army.</span> <span id="s736">So there were a lot of people younger than I was.</span> <span id="s737">One of the things that we did as an interpreter -- as an interrogator, we were very conscious that the Germans were rank conscious.</span> <span id="s738">And I was allowed to wear any kind of button up to Major, which on an 18-year-old was a little iffy, of course, and we finally settled in the end of wearing US buttons that just said US on the shirt.</span> <span id="s739">It did allow me to go eat in the officers' mess occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: But you say it was because the Germans were rank conscious that you were allowed to wear these buttons.</span> <span id="s741">Did that mean that -- did that mean that in the interrogation situation somebody who would have been higher ranking than you sees this button and then is more likely --</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: More likely to talk.</span> <span id="s743">The US button sort of represented some kind of a special troops to the Germans so that -- but there were Germans when I first started, and it was a corporal who said they wouldn't talk to a corporal; get me a lieutenant; I will talk to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Did they know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Was there any time in the interrogation that you would reveal anything about yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Did you, did you ever interrogate anybody who was close to where you had come from, from Gunderstein or –</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yeah, not really.</span> <span id="s750">I once interrogated somebody who had been at the school in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: You're kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: And -- but that was about as close as I got to --</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: And did they talk about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: They asked about my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: So they knew who you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: I explained to them who I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Were your feelings any different to the 15 and 16 year old than to the higher ranking officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s759">They were all Germans to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: When did the conversation or the interrogation ever touch on what the concentration camps were about?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Most of these people didn't know very much.</span> <span id="s762">They knew they existed, but I did, after the war, spend a short time at Dachau interrogating guards and people there, and it looked just like those pictures that you've seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: So is that what you were referring to earlier when you said you couldn't touch anybody, even if he had been a camp guard and you would have wanted to tear him apart?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: So this was from Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Do you remember the names of the persons THAT you interrogated?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Do you remember the name of any of these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: No.</span> <span id="s772">Do you remember what they were like, the kind of demeanor they had?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Very different, you know.</span> <span id="s774">Hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s775">Some were arrogant Nazis; some were country boys who didn't know any political consequences; some were old-time Army guys who would follow orders no matter what.</span> <span id="s776">So it was a great deal of difference.</span> <span id="s777">Towards the end of war, as I said, they were 16, 17 year olds.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Did this change you?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: The war?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: The experience of having been an interrogator.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: I think that the war probably changed me, yes.</span> <span id="s782">Maybe I grew up a lot quicker than I would have otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: That maybe I was more serious about the things I was doing than I would have been if I'd just been a 21 or a 22 year old in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Did your parents know that this was your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: What did they think of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: They were mostly worried about whether I was going to get hurt or not.</span> <span id="s789">I think that was probably the most concern who had soldiers who were near the front lines.</span> <span id="s790">And one of the problems was that there were no telephones and you had to write e-mail letters.</span> <span id="s791">I had one, which was special.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: I thought I had one, but maybe I don't.</span> <span id="s794">These were e-mails.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: These were -- are these telegrams?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: No, these are letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: V-mails?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Photographed and then sent by e-mail, or whatever the --</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: It says a V-mail, like Victor.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: That's what my parents would be getting.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s802">And it's in English.</span> <span id="s803">And was it this size?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: No, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: That was the original size?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: That was the original size, but it was sent this size, in that size.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: And this is almost like a quarter of an 8 1/2 by 11 piece of paper.</span> <span id="s808">And this is an example of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s811">That's very interesting.</span> <span id="s812">And you have some original documents as well.</span> <span id="s813">I see there are --</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: -- about the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: That’s something about the school.</span> <span id="s817">And that’s a document says I was wounded in action.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: I didn't get in the fox hole quickly enough, and I got hit in the foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s821">And you got a Purple Heart?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: I got a Purple Heart, which I didn't pick up until at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s823">People would -- you had to have a certain number of points to get discharged, and Purple Heart would get you five points, so I made sure that this is -- I made sure that I had this letter to get my five points so that --</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: So you could get discharged?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: -- I could get discharged.</span> <span id="s826">But I spent almost a year after the end of the war in military government in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Couldn't find anybody who wasn't a Nazi to put in charge of, the only people we could find to -- you know, we was supposed to set up governments at various places.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: And the only people we could find were people that had been in concentration camps, and they were often not really ready to run a city, or something like that, so it was difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Where were you based for that year after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Various places in Germany.</span> <span id="s833">You can see on this line.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: So this route that is described on this map of --</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: That's the map that I went through --</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Can I read some of the names?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s839">So this is the route of the 79th Infantry Division, and it looks like that it went from France, down to France to Loutenburg (ph), Luxembourg, Strasbourg.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Well, this was the Battle of the Bulge up here.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Uh-huh, in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: In Belgium was the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s843">We were called up there because there were some American troops that were surrounded at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s845">And there, and you get into Germany through ?</span> <span id="s846">Kothen?</span> <span id="s847">, through Essen, Recklinhausen --</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: -- Mannheim, Winterberg, Alsfeld, Eisenach, which was already East Germany after the war, and then through --</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: To the Czech border, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: -- to the Czech border, Felesenburg, which is already in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: So when you set up the military government, the 79th Infantry Division, you wanted to set up -- where were you based for that year?</span> <span id="s854">Were you in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: We moved around.</span> <span id="s856">This was --</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: This was the route?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: This was after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Uh-huh, that was after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: And we moved around from place to place, and most of the time we went back here and set up military governments in this area.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s862">So that what were talking about is Recklinghausen, Mannheim, Winterberg --</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: That's where the military governments were set up.</span> <span id="s865">That's after the war.</span> <span id="s866">And then the 79th went from those places to Alsfeld, Eisenach, Meiningen, Eisfeld, ?</span> <span id="s867">Sonnebauch?</span> <span id="s868">, ?</span> <span id="s869">Holf?</span> <span id="s870">, Ash, and then Frankenberg.</span> <span id="s871">And it was in this part of Germany that you did -- conducted those interrogations, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Well, the interrogation was conducted all the way along anytime there was a, the division took a prisoner, we would interrogate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s874">So that's through France, through Northern France, Belguim, down towards Strasbourg, back up to Battle of the Bulge?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Right, and then into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: And the Battle of the Bulge, was that where you were wounded?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: No, actually, it was earlier.</span> <span id="s878">It was in July somewhere.</span> <span id="s879">I had a letter in here.</span> <span id="s880">What did I do with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: There's some letters in here, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: That said where I was wounded.</span> <span id="s883">Maybe not.</span> <span id="s884">There it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s886">I certify that I was present when Tech IV, Eric H. Bondy, was wounded in action on July 11th, 1944, in Normandy.</span> <span id="s887">In Normandy.</span> <span id="s888">So it was very soon after landing.</span> <span id="s889">That he was treated in an American evacuation hospital, and the medical doctor in charge authorized the Purple Heart was to be issued to this solider.</span> <span id="s890">And it's signed by Richard H --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Pepi (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Pepi.</span> <span id="s893">So this was very quickly.</span> <span id="s894">Do you remember anything from that incident?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: I remember that I went to the, to some kind of Army hospital, and they sewed it up and put a bandage on it and told me to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">{Laughter}</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: You mentioned that you had come into contact with concentration camp survivors.</span> <span id="s898">Do you remember the first time you saw any concentration camp survivors after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: It was at Dachau after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: How much after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Oh, probably two weeks, three weeks after the Armistice.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s903">So that would have been end of May.</span> <span id="s904">That would have been end of May '45?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Do you have memories of that?</span> <span id="s907">Do you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Of course, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: What can you tell us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: As I said, it looked just like the photographs you have seen, a lot of dead people around, piles of clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: How did you get into Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: How did you -- tell us how you got there, what took to you to Dachau?</span> <span id="s914">Why were you sent there?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: My division was stationed near Dachau, and they needed somebody to help interrogate the guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: So I and another interrogator was sent over there to interrogate the guards and make some recommendation what to do with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: And there was still survivors of the camp in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: There was some still there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Did you speak with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s922">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Did they say anything about those guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: About the guards you were going to interrogate?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yeah, I asked them about the guards, and they said some were good; some were bad, so -- but they were in pretty bad shape.</span> <span id="s927">I mean, by the end of the war the Germans were running out of food, and of course they didn't give any food to the camps, so that many of them were really very badly starved.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: So that -- and then I can remember that I went around and told all the soldiers that were in the camp don't give them too much food; it will kill them.</span> <span id="s930">It will kill them.</span> <span id="s931">Don't give them.</span> <span id="s932">They used to hand them chocolate, which of course was terrible for them, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: And I remember that pretty vividly, trying to tell them.</span> <span id="s935">Most Americans soldiers were very generous that way and wanted to feed them and give them whatever they had.</span> <span id="s936">But it was just very bad for them since they had been starving and --</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: How long did you stay in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Six days, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: And do you remember approximately how many guards you interrogated.</span> <span id="s940">I know it's a tough question.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Oh, I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s942">Maybe 20, 25, 30 of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: These people that you mentioned before --</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Well, they were usually SS guards at the -- there were some -- I guess by the end of the war they had some guards from Latvia and various other occupied countries who swore up and down that they weren't SS, of course, but they were Latvian SS or Bastognian SS, but they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: That's interesting?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: That's interesting.</span> <span id="s948">Was their demeanor any different than the German guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s950">Nix SS Latvian.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: And had any of the prisoners identified them --</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: -- as being particularly cruel or particularly good or --</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Not particularly good.</span> <span id="s955">Nobody was ever particularly good.</span> <span id="s956">They did point out some who were particularly cruel, but a lot of them were just guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Oh, I had another question, and I just lost it.</span> <span id="s958">When you -- going back to the process of interrogation.</span> <span id="s959">After you completed an interrogation, what did you do?</span> <span id="s960">Did you have to write it up and pass it in?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: We wrote it up and passed it to the, either the regimental or division commander, depending on who we were working for at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: And the questions I would assume must have changed by the time you got to those camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Oh, during the war the questions were all tactical.</span> <span id="s964">After the war, we were looking for war crimes and, of course, we had arrested, oh, a lot of sort of Nazis with a rank around Mayia (ph).</span> <span id="s965">And then General Patton decided that the Nazis were just like Republicans and Democrats, and we should let them all go.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s967">Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s968">And did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: That must have been galling.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: That must have been galling.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s974">And I will admit that most of the people I was with cheered when they heard that Patton was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: What else could you tell us about that experience of having interrogated so many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: You know, it's like any other job, after a while --</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: It becomes routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: -- it becomes routine.</span> <span id="s979">And paid special attention to people who might have been war criminals, but the general run-of-the-mill solider, it got to be routine, and you pretty much asked the same thing over and over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Did you catch any people who were, you know, high-ranking who were war criminals?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Occasionally, there were some high ranking SS people who were trying to hide, but usually when that happened we would turn them over to higher authorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: The Ritchie Boys, how many -- when you were with the 79th Division, were they scattered all over amongst various divisions?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: The Ritchie Boys were divided into teams -- one lieutenant, one sergeant, and one corporal.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: And you were part of such a team?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: And I was the corporal on one of the teams.</span> <span id="s986">And each division would be getting one of these teams.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: What was your -- what was your interaction with one another?</span> <span id="s988">Were you all -- did you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: We were always together for a whole year, so two years.</span> <span id="s990">Slept in the same place, and probably got on each others nerves, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Were they also, your team members were they also from Germany?</span> <span id="s992">Did they have a similar background?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: The lieutenant was from Milwaukee.</span> <span id="s994">At the time the Army did not want German refugees or recent refugees from Germany being officers in the Army, so that the lieutenants in the office were usually German speaking or poorly German speaking from places like Milwaukee and the other German --</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Midwest?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: -- or New York, 86th Street, wherever that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: But the enlisted men were usually the refugees.</span> <span id="s999">But they were all -- many of the refugees would come from Germany were older than I was.</span> <span id="s1000">They were 36, 35.</span> <span id="s1001">I remember that the person I was with, the other sergeant was about 35 at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Oh, yeah, I forgot for a minute as you were talking and as we were going through the military process, you were basically a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: You’re basically a kid still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1006">I was—I got in the Army when I was 18, and I guess I got out when I was 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: When you leave Germany -- by the one way, one last question on this.</span> <span id="s1008">Do you remember the name of your teammates, you know, the corporal and the lieutenant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: I knew it about a month ago and then I've forgotten.</span> <span id="s1010">I was at a Ritchie Boy reunion, and I guess both of those guys were dead because nobody knew anything about them, but I can't remember it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Were you part of the film that was made about Ritchie Boys a while ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: No?</span> <span id="s1015">Were you contacted about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: No, I saw the movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: You saw the movie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Oh, my goodness, and nobody had known to contact you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Yes, I actually saw the movie at a Ritchie reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Let me go then to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1022">You -- you leave in 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: 1945, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Were you glad to get out of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1026">I was glad to get out of the Army.</span> <span id="s1027">In fact, I made the mistake of throwing everything away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: In general had it been, aside from the war interrogation --</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Well, I didn't like and don't like the Army system of taking orders from -- you know, you take an order from the next higher up, and very often the people who gave the orders didn't know as much as the people who took them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: {Laughter} That's a common frustration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: When you came back to the states, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: By that time my parents had a school in Manchester, Vermont.</span> <span id="s1034">I very quickly returned to college and went to Swarthmore and spent the next three and a half years there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Did you tell them about what some of your experiences were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: I probably didn't talk about the war for 30 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: I wanted to ask you about that.</span> <span id="s1038">Because in the questionnaire that was sent back it was indicated that you had never been interviewed at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: So that to me tells of a certain reticence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Well, I certainly didn't volunteer to be interviewed, and it was just something so different from what anybody else had experienced, except an veteran, that I just didn't want to talk about it, and then maybe after 30 years I started talking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: To whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: I guess my wife and my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Is she -- does she also -- does she have a similar history to your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: No.</span> <span id="s1046">I was married -- I'm married twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: My first wife was a student at Swarthmore, and her father was the head of the Harvard medical school, and she died of cirrhosis of the liver --</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: -- after we were divorced.</span> <span id="s1051">And I've been married to my current wife for 35, maybe 38 years now.</span> <span id="s1052">She was a teacher at Windsor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: And your son is -- how many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Two sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Two sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: One is the head of a school in Pennsylvania, and the other one is a construction type.</span> <span id="s1057">And grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: And you have grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1059">How many?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Girls, boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Two are adult, and they're 19 and 20 from my oldest son.</span> <span id="s1063">And my youngest son has a -- the two older ones are girls, and the two younger ones are boys, 3 and 8.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Did any of the younger generations then come to you and say tell us about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: My youngest son got interested in what I did during the war, maybe ten years ago.</span> <span id="s1066">But you can't blame them.</span> <span id="s1067">I never talked about it, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: What was your own profession?</span> <span id="s1069">After you finished your masters at Swarthmore, what was your career after that?</span> <span id="s1070">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: I was the headmaster of a co-educational boarding school for 35 years, called the Windsor Mountain School.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: So the same school your parents had founded?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: The school was founded by my parents, yes.</span> <span id="s1074">And then after I came to Washington I was the head of a number of small schools.</span> <span id="s1075">Then I retired when I was 78, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Is there -- have you been back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Once.</span> <span id="s1078">I had -- didn't want to go back to Germany and always avoided going back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1079">They had a ceremony to honor my parents, and I felt I should go to that, so I was back in Germany once.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: At the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: No, it was in -- yeah, it was at the school too, but the ceremony was, I think, in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Is there anything that I did not ask about that you think was important to note?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: We talked so much I can't remember what I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: {Laughter}</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Well, you know, one interview can never capture everything, and I still have a lot of questions about, about the whole experience, the details, the training at Camp Ritchie and, you know, those experiences, but at the same time I realize I'm asking these so many decades later, and it's hard to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: It's very hard to remember, and particularly the war.</span> <span id="s1087">Sometimes I don't know whether I've seen it in the movies or whether I've really experienced it because it's so long ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1089">Yeah, I mean, that's one of the -- that's one of the challenges that we face when we conduct these interviews --</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: -- is that we know that so much time has passed, and so much more is known now than was known at the time.</span> <span id="s1092">But this looks like a very interesting book, the one of the 79th Division.</span> <span id="s1093">Have you had many reunions that you've gone to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: No.</span> <span id="s1095">I just went to -- as I told you, I was not very pleased with the military so for about 15, 20 years I had no contact with any -- you're free to look at the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1097">I will.</span> <span id="s1098">I will.</span> <span id="s1099">Why don't we turn this off.</span> <span id="s1100">Hang on a second.</span> <span id="s1101">I will say this concludes our interview with Mr. Eric Heinz Bondy on August 30th, 2012.</span> <span id="s1102">Thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: You are very well behaved, guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: They were.</span> <span id="s1105">They were very well behaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
