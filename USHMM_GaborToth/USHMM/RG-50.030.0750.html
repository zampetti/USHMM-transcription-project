<span id="s2207">When something start, we used to put it together and – and then in the f – before the declaration of the state, in May 15, ’48, when Ben Gurion said, we became a legal army.</span> <span id="s2208">And the Palmach was almost three – three brigades, organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">Q: And that would be how many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: And we were like

<span id="s2217">Then the Palmach, we got stationed all the road to Jerusalem to secure the [indecipherable] by the last convoy, was by 180 trucks.</span> <span id="s2218">And Colonel Marcus, did you hear about him?</span> <span id="s2219">Colonel Marcus was a American colonel that he went to Israel, he was fighting, and he – he became the commander of Jerusalem area.</span> <span id="s2220">Then we organized the 180 trucks, and we were securing them.</span> <span id="s2221">We brought food, ammunition, water to Jerusalem, because by that time, was about 60,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s2222">And this convoy wouldn’t arrive Jerusalem, Jerusalem would fell.</span> <span id="s2223">People would die from hunger.</span> <span id="s2224">And we got caught, the whole brigade in Jerusalem, and we were fighting there.</span> <span id="s2225">We tried to catch the whole city.</span> <span id="s2226">We caught Katamon, if you heard about this, it’s a big section, we were fighting.</span> <span id="s2227">The Castel(ph).</span> <span id="s2228">Castel(ph) is the big mountain to go to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s2229">We opened the road, and then we si – little by little, we took care on all the – almost all the road, til we opened up the Burma road.</span> <span id="s2230">We were securing the Burma road, because from the beginning we couldn’t get there with – with trucks, with nothing.</span> <span id="s2231">We brought over thousands of people from one side, and on the other side, and people with hammers, wi-with shovels, with everything, made a little pass.</span> <span id="s2232">And used to – one side used to come from tele – Tel Aviv side.</span> <span id="s2233">Trucks with food, with ammunition, whatever we need, and carry on the b – on their backs, on their arms, to the other side, and load the other trucks, go to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s2234">That’s what started Burma road.</span> <span id="s2235">And lit – and we were securing the area, because the Jordanian army was not far away from there.</span> <span id="s2236">And little by little, brought tractors and blew out, and we made a road.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">Q: And you were 17 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2239">Not only I, was a lot of my age.</span> <span id="s2240">And that’s the way we open alternative road to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s2241">And – and we si – were til the first ceasefire.</span> <span id="s2242">The first ceasefire was in – I think in June.</span> <span id="s2243">End of June.</span> <span id="s2244">Was a ceasefire for three weeks.</span> <span id="s2245">Then – now all brigade, they brought us down, we got some replacement because we got about a 180 people – soldier died, in those couple months.</span> <span id="s2246">And we went back in this area after the ceasefire.</span> <span id="s2247">The meantime, it was an embargo.</span> <span id="s2248">But when the British left on May 15th, were boats already waiting outside to come in, with weapons.</span> <span id="s2249">We got a lot of weapons from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s2250">We start to get some cannons, some planes, little by little, we rebuilt, and we start to push the Arabs back.</span> <span id="s2251">When there was the second ceasefire, we were in a different situation because we could bring in everything, just money.</span> <span id="s2252">And with money you know from where it came.</span> <span id="s2253">Who could give the money?</span> <span id="s2254">American Joes.</span> <span id="s2255">And that’s the way we finished the – the war in ’49, til the ceasefire.</span> <span id="s2256">And if they couldn’t kill that time, the Irgun, Bernadotte, if you know who was Bernadotte.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: Familiar, but not quite.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A: Bernadotte was there, from the UN, the head of keep the ceasefire.</span> <span id="s2259">And Lehi killed him in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s2260">We were already ready to attack, take away the West Bank, maybe would take it in three days.</span> <span id="s2261">But because they killed him, the whole war was cancelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: When did you put down your gun?</span> <span id="s2263">When did you put down your gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: Which

when I got married, I got different world, how to make a living, how to build up myself, how to supply for the family everything.</span> <span id="s2293">I didn’t think about this.</span></p> <p><span

Okay.</span> <span id="s2319">I have a couple of – couple of general questions.</span> <span id="s2320">If you could speak to your father today, what would you tell him about your life, about your family?</span> <span id="s2321">What would you want to tell him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: I will tell him the same thing what I’m telling you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2324">You would tell him what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: Same story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2327">That’s speaking to someone who shaped you.</span> <span id="s2328">What would you want to say to somebody who comes after us?</span> <span id="s2329">What would you want them to understand about what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: It’s very hard to – even to think what to say.</span> <span id="s2331">What can I tell them?</span> <span id="s2332">I can tell them my story.</span> <span id="s2333">I can tell them that people should behave a little bit different to us.</span> <span id="s2334">That’s all.</span> <span id="s2335">What can I tell them more?</span> <span id="s2336">That the whole world, even United States, they knew what’s going on in Europe, they knew what the German do to the – not only to the Jews, they killed also five million Poles, and plus other nationality.</span> <span id="s2337">And they knew what’s going on.</span> <span id="s2338">And what they do?</span> <span id="s2339">Did you hear – did you hear somebody give a speech about this?</span> <span id="s2340">Maybe they were too busy with – with their own war, but they should at least say something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: A real abandonment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2343">When I was hiding, I didn’t maybe think about this, I wasn’t maybe enough old to think things like this, but after, I start to think, where all the world was?</span> <span id="s2344">And they had the power to do something.</span> <span id="s2345">Maybe not – maybe if they would threaten Germany that we will wipe you up of the wa – of the war, maybe they would behave a little bit themselves, but they didn’t do nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">Q: You were telling me also earlier that there were young men when you were – you know, when you were still in the ghetto in Mlynov, who went to the Judenrat, and instead of giving the gold to the Germans, the young men were saying, give it to us so that we can get weapons.</span> <span id="s2347">How do you explain that, that the young men wanted this, and the – and the older men, the Judenrat did otherwise?</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">A: I don’t know what to tell you, I just give you the story, what was, the time was witnesses to this.</span> <span id="s2349">They begged to them, give us money, give us something that you give away to the German, we’ll buy some and try to survive.</span> <span id="s2350">Maybe 25 percent would survive, but give us something.</span> <span id="s2351">Let us at least do something, not to go like sheeps to – to the killing area.</span> <span id="s2352">I don’t know, maybe this was the – the – for years the Jews
