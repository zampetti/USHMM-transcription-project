<span id="s11">A: My name is Esthy Adler.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I think I was born in , East Prussia, but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s14">Any of the information that I'm likely to give you I think, but there was nobody close enough to me to corroborate any of the information, so I really am not entirely sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Give us your earliest memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My earliest memories going to seaside place with my parents, which was not too far from where we lived.</span> <span id="s17">My guess is, and speaking to people, I was told that it was probably on the Baltic because is not too far from the Baltic.</span> <span id="s18">That's really my earliest memory that I have of my parents and being there and not wanting to be left there because we had a caretaker with two children, and they were twins, and they were very mischievous and they always tried to play pranks on me, and I never wanted to be left alone there.</span> <span id="s19">So, one of the earliest memories I have is my parents bring me out there and wanting to leave me there and my absolutely refusing to stay without them.</span> <span id="s20">They didn't leave me, actually, they didn't.</span> <span id="s21">So, that's one of my earliest memories I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Do you have any recollection of what they look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Very vague.</span> <span id="s24">I remember my mother.</span> <span id="s25">I seem to remember a dark haired woman rather pale.</span> <span id="s26">My father all I remember is that he wore glasses.</span> <span id="s27">Isn't that strange?</span> <span id="s28">I don't remember much more about him but that he wore glasses.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Were you an only child as far as you remember?</span> <span id="s30">A: Yes, yes, as far as I remember I was an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: What do you remember after that?</span> <span id="s32">Did the war come?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well, I do remember that on one of those trips to our summer place, the sea, I remember being very tense.</span> <span id="s34">I didn't understand clearly, but I understood that there was something going on and that my parents were very tense.</span> <span id="s35">They were trying to leave me there, and I didn't want to stay.</span> <span id="s36">Then I remember that we couldn't go back home.</span> <span id="s37">After that, we just couldn't go back home.</span> <span id="s38">Somehow, we had to go somewhere else, and we ended up going to a town where my mother's sister lived, and we moved into an apartment in the same building.</span> <span id="s39">I remember the language was different.</span> <span id="s40">I remember she had several children including a pair of twins, twin girls, red headed twin girls.</span> <span id="s41">I remember.</span> <span id="s42">Isn't that funny some of the memories one has?</span> <span id="s43">And I remember they spoke a different language and they sort of made fun because I couldn't speak the same language, but it quickly sort of faded because I seemed to have learned enough words to get along.</span> <span id="s44">My guess is is that was in Poland, and that's when I started learning Polish, really.</span> <span id="s45">So, that's some of the earliest memories I have.</span> <span id="s46">Then I have another memory of my mother dying.</span> <span id="s47">I remember she was ill, but very briefly.</span> <span id="s48">I have memories of my mother going out and bringing back donuts, jelly donuts, and I remember hugging her and she had snowflakes on her shoulder and her hair, and that's one of the early memories that I have.</span> <span id="s49">I assume it snowed quite a bit in Poland, so I probably had that experience more than once, but I do remember that.</span> <span id="s50">Then I remember my mother dying June the 9th and my father bringing me over to my aunt's place, which was in the same building only a different apartment, and I remember a great deal of upset in my life as a result of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Were you aware that she had died?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s53">My father told me.</span> <span id="s54">My father came to get me from my aunt's and told me that my mother had left.</span> <span id="s55">I think that's the way he put it.</span> <span id="s56">And that I wasn't going to see her anymore and that I had to be very brave.</span> <span id="s57">And then I remember a woman moving in with us, somebody who took care and cooked for us.</span> <span id="s58">Then still later, I remember my father remarrying, but that's only a vague memory, and I remember my aunt being very disapproving of the marriage.</span> <span id="s59">Apparently he made an unsuitable marriage, and I remember always a lot of talk about it behind closed doors, and as soon as I walked in there would be silence.</span> <span id="s60">I figured there was something wrong with the marriage.</span> <span id="s61">She was very young, the woman he married, and she was a very good looking woman and I suppose that didn't go down too well with my mother's sister and her family.</span> <span id="s62">So, that's some of the earliest -- and then suddenly a great deal of the war started intruding.</span> <span id="s63">I remember being on the street once with my father and Germans marching, and my father was holding on to me in such a tight way that I knew there was something wrong that he was tense.</span> <span id="s64">You know, how you communicate with children that there is something not quite right and he told me to be very quiet, which I was.</span> <span id="s65">I remember the Germans marching and a lot of the people on the street applauding as the Germans marched by.</span> <span id="s66">I remember going back home and there was a very somber atmosphere suddenly and neighbors kept on dropping in and there were meetings late at night.</span> <span id="s67">Sometimes I would hear through the slightly opened door that there were people meeting in the living room, you know, and talking and sort of making plans on what to do.</span> <span id="s68">I knew there was something very menacing going on, but I didn't know exactly what it was.</span> <span id="s69">Then the first inkling how menacing it could be.</span> <span id="s70">We were at dinner one day and I heard an enormous explosion.</span> <span id="s71">The noise, like my heart stopped for a minute.</span> <span id="s72">It was so close and so loud and I was told that that was a bomb that dropped very closely by.</span> <span id="s73">So, that's how it started.</span> <span id="s74">That's how I remember the war really.</span> <span id="s75">Then I remember people organizing themselves in a hiding place, a cellar was made ready for people to go down in case of bombings and in case of raids also by the Germans and the Poles together I assume.</span> <span id="s76">I remember very often being woken up and being asked to dress very quickly and very quietly and everybody was trooping down into the cellar.</span> <span id="s77">After coming out on one of those raids, I wanted to go and see a friend who didn't live in the building but who lived just a couple of streets away, and my father said I couldn't go by myself anymore.</span> <span id="s78">I used to go by myself.</span> <span id="s79">It was just maybe around the corner, a couple streets away.</span> <span id="s80">So, he took me there and we walked over there and suddenly all I saw was a pile of rubble.</span> <span id="s81">Our building was gone, and my friend was gone and everybody in it was gone, and I remember coming back and for the first time feeling very threatened, really threatened, that maybe the same thing was going to happen to our building and to us in the building.</span> <span id="s82">That was a very threatening moment I remember very distinctly.</span> <span id="s83">From the on there was a whole series of raids and bombings which I --it got to a point where I was afraid to go to bed you know, because it was very frightening when it happened at night and I felt if I didn't go to sleep maybe it wouldn't happen, but it just kept on happening.</span> <span id="s84">On one of those raids we all trooped down to the cellar and I remember, there must have been bombs falling all over because the noise was just absolutely deafening.</span> <span id="s85">I remember very distinctly that stay in that cellar because we ran out of food and water.</span> <span id="s86">There were some children, and there was one child who kept on yelling for water.</span> <span id="s87">He sat next to me and that child, that little boy and I remember on one of those occasions when he started yelling his father put his hand on his mouth.</span> <span id="s88">I didn't see it because there was no light, but I could feel his arm and the little boy started struggling and kicking and then he just lay very still.</span> <span id="s89">My father said you have to be very quiet.</span> <span id="s90">You cannot do what he did.</span> <span id="s91">You cannot yell or cry or do anything.</span> <span id="s92">You do exactly as I tell you.</span> <span id="s93">He was telling me that in my ear.</span> <span id="s94">And I really did what my father told me.</span> <span id="s95">I really learned how to be very quiet, because even though I didn't fully understand what it meant I knew it was something final and terrible that had happened to that little boy.</span> <span id="s96">So, I knew that I had to do as my father said.</span> <span id="s97">We stayed in that cellar, and I don't know for how long because one day they just discovered us and they ripped open the doors and they got us all out in German , of course, and it was full of lice.</span> <span id="s98">It was at night and barking dogs and when I hit the air I fainted, so I don't remember what else happened there except when I woke up we were in the country, in barracks.</span> <span id="s99">I was with my step mother and aunt and the two girls, but all the men were gone.</span> <span id="s100">There were only one or two old men and all the other men were gone.</span> <span id="s101">They must have taken them away.</span> <span id="s102">That's the last time I saw my father.</span> <span id="s103">I don't remember ever seeing my father after that.</span> <span id="s104">So, that was the beginning really of most of my memories of war.</span> <span id="s105">That's the way it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Did you ask people what happened to my father?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: You asked but you didn't get answers and I very quickly learned not to ask because it was annoying, and my step mother was very short tempered.</span> <span id="s108">And my aunt did a lot of crying and she had two little girls who were always sort of hanging on to her arms, so there was really nobody I could ask.</span> <span id="s109">There was some other people that I knew vaguely but I didn't know them well enough and I very quickly learned not to ask questions unless I would get an answer immediately I never asked a question again because I knew it was annoying.</span> <span id="s110">Very often they couldn't give me any answers and I was learning not to annoy people.</span> <span id="s111">It was too dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: How old do you think you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I don't know, maybe five, maybe six.</span> <span id="s114">I don't know.</span> <span id="s115">I don't know how old I was.</span> <span id="s116">Q: Did you feel close to anybody after your father left at that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: I was clinging to my aunt, really, because my step mother I hardly knew, and she was not a patient or sort of nurturing kind of person.</span> <span id="s118">She was very distant, so I didn't feel comfortable with her, but I was trying to cling to my aunt, but she had two little girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">So, there was a limit of how much she could really do for me.</span> <span id="s120">So, I was learning very quickly to be alone, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: There were other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: There were some other children of various ages, yes.</span> <span id="s123">Q: Were you friends with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: I didn't know them.</span> <span id="s125">I didn't know those children because I didn't know where they came.</span> <span id="s126">I'm not even sure that many of the people who were with in the cellar survived, because we were there for quite a while.</span> <span id="s127">My guess is a week, no food no water.</span> <span id="s128">That is a long time.</span> <span id="s129">I think probably a lot of the elderly died.</span> <span id="s130">The men were all taken away.</span> <span id="s131">They're weren't that many left, really.</span> <span id="s132">Some of them I knew by sight but I really didn't know them well enough and there weren't that many children in that cellar.</span> <span id="s133">There were my two cousins and that little boy who died and if there were any others I hardly remember them.</span> <span id="s134">I don't.</span> <span id="s135">So there weren't really.</span> <span id="s136">There were other children in that camp, but I didn't know them really.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Tell us about the camp.</span> <span id="s138">What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: It was out in the country.</span> <span id="s140">It was surrounded by fields and trees and it was obviously wheat fields, is that what Poland must have had because that was in Poland.</span> <span id="s141">It must have been wheat fields.</span> <span id="s142">Also, you know, wood and such and there were mostly barns and people were housed very crowded in and every morning the younger women would be marched out at daybreak into the fields to work, and the others were left in the camp.</span> <span id="s143">At night they would come back and we would all congregate on that tree where they would bring out some food.</span> <span id="s144">Everybody went up.</span> <span id="s145">We all had a tin plate or something or wooden plate, even.</span> <span id="s146">I don't remember what it was really and we would get something to drink and some soup and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s147">Then, one day they marched the women out as usual and then instead of leaving us in the barracks, the rest of us, the children and the somewhat elderly, people not well enough to march out, they rounded us and they started marching us to one particular wooded area and when we got there we noticed that there were a few men digging a sort of a deep hole and then they told us all to line up and I noticed that they had machine guns lined up across from us and they opened fire on us.</span> <span id="s148">Then all we did was sort of topple into that hole into that grave.</span> <span id="s149">Those of us who weren't hit, fell anyhow because there were so many bodies milling about and I fell in there, and I must have lost consciousness for a while because when I woke up I started moving and I was sort of on top of bodies and there were other people on top of me and I felt some stickiness and I looked and it was blood.</span> <span id="s150">I wasn't sure if I was alive or dead, but I sort of sat up.</span> <span id="s151">By then there was nobody around, and I sort of climbed out.</span> <span id="s152">It was easy enough to climb out because it was on even ground.</span> <span id="s153">I climbed out and I sort of ran into the woods and I sat down in the bushes.</span> <span id="s154">There was very thick woods and bushes, a real undergrowth, and I sat down there because it was daylight and I figured I couldn't go out into the clearing.</span> <span id="s155">Then I heard a man with a dog coming, one of those big -- and suddenly I looked and there was the man and that huge German shepherd walking towards me and I thought, that's it.</span> <span id="s156">I thought that was the end.</span> <span id="s157">The German shepherd stuck his head in under the branches.</span> <span id="s158">Went like this and stuck his head out and continued with the man.</span> <span id="s159">To this day I don't understand what happened.</span> <span id="s160">I really don't understand because those dogs were really trained to hunt people, and I don't understand what happened, but they passed and I stayed there.</span> <span id="s161">I stayed there until it was dark and then I came back to the barracks to where I stayed with my stepmother and everybody wanted to know what happened because everyone realized what had happened, that something had happened, but they didn't know exactly what, and that particular barrack, you know, most of the people in it were missing and there were a few other barracks where probably some survivors had also gone back, but you didn't run back between barracks once you were into your barrack, so everybody asked me what happened.</span> <span id="s162">Then it was decided, there was one other little girl who had come back.</span> <span id="s163">I didn't even notice her, you know, I didn't even know where she was from, and it was decided that the two of us the next day when the women marched out to the fields that we would stay under the beds and we weren't going to move until they came back at night, and that's what we did.</span> <span id="s164">So, in the morning when everybody left the barracks, by then it was just the working women in the barracks, we too, stayed in the barrack and we stayed under the bed.</span> <span id="s165">I don't think we stayed there too long because shortly afterwards they rounded everybody up at sunset, you know, after they came back from the fields and they started marching the whole group.</span> <span id="s166">All the barracks were rounded up and there were a few children and the children were sort of hidden between women, large skirts covered the children, and I guess they didn't look too closely at the legs to notice that sometimes --.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Were you under the skirts?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Well sort of.</span> <span id="s169">The skirts were sort of wrapped slightly around us, and they marched us to the railroad tracks and they shoved us onto trains and the trains left.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Can we go back for a moment?</span> <span id="s171">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Were you wounded?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s174">I had a wound -- at that particular time I had one wound in the back, one bullet wound in the back.</span> <span id="s175">Later on I got other wounds.</span> <span id="s176">I have about one, two -- I have seven wounds, seven bullet wounds.</span> <span id="s177">That was only one in the back that sort of grazed my back.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Sideways?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Must have been sideways, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: When you walked into the situation and you saw the guns, was there any time for something to go through your head or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: There was no time.</span> <span id="s182">There was no time and there were people sort of falling all over you.</span> <span id="s183">People were yelling and trying to run and you know how it is when people try to run and they don't know in which direction because no matter where they looked they were either standing with rifles or there were machine guns set up, so there was no place to run really.</span> <span id="s184">No, I don't remember realizing what was happening.</span> <span id="s185">All I knew was that I was tumbling into the pit with everybody else.</span> <span id="s186">I didn't really realize what else I could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: When you touched this blood --?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I didn't know if it was mine or if it was somebody elses.</span> <span id="s189">When you are hit by a bullet it doesn't hurt right away, but when it gets cold it gets stiff and it hurts, so my back was bothering me and obviously when they were trying to take my shirt off when I got back to the barracks, it was sticking to my back.</span> <span id="s190">So, I must have had some kind of a bullet wound in the back because I remember it stinging by then I had learned not to yell or cry about anything.</span> <span id="s191">You learn very fast that there's no point in complaining, really.</span> <span id="s192">So, I think I had one of the wounds there, it happened to me in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Did you explain when the women asked you, did you explain what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s195">I don't think anybody believed me about the dog.</span> <span id="s196">I don't think they believed me.</span> <span id="s197">They looked at me in such a peculiar way and one of the women said well I know they have a dog, and I know they walk around with that dog, so there was a dog and I could not have invented him because I don't think I was familiar with German shepherds and I described the dogs.</span> <span id="s198">Except I described him but he had green eyes.</span> <span id="s199">How can he have green eyes?</span> <span id="s200">I saw green eyes.</span> <span id="s201">I don't think a dog has green eyes, really, but I described you know adequately so they that they thought maybe I did see a dog but they couldn't believe that the dog walked right past me and didn't start barking or tearing me a apart.</span> <span id="s202">That was the point, because I think that's what they were trained for.</span> <span id="s203">That was sort of a bizarre episode, that I just stopped talking about it.</span> <span id="s204">I decided I'm not going to -- but it stuck with me really, it really did stick with me that bizarre episode with the dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Were you very hungry in this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: I very often was very hungry, but what I remember most is thirst, always being thirsty and never having enough to drink.</span> <span id="s207">I think at one point I sort of lost my appetite for food except when you know you have a grumbling stomach, but I didn't know really.</span> <span id="s208">I was scared.</span> <span id="s209">I was always full of fear and hunger doesn't always assert itself when you're full of fear.</span> <span id="s210">Yes, I remember times that I was hungry, but not so much hungry as full of fear and very thirsty always.</span> <span id="s211">There was never enough to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Did the women -- I don't know if you remember, did they share their food with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: You mean after this?</span> <span id="s214">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s215">They did.</span> <span id="s216">They would always bring back a piece of bread or something.</span> <span id="s217">They couldn't bring back soup or something because they would have seen them, but they always managed to put a piece of bread in their pocket to bring back a piece of bread for us or something that could be carried unobtrusively.</span> <span id="s218">You know, they couldn't opening carry something because it would have given it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: When were you fed, at night?</span> <span id="s220">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Was there some soup?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: There was some soup or potatoes or something like that or cabbage.</span> <span id="s223">There was very often cabbage and potatoes cooked together in sort of a soupy stuff which they handed out and a piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Did the women there also give you some of what they were given?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Oh, you mean when we were still in the open?</span> <span id="s226">When we were still in the open they gave us some too.</span> <span id="s227">After that supposedly there weren't supposed to be any children or any idle mouths to feed so from then on, no.</span> <span id="s228">But before that carnage, I don't know how else to call it, they did give us some food too, maybe not as much as the women, but we didn't need as much really.</span> <span id="s229">Mostly what I remember is cabbage and potatoes, you know, cooked with some water.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: But in spite of your fear, you were thinking very clearly where to go and what do to?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Oh, yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s232">I had to get out of that pit, that I knew.</span> <span id="s233">I had to wait until it was dark because I didn't feel too comfortable being out in the daylight uncovered.</span> <span id="s234">By then I had already learned that I couldn't be anywhere where I was seen.</span> <span id="s235">I did have the instinct to go back to the barrack where I had been with my stepmother.</span> <span id="s236">That I did.</span> <span id="s237">I always had sort of a very good sense of direction, even in the forest, how to navigate my way and I learned very quickly how to navigate my way through the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Was your stepmother there in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: She had gone out and your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: My aunt was killed with the two girls on that afternoon.</span> <span id="s242">She and my two cousins were killed on that afternoon, and I survived.</span> <span id="s243">Don't ask my why.</span> <span id="s244">It's a lottery definitely, yes, it really is.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Okay, so now they take you out of the camp for transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: We went sort of shoved into a railroad cars and what I remember -- that's a terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">I really want to forget that because it was very crowded.</span> <span id="s248">I don't know how many cars they had and how many people.</span> <span id="s249">I don't even know where they got all those people.</span> <span id="s250">I didn't think there was that many people.</span> <span id="s251">It was very crowded and they really shoved us in.</span> <span id="s252">It was very hot and it stank and it was night, you know, and I was absolutely petrified.</span> <span id="s253">I was petrified then.</span> <span id="s254">When the car stopped and they let us out, there were like search lights and again I could hear the Germans.</span> <span id="s255">I could hear German spoken and dogs barking, lots of dogs barking, and they kept on pushing us, quick, quick , they kept on really pushing us to this side and to that side.</span> <span id="s256">I was so petrified that I don't remember the route that we took from the car.</span> <span id="s257">All I know is that we ended up in another barrack somewhere, but I do remember towers with guards just a little bit off the ground.</span> <span id="s258">The towers just high enough for them to be able to see what was going on and the entrance to the barracks and everywhere else.</span> <span id="s259">We ended up in that barrack.</span> <span id="s260">That other little girl was there too, and my stepmother and her mother.</span> <span id="s261">And then there was a third little girl in the barrack whom I didn't know and her mother and plus assorted other women.</span> <span id="s262">This was the women's camp, and again every morning they would open up the gates to get the women out into the fields, out in the working fields, and we three children were taken to a big shed which had a lot of carriages or not carriages but carts really, farming carts and such and we three girls were told to stay there and not to move from there the whole day until the women came back into the camp, and we did usually.</span> <span id="s263">I don't know for sure, but my guess is that all three of these women, my step mother and the two others were sort of the favorites of the guards very quickly became the favorite because they got privileges and I think the guard who usually patrolled that particular barrack knew that there were three children in there, but they didn't harm us.</span> <span id="s264">We just sort of got used to the routine.</span> <span id="s265">At night they would bring us into the barrack.</span> <span id="s266">The women usually brought some food back for us.</span> <span id="s267">They went somewhere else to eat.</span> <span id="s268">I don't know where.</span> <span id="s269">I never saw the place.</span> <span id="s270">And very early in the morning before they marched out the three of us would just sort of go in the shade, there was path along the barrack was here and there was a path here and we would go along the path to the shed, and we had to just run across another path and into the shed and we felt safe.</span> <span id="s271">One morning the guard appeared at the door and told the women to walk out, and she took one of the little girls by the hand and said you come with me and he told the two of us, me and the other girl, you stay here, don't come with me.</span> <span id="s272">By then we didn't want to stay in the barrack, we thought maybe he was trying to save her and leave us there.</span> <span id="s273">So, we kept on following him and he kept on saying go back, go back.</span> <span id="s274">He was getting angry with us so we sort of crept after him along the barrack and he walked out with that little girl to that path that was between the barrack and the shed and there was a cot and a body was lying on that cot.</span> <span id="s275">It was the other little girl's mother and he took out a gun and he shot the mother and he shot the little girl.</span> <span id="s276">So, the two of us really very quickly ran back to the barrack.</span> <span id="s277">We realized -- we didn't know what had happened, but that night when the women came back, one of the women was the sister of the woman who had been killed with her little girl and she was crying.</span> <span id="s278">She had red eyes, and when she walked out the others were saying that her sister had small pox or something and they didn't want the whole camp or something contagious.</span> <span id="s279">I think it was small pox, because I remember noticing that the little girl had some pimples, so I figured it must be something like that, so they killed both of them to make sure that the rest of the camp didn't get infected.</span> <span id="s280">Why I don't know, you wonder why.</span> <span id="s281">But, from then on, it became even more threatening to be there, you know.</span> <span id="s282">We had sort of gotten used to a little bit to the routine but it became very threatening.</span> <span id="s283">And I was sort of turning more and more inward and to myself.</span> <span id="s284">I spoke very little.</span> <span id="s285">I never complained.</span> <span id="s286">From then on I was just sort of living full of fear.</span> <span id="s287">I remember waking up a couple of nights and seeing there was a candle and they had put a blanket over the door so that it wouldn't show through and they were digging the hole, the women under one of the walls.</span> <span id="s288">And my step mother walked over very angrily told me turn to the wall and don't look.</span> <span id="s289">You haven't seen anything.</span> <span id="s290">That's all she had to say to me, believe me, I didn't see a thing.</span> <span id="s291">What I realized later on was they were digging a hole to go out from under the barrack and since we were surrounded by fields there too, came a night when they woke us up, the two little girls, and the two mothers, my step mother and she and we all made our way under the holes and we were out in the fields and we started running and we walked all night long.</span> <span id="s292">So, from then on, the routine was, we walked at night and we slept during the day in the wooded area.</span> <span id="s293">Food was not often.</span> <span id="s294">Sometimes we would pick up apples so it must have been June, the late summer, it must have been the late summer because I remember also a lot of stubble on the ground where we walked which meant they must have cut the crops already.</span> <span id="s295">Sometimes we would steal something if something was to be stolen and once I remember a peasant, a woman caught us while we were sleeping and the two women started talking to her and asking her for food and they offered her a ring.</span> <span id="s296">One of the women had a ring and they offered her a ring and then she didn't come back and we were sure she was going to go and get the Germans or somebody and we were ready to leave and then she came back with some bread and cold boiled potatoes.</span> <span id="s297">They never tasted so good, so we did get some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">This whole trek was taking place because my step mother had a brother who was in the forest and she was obviously trying to join him so I don't remember chronologically how long that journey took, but eventually we did meet up with that group in the forest, which was a very motley group.</span> <span id="s299">What I remember best was that her brother was very angry that she had a child in tow and it didn't pay to have children around and he tried various means to detach me of the group and dispose of me, but by then I had become very watchful and very clever about avoiding him.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: You mean literally trying to kill you?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Oh, yes, oh he would have definitely disposed of me.</span> <span id="s302">I knew it.</span> <span id="s303">I knew it, so I tried never to be left alone with him anywhere and with a group I knew I was a little safer because he couldn't very well start shooting into the group.</span> <span id="s304">That became my life for a while living in the forest it was full of escaped Jews from various camps.</span> <span id="s305">Incidently later I thought that this camp was Treblinka before they installed the crematorium because the spot was right.</span> <span id="s306">Reading in books and I didn't know it until there was a gathering of Holocaust survivors here in Washington, quite a few years ago, ten years ago, longer than that and there was all kinds of books which Jim picked up, my husband, and reading up on it sure enough Treblinka was to begin with a women's work camp, and then they installed the crematorium, so we must have left the camp, escaped it just before it became really locked up and they started disposing of everybody.</span> <span id="s307">So, we must have just come out, because the area was right, and it was a fairly large women's camp.</span> <span id="s308">I remember that the gatherings of women there.</span> <span id="s309">It was a large camp, so it must have been Treblinka.</span> <span id="s310">It wasn't just another camp like the first one we were at.</span> <span id="s311">So, there we were in the forest and during the summer it was perfectly okay, and there was quite a motley crew in the forest.</span> <span id="s312">They were escaped people from the Russian Army deserters, there were Poles in it, women, children, lots of young women all of them carrying around guns, and armed, which was very strange.</span> <span id="s313">I don't know where they got their guns really and several children.</span> <span id="s314">We lived in the forest and at night they went to raid the farms and they brought food back, so we did have some food in those places really.</span> <span id="s315">Never enough, never enough food and water was always a problem because the Germans were very often hunting us and if they had any suspicion if there was a group in the area they would poison the waters.</span> <span id="s316">So, it was very-- we were told not to drink anyway.</span> <span id="s317">You had to be very cautious where you got your water.</span> <span id="s318">The winter was very rough and they just kept on hunting the groups.</span> <span id="s319">You know you never knew when you were going to be denounced by some people in the area who had been robbed of food or such, and then set upon by the Germans, or the Poles more like it.</span> <span id="s320">There were more Poles than Germans at this point who were doing the hunting.</span> <span id="s321">They were the Poles who were in uniforms, in those black uniforms.</span> <span id="s322">On one of those hunts they kept on driving us like you would hear shots.</span> <span id="s323">You would run in a certain area and they drove us out in a clearing and when we got out in a clearing we realized that they had machine guns set up on three sides of the clearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Then they just opened fire and everybody war running back and forth and back and forth and on that particular hunt my step mother was hit and died.</span> <span id="s325">I saw her die.</span> <span id="s326">I literally saw her die.</span> <span id="s327">For some reason I escaped again.</span> <span id="s328">There weren't too many left of us.</span> <span id="s329">Again, we retreated towards the forest and we stayed put until it was dark, completely dark.</span> <span id="s330">Usually their favorite time of hunting was towards the end of the day.</span> <span id="s331">Then we sort of congregated together.</span> <span id="s332">We couldn't drink because they poisoned the water.</span> <span id="s333">That's when I was really wounded because I had several bullet wounds from that and so did the other little girl.</span> <span id="s334">The other little girl was with us still.</span> <span id="s335">I don't remember any other children left except her and me.</span> <span id="s336">Then they decided, the people who were left, that they had to -- we couldn't stay in the forest the way we were.</span> <span id="s337">We were going to die, so they took both children to different villages and all I remember is that they brought out a peasant, mine was Polish speaking, I don't know what the other one was because I don't know where they took her because some of the villages were Ukrainian speaking villages and some of them were Polish speaking villages.</span> <span id="s338">They told him that he had to take me in and take care of me and if anything happened to me they would lock him and his family in house and burn the whole house down.</span> <span id="s339">And they did that.</span> <span id="s340">They used to do that, so he knew they weren't bluffing.</span> <span id="s341">So, he carried me home and they put me on top of the bread oven.</span> <span id="s342">They would have a bread oven and then around the corner on top there was a little knish like and you could climb into the knish and it was warm.</span> <span id="s343">And I must have been very sick because I remember very little.</span> <span id="s344">I remember waking up and them feeding me some water.</span> <span id="s345">I must have run a very high fever and then they told me at night they would put me there and then they said they couldn't keep me there during the day because they had two boys or three boys even and the neighbors would sometime come in, although not often.</span> <span id="s346">There was very little traffic between the houses and their house was sort of at the edge of the village.</span> <span id="s347">I guess that's one of the reasons they picked that house.</span> <span id="s348">So, they told me he was going to dig a hole in the storage room.</span> <span id="s349">He was going to lift a couple of planks and dig a hole and I would have to be there during the day and then at night they would come and get me and put me on top of that oven to warm me up again.</span> <span id="s350">That whole winter I remember that constant going back and forth between that little hole where I was just sort of reclining.</span> <span id="s351">It was just barely big enough to recline in and at night being taken out.</span> <span id="s352">I was completely stiff, and put on top of that oven to thaw out.</span> <span id="s353">It was pretty cold that place.</span> <span id="s354">I couldn't make any noise either.</span> <span id="s355">I wasn't supposed to make noise because if anybody came around the house they might hear if any noises were coming out of there, so I kept very quiet.</span> <span id="s356">I was sick a lot of the time.</span> <span id="s357">I probably was delirious.</span> <span id="s358">I don't know, but quiet, in a quiet way.</span> <span id="s359">Then, the spring came and the peasants said to me you know during the spring the neighbors come and go and everybody is out in the field and if they know you are here they could easily tell that to somebody.</span> <span id="s360">So, they talked it over it with me.</span> <span id="s361">They were good people, you know.</span> <span id="s362">They really were good people because they really sort of nursed me and they said what I should do is he was going to bring me part way to the next village and then I should walk to the next village.</span> <span id="s363">They were going to provide me with some shoes and clothes.</span> <span id="s364">I didn't have any shoes or clothes by then.</span> <span id="s365">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s366">I suppose they must have cut off my shoe because I had -- and I was going to have some shoes from the boys and they would give me some clothes.</span> <span id="s367">His wife was making me some clothes, and I was going to tell them that I came from that village, from the Polish village and I needed to hire myself out because my family was too poor and could they take me in as a cow hand.</span> <span id="s368">That's what happened.</span> <span id="s369">I walked to the next village, and they hired me as a cow hand.</span> <span id="s370">So, from then, what I remember is spending a lot of time in the fields with the herd, driving the herd in the morning and staying in the field and I was told very precisely which fields they were to graze when because they didn't want them to just ruin the field so you had to drive your cattle to one field, let it graze a certain amount of time and when the sun was at a certain point you drove your cattle to another field and come back at night and they attempted to teach me how to milk the cows which I wasn't too successful at the beginning, but I learned eventually, and assorted chores around the farm, which I did and I stayed on that farm in that Ukrainian speaking village until the war was over.</span> <span id="s371">I remember the Russians coming and being in the village.</span> <span id="s372">Actually the villages were just as happy to get rid of them.</span> <span id="s373">By then the Germans never put food there because they were somewhere else already so you hardly ever saw any Germans.</span> <span id="s374">Nobody was doing any hunting there.</span> <span id="s375">They were such remote villages.</span> <span id="s376">There was no electricity, no sewers, no water, nothing like that there, so they didn't bother.</span> <span id="s377">The safety lay in that they were so remote, those villages.</span> <span id="s378">I remember the Russians coming through, the Russians soldiers being stationed right outside the village and some of the houses.</span> <span id="s379">I remember the guns going and I was told that that's when they had the siege of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s380">You could here the guns, all through the country almost.</span> <span id="s381">They were those big that the Russians drove in.</span> <span id="s382">When they were all gone, that peasant came back and said now you can come back and live with us.</span> <span id="s383">So, I went back to the first village and they were pretty much decided that they were going to keep me.</span> <span id="s384">They had boys and she wanted a girl.</span> <span id="s385">She wanted to teach a girl how to sew.</span> <span id="s386">She needed somebody to help her how to make all the clothes and to spin, and actually I had learned how to spin in the other village during the winter.</span> <span id="s387">I remember one winter when I was taught how to spin and how to sew also and how to weave.</span> <span id="s388">They were completely self sufficient in those villages.</span> <span id="s389">They made all their clothes, all their food, everything.</span> <span id="s390">So, I was with this Polish family and for all I knew that's where I was going to stay for the rest of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: I want to go back to the camp just before the escape.</span> <span id="s392">You had said that you were not so close with your step mother, but clearly she seemed to have wanted to take you with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: I'm not sure really.</span> <span id="s394">She was very young.</span> <span id="s395">I think that one of the reasons she took me with her was because the women in that barrack chose the women with the children to escape.</span> <span id="s396">I think that was her ticket out, really.</span> <span id="s397">I'm not sure she would have been one of the ones who would have been chosen to escape if it hadn't been that she had a child with her.</span> <span id="s398">So, in a way, you know, we were mutually what's the word, necessary to each other.</span> <span id="s399">So, that's why probably she took me with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: But she also knew that her brother was in the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s402">I don't know how she knew it.</span> <span id="s403">I don't know how she knew it.</span> <span id="s404">I have no idea how the information came to her but she knew he was there and we definitely had a destination when we were going.</span> <span id="s405">We weren't just ambling around the countryside.</span> <span id="s406">They tried to walk in a certain direction.</span> <span id="s407">Of course they didn't have maps or anything like that, but my guess was they knew their general direction which they wanted to walk.</span> <span id="s408">And my guess is they might have missed the group a couple of times and then finally met up with the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Now, you said her brother wanted to kill you?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: But there were other children in the group also.</span> <span id="s412">Do you think he didn't want any children there at all or was there something about your presence with his sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: I think it was my presence because I was a burden to him and his sister.</span> <span id="s414">You know, in a group like that you never knew how long you were going to stay with a group and those groups were forming and reforming all the time.</span> <span id="s415">You might leave one group.</span> <span id="s416">There were many of those groups roaming around the countryside and the forest and he didn't know how long he was going to stay with the group and he obviously was going to take his sister and why did he need a child at that point.</span> <span id="s417">I remember them as being very young, both of them.</span> <span id="s418">So, I don't bear grudges.</span> <span id="s419">I understand it.</span> <span id="s420">A child was a burden.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Was this a resistance group as far as you could tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yes, indeed, some of them were resistance because I remember they would go off on missions at night to mines somewhere and to blow up certain point so they were a resistance, definitely.</span> <span id="s423">They were part of the resistance group.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Did you have any particular job in this group, any kind of responsibility as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: I don't think I had a responsibility, but I seemed to acquired a peculiar what do you call it, a peculiar calling.</span> <span id="s426">I seem to have an extra sense of when we were going to have the Germans descend on us in a hunt and I seemed to dream about my mother the night before.</span> <span id="s427">I have talked about it to some people.</span> <span id="s428">It's a ridiculous thing to say that I had a premonition or something but some people interpret it as I probably I had extra good hearing and I could hear maybe hooves of horses or vehicles rolling somewhere and I could feel it because we all slept on the ground obviously.</span> <span id="s429">That probably would trigger a dream where I was in danger and I would always wake up yelling and if I woke up yelling, everybody packed camp.</span> <span id="s430">So, I sort of became the mascot in a way.</span> <span id="s431">You know people who are in danger, whose lives are in danger are extremely superstitious and anything that helps them stay alive they will clutch at.</span> <span id="s432">That wasn't as far fetched as other things when you're trying to stay alive and you really don't know where your next salvation will come with.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Esthy, you were explaining about this dream and your prophetic --?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Powers.</span> <span id="s436">I don't really remember it that accurately, but I think the first time when I woke up, the dream, when I woke up I was yelling because I was frightened and I think the dream was, my mother, whom I knew was dead was chasing me and I didn't want her to catch me, and I was running.</span> <span id="s437">You know how you run in your dream and you're sort of slowed down, and then I realized that I had a scarf, so I took the scarf and I let it float behind me like a sail and I was sort of jumping from stone to stone and floating away while my mother was trying to catch me.</span> <span id="s438">I was running faster and faster and I felt myself falling, and that's when I would wake up yelling.</span> <span id="s439">That happened to me the first time in the camp as far as I can recall.</span> <span id="s440">Of course someone was near me trying to put a hand on my mount to prevent me from yelling, and then everything around the camp was talked about and known.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Wait one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: So, they must have discussed it and they asked me what my dream was.</span> <span id="s443">Somebody came up to ask me.</span> <span id="s444">There was always a leader in a camp, you know, somebody was always a person whom they looked up to this was a man and he came to ask me what I had dreamt and I told him and he sort of listened and didn't say anything and then the next time it happened the woman woke me up, but this time she wasn't trying to stifle my yells.</span> <span id="s445">She just woke me up and I stopped screaming and she went and got the man and he came back and he asked me, and I told him it was the same dream.</span> <span id="s446">So, he left, and very shortly after the order was given to break camp.</span> <span id="s447">Usually an order would come and everyone would start packing up their immediate belongings and we started moving.</span> <span id="s448">And from then on, ovariotomy I had the dream, we packed camp and we moved, so I figured it must have something to do with my dream.</span> <span id="s449">Somebody once asked me whether I wasn't tempted to just sort of give false signals.</span> <span id="s450">And I said absolutely not, believe me.</span> <span id="s451">I wasn't about to test anybody to give false signals because it could have been disastrous and then where would I have been.</span> <span id="s452">I had to depend on the good will of others to survive and this was no way of doing it, so you didn't give false signals.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Did this give you a different place in the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s455">I felt safer.</span> <span id="s456">I felt much safer.</span> <span id="s457">I felt for instance very often at night we went on long marches when we were changing camps and from then on there was always somebody if I was lagging too far behind, somebody would pick me up for a while, sort of carry me around for awhile, carry me on, and then let me down.</span> <span id="s458">Very often before I was afraid I was going to be left behind and from then on I sort of sensed that I wasn't going to be left behind.</span> <span id="s459">I was going to be carried along if I faltered and if I stayed too far behind, which happened some times.</span> <span id="s460">It wasn't intentional, but I was sometimes so exhausted and my feet hurt that I just couldn't walk anymore and I would fall behind, so it was sort of a helping hand that would come along and sometimes even two people would relay themselves and carry me for a little while.</span> <span id="s461">So, my status definitely did change from then on.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: What you didn't describe was how they connected your dream with a raid?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Well, the next day there was a raid.</span> <span id="s464">There was a raid after the first dream, and so the next time they obviously talked to each other and they decided to pack up camp and sure enough there had been a raid on that camp, because they sent back somebody and they found that the water had been poisoned.</span> <span id="s465">They got to test the water from time to time on a dog or an animal they would test it.</span> <span id="s466">There was no other way of testing the water.</span> <span id="s467">They decided there must have been a raid too because the water was poisoned.</span> <span id="s468">So, from then on I became the lightening rod.</span> <span id="s469">Is that the word for it?</span> <span id="s470">If I had the dream they would pack up camp and go.</span> <span id="s471">As I mentioned that before when I checked with somebody the explanation that makes the most sense to me is that I must have had very good hearing, which I did.</span> <span id="s472">I had excellent hearing and eyesight too, that I must have heard some vibrations on the ground.</span> <span id="s473">Horses hooves or carriages being rolled along and that might have set me off that there was danger coming.</span> <span id="s474">When you live with danger, even when you're very young, you often develop an extra sense about when danger is coming and where it's coming from.</span> <span id="s475">You really do, so that must have been my sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: What about clothes in this group.</span> <span id="s477">What were you wearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Rags, whatever you could to keep warm.</span> <span id="s479">Feet were usually -- shoes didn't last very long or if they got wet they got too hard and you couldn't wear them so whatever you had you would wrap around your feet particularly if you had to march around at night because you were going through all kinds of terrain, like fields that had been harvested and where the stalks are very hard to the soles of the feet.</span> <span id="s480">Or pebbles or things like that, so you did the best you could.</span> <span id="s481">You stole clothes.</span> <span id="s482">Very often they steal food, they stole clothes too.</span> <span id="s483">It was very hard to keep warm during the winter.</span> <span id="s484">During the summer you didn't care really what you wore, but during the winter it was very hard to keep warm.</span> <span id="s485">I don't remember ever washing now that I think of it.</span> <span id="s486">We must have washed sometimes, but I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s487">I guess it wasn't very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Do you remember getting thinner and thinner?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: I don't remember noticing.</span> <span id="s490">Probably I did.</span> <span id="s491">Probably I was never very fat, but I don't remember noticing that I got thinner.</span> <span id="s492">No, I never really looked at myself.</span> <span id="s493">You never looked at yourself naked, well maybe I really thought of it I would have looked at the arms, but you tried to keep warm, you know, you try to keep bundled up.</span> <span id="s494">You don't notice whether you're getting thinner or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Was there lice because people weren't clean?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yes, oh yes, absolutely lice.</span> <span id="s497">I'm sure we were all covered with lice.</span> <span id="s498">I remember having lice when I came to France.</span> <span id="s499">They had to shave my head.</span> <span id="s500">They shaved my head completely because I had lice.</span> <span id="s501">I have a funny story to tell you about my shaved head but maybe I will do that later so that we do it chronologically.</span> <span id="s502">Any other questions about that, about the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: When you were caught and they were machine gunning you and you were shot, where were you shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: I have four wounds on my left leg, two bullets.</span> <span id="s505">One entered at a peculiar angle.</span> <span id="s506">One went through the leg and came out the back.</span> <span id="s507">One bullet went into my right breast and came out under my arm and that one must have touched a little bit long because I was spitting blood for a long time, so it must have touched the lung slightly.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: But you were nonetheless able to run and escape this and they didn't chase you?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: No, because they were further away behind the machine guns.</span> <span id="s510">So they weren't chasing because they would have been caught in the machine guns.</span> <span id="s511">They weren't chasing.</span> <span id="s512">They were just sitting behind the machine guns really.</span> <span id="s513">They weren't chasing you.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Nobody had anything to help you with the wounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s516">As a matter of fact, I think they probably must have just put some rags on my legs and my other ones so there wouldn't be a trail of blood when they carried me to the edge of the forest and they had the farmer pick me up.</span> <span id="s517">They must have bandaged it up with rags because it would have been too dangerous to have a trail of blood I suppose.</span> <span id="s518">When you get hit with bullets, you don't feel, unless it hits a bone or something like that, it takes a while for the wound to stiffen up and hurt really.</span> <span id="s519">At the beginning it doesn't hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Do you have any idea about how many people were in the group prior to this machine gunning episode and then how many after?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: It's difficult for me to tell because the group was -- there were people coming and going all the time, new arrivals, people who departed and went outside, and I really didn't have any sense of counting either.</span> <span id="s522">It was a large camp.</span> <span id="s523">There were lots of people, but how many I couldn't tell, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: But obviously afterwards there were enough people that this farmer would take very seriously this threat?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s526">Well, they never knew because usually they would only send two or three people on any raid or on any mission.</span> <span id="s527">You know, they wouldn't send too many people ever so he had no idea how many survivors there were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Were you frightened with this farmer at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: I was too sick to be frightened.</span> <span id="s530">By then I was really sick.</span> <span id="s531">I must have gone into delirious state because I remember very little.</span> <span id="s532">I just remember them feeding me something to drink or a little bit of food, some soup, some potato soup or something.</span> <span id="s533">I couldn't even eat.</span> <span id="s534">I don't remember being frightened because I was beyond that.</span> <span id="s535">I thought I was truly dying.</span> <span id="s536">No.</span> <span id="s537">I wasn't frightened by the peasants.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: How long were you with this particular family before you went --?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Throughout the winter.</span> <span id="s540">I was there through the winter until that following spring when it became dangerous, when they were going to go out into the fields and when the neighbors were going to start dropping in and the boys were going to be in and out, it became too dangerous for me to stay there, so one evening, one night, he took me halfway and then he told me to stay in the fields until day and during the day to walk the rest of the way to the village and then --.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: But you felt kindness from these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s543">I didn't feel that they meant me harm, and I had developed a sense already who meant me harm, but they didn't, so I felt comfortable with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: And the boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: They were wild.</span> <span id="s546">They were wild, the boys, but when I left the boys had never seen me, remember.</span> <span id="s547">I was hidden during the day and I slept at night outside and before day break he would come and put me back in the hole so those boys never saw me until I actually came back from the other village after the war was over.</span> <span id="s548">They never saw me the boys, but I could hear them, you know, and they were wild boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Now was it common for young children to go from village to village this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s551">Sometimes you would have a farm which was particularly impoverished where they couldn't feed all the people that they had in their family and it was quite common for the youngsters to go an hire themselves out as cow herdsmen, whatever you want to call it, and for the older ones to hire themselves out as laborers, so that was not at all uncommon, no.</span> <span id="s552">Nobody thought twice about it.</span> <span id="s553">They told me what name, by what name I was called, and they told me the end name, which I have forgotten since, that I was to tell the people who hired me that I came from that farm, which was their name so it would have been if they wanted to inquire it would have been -- but they never did anyhow because the two villages the Ukrainians never talked to the Polish and the Polish never talked to the Ukrainians, so we were pretty safe that nobody was going to go in to inquire.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Did they give you a picture or anything to take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: No, no, they didn't give me a picture.</span> <span id="s556">I just went and but he used to drop in from time to time to come and see me so they knew that I had somebody to whom I was attached and it was obviously a peasant.</span> <span id="s557">You know, it was obviously a Polish peasant so they never thought twice about it.</span> <span id="s558">Then when the war was over, he came back for me and he said he wanted, would I like to come back and live with his family and I said, "oh" and he said well, mother and I -- I think that's how he called her -- mother and I talked about it and we have the sons but we need a girl.</span> <span id="s559">Would you like to be the girl and I said sure, so I went back with him.</span> <span id="s560">She taught me how to sew.</span> <span id="s561">She liked very much my sewing.</span> <span id="s562">I was a good seamstress, so they were quite pleased with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Were you pleased to go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Oh, yes, I was very interested in what was going on in the farm.</span> <span id="s565">I was fascinated by the seasonal business of the sewing and then the crops were growing and the planting of potatoes and the vegetables and taking care of the livestock and things like that.</span> <span id="s566">I thought it was very fascinating.</span> <span id="s567">I was fascinated also by the fact that they did everything themselves.</span> <span id="s568">Like they made their clothes and they built everything and when it came to the fall they would all slaughter together.</span> <span id="s569">They came to help if they slaughtered a pig or a calf and then what they did with the meat and how they kept if for the winter.</span> <span id="s570">I thought it was very fascinating, so I stayed there and I thought that was going to be my life.</span> <span id="s571">I was still going to be -- obviously my job was going to do a lot of sewing and weaving because I seemed to have a knack for that.</span> <span id="s572">That was going to be my worth.</span> <span id="s573">It beat the camp, let me tell you, so I had no complaints about that, plus the outdoors.</span> <span id="s574">I always loved the outdoors, being out in the open, so that pleased me very much, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: In the Ukrainian village were you still worried because the war was going on but by then did you have a sense that you were pretty safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: I was worried.</span> <span id="s577">I wasn't sure.</span> <span id="s578">I was worried, and life was hard in that Ukrainian village.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">They were violent people.</span> <span id="s580">I never had a chance to see what it was like in the Polish village before because I was always hidden but in the Ukrainian village they were very, very violent like for instance the farm I was on there was a mother and a son and the son when he got drunk he beat up his mother and he would beat up anybody and I learned how to run very fast because I made myself scarce.</span> <span id="s581">They beat up each other and they would get drunk periodically so it was violent.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Were you ever beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No.</span> <span id="s584">He never caught me.</span> <span id="s585">When he was sober he was okay, and I was out in the fields most of the time and I always did what I was told to do so there wasn't really any reason but when he was drunk he could have easily beaten me up, but I was always very scarce.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">I could tell already when he was working himself up to a state of drunkenness where he was going to beat somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Did people talk about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Hardly ever.</span> <span id="s589">Mostly they talked about the daily work and what they were doing, and then while I was there on that farm he got married and that was an enormous event because at Polish wedding, literally it is a Polish wedding.</span> <span id="s590">It takes place a whole week of festivities when there's a Polish wedding.</span> <span id="s591">That was a lot of fun because everybody gets into the act.</span> <span id="s592">So, I was -- but he beat his wife too.</span> <span id="s593">It didn't take too long before he beat his wife.</span> <span id="s594">So, that was sort of interesting and that was a big event and ovariotomy a wedding takes places it's a big event in the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: How was your food intake at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: I ate like the peasants did.</span> <span id="s597">We all ate together.</span> <span id="s598">In the morning there would be mashed potatoes and if we were lucky there would be a little bit of bacon that would have been fried and mixed into the mashed potatoes.</span> <span id="s599">IF there was a little bit of butter milk.</span> <span id="s600">The butter we never had because that was taken maybe once of twice a year and they took butter and eggs you know.</span> <span id="s601">They exchanged it, they bought it with other homes for necessities like plows and things like that, or seed.</span> <span id="s602">It was a very simple diet, but I don't remember being terrifically hungry.</span> <span id="s603">Bread was baked once a week and the bread was stored.</span> <span id="s604">There was always meat from the slaughter that took place in the fall, and it was hung in that storage room.</span> <span id="s605">Bacon and sausages, blood sausages.</span> <span id="s606">A lot of blood sausages, I liked it too, actually.</span> <span id="s607">During the summer there was alot of vegetables.</span> <span id="s608">Cabbage, the potatoes were delicious.</span> <span id="s609">Let's see what else, there was a white cheese which they made in the cloth from he butter milk which was very good, which mixed with potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Everything was mixed with potatoes.</span> <span id="s611">Every once in a while a chicken died.</span> <span id="s612">I killed one once unintentionally.</span> <span id="s613">You had the chicken for the eggs so you often didn't kill the chickens but when a chicken wanted to sit on the eggs, the farmers lady would say to me just don't get in cold water for a little while, it will stop sitting on the eggs.</span> <span id="s614">Well I dunked it a little too much and the poor chicken just you know got too much of a dunking so we cooked the chicken of course.</span> <span id="s615">Somebody asked me once, didn't you kill another one.</span> <span id="s616">I don't think that would have went over too well if I had killed another chicken.</span> <span id="s617">So, every once in a while there was some foul.</span> <span id="s618">A lot of meat from the pig.</span> <span id="s619">They mostly killed pigs.</span> <span id="s620">They didn't kill calves because they needed them for the dairy products.</span> <span id="s621">I don't remember any lambs at all on that farm.</span> <span id="s622">There must have been farms that had lambs, but not in that particular village.</span> <span id="s623">It was mostly cattle, cows and poultry.</span> <span id="s624">Hens, and geese and such.</span> <span id="s625">They would make a goose for Christmas.</span> <span id="s626">They would do that.</span> <span id="s627">The food was skimpy but enough to keep you healthy.</span> <span id="s628">I think people now a days would approve of a diet like that.</span> <span id="s629">They grew a lot of fruit in that part of Poland.</span> <span id="s630">There were apple trees and pear trees, small ones, the fruit was never large, but it was quite good, and cherries, yes, that's the main fruits that they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: You weren't thirsty anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: No, water, there was plenty of water there and everybody drank water.</span> <span id="s633">You drank something called , I believe, which was made from cabbage which had a slightly fermented tasted almost like apple cider only it was much sourer than apple cider.</span> <span id="s634">Lots of cabbage.</span> <span id="s635">We had lots of beats, lots of beats, lots of cabbage.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Did you play at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: No.</span> <span id="s638">How could you play?</span> <span id="s639">No, there was no time.</span> <span id="s640">Except I could sit.</span> <span id="s641">I could sit in the fields when I was watching the herds and the playing consisted of watching what was going on in a stream or birds, watching birds.</span> <span id="s642">I loved to watch the birds.</span> <span id="s643">Playing, there was nothing to play with really.</span> <span id="s644">What would one play with.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Were there other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: No.</span> <span id="s647">Because all the herds were kept separately and they would never graze together because each one of them had their plots and they would graze separately.</span> <span id="s648">They would not graze together.</span> <span id="s649">There were children in the village, but and sometimes they ran in a pack but I don't ever remember playing with them.</span> <span id="s650">I think part of the reason might have been that they thought I was Polish and they were Ukrainian, so that was already it created a distance.</span> <span id="s651">They did not like each other, so they pretty much let me alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Did you think about particular thing when you were sitting there watching the herd, about what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: I kept on wondering about some of the people where they were.</span> <span id="s654">That, I kept on wondering, where are these people now.</span> <span id="s655">That's mainly what I was thinking about.</span> <span id="s656">Very often I was also very tired.</span> <span id="s657">You know you get up very early.</span> <span id="s658">You get up before the sun's up to get the herd out and when you come back and you have to do other chores, by the time you are -- during the day I was always tired.</span> <span id="s659">It took me a while to wake up.</span> <span id="s660">I would be out there, and it was cold also, and the June there was a slight frost even in the summer, on the grass.</span> <span id="s661">I spent a great deal of energy and thought on how to keep warm because I always seemed to be freezing in the morning.</span> <span id="s662">I never had the right clothes for that, and I never had the right shoes.</span> <span id="s663">So, I would always try to figure out how to keep warm, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Did you remain having dreams about your mother or did they stop after the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: They stopped after that.</span> <span id="s666">They did stop after that, yes.</span> <span id="s667">I don't remember after that.</span> <span id="s668">From time to time I had them later on.</span> <span id="s669">Usually when I was in danger.</span> <span id="s670">When I felt myself in danger, I would have that dream, it would come back but usually it was because I was in danger in one way or another.</span> <span id="s671">Strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: So, then he brings you back to the farm and you think this is going to be --?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s674">Then I got to know the boys who were very rowdy and I was sort of very sedate.</span> <span id="s675">And the mother used to always protect me.</span> <span id="s676">If they chased me too much I would always go and hide behind her and she would make a game of that.</span> <span id="s677">She like that.</span> <span id="s678">She liked having a girl.</span> <span id="s679">And I thought that was going to be my life and it wasn't so bad, really.</span> <span id="s680">So, I was there, and one day I came in and there was a couple, a man and a woman and the peasant said to me that they were people who had come they wanted to take me away and I said why.</span> <span id="s681">So, they started explaining to me that they were Jewish people and they thought that they wanted to pick up all the Jewish children who were hidden in the countryside.</span> <span id="s682">They I remember they mentioned money that they would give some money and the peasant got angry and he said we don't want money.</span> <span id="s683">We want to keep her.</span> <span id="s684">By then I had been baptized and I had been given a little bit of catechism whatever you could get orally because I couldn't read or write, nor could they for that matter, probably.</span> <span id="s685">Everybody got it the same way.</span> <span id="s686">I was going to church with them on Sundays, and I did not want to go back to the Jews.</span> <span id="s687">I felt I really was catholic and for some reason I felt like the Jews were really the ones who killed Christ, so I wasn't going to get mixed up with the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: And you had no recollection of coming from Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: No.</span> <span id="s690">I probably came from a non practicing home and that is why I have no recollection of anything.</span> <span id="s691">So, I don't remember how it ended but they left those people and the next thing I know we were working in the fields.</span> <span id="s692">By then you know the spring was really advancing and we were working in the fields and I liked to feed the chickens so I was always sent back to the house and I would feed the chickens.</span> <span id="s693">I started feeding the chickens an I hear a car drove up and here that man and that woman and she jumps down and she grabs me and she pushes me into the cart and off they ride with me.</span> <span id="s694">I look back and the last picture I see is the peasants running after them shaking their fists and they drove off with me.</span> <span id="s695">So, I was pretty miserable.</span> <span id="s696">I really felt miserable and they drove me to a town somewhere.</span> <span id="s697">I don't remember much about the town except for some reason, I don't know why, but when I see in those westerns, those make shift towns, I'm always reminded of that town.</span> <span id="s698">But anyhow, they drove me to that town and that town was a collection center for children and I stayed with a family for a while in one of the houses consisting of a man who had lost his wife and married his wife's sister and his daughter and his wife absolutely doted on his daughter.</span> <span id="s699">Every day she had a tutor coming in to tutor them in English because they were going to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s700">They were waiting for papers to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s701">And she was taking such good care of that girl and I kept on thinking wistfully God I wish I had someone to take care of me like that.</span> <span id="s702">I felt really disoriented in that period.</span> <span id="s703">I felt very homesick for the farm, and I felt very uprooted and I felt sick.</span> <span id="s704">I just felt sick.</span> <span id="s705">So, I don't remember too well that whole period except the next thing I remember, the next memory I have is being Bratislava, but I don't remember how we got there, you see.</span> <span id="s706">I have no recollection of how we got from that place to Bratislava.</span> <span id="s707">But in Bratislava was a stop off place and I got very sick there.</span> <span id="s708">I don't know what I had.</span> <span id="s709">I must have had the measles or something, but I was very ill and most of those children left except for one girl whom you saw I have a picture of.</span> <span id="s710">I don't know how long I was sick, but then other children started arriving and then we all were again a large enough group for us to continue and by small stages -- then I remember being on busses, and they got us out from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s711">I think they probably must have gotten us through East Germany and the West Germany and then to France.</span> <span id="s712">In France we ended up in a home in Barbizon which is very close to Fountain Bleu.</span> <span id="s713">It was a beautiful spot.</span> <span id="s714">It was truly beautiful.</span> <span id="s715">That's where I got my first orange.</span> <span id="s716">That's where I got my first taste of chocolate, and that's where they taught me to eat with a knife and fork -- not a knife, a fork.</span> <span id="s717">We started with a fork.</span> <span id="s718">I don't think I ate with a knife for a while.</span> <span id="s719">That's where they started teaching us things.</span> <span id="s720">We were like savages really.</span> <span id="s721">That's when I had my head shaved because I was full of life.</span> <span id="s722">I was also ill, I was quite ill.</span> <span id="s723">I couldn't eat properly, you know.</span> <span id="s724">My stomach wouldn't digest regular food.</span> <span id="s725">I became very friendly -- it was so strange because the director of the camp was a man by the name of Eric Schott and he drove by and there was a group of us playing and he opened the door and he motioned for me to come into the car and he did.</span> <span id="s726">And he took me to the home where they lived which was on the grounds, but it was very extensive grounds there, so he drove me to their home and they gave me upstairs I met his wife and his son.</span> <span id="s727">He had a son, and they gave me what you call in French , which is in the middle of the afternoon and they gave me little sandwiches with cheese and a piece of chocolate and some milk.</span> <span id="s728">I thought that was absolutely delicious.</span> <span id="s729">So, that was a wonderful place.</span> <span id="s730">I have very good memories.</span> <span id="s731">Once he asked me if I wanted to go and see what the sea was like and I said sure.</span> <span id="s732">I hadn't seen the sea in a long time.</span> <span id="s733">I remembered it from the place we had, but he took his son and me to Brittany for vacation for a whole week's vacation and it was absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s734">It was for the first time I started eating certain fish which I had never had and shrimp and things like that.</span> <span id="s735">I had never tasted anything like it before.</span> <span id="s736">That's when I rejoined civilized life, really.</span> <span id="s737">The older children in that group then left for Israel except for two, that little girl who stayed with me in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s738">She found an aunt and uncle in Paris and she went to live with them, and I visited very often with them, and then when all the children had left, the director and his wife and their son moved to Paris and I moved with them.</span> <span id="s739">That's when I really started school in earnest.</span> <span id="s740">I had started school already in Barbizon, but it was a one room school with different grades.</span> <span id="s741">When we moved to Paris, I really started regular school and it was very hard at the beginning because I didn't speak the language yet and I had to learn to read and write at the age of 11 and the French are very strict where they place you.</span> <span id="s742">So, they immediately decided that I had to go into a class with younger kids which wasn't very good for my morale.</span> <span id="s743">The first day that we had you know the spelling test, the teacher put my spelling on the board as an example of what not to do.</span> <span id="s744">Twenty- three spelling mistakes, so I decided I had to learn fast, which I did, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Esthy, when they kidnapped you, were you screaming?</span> <span id="s746">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Did they talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: They were just holding me.</span> <span id="s749">They said I had to come back.</span> <span id="s750">I had to come back.</span> <span id="s751">I belonged to the Jews and I had to come back amongst the Jews.</span> <span id="s752">Oh, yes, I was screaming indeed.</span> <span id="s753">I was fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Did you decide I have no power here, I will just take what coming as you did all the other things?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: I had no choice.</span> <span id="s756">I really had no choice.</span> <span id="s757">Q: Did you think about running away?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Where was I going to run?</span> <span id="s759">Where would you run, you know, at that point.</span> <span id="s760">If somebody fed you you stayed put because if you run who was going to feed you.</span> <span id="s761">So, I wasn't going to run because I didn't know exactly -- I could have never found my way back to the farm, never.</span> <span id="s762">I knew that.</span> <span id="s763">I was not going to be caught.</span> <span id="s764">I knew how violent the peasants can be, and I wasn't going to be caught somewhere like that.</span> <span id="s765">So, running away wasn't an option really.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: What point did you stop fighting or feel as if okay --?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Well, in Barbizon I sort of began to have a glimpse of another life.</span> <span id="s768">When we went away to Brittany which I found absolutely beautiful, I particularly liked , I remember.</span> <span id="s769">I have pictures with their son from with Rene, who was the son of the Schotts.</span> <span id="s770">And, I began to have a glimpse of another life and then when I started school I very quickly learned how to read and write.</span> <span id="s771">When you're ready you learn it very quickly.</span> <span id="s772">You don't need several years like you have it here to learn how to read and write when you're really of a certain age and you're really motivated.</span> <span id="s773">So, I learned how to read and write very quickly and I learned French very quickly and I started reading a lot and that opened up to me a whole new world once I started reading.</span> <span id="s774">I knew now that maybe it wasn't so bad what happened to me, and I absolutely loved France.</span> <span id="s775">I found France beautiful.</span> <span id="s776">Everywhere I looked -- the city of Paris I just couldn't get enough.</span> <span id="s777">I used to just wander around by myself everywhere and it was safe at the time to wander around anywhere you wanted in Paris.</span> <span id="s778">I thought that that was the most glorious city that I had ever seen which it was.</span> <span id="s779">I was pretty happy by then and I was adjusting very well, and I was learning lots of things.</span> <span id="s780">I was going through school.</span> <span id="s781">I became very good at writing.</span> <span id="s782">I was writing poetry in French.</span> <span id="s783">I always found teachers who were always helpful and always pushing me along.</span> <span id="s784">I enjoyed that.</span> <span id="s785">It became very challenging to me and very stimulating not to disappoint them, you know, that the French are very big on competitions and regional tests and this and that, and I became a regular at the various competitions in writing and such because all of them wanted to send me because obviously I had a gift in that area.</span> <span id="s786">So, I began to really enjoy it.</span> <span id="s787">I had to work very hard, because the French school system at the time was very difficult to get through.</span> <span id="s788">It was very challenging and I had a lot of work to do and a lot of catching up to do.</span> <span id="s789">It was ridiculous, I remember doing calculous and they discovered my multiplication table or my additions.</span> <span id="s790">And we didn't have little calculators at the time and you really had to be able to calculate and I couldn't.</span> <span id="s791">So, somebody would always step in to coach me so I would have several weeks of coaching in addition to the regular school.</span> <span id="s792">They were sending me for competition in essays and they discovered that I didn't know the rules of grammar in French.</span> <span id="s793">I had skipped the grade where there were rules of grammar so I had a tutor assigned to me from school for a couple of weekends to teach me what the rules of grammar were.</span> <span id="s794">You needed to know the rules of grammar when you off to a writing competition.</span> <span id="s795">So, I was very busy and I was very caught up in that life, and I really enjoyed it very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: You felt close to both Mr. and Mrs. Schotts?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: I felt very close to Mr. Schott.</span> <span id="s798">Mrs. Schott, no.</span> <span id="s799">Mrs. Schott was a bit of a basket case and a difficult woman, although I couldn't blame her after she lost her son.</span> <span id="s800">Honey died when he was --I was -- how old was I when he died?</span> <span id="s801">13 or 14, and he must have been 17 years old and he died of cancer, a young boy.</span> <span id="s802">So, that was a very terrible blow to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Were you close to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: I was very close to him, yes.</span> <span id="s805">He was very protective of me, and I was delighted to have a big brother who was protective of me, so I felt very close to him.</span> <span id="s806">I felt very close to Mr. Schott, in fact, I named my son after him.</span> <span id="s807">My son is named Eric after Eric Schott.</span> <span id="s808">And I got to know his family in England, and I became very close with his family.</span> <span id="s809">He had a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew who lived in England and I became very close to them.</span> <span id="s810">In fact, I still see them.</span> <span id="s811">Unfortunately he died, and his nephew died a couple years ago, but we spent some time before he died together because they were very important people in my life.</span> <span id="s812">I made friends in Paris and I was doing lots of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: So you put your life together?</span> <span id="s814">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s815">I really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Did you consider yourself a member of the Schott family?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Up to the time when he died.</span> <span id="s818">After that I didn't.</span> <span id="s819">After that I had a whole series of places I lived.</span> <span id="s820">She wanted to remarry and after all to have a young girl on her hands was not the best thing for her.</span> <span id="s821">So, I went to live with a friend of theirs who was my tutor.</span> <span id="s822">Eric Schott was my tutor first, and they appointed an assistant to him in case something happened to him, and when he died, I went to live with that other family by the name of Katts, and they were a terrible family to live with.</span> <span id="s823">They really were.</span> <span id="s824">Actually, I don't think he particularly picked on me.</span> <span id="s825">They had two sons and he was equally cruel to his two sons, so it was not a good place to live.</span> <span id="s826">I stayed with them until I reached the age of 18 at which point in the French court, you can be declared mature of age if two witnesses will testify to your character and your maturity, which is exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s827">So, I became essentially 21 at the age of 18.</span> <span id="s828">From then on I could do as I pleased and I went to live with a family of two doctors who had been at that camp in Barbizon.</span> <span id="s829">They were taking care of the children.</span> <span id="s830">They weren't married, the two.</span> <span id="s831">They lived together.</span> <span id="s832">She had a little girl.</span> <span id="s833">Her husband had been deported during the war and killed and I lived with them until I married Jim.</span> <span id="s834">I met Jim in the summer of 1954 in Germany, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s835">He was stationed at Heidelberg, and I was visiting with this family became they had gone back to live in Germany because he was a doctor and he couldn't practice in France.</span> <span id="s836">The French medical association is very reactionary and very tight and they wouldn't allow him to practice so, since he took his medical degree in Germany he went back to Mannheim where his family was a doctor and he opened up a very thriving practice, so she had to join him there and I lived with the daughter in Paris and during vacation time when we didn't have school we would go to Mannheim and stay with them and then come back to Paris when school resumed.</span> <span id="s837">One of the trips in '54 I met Jim, who was in the United States Army, and I went back to France and he went back to the United States but two years later, he came back and we got married.</span> <span id="s838">So, we were married in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: You corresponded during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s841">Jim is not really a letter writing.</span> <span id="s842">I know he can hear me.</span> <span id="s843">Telegrams mostly.</span> <span id="s844">He sent me telegrams, and also I must say my English wasn't very good, so it was hard to correspond when your English is not very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: So, did you take these people's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Lehman, yes, I took their name, that's right.</span> <span id="s847">Q: So you were married --?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: In Paris.</span> <span id="s849">We were married in Paris, but then when we came here, his parents wanted a wedding too, so we had a second wedding for his parents, too.</span> <span id="s850">And I didn't know anybody and it was very funny because whenever I was introduced to somebody and we would turn around to somebody else I would hear, is she Jewish?</span> <span id="s851">At one point I said to Jim why don't you make a sign and put it on my back, I'm Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Were you taught anything about Judaism after the war in Barbizon?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s854">Yes, as a matter of fact, I was in a very peculiar way.</span> <span id="s855">You see, in order for me to catch up with the French school system I had to go into a private school for a while to catch up.</span> <span id="s856">And it so happened that I was sent one year to a very special private school which was not Jewish and one year I was sent to a private school which was Jewish, and the only way they would keep me there is if I would learn how to read and write Hebrew right away, which I did.</span> <span id="s857">We had religious instruction and we read the Bible every day in addition to the regular curriculum, so I learned about Judaism there, as much as you can learn in a couple of years, you know.</span> <span id="s858">I learned how to read and write.</span> <span id="s859">I learned even how to read , which I cannot do any more, but if I had to, I probably would again, I would learn it, if my future life depended on it, I would probably learn it again.</span> <span id="s860">So, I did learn a little bit about Judaism.</span> <span id="s861">It didn't take.</span> <span id="s862">It really didn't take.</span> <span id="s863">I think that the first time I really felt Jewish was after the Six Day War.</span> <span id="s864">That's when I really felt Jewish.</span> <span id="s865">I don't quite understand why except that maybe I saw the Jews stand up and fight and that did it for me.</span> <span id="s866">They were defending themselves and they were defending their land, and for the first time I felt Jewish.</span> <span id="s867">So, I feel perfectly Jewish now, but I didn't for a long time.</span> <span id="s868">I really didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: What does that mean, do you think, feeling Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Feeling that I'm proud to be part of that breed.</span> <span id="s871">Feeling that in spite of all the trials that we have gone through we are a very strong and resilient people, not feeling that I'm ashamed of being a Jew.</span> <span id="s872">That's what it means essentially to me.</span> <span id="s873">I can't say that I'm really religious.</span> <span id="s874">It's just that I feel very Jewish.</span> <span id="s875">I really do at this point.</span> <span id="s876">I feel that I'm part of this minority, and I'm going to stay that way and I'm going to tell my children about it and I hope my children stay part of the minority.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Is there a piece of the child in you feeling angry about what Jews did or didn't do during this period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: I think, yes, there was a certain amount of anger in me.</span> <span id="s879">There was the anger of our marching off like that.</span> <span id="s880">I was very angry about the, but I have come to understand that we really didn't have a choice.</span> <span id="s881">We were trapped and we really didn't have a choice.</span> <span id="s882">But I did feel angry for a long time, you're right.</span> <span id="s883">And I think that's probably why I didn't feel Jewish because I didn't want to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s884">I was angry about it.</span> <span id="s885">But the Sixth Day War showed me that if there was a way, the Jews can fight, you know, and they will fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">That made a big difference to me really.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: You're identity is something that you've created in a way that most people don't.</span> <span id="s888">A: Don't most people create an identity for themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Yes, but you have a history that is lost to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: That's true.</span> <span id="s891">Well, I had no choice really.</span> <span id="s892">I had to create an identity.</span> <span id="s893">You're right.</span> <span id="s894">I did create an identity for myself.</span> <span id="s895">I didn't realize it was that unusual though.</span> <span id="s896">I thought most people created their identities, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: But your history is one of so much oppression and so much terror as a child that you couldn't be a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: No, I guess I was always adult.</span> <span id="s899">I guess I was always adult.</span> <span id="s900">Q: What was it like for you to raise children?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: It wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s902">You know the best way of understanding another person is to put yourself in their shoes and I am very good at putting myself in the shoes of adults.</span> <span id="s903">I couldn't put myself in the shoes of children.</span> <span id="s904">As a consequence I was probably very over protective of my children.</span> <span id="s905">I was always trying to keep them safe, which doesn't work.</span> <span id="s906">I have come to certainly realize that.</span> <span id="s907">You can't keep anybody safe, but part of the reason was that I didn't remember what it was as a child.</span> <span id="s908">I couldn't venture out as a child because it was too dangerous, so consequently I probably tried to keep my children from straying somewhere where there might be danger.</span> <span id="s909">And I know that I had peculiar fears like if they had a rash it used to drive me crazy until I realized that it had to do with that little girl that that was shot because she had pimples.</span> <span id="s910">I associated pimples always with being sick and if you're sick you're going to get shot.</span> <span id="s911">So, my kids never had a rash I can tell you that.</span> <span id="s912">I drove them crazy but they didn't have a rash.</span> <span id="s913">You know, it's things like that that I probably overdid as a mother.</span> <span id="s914">But for a long time my children didn't know my past, which is again, I'm told, I didn't realize but I'm told that this is not usual with survivors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s915">I remember the first time my daughter came back from religious school and they were talking about the Holocaust and she asked me point blank are you a Holocaust survivor, and I said yes, and she got very upset.</span> <span id="s916">By then I think she must have been 10 or 11 years old which is an advanced age and she never had a glimmer that I might be a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s917">So, you know, it's --.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Did you then tell her?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Some, but then I wasn't able to talk about it all so I was very reticent and that probably created more anxiety than if I had told her.</span> <span id="s920">Our son never questioned me about it.</span> <span id="s921">He's the kind of a child probably that I was.</span> <span id="s922">He absorbed things by observing.</span> <span id="s923">He doesn't ask that many questions so he just absorbed and watched and didn't ask too many questions.</span> <span id="s924">My daughter is a real questioner.</span> <span id="s925">She likes to ask questions.</span> <span id="s926">Some of the answers I gave weren't entirely satisfactory.</span> <span id="s927">Part of the reason was I wasn't able to talk about it then, yet.</span> <span id="s928">It didn't come until much later when I was able to talk about it.</span> <span id="s929">I just sort of decided this was my past life, another life.</span> <span id="s930">I was living in a different life and I was going to pretend I'm just as normal as everybody else.</span> <span id="s931">So, that's really the mission I took on.</span> <span id="s932">I was going to lead a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Did you imitate other mothers that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s935">And also, I had an instinct.</span> <span id="s936">I have a protective instinct to begin with so I would never do any harm to a child, so I'm very protective of children.</span> <span id="s937">So, that's -- and I read so I understood some of the things that were going on, and I did let go of the children, I must say.</span> <span id="s938">Maybe not as fast or as soon as they wanted it to happen, but it happened.</span> <span id="s939">No, I understood suffering so I was always trying to nurture and avoid suffering, but I suppose that I must have brought certain hang ups with me that other mother's didn't have, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Maybe we should bring the pictures over here.</span> <span id="s941">Why don't you explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: This picture was taken, it doesn't show my finger, is that okay?</span> <span id="s943">This picture was taken in Bratislava in 1946, and I am the girl in the middle next to the white bunny and the little boy who leans on my right arm we call him the Englishman because nobody could understand what language he was talking, which he spoke in.</span> <span id="s944">We all had a smattering of different languages, but nobody understood his.</span> <span id="s945">So, that was the Englishman leaning on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: So you're second to the left there in the first row?</span> <span id="s947">A: I'm second to the left.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Do you remember the other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: No, I just don't remember them, except for that little boy.</span> <span id="s950">He was always next to me.</span> <span id="s951">He was always leaning against me, but he didn't speak.</span> <span id="s952">He never spoke.</span> <span id="s953">I never heard him speak.</span> <span id="s954">This picture also was taken in Bratislava and that's the whole group.</span> <span id="s955">You can see it's a pretty large group.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Where are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: There I go.</span> <span id="s958">That's the one, that's me.</span> <span id="s959">Around time, that was taken around the same time I would say.</span> <span id="s960">Same hat, same coat, I didn't have any more than that.</span> <span id="s961">Maybe somebody who knows Czechoslovakia will recognize the monuments, but I don't remember it.</span> <span id="s962">I know it was Czechoslovakia, and I think it was Bratislava, although we were also in Prague, but I think it was Bratislava.</span> <span id="s963">This picture I'm the one holding on to two hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: So you're this person?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: That's me, that was taken later.</span> <span id="s966">That was taken in France.</span> <span id="s967">By then you can tell my hair had grown back a little bit.</span> <span id="s968">I had my head shaved when I came to France and by then it was growing back a little bit.</span> <span id="s969">I forgot to tell you a story.</span> <span id="s970">Mrs. Roosevelt came to visit the home and I was designated to learn by heart The Raven and to recite The Raven to her, which I did.</span> <span id="s971">When I was finished she patted me on the head and said, "What a cute little boy."</span> <span id="s972">So that was my first meeting with Mrs. Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s973">I met Mrs. Roosevelt later on because my husband and I started a Reformed Democratic Club when we lived in New York and she came to be our speaker and Jim and I went to pick her up.</span> <span id="s974">I told her the story when I first met her and she looked at me and said, "My you have changed."</span> <span id="s975">So, those were my encounters with Mrs. Roosevelt.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Thank you so much Esthy.</span> <span id="s977">A: Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
