<p><span id="s5">A: I was born in Offenbach in Germany in 1924 and we emigrated when I was 14 going on 15 in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your education in Offenbach?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: I first went to the public school to which all children went, and in 1934 in Offenbach they made a Jewish school where the teachers who had lost their jobs in the public school system got together and the Jewish children from our own area -- sometimes from the little villages nearby -- they had already known some violence and so on.</span> <span id="s8">I had really felt very little of it and this is interesting -- I remember my father being against the idea of a Jewish school because he thought that if in the regular schools they don’t see that the Jewish children are just as good and as normal as the Christian children, then the Christian children in the regular schools will -- might become more anti-Semitic, not having Jewish examples different from the Stuermer -- the paper.</span> <span id="s9">So with this, I was influenced by my father, too, and sort of went to the Jewish school -- well, there was no choice but I also felt that split and I never quite knew where I belonged because we were not really observant family.</span> <span id="s10">My father, even though he made kiddush, my parents never really went to Temple, my father, maybe on a rare occasion on a seat given by the director of his bank.</span> <span id="s11">And their friends up until then had been quite a few non-Jews and colleagues of my father, so it wasn’t such a Jewish background at all and I didn’t feel particularly Jewish.</span> <span id="s12">Rather mixed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: You were about 10 years old at this time.</span> <span id="s14">Do you remember the first time you went to this Jewish school as opposed to the school you were used to?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Actually.</span> <span id="s16">No.</span> <span id="s17">I do remember an incident, hardly an incident, in the other school when they sang the German National anthem, I didn’t want to sing it, so I was mouthing it and I always felt as if they were watching me, my gentile neighbors, and wondering why would a Jewish kid sing it and I felt oppressed – I mean didn’t feel very Jewish not to sing it but I didn’t sing it, and I didn’t feel very German -- I felt oppressed.</span> <span id="s18">This is a feeling when I think back, because I also remember my parents sometimes went away over Easter vacation to little hotels which were not Jewish, and I remember walking there along and they sometimes had asked, and from some other guests, the children to join me because I was an only child.</span> <span id="s19">By their choice, the kids went along and you know Germany has a lot of churches all over and they would say to each other, I’m going to this church and I’m going to that church tomorrow morning, and I remember feeling oppressed to this day because I thought the next question would be what church do I go to, and I didn’t feel so Jewish and I knew I wasn’t Christian.</span> <span id="s20">This sticks with me and it is in a way why now I feel rather affiliated more than ever before.</span> <span id="s21">I didn’t belong anywhere -- being put to a Jewish school, being neither one nor the other -- becoming Jewish by the Germans pushing me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Before you went to the Jewish school -- did you have many non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s24">My closest friend and neighbor, and this building just had two apartment buildings, was a daughter of a colleague of my father and we were the closest friends growing up together -- playing together in a little hallways outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Did you feel yourself and your family well integrated and accepted in Offenbach?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yes, yes, among the gentiles, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What did your father do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: He was with a bank and it was a private bank owned by a Jew, but except for him and one apprentice, they were all gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: When you say owned by a Jew, financed by Jewish capital?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s31">But more so I think there were -- like Lehman Bros. here -- there were then small banks yet which were family owned but had connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: As you continued in this Jewish school and as time went on, did you notice any change in the attitude of your gentile friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Slowly they disappeared.</span> <span id="s34">I didn’t have gentile friends.</span> <span id="s35">It somehow fizzled out.</span> <span id="s36">I remember once a gentile friend defending me when another kid from the neighborhood had perhaps called me “Jew” I wasn’t quite sure and this gentile friend of mine took me right to this boy’s mother to complain for me, and again I felt oppressed -- I wanted to crawl away -- I didn’t want to fight as a Jew and I didn’t want a gentile to fight, and I felt just pretty crummy about the whole bag.</span> <span id="s37">And I didn’t feel so Jewish associated until I think later at the Jewish school as time went on and we were by ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: In the Jewish School, was there ever any discussion among the students or the teachers about the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: No.</span> <span id="s40">Never, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Did you hear any discussions at home about the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s43">The discussions that I remember were mostly that it couldn’t continue that way -- that the Ausland, the other countries couldn’t let this happen.</span> <span id="s44">Slowly, it was more than a matter of where one would emigrate to, but yet, I remember my father was reluctant to accept an offer from a niece in America to come.</span> <span id="s45">I forgot the year -- my parents didn’t discuss it much with me at all -- even though I was old enough by standards nowadays.</span> <span id="s46">I was kept out of it as a child.</span> <span id="s47">Perhaps also they were afraid that children would say something to the outside world.</span> <span id="s48">And anything could be misinterpreted by a Nazi or by a gentile for their own gains -- not that they even needed an excuse but an excuse might have been better to further their own ends.</span> <span id="s49">So things were really kept -- one thing I remember, my mother once asked one of my father’s colleagues if she could see him and she had me along and she asked him in case my father ever has a political debate with him, she asked this gentile not to take my father serious.</span> <span id="s50">She was afraid -- this I understood -- that perhaps he could land in a concentration camp for his views.</span> <span id="s51">And she stressed that this is not what he really believes but maybe just some kind of academic talk like don’t take it too serious – I case he might make some anti-Hitler remark, not to get that known</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Do you remember if any of your father’s colleagues or employees in the bank made trouble in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: No.</span> <span id="s54">Some were Party members but I’m not aware -- I as a child -- that he really had trouble.</span> <span id="s55">Perhaps the reason that he didn’t get one higher position was that the man who later took the bank over was a gentile.</span> <span id="s56">I became aware that my parents slowly withdrew a little bit or maybe talked less freely but there was little of real anti-Semitism as one hears it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did you ever see signs in stores Juden Unerwunscht or?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s59">I didn’t see it happen to my own father, but a friend of ours who had stores -- they were demolished.</span> <span id="s60">There was Kristallnacht when many of my teachers were taken to concentration camps and all the fathers of my then Jewish friends except mine.</span> <span id="s61">Now, we lived a little bit -- our building was kind of in the back of a bank -- like a hinted?</span> <span id="s62">house kind of thing.</span> <span id="s63">It was perhaps a little bit difficult to find but perhaps someone protected him -- I don’t know, but I felt bad about that.</span> <span id="s64">I felt torn between my loyalty – I was glad my father was safe and I felt bad facing my Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s65">I remember a friend of mine who stuttered -- how much more she stuttered when her father was taken away -- it was horrible.</span> <span id="s66">And I remember our school after Kristallnacht, how it was smashed.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: You said that you didn’t belong to a congregation but did you…</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yes, but the Jewish school was part of the Temple compound and there I was a student and eventually part of the setting, I was one of the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: What was your father’s reaction after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: He was generally a quiet, philosophical, a somewhat pessimistic person.</span> <span id="s71">We didn’t discuss this.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Do you think that was because of the German attitude towards children?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: My father felt there were always good people everywhere.</span> <span id="s74">In fact, we had some good gentile friends who again at the Kristallnacht, after that -- I think Jewish homes were searched for weapons.</span> <span id="s75">Now even a bread knife would have been considered a weapon by German standards.</span> <span id="s76">We had a bread knife.</span> <span id="s77">Our gentile dressmaker came -- risking her own life -- and took the bread knife from us that it shouldn’t be found with us.</span> <span id="s78">We were always torn between some really decent Germans and the guilt and feeling bad towards other Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Did you know either any of your former school friends or any local children who were members of either the Hitler Jugend or BDM?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Actually whether this next door neighbor who was my friend ever became one, I don’t know because we slowly withdrew and again, it’s foggy in my mind.</span> <span id="s81">I’m unaware but when we did leave in 1939 and they knew that we were moving out for good, they didn’t say good-bye.</span> <span id="s82">They didn’t come to the door even though there was no one who might have seen it.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Had your father made plans to emigrate before Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: I believe so because it took that long to get the affidavit.</span> <span id="s85">We were given a number and then I recall too the horror when we found out that the American consulate was closed over the summer -- it seemed that our number would not be called until after the summer and my father made a remark like we’re lost -- verratzed was the term which was terrible -- really gone.</span> <span id="s86">And I don’t know why, but our number was yet called before they closed -- we came in April.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Was there ever a question of where to emigrate to?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Slightly Israel.</span> <span id="s89">And then somehow because we had more friends here, it came to being here, to America.</span> <span id="s90">Something I remember well, I think since the Kristallnacht and by that time also an aunt and uncle of mine had lost their business because people wouldn’t go to the Jewish businesses anymore -- that uncle had been taken to a concentration camp and their daughter was working in a household then -- in a Jewish household in Offenbach and their son learned to be a locksmith in Frankfurt for emigration purposes.</span> <span id="s91">And after Kristallnacht, that school was also smashed by the Nazis and I remember him phoning if he can come.</span> <span id="s92">And here was a real horrible thing -- my mother was so upset that if the boy could come and two men in the building -- maybe it would be more conspicuous -- maybe then my father would be taken to a concentration camp -- that she first didn’t want him to come.</span> <span id="s93">And my father -- this is the first quarrel I remember -- really saying vehemently, “No, Ernest can come.”</span> <span id="s94">And I being totally upset again not knowing which side to take.</span> <span id="s95">My mother wanted to protect my father.</span> <span id="s96">This split loyalty -- and my father who wanted to let his nephew come rather than playing it so safe as to having no one notice anyone coming into the Bodenheimer apartment.</span> <span id="s97">This I remember with real horror -- it doesn’t compare to some of the sad stories but this I remember with the utmost depression -- it weighing on me about Ernest coming -- should he come or not and my mother crying that he shouldn’t come, really being afraid and my father insisting he must come.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Would you say your father was a German patriot?</span> <span id="s99">Did he serve in WWI?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Before the First World War, he lived in Paris and then in England.</span> <span id="s101">He was taken a civilian prisoner.</span> <span id="s102">He was never a German soldier because he lived in England.</span> <span id="s103">Since he had liked it in France and England and part of his training was to know other banking houses, he was more a citizen of the world.</span> <span id="s104">He was not so affiliated.</span> <span id="s105">He was not a nationalist.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Did he consider going through France and England through any of these connections?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: No.</span> <span id="s108">They didn’t exist anymore -- this was before he was married.</span> <span id="s109">No.</span> <span id="s110">He came then here and he was rather philosophical and pessimistic.</span> <span id="s111">He sold Fuller brushes first and was later a shipping clerk.</span> <span id="s112">And I remember talking with him here too, the cold weather -- he was pessimistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: When you say he was philosophical and pessimistic.</span> <span id="s114">I don’t know how old he was but he must have been middle aged.</span> <span id="s115">That must be very difficult for a man of that age to readjust.</span> <span id="s116">How did he feel about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: I think again he felt that they came out alive -- they have no kick coming.</span> <span id="s118">And many were in the same boat.</span> <span id="s119">Many were in the same position -- just because he spoke English, that was good but on the other hand, he was not a business man type and my mother at first went cleaning and later on helped with some dressmaking, and sewing.</span> <span id="s120">And we had two rooms rented in a five-room apartment.</span> <span id="s121">We took in boarders which was what most of them did and I who never had a room to myself, until I worked and never had an apartment alone with my parents at all -- it didn’t bother me then.</span> <span id="s122">I mean it was part of the immigration, part of the group.</span> <span id="s123">One thing I felt in Germany and then here, like if kids seems to be sometimes foolish or laughing, I felt they don’t really know how serious things can be.</span> <span id="s124">I knew the reality.</span> <span id="s125">When I recall leaving my grandmother in the Black Forest, I remember parting from the family because we took a trip to visit those who were then still there -- a last goodbye.</span> <span id="s126">And I knew we would go to safety and it was quite obvious -- even though it was never really talked about --it was doubtful if they would ever live and see us.</span> <span id="s127">So therefore, my youth, here, putting up with boarders and roomers, it seemed part of the total.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Let me just go back a moment, when you went to say goodbye to your grandmother, was this your mother or father’s mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: My mother’s.</span> <span id="s130">My father had no parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: How did you see your mother on that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: I see my mother almost always nervous.</span> <span id="s133">And now I understand, that time I didn’t, they tried to get a little bit of money out on which there was a death penalty.</span> <span id="s134">And they sometimes mailed it out.</span> <span id="s135">When they sent a little package -- some kind of boards -- to relatives here -- some kind of boards on which one could tie on one’s bed sheets in order to make it neat in the linen closet -- between these boards they put some money -- not much.</span> <span id="s136">The main thing I remember is the fear of being anyone’s burden -- of having to ask either those who gave the affidavit or anyone else.</span> <span id="s137">The fear of being poor.</span> <span id="s138">I know they never mailed it with a return address, and yet one was always afraid of being caught.</span> <span id="s139">You know in Germany, it was more a homogenous group and everybody knows who is a Jew and who is not -- especially in a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Do you remember in Offenbach ever trying to go to a movie or to buy something and being refused or made to feel…</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Once the movies had a sign out that Jews were not wanted, we didn’t go and stores -- one had to go.</span> <span id="s142">There were small stores and again some knew us and were friendly and I remember also at the market place, my mother knew some people who would be friendly.</span> <span id="s143">What I do remember of anti-Semitism is whenever they would be marching by, the Germans, how the Jews would run away.</span> <span id="s144">And my father explained that even if I would for some reason greet the flag, it could be considered hypocritical and it could be an insult and if you don’t greet it, it was an insult so whatever you do, you were better off running away.</span> <span id="s145">I often felt I was a little better off than some of the kids coming from the villages who really had stories of real violence and we only had that after Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Do you remember such instances?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s148">Later on, when the school started again that I looked into the synagogue which was totally smashed.</span> <span id="s149">All the pews had been hacked I think by the fire department because first they had burned it and then to prevent it from spreading to other homes.</span> <span id="s150">The teachers who had come back or the women teachers didn’t want us to climb up to some windows and look in -- for some reason not to see.</span> <span id="s151">And things were never really discussed.</span> <span id="s152">But I did look and it was very depressing and sad.</span> <span id="s153">And I felt rather helpless -- not knowing what’s up really.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: When your parents told you you were going to leave, how did you feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Oh glad, with joy.</span> <span id="s156">It was not sudden -- it was a slow process.</span> <span id="s157">We go to America.</span> <span id="s158">Some others go to South America.</span> <span id="s159">One looked forward.</span> <span id="s160">And the funny thing was in our school, as each class got smaller due to emigration.</span> <span id="s161">It was almost funny -- it was not sad.</span> <span id="s162">Maybe I as a child didn’t see the sadness and maybe it wasn’t sad -- we were glad to get out.</span> <span id="s163">And it was an accomplished fact that we would leave.</span> <span id="s164">Once we knew that the visa was granted and once we had been examined in Stuttgart, -- then there was the story of a teacher’s daughter who learned the numbers by heart because she was very near sighted so she wouldn’t be rejected.</span> <span id="s165">But then they changed the chart and the child kept on saying it but they got out -- how these people got out?</span> <span id="s166">I remember my father always saying something and being told take it easy or don’t worry because he was worried about whatever condition -- I was near- sighted, not that bad, but near-sighted too.</span> <span id="s167">One always was worried, is there anything that can foul it up because we knew we would be lost -- that staying is death.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: When you saw your friends going, was that a difficult time for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Strangely enough, it seems in a fog.</span> <span id="s170">I don’t even remember some friends if they came after me or before me but I met them again here.</span> <span id="s171">Those who were going to New York City, somehow one felt we would meet again but the whole thing was sort of an oppressive mood -- I was always afraid of poverty.</span> <span id="s172">Maybe some got out more money, maybe and I thought of living in dungeons.</span> <span id="s173">It never occurred to me that New York might have a Fort Tryon Park.</span> <span id="s174">We knew we would be safe but beyond that, I wasn’t much looking forward -- and I was afraid of English.</span> <span id="s175">I didn’t speak English and you know what you learn in school -- I was afraid.</span> <span id="s176">One sad thing I had a little parakeet to which I was much attached so naturally you don’t take a parakeet to America and then again the seamstress took the parakeet and I remember crying about the parakeet.</span> <span id="s177">Not about my grandmother -- this was strange.</span> <span id="s178">When I left my grandmother it was all an oppressive, quiet thing -- there was not much emotion shown -- maybe my parents tried to hold back and therefore I did too -- I just picked up the pattern.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: What did happen to your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: My grandmother died in camp -- in Gurs.</span> <span id="s181">The other aunt whose husband was killed in a concentration camp – my aunt was killed in a concentration camp also.</span> <span id="s182">Their boy who we did let come, Ernest, he was killed in Israel by a mine by Arabs.</span> <span id="s183">And he had a sister and her story, it came out later, she trained to go to Israel too and then there in this camp -- Haachura it was called, she had a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s184">They were about 16 years old.</span> <span id="s185">The boyfriend had a chance to get out and he didn’t want to leave her and they both got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: You, your mother and your father all left together.</span> <span id="s187">When you landed in New York, what did you do the first day?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: There was a cousin and an uncle, they had rented a room for the three of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Were they the ones who sent you the visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A; No, they lived in Arkansas, in Fort Smith, Arkansas and they never came and my mother said why don’t they invite the child once to Arkansas away from New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: How did you know them?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: This was a niece of my father who came here early.</span> <span id="s193">Sometimes German Jewish fellas or girls would emigrate.</span> <span id="s194">They came in the early 1920’s.</span> <span id="s195">But these were others who had come here as we did.</span> <span id="s196">They showed us this room for the three of us and they were refugees like us so we were rather glad that we could speak German and I know that the landlady took me along to a little deli -- a little grocery store and instead of buying just one egg as you were accustomed in Germany, I think she asked for a dozen or six and I thought it’s really a nerve to ask for so many eggs -- a chutzpah because it was unheard of.</span> <span id="s197">And I also realized later, that for this little party which they gave us, we were charged.</span> <span id="s198">My cousins didn’t pay.</span> <span id="s199">I mean my parents were already a little bit sad like here, they are giving a little beginning party to my cousins and uncles and then have to pay for it when they had just arrived and really didn’t know how to make out.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: One thing I forgot to ask and it occurred to me just now.</span> <span id="s201">Was your father ever dismissed from the bank where he worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s203">One day, he just came up -- he was just let go.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: It must have been before the Kristallnacht -- he was just dismissed.</span> <span id="s206">After twenty or more years, just let go.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Was the bank Arisiert?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: It must have been in the process -- the owners went to England where they had family.</span> <span id="s209">It was to be expected but it came worse than he thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: But you already had made plans to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yes, but this made it more final.</span> <span id="s212">After all, there was no more income.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Getting back to the early days in New York, how did your father manage to earn a living during the early days?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Through connections.</span> <span id="s215">When we after six weeks got an apartment, the people who had the apartment over us were also refugees and their son-in-law was a Fuller Brush man and they told us why don’t we go and try that, so that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: How did you manage during those six weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: I’m trying to think.</span> <span id="s218">Then my father took me to school one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Humboldt Junior High -- 173rd Street.</span> <span id="s221">I had wanted to wait until our lift came which might have had my report cards which we did bring over which would have had more credits but my father didn’t want me to wait six weeks or whatever and he thought that if I get a lower grade, it would be easier for my English.</span> <span id="s222">And so he took me to school and at first I was put in a class with mostly immigrants and here to, it was odd.</span> <span id="s223">Not that we were so crazy about New York and I never got used to the fire escapes -- the ugliness in some way and there was this little Dutch boy in the class and I don’t know what the talk was but this very strict Irish teacher said to us if anyone doesn’t like it here, raise your hand.</span> <span id="s224">I was smart enough not to raise my hand --I wasn’t so happy but this boy -- Blitz was his name and he raised his hand.</span> <span id="s225">And she said to him -- Take the first boat and go back.</span> <span id="s226">Then I learned to shut up and don’t criticize even more.</span> <span id="s227">We were sort of a nice bunch of refugees and we spoke German amongst each other and we often were caught and we were scolded a little bit not to talk so much in class and I talked a lot in class and I was so surprised when we went from one room to the other which is different from the German system that in all rooms I found a few more I could talk German with and I was really quite happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: When you first got to school this must have been an entirely new experience for you, and you were about 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s230">It was even a little bit of a disappointment because in our little German Jewish School for instance, we had a much nicer gym.</span> <span id="s231">We would have gym outdoors which I liked.</span> <span id="s232">We would change for that and we had a much more rigorous physical activity and I thought our teaching was better -- more was expected.</span> <span id="s233">It was in a way more enjoyable -- here.</span> <span id="s234">I felt a little bit strange.</span> <span id="s235">The fact that you could never get out between classes -- that is the worst thing and I think so to this day.</span> <span id="s236">That you cannot have periods to change, to run around, to talk to your friends, but here in America, you just go from one classroom to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Did you feel the refugee children kept together?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: We kept together, yes.</span> <span id="s239">And I liked that.</span> <span id="s240">And also then I met another girl who was a very bright girl and I wanted to get to know her, and my mother was a bit against my meeting Americans.</span> <span id="s241">Somehow she wanted to be sure she knows the background or with whom I associate and then we took up some homework too.</span> <span id="s242">Again from the family above, they showed us.</span> <span id="s243">There was a woman who was older than my parents and her husband and they had a married daughter and son-in-law, and a son living with them -- this is how people shared apartments.</span> <span id="s244">And they not only helped my father get the Fuller Brush job, they also showed us where to get some homework -- where some Russian Jewish people who were here longer brought some homework home where my mother did some cross-stitching and sewing the bottom of slippers and the upper part of slippers.</span> <span id="s245">It was very hard work on the hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Yes, because it’s tough to get through.</span> <span id="s247">Did you do this also?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Not so much.</span> <span id="s249">My father tried to help her too.</span> <span id="s250">It’s amazing how, when I think back, how they worked together.</span> <span id="s251">How they stuck it out and the sacrifices.</span> <span id="s252">I remember my father coming home really tired -- the Fuller Brush people that time, had to make their own deliveries too -- there was nothing else.</span> <span id="s253">He would usually after dinner go right to bed -- read a paper or a book -- that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: What did they or you do for recreation then?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: I then later joined the New World Club.</span> <span id="s256">I had friends -- we had even dancing lessons -- four or five girls, and we met some fellas.</span> <span id="s257">There was also a refugee woman -- Mrs. Peretz, who gave some gym classes and also dancing lessons.</span> <span id="s258">We stayed within this refugee compound and I think I was quite happy.</span> <span id="s259">We went to George Washington High School then -- there was no talk of taking a bus -- we walked it from 180th Street.</span> <span id="s260">It was not an unhappy time.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: You mentioned that your mother did some cleaning and this piecework…</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s263">And she did this piece work which I sometimes helped with, and I cleaned the house while she was out cleaning, and we had the boarders -- who were at one time, the border was a distant relative which was nice.</span> <span id="s264">Another time, the boarder -- roomer -- they didn’t eat with us -- was also the mother of some other people who were friends.</span> <span id="s265">Again they were refugees, and later a friend of (word missing) who was later to become my husband who had a sad story of his own -- had gone through concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Had your mother ever worked in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: No.</span> <span id="s268">Earlier she had worked once as a secretary in Heidelberg, and as a teacher of business courses during the First World War, but not menial work.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: How did she feel about life in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: You know, one didn’t really discuss feelings.</span> <span id="s271">It was a necessity, nor was I so geared.</span> <span id="s272">I just felt my own restrictive parents.</span> <span id="s273">I didn’t take it really as depressing as it would be if I had to go cleaning now -- what it would mean to me.</span> <span id="s274">If I now had to go cleaning, I would feel terrible, it never occurred to me how my mother would feel doing that, but it was also done by many of her other friends who had been in Europe, who had been in Europe in similar financial, or even better circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Do you think that made it a little bit easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Perhaps a little, but I remember she had jobs where she would only come every other week, and my father saying that’s pretty rough, because if people wait for every other week to have it cleaned, it’s dirtier than a job where one cleans every week.</span> <span id="s277">I know he felt a bit bad that she had to do it -- that’s why he maybe helped her with the cross-stitching, and also helped cleaning their own house.</span> <span id="s278">That might have lasted not more than two or three years, and later on when he did a little bit better, and she then had the connection through a cousin whom she would help with doing some of the needlework, on drapes.</span> <span id="s279">This cousin was working for an interior decorator, and she got some of the jobs which the interior decorator gave her.</span> <span id="s280">And my mother also would sometimes be a companion or a nurse helper, and then she also cooked for someone who had a room somewhere else.</span> <span id="s281">And this she liked a little bit more, and we were all happy with it, because she felt better doing it – you feel you are helping somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Going back for a moment, when you were in Germany, what did you hope to become?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: I was a bit interested in art.</span> <span id="s284">But I also felt one cannot really make a career here, the main thing is to earn a living, and at one point, here, my teacher said I should go to college, I had good marks and my mother sort of pooh-hood it, like it was out of the question, and sometimes the children -- someone was taken out of school to become an operator in a factory -- and I was glad they let me finish high school.</span> <span id="s285">But I regretted a bit that I couldn’t go further, yet I knew that at that time, I couldn’t do more.</span> <span id="s286">Also when I then got a job at eighteen, the question of going to college was out, because in case I wouldn’t be up to it, and God forbid I would lose my job, because I helped my parents -- it was a very negative situation, that one didn’t plan ahead, or at least I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: What kind of job did you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: That was then as a billing clerk for the same firm where we had done the cross-stitch, and I was there for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: How was your social life organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: The social life wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s291">I now wish I had planned more of a career at that time, but it somehow seemed out, and also it had to do with being a girl, you don’t want to get too much of an education.</span> <span id="s292">If you haven’t got money, you don’t really -- the best thing is to work and not to be a student.</span> <span id="s293">The social life was the New World Club, and we had a room that we rented -- a kind of a super’s apartment on 164th Street, where we held meetings, and a lot of us got together there -- we even managed to have a little newspaper.</span> <span id="s294">We did a lot of that, and then also the Temple Habonim had a hiking group and there was also a hiking group Zigzag to which some -- that was a former Austrian travel agent -- a little munchkin of a man who would take people not only hiking, but on unusual side trips -- places of interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Were the members of this group refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s297">We stayed within the refugee group.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Did you date any American Jewish boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: The family with the cross-stitch -- they had not only a daughter with whom I was friendly, but a son on whom I had a crush, and the son had a friend.</span> <span id="s300">We were together in a group and we went out together sometimes, until both were in the army.</span> <span id="s301">I was 15, they 17, and after that I got more into a refugee crowd again.</span> <span id="s302">Before that, I was a little bit with these Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: How did your parents feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A; I think my mother had a little bit the feeling that after all these are Eastern Jews.</span> <span id="s305">My father was more interested because the boy was brilliant and I had a crush on him, but he didn’t return it.</span> <span id="s306">But his friend liked me and we were kind of a group -- the sister with whom I was friendly more for the purpose of meeting her brother.</span> <span id="s307">And there was another family -- I think they also did these cross-stitches, and their daughter also came over to pick up the homework.</span> <span id="s308">With them we did interesting things – we saw that time Fantasia, we saw Native Son.</span> <span id="s309">They had some theater productions in little movie theaters.</span> <span id="s310">That was a good era, these two or three years, and then the war came, and after that, I got more back into the refugee community.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Did you all continue working until things got a little easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s313">They worked forever.</span> <span id="s314">My father worked until he died.</span> <span id="s315">He died at age 62.</span> <span id="s316">My mother stopped when she was about 74 or 75.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Was there ever a chance of your father going back into the banking business?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: He never tried -- times were bad here, and I remember my mother once asked a teller about her husband.</span> <span id="s319">No, he didn’t try, nor did he take courses in bookkeeping or accounting or taxes which some did.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Why do you think he didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I think he was a bit pessimistic and he didn’t really try.</span> <span id="s322">He was not an aggressive person, and he was also small.</span> <span id="s323">I think his figure might have mattered a little -- he thought people with a good appearance get further.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: But he had gotten that far in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s326">But there because he knew many languages.</span> <span id="s327">He knew French, English fluently.</span> <span id="s328">He was not that aggressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Did you as a family partake in the cultural events in Offenbach?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: I think my parents – again due to Hitler, they couldn’t do many things anymore.</span> <span id="s331">Finally, if the things were given in the Temple, a concert, sometimes.</span> <span id="s332">But they were interested.</span> <span id="s333">My father played the violin, my mother the piano, and they sometimes played duets.</span> <span id="s334">They knew operas, they knew the arias.</span> <span id="s335">If they went actively, I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Did they feel the loss of that when they came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s338">My father would say that to just go to bed after work is no life.</span> <span id="s339">But it was accepted.</span> <span id="s340">They didn’t fight it much.</span> <span id="s341">They didn’t often go to the movies.</span> <span id="s342">My father read a lot -- once he took me to an opera that I should see it.</span> <span id="s343">Together I think they did little of that stuff here although they were cultured people.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: How did they feel when the Wiedergutmachung came?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: That came later and my father never expected it.</span> <span id="s346">Never, and he didn’t even apply.</span> <span id="s347">My mother, through some prompting from relatives after my father’s death – or if he had applied, it was a dormant thing, and he never in his wildest dreams would have thought it would be as good financially as it is now.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: How did your mother feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Good.</span> <span id="s350">She went then to visit her sister who managed to get to Switzerland, a few times who meanwhile died.</span> <span id="s351">She is glad that she cannot be anyone’s burden.</span> <span id="s352">The main fear was always to be a burden.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Have you ever been back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: No.</span> <span id="s355">I would not want to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s356">I have been to Austria -- where my husband comes from.</span> <span id="s357">My husband had a Catholic mother who became Jewish by marriage, but it was really a Christian household, and if it hadn’t been for Hitler and the Anschluss -- that family would have been Christian.</span> <span id="s358">His feelings were not so bad and he also wanted to visit friends who had been helpful to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Would you ever go back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: No.</span> <span id="s361">I don’t want to go back.</span> <span id="s362">I feel oppressed and I don’t want to see it.</span> <span id="s363">Austria I didn’t mind and I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s364">Our first big trip was to Israel -- very purposely.</span> <span id="s365">And I’ve never been happier -- I never felt more that this is a country that you belong.</span> <span id="s366">This was an experience where we both had tears every day.</span> <span id="s367">And we were really not affiliated until 10 years ago.</span> <span id="s368">We floated around not belonging, and we are both very happy that we have hooked on to Jewish things.</span> <span id="s369">It came about by chance when my husband took some courses which turned out to be much more Jewish oriented than he had anticipated, and so we slowly grew into a Jewish thing -- almost like fate, and it has been a blessing.</span> <span id="s370">I don’t want to be corny but after my experience, we finally know where we belong, which we didn’t know during Hitler or before.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Did you become affiliated with the Tabernacle then?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Yes, for the children’s sake and because it was the least orthodox which my husband could get into with practically no Jewish background at all.</span> <span id="s373">And there again, we met the German Jewish crowd and there we found a niche -- maybe it’s too narrow a horizon but I don’t care.</span> <span id="s374">We finally have an identification, which in retrospect I feel I didn’t have in Germany.</span> <span id="s375">And if something would, God forbid, come here, I would try to speak much more with my children about what goes on.</span> <span id="s376">But you cannot blame them either, because my father, who came from an orthodox home, simply was not an orthodox person -- he was much more philosophical in his outlook.</span> <span id="s377">That time it was fashionable too, to be more of a humanist.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: How have you transmitted this story to your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: I failed.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Not necessarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Perhaps not.</span> <span id="s382">I had at some point wanted them to watch a TV program which showed the concentration camps, and things which maybe was not a good idea.</span> <span id="s383">They were not interested.</span> <span id="s384">They don’t openly show a great interest.</span> <span id="s385">I have asked whether they want to go to Israel, but they have not been interested.</span> <span id="s386">I don’t want to rule it out yet, but I feel I haven’t transmitted it the way I wanted to, or the way I feel now.</span> <span id="s387">But we slowly grew into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Do you see yourself today as more a part of the American mainstream, or more a part of the German Jewish community in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: The German Jewish.</span> <span id="s390">Increasingly less American.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: How do you see your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: More American.</span> <span id="s393">Far more American.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: In terms of your children’s ambitions for their own lives, how do you think that is different from what you experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Well, there are no restrictions on them.</span> <span id="s396">There are no financial restrictions.</span> <span id="s397">They can reach out and if they lose a job, they don’t have to worry about supporting us so they are freer, and yet, I feel, they also missed something good that we had.</span> <span id="s398">We belonged somewhere.</span> <span id="s399">We belonged to this refugee clique afterwards, and to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s401">PAGE 1</span></p></body></html>
