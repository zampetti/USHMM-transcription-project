interviewing Clarice MacLeod on July 15th, 1995.</span> <span id="s4">This is the firs-first side of that interview and we are in West Park, New York.</span> <span id="s5">Please tell me where were you -- when and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Answer: I was born in Philadelphia, New York in 1917.</span> <span id="s7">Why I emphasize the New York, everybody thinks it’s PA.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Tell me a little bit about the town you were raised in and your family.</span> <span id="s9">Tell me something about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: We moved when I was about three years old, so I don’t remember much about the town, but I do remember it was mostly farmland and they were just building the roads, there was no thruway or any of this.</span> <span id="s11">And then we moved about seven miles south, to a little place called Levin’s Mills and that’s where I went to school and was brought up and graduated in ‘35 and that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: When did you decide you wanted to be a nurse?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I think when I was in my senior year in high school.</span> <span id="s14">We didn’t have much choices in that time as to what you could do.</span> <span id="s15">Was a nurse or a secretary or a teacher.</span> <span id="s16">And I can remember a lecture that our professor gave and he said, “Do what you think you can do for the most people.”</span> <span id="s17">And I think that’s what decided me to be a nurse.</span> <span id="s18">No -- no special reason, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: When did you go to nursing school?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: 1935.</span> <span id="s21">Graduated ‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Where at?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: At House of the Samaritan in Watertown, which is another small city in upstate New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s25">And what did you do when you got out of nursing school in 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: I did general duty and I did private duty and in following years I worked with the visiting nurse association.</span> <span id="s27">I guess that was after I came back from service.</span> <span id="s28">That’s about it.</span> <span id="s29">General duty and private duty for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And when -- and when and why did you decide to go in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I had nothing to hold me at home.</span> <span id="s32">I knew that nurses were needed.</span> <span id="s33">I knew that I could be covered at home by older nurses who had children and whatever and I didn’t see any reason why I shouldn’t go and I felt I could be of some help, I guess.</span> <span id="s34">That’s the only reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: You know other people that were going in?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s40">Where did you find out about overseas service for nurses?</span> <span id="s41">Something that just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Well, that was aft -- no, that was after I’d gone through basic training and they just sent us there.</span> <span id="s43">You had no idea that -- what you would be doing, you know.</span> <span id="s44">No, they just all of a sudden said, “You’re going overseas,” and you accepted that, well, I think you probably expected it at one time or another, but no, no special --</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Where did you do your basic?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Atlantic City, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Hard.</span> <span id="s49">Did lot of marching, up and down the boardwalk.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Marching on the boardwalk?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Oh yes, but they were very strict, I think because you were in basic training.</span> <span id="s52">But enjoyed it really and -- enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: What other kinds of things do you -- do you remember from basic training?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Nothing much, really.</span> <span id="s55">I can’t remember that we went any place special.</span> <span id="s56">I can’t even remember what the meals were.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Must not have been too good, if you can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Or else it must have been real good.</span> <span id="s59">I don’t know how to answer [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s61">And when -- when did you go overseas and -- and how did you find out about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Oh, let’s see, we had -- I was sent to South Carolina.</span> <span id="s63">Well, I guess it was then that they told us that we were preparing to go overseas, because we had to learned how to pitch tents and do all -- dig trenches and all this.</span> <span id="s64">And I think was about November maybe, they told us that we were going overseas.</span> <span id="s65">And we -- I can’t remember what the date we got on the boat, but I remember we arrived December 22nd, in Scotland.</span> <span id="s66">And that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Do you remember very much of the crossing?</span> <span id="s68">About the boat, or what -- what it was like on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yes, there was 19 of us in a stateroom that normally held two people.</span> <span id="s70">I remember we were told that we might be -- the -- the Germans were hitting -- with submarines, might do damage to our boat and we had to sleep one night fully dressed and with our helmets on, we were told that.</span> <span id="s71">Life on the Queen Elizabeth was just casual because everything certainly was different than it was in peacetime.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Was it crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, very.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: And then you landed in?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: 22nd of December we landed in Greenock, Scotland.</span> <span id="s76">From there we went to England.</span> <span id="s77">Alteringham I think it was.</span> <span id="s78">And that was -- and then from there we just kept moving with the flow.</span> <span id="s79">We went to France and we went to Belgium and then on to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And when you were in Germany then, you were treating men who were coming back from battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Yes, some, but mostly when -- they were patients right off the field, because we were the first unit to get them right off the field.</span> <span id="s82">And we were treating some -- and sometimes we had to do temporary duty at other hospitals.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: And what was your specific job?</span> <span id="s84">Were you in a ward or in a operating room?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: I was in the operating room, anesthetist.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Anesthetist.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: So I’m kind of lost as to -- I feel kind of sorry, because I liked the contact with the patients and of course I didn’t have much of that, you know, it was [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: So they would come in and you’d knock them out and that would be it.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yeah, that’s about it, that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s91">And did you ever get much contact with them later?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Or were you just in doing that over and over and over?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, no.</span> <span id="s95">In fact there were very few times that you would have -- well I -- maybe you were so busy that you didn’t, I don’t know, but you didn’t contact them at -- on the ward after they left the operating room, as a rule.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: What kind of anesthesia was used?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Retrous oxide and Sodium Pentothal.</span> <span id="s98">I can’t remember about ether.</span> <span id="s99">I think probably that was initially -- started a patient out maybe on ether, but didn’t give it to him for the full surgical operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Well, cause it’s a little bit too heavy, I think, for a long operation.</span> <span id="s102">Or else it was the doctor’s choice.</span> <span id="s103">I don't remember [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s105">And it -- that -- was that the same job you always did?</span> <span id="s106">Did people rotate in and out of different jobs, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: No.</span> <span id="s108">Prior to that, I had worked in hospitals before we went overseas.</span> <span id="s109">Like there was Halloran General in -- in Staten Island.</span> <span id="s110">I was at Mason General, which was a psychiatric hospital in New York.</span> <span id="s111">No, anesthesia was only when I was overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: And did you have special training for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: No, the -- the anesthetist taught me how to -- you know -- I had worked on the operating before, but not as an assess -- an anes-anesthesiast, when I working not -- not --</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: D-During that job, do you stay there, in the operating room the whole -- during the whole procedure and --</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: The surgery?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: What do you do during the surgery?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: You monitor the patient.</span> <span id="s122">I mean that’s a constant thing, you have to do that until a surgery’s over.</span> <span id="s123">And of course you’d go from one patient to the next -- I mean it was like, today, they schedule their -- your surgery and --</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: So you were constantly monitoring their vital signs, is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s127">Were those quick surgeries, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: No, a lot of them were repair surgeries.</span> <span id="s129">Mine explosions and fractures.</span> <span id="s130">No, I wouldn’t call them -- I think maybe what you mean is you did the initial thing there and sent them on to a major general hospital, yes, that’s true, likely.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: But they weren’t necessarily like an emergency room situation where you just --</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Well, yes and no.</span> <span id="s135">They’re emergencies because they have to be done right away, cause they’re right off the field.</span> <span id="s136">Yes, I guess probably you would say they were emergencies, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Mm-hm, Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s139">But then they were sent to the wards afterwards until they could be transported to a -- a major hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: And what was it like when you were off duty?</span> <span id="s141">What kinds of things did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Just -- I guess walking, you’d play ball, you’d read.</span> <span id="s143">You’d do anything to pass your time away.</span> <span id="s144">I don’t think there was any specific thing and like I said, you made your own fun.</span> <span id="s145">Cause you naturally didn’t watch TV and listen to the radio and all that jazz.</span> <span id="s146">No, I just -- camaraderie I guess, with your roommates and --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: You all get along?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s149">I -- I can’t remember ever having an argument with -- that’s why I said it’s a good training, a good learning.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Being in the service, you mean, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Well yes, but I’m -- even in the hospital you see when you’re -- when you’re in training to be a nurse, you’re pretty much in with a block of other nurses and you learn -- course most of us knew how to get along with other people, but I think being in that close proximity, you are more aware of it, maybe.</span> <span id="s152">But you asked what we did, I don’t even know what we did, but the time went fast.</span> <span id="s153">And -- and we couldn’t be out by ourselves, you had to -- like when we were at the concentration camp, or in Germany, you had to have an armed guard and there weren’t enough available because they were guarding the camps.</span> <span id="s154">So well, you didn’t get to see too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Did you mingle with the men at all very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes, we had parties for the enlisted men and -- and you’d go to the officer’s lounge for either eating or having a drink or whatever.</span> <span id="s157">Yeah, you mingled, not -- you know, not all the time, but yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s159">And how long do you figure you were in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Not very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: You were there for VE Day?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yup.</span> <span id="s163">I remember that one.</span> <span id="s164">I think we might have left -- I think we might have gone in there -- I know at Easter time we were in -- in France or in Belgium, one or the other.</span> <span id="s165">So it might have been May til I’d say maybe sometime in July.</span> <span id="s166">So it wasn’t very long, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: We were there for the liberation, we were there for -- well, they liberated the camp and -- and that’s when our colonel said that we could go.</span> <span id="s169">We were left behind, all the boys went over to --</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Your unit --</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: -- l-liberate the -- yeah --.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: This is the 113th -- we didn’t say this.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: This is -- no, 131st.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: 131st, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yeah, 131st.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And what’s -- the full title is?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: 131st evacuation unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Uh-huh, and it -- they split off and they went ahead to Austria and left you behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: No, we were already -- th-th-they went -- now where were we?</span> <span id="s180">I think we were like in Kern and they left and went to Austria.</span> <span id="s181">And -- no, there were still some there, because they couldn’t leave women alone in that area.</span> <span id="s182">But they -- most of them left and liberated the -- I think I have a thing downstairs that tells about that.</span> <span id="s183">And our colonel said when he came back that he was not -- what’s the word?</span> <span id="s184">Forcing any -- any of the nurses to go.</span> <span id="s185">We could go if we wanted to and everybody but one elected to go.</span> <span id="s186">And course, when we got there, it was quite a sensation, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Do you remember arriving?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Well, we all went up in trucks of course and when we got there, there were patients intermingled.</span> <span id="s191">Some of them were dead and some of them were still living.</span> <span id="s192">All on one room.</span> <span id="s193">There might have been some bunks in there and I guess several maybe in a bunk, but I think the sad part was that some were alive and some were dead.</span> <span id="s194">And we had a fine chaplain who buried them, put crosses on every one -- in fact I have pictures of that too, downstairs.</span> <span id="s195">But that’s about it, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: And what did you do there?</span> <span id="s197">What was your assignment while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: That’s when I worked in the operating room and when we would get -- well, I just had to do what patients were there, what necessarily had to be done, but you’d also be getting patients from outside in the interim.</span> <span id="s199">I mean they were always coming in.</span> <span id="s200">But we did do some work on some of the patients that were there as far as -- well, we called them patients, they were really prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Did you s -- did you set up your tent hospital there, is that what you were working in?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: We -- we were -- no, we were in the -- we were housed in houses, regular houses.</span> <span id="s203">Nice -- fact, it’s the nicest place we stayed.</span> <span id="s204">But, in the hospital itself, they were like long wooden -- they weren’t tents.</span> <span id="s205">We -- we were set up in tents three or four different times, but when we were there, this was a long, wooden building with --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: And the name of this camp was Gusen?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Gusen, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: A sub-camp of --</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s211">Do you have any sense of how many people were there -- how many when you got there, how many former prisoners there were?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: No, and I don’t know whether I have a record of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: W-Would have been hundreds or thousands or --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Oh, hundreds, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s215">Thousands, no, I don’t think so, because a lot of them -- when I say a lot, some had just taken off.</span> <span id="s216">Heavens knows where they went, but they -- when they were liberated, they just went.</span> <span id="s217">But there were still a lot of them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: And you would then, every day, go into the surgery -- into the operating room and that was your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s221">What kinds of it -- what kinds of injuries were you seeing?</span> <span id="s222">Or what -- what kinds of things were --</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Well, like I said, mine blow ups or whatever.</span> <span id="s224">Not too much gunfire problems.</span> <span id="s225">Sometimes you’d get a patient in who’d been shot or whatever, but n -- a lot that I can remember were mines.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Land mines?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Land mines that exploded by people walking over them or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: A-And this was after the fighting had stopped, though?</span> <span id="s229">Or were these people who were injured before?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: No, this was -- the fighting had stopped, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: But people were still --</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Still coming in because those land mines weren’t deactivated for a long time after, even after we left, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s233">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: And what about -- I’d heard that there were people in that camp who had been experimented on surgically by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: I read that.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Did you see any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: You never saw that?</span> <span id="s239">People like that --</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: But I believe from what I read that that probably happened, yes.</span> <span id="s241">I think too that the major one I read about was Dachau and of course that was earlier than when we went over there, so [indecipherable] I read all that, yeah.</span> <span id="s242">But no -- not that I know whereof.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Did you get out and see much of the camp itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Did you see -- for example, there was a quarry there where a lot of prisoners were f --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yeah, when we went to work, there was a long s -- line of steps or whatever in the quarry and many mornings when we’d go, naturally, to have breakfast and whatever and then go to work, the Russians or the Germans had put a whole mess of stones in front, so they had to be removed before the nurses could walk up to get to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s248">So you had to go up those stairs?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Did you know at the time that that -- prisoners had been forced to walk up and down those stairs?</span> <span id="s251">Did you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: No, I didn’t know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s254">And the crematorium, did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: We ah -- yes, we saw that.</span> <span id="s256">We did not see it in op -- I didn’t see it in operation.</span> <span id="s257">Before we arrived there, there was the stench of the crematorium, which was sad.</span> <span id="s258">But as far as being in use when we were there, I never saw that.</span> <span id="s259">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s260">But I’m sure that it had been used.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s262">Did you -- were you aware of local people in Linz coming there for any reason to the camp or to work or just to see it, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: No, not to be aware -- daily.</span> <span id="s264">They used to bring in a truckload of personnel that they would go and pick up off the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: US Army would do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Would do that.</span> <span id="s267">Local, I mean people from our working area.</span> <span id="s268">And many times the patients would recognize some of these people that were picked up as being SSers, abusive people -- which we weren’t aware of until this, you know, they started coming in.</span> <span id="s269">No, as far as viewers, I can’t ever remember people just coming to look around, but that -- that could happen, I suppose.</span> <span id="s270">But I don’t -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s271">I wouldn’t think so at that stage of the game.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: It’s pretty early.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Yeah, I don’t think there would have been people coming in just to view the area, if you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: But you mentioned that some of the patients would recognize people and -- do you remember any -- any specific incident like that, when somebody said something or --</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: No.</span> <span id="s276">I think probably I was told this, because I was not on the wards and probably some of my nurse friends told me about this.</span> <span id="s277">No, I did -- I was -- I did not see this.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s279">You were in the operating room all the time, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Operating room, yeah, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: What about some of the people who -- the former inmates there who were well enough to walk around?</span> <span id="s282">Did you see those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s284">They were skin and bones.</span> <span id="s285">Well, many, many days they would -- like when we went there, we s -- naturally fed them.</span> <span id="s286">There were two doors to each one of those barracks.</span> <span id="s287">They would come in one door and go out the other door, so they were really overfed.</span> <span id="s288">But they would take their food and bury it outside of the -- the barracks, because they thought some time that they might need it -- if there -- they didn’t know that they were liberated.</span> <span id="s289">They didn’t know too much.</span> <span id="s290">You could see in a week’s time how they improved and all that, but they really were mentally and physically -- I don’t know the word to describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: But they would bury their food in the ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Bury their food in hopes that one -- they could get out of there.</span> <span id="s293">I suppose they constantly had in their mind that they would -- were going to get out, you know, or would get out some way or another.</span> <span id="s294">And they would bury their food so that they would have something to take with them, until we finally got them educated, that they could have food every day and three times a day and that they didn’t have to do that, that they were liberated.</span> <span id="s295">But here again, where could they go?</span> <span id="s296">They had no place to go, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Did you know at the time where those people were or who they were?</span> <span id="s298">Did you know if they were Jewish people or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Did you know anything about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Did you learn, after time went by?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: No, I’m sure that whatever records -- and they did have some records, I’m sure that others could tell you about this, like Colonel Case was our chaplain and he did a lot of this.</span> <span id="s304">Maybe a lot of the nurses that worked on the wards could tell you this, because they certainly got what information they could from them.</span> <span id="s305">And names and numbers, if they had any numbers.</span> <span id="s306">But I’m sure a lot of them didn’t even have names or numbers and probably couldn’t remember.</span> <span id="s307">I know that there were -- I think more Polish, maybe they were Polish Jewish, I don’t know, than there were actually just Jewish people.</span> <span id="s308">You see, this was quite awhile after the Holocaust, really.</span> <span id="s309">The Holocaust started in what, ‘42?</span> <span id="s310">‘43?</span> <span id="s311">And we were there in early ‘45.</span> <span id="s312">So a lot of this happened before we even arrived, I’m sure -- having watched the movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: You learn about it afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: When -- when did you get out of the service, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: October ‘45, I had a separation.</span> <span id="s317">That was -- yeah, 1940 -- October ‘45, in -- some time in ‘51 I was recalled.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Because I didn’t realize that when you were separated, that you were supposed to take two weeks training every year or they could recall you.</span> <span id="s320">Which they did.</span> <span id="s321">Cause at that time it was maybe --</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: What is a separation, I don’t -- I don’t know the word separation?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: You were just separated -- nobody -- at the time I got out, nobody actually had a so-called discharge.</span> <span id="s324">Everybody was just separated.</span> <span id="s325">You got your discharge later, but -- and I think at one time there was a choice too, as to whether you were discharged or just separated and I think, for some reason, I chose not to be discharged.</span> <span id="s326">And I think that I did this because -- thinking of retirement.</span> <span id="s327">Well, I was uneducated and in order to -- to do this, you had to spend two weeks training a year, which I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s328">So they recalled me, to make up I suppose for the time that I should have spent or I say should have, I -- yeah, I guess it would be.</span> <span id="s329">So -- and at that time, I was married, but I was stationed at Massachu -- in Massachusetts and eventually I got transferred to Fort Drum, which is very -- 10 miles within my home, I could live at home except when I was on call in the OR and that was probably two or three nights a week that I had to stay on call.</span> <span id="s330">And the rest of the time I could live at home and I had it made.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: That was pretty nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Well, it’s been 50 years, that’s a long time and it’s ha -- I know that memories fade, but what sticks with you about that service that you did?</span> <span id="s336">Especially at -- at Gusen, at that concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: I think it was very important and I’m not sorry a bit that we went or that I went, no.</span> <span id="s338">I think it was necessary.</span> <span id="s339">I think it was good experience, a good training.</span> <span id="s340">I think that I did a part to help.</span> <span id="s341">I guess that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: And how do you think you’re different as -- for having witnessed what you witnessed?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I don’t think I’m any different than a lot of people.</span> <span id="s344">I don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s345">I don’t understand how it could be done.</span> <span id="s346">I don’t understand a lot of things that are going on today, like in Bosnia and wherever.</span> <span id="s347">I cannot believe that some one man could be so cruel as Mr. Hitler.</span> <span id="s348">But that’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s349">There will always be wars, there will always be people like him.</span> <span id="s350">So, I don’t know -- you say, how different?</span> <span id="s351">I guess I was more educated in that line and that’s about all.</span> <span id="s352">I just never gave it any thought before and I still just can’t believe that those things happened, but they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: You never gave it any thought, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s354">Be-Before what?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Before I went in the service, I never -- I guess I probably was aware of it reading the papers, but never -- maybe then I just didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s356">I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s357">Never as aware as I was when I was there and witnessed what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Since that time, have you had people -- have you been in conversations with people who don’t believe that it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s360">In fact my niece did a theme when she was a senior and at that time there had been a lot of news in the paper about people not believing it happened and she had cut some of those out and sent them to me.</span> <span id="s361">But no, I’ve not talked with anybody who said it couldn’t have happened, no.</span> <span id="s362">I think everybody felt that it was true and maybe not to the severity of it, but they -- because I don’t think you could believe it until you saw it, really.</span> <span id="s363">Except if you had family or whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s364">Then it’s -- would be a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s368">Anything else you want to say, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: No, I can’t think of anything --</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: -- I’m sure that a lot of these girls that you have interviewed could offer you a lot more than I can, as far as that, because I wasn’t in contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s373">Some people were working on wards, ha-had a lot more --</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: And that made a lot of difference</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s376">They have different memories, yeah.</span> <span id="s377">Okay.</span> <span id="s378">Thank you, let me say this is the end of the interview with Clarice MacLeod, July 15th, 1995.</span> <span id="s379">This is Nina Ellis in West Park --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: West Park.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: -- New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">End of Tape One, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
