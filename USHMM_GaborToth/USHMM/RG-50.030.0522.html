<p><span id="s12">Question: Good morning, Lore.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Good morning, Joan.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: It’s nice to see you.</span> <span id="s15">Tell me what -- what your name was -- what -- what is your name now?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My name now is Lore Segal.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I was born Lore Groszmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: But it was Lore?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: It was Lore, and nobody can pronounce it the way my mother did, which is Loourie, you see, is the Austrian way to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: So, it was a very long O.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: In -- and in -- while I lived in England, I was Lorry, like a truck.</span> <span id="s23">But now people ask me how to pronounce it and I say o-open season, any --</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: O -- and what was your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: March 8th, 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Now tell me something.</span> <span id="s27">This is, for me, somewhat odd way to start, but you wrote a novel about your -- about your experiences in Vienna and going to England.</span> <span id="s28">Why did you decide to write a novel and not a memoir?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Because I was really less interested in the history than in being a writer.</span> <span id="s30">And for many years -- I -- I have written little stories before that, and I came to the point in my 20’s when it seemed to me I had no subject.</span> <span id="s31">I hadn’t been in love, I hadn’t died.</span> <span id="s32">None of the big events had happened to me, and I wanted to be writing.</span> <span id="s33">And it seemed to me that these stories that I did have with -- my experiences were a dime a dozen, everybody knew about them.</span> <span id="s34">And then one day I -- when i-in -- in my early days in New York, I had gone to the new school and taken a course in creative writing, and we -- the people in that class had a s -- had a -- had a party.</span> <span id="s35">And somebody said to me, how did you come to the United States?</span> <span id="s36">And I began to tell my -- my Hitler stories.</span> <span id="s37">And there was that silence in the room that I have since had as a teacher, but hadn’t experienced at that time.</span> <span id="s38">I thought, gee, wow, I have stories to tell and it a -- and -- and it came to me that these stories were my subject.</span> <span id="s39">But again, I wa -- didn’t write them because I wanted to -- what I think is now known as bearing witness.</span> <span id="s40">I wanted to be writing.</span> <span id="s41">And I -- I mean another answer is that as a novelist you can in a way -- it’s a cliché, it’s a truism, but you can be truer that you can --</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: -- by sticking to the facts.</span> <span id="s44">Can I give you an example of --</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: -- how writing as a novelist changed what might be a fact.</span> <span id="s47">One of the -- one of the chapters in “Other People’s Houses” was about my attraction for awhile to the stories of Christianity.</span> <span id="s48">No-Notice that I’m -- it’s the stories that attracted me.</span> <span id="s49">Now, in the chapter about this in “Other People’s Houses”, I made it may -- the narrative seems to suggest that it was the people in -- my foster parents at the -- of the time, my foster -- two -- two foster mothers tried to convert me.</span> <span id="s50">And when they got to -- when th -- one of them at any rate, read the story, s -- read the book, she wrote me and said, but we never tried to convert you.</span> <span id="s51">And I wrote back and said absolutely not, you didn’t.</span> <span id="s52">But for an -- for a story, to be seduced by a person is more -- is a be -- it’s a better story than being seduced by an idea.</span> <span id="s53">In fact, it’s almost impossible novelisticly to write that.</span> <span id="s54">So novels suit me better than history, or biography, or auto-biography.</span> <span id="s55">It’s a long answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: No, it’s very -- it’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s57">So is -- is doing an interview somewhat problematic for you because you are not being a novelist now, when I ask you questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s59">I will try and answer you historically.</span> <span id="s60">But I -- as we were saying earlier, once you have actually written something, or even told it a lot, something has happened to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: It -- it becomes overlaid with, I guess a skin.</span> <span id="s63">Like an anecdote gets a kind of polish on it that is almost impossible to --</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: To remove that skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: -- to remove that skin and get back.</span> <span id="s66">But it’s an interesting thing to do.</span> <span id="s67">I think it’s what one would do in -- in analysis, I think.</span> <span id="s68">When you’ve got -- you -- you go back to -- to the -- to the -- to the -- to the -- I want to say real, but you go back to the -- to the event as it happened, or try to.</span> <span id="s69">And that’s an interesting -- so this is interesting thing to do.</span> <span id="s70">I don’t know how -- how well I can unpack what was -- what was wrapped up.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Well, we-we’ll divide our -- our -- your story into a few parts.</span> <span id="s72">So let’s -- we’ll go from 28 to 38 bef -- before you actually leave Vienna.</span> <span id="s73">So when you think about your parents as a kid, what is your -- what is your earliest memory of being in Vienna?</span> <span id="s74">How -- how far back do you go?</span> <span id="s75">Cause you’re born in 1928.</span> <span id="s76">Are you five, are you four, are you six, eight?</span> <span id="s77">Do you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Well, once again, as -- as with all those memories, I don’t know what are the memories, and what are the stories told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Mm, mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: I mean, I have a lot of memories being a cute kid, very cute, and very much beloved.</span> <span id="s81">I was the only grandchild, the only child, the only grandchild, the only niece of two loving uncles.</span> <span id="s82">So I was a big deal.</span> <span id="s83">I will tell you the embarrassing story which explains this.</span> <span id="s84">My mother loved to tell the story against -- she felt it a story against herself, that she took me with her to a ladies’ café yousa, a -- a coffee klatch.</span> <span id="s85">And all the ladies were talking with each other and at the end, as my little coat was being put on, I was reported to have said, here one knows nothing, here one speaks of nothing.</span> <span id="s86">I might have been five, or six.</span> <span id="s87">And my mother said, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s88">And I said, here they don’t know that I dance on my toes.</span> <span id="s89">Here they don’t know that I -- I can do the figure eight on the ice.</span> <span id="s90">No, I must have been older, seven -- six or seven [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s91">And my mother was embarrassed and realized that I had been made too much of, and too much admired and too much praise.</span> <span id="s92">But I always thought that I’m incredibly lucky to have been brought up by two of the best people in the world that I know.</span> <span id="s93">My mother and my Uncle Paul, who -- who were both witty, loving, very, very, very much attached to me.</span> <span id="s94">Gave me a lot of space to show off.</span> <span id="s95">That was a world in which my poor very lar -- father, who was a six-footer, which was unusual for -- for a European Jew, I think, who was a -- who was an accountant, a chief accountant in the Bank of Cooksbrock and company, was an outsider.</span> <span id="s96">He was odd man out.</span> <span id="s97">He was not able to laugh, he was not able to participate in the fun that we had before he walked in the door.</span> <span id="s98">He was very dear and very lacking in imagination and became, when I was five -- this certainly is a datable event, and one that I remember, became very ill.</span> <span id="s99">He was a bleeder.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: I suppose not th-the worst degree of bleeder, otherwise he wouldn’t have survived, but he’s -- he was taking my mother is the story, for a bicycle ride along the [indecipherable] the -- the dia -- the Danube -- I don’t know what an [indecipherable] what -- what -- what -- what broke down -- wh-what -- what is -- what is supposed to hold the water in?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Dike?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s104">Anyhow, it was a long road, and they were -- they were riding along it and some partridges -- he saw some partridges and he took his hands off the bicycle and clapped and fell off and began to bleed.</span> <span id="s105">And I remember we were in my grandfather’s house in the village of Fischamend, which is some half an hour by train from Vienna.</span> <span id="s106">Very close now, 10 minutes now from the modern V-Vienna airport, and th-that my grandfather had a house on the main square of the village, a huge house with a store, with my grandfather’s straggled store at the bottom.</span> <span id="s107">And I remember my parents had their own room back there.</span> <span id="s108">My father -- remember my father flat on -- on the bed.</span> <span id="s109">He had -- he -- I-I remember particular that he was not allowed to have a -- a pillow, and oddly enough I cannot bear to lie for two seconds without a pillow under my head.</span> <span id="s110">But that -- he -- there was a bucket of ice water next to his bed with little balls of butter which he was supposed to eat.</span> <span id="s111">I don’t remem -- I have no idea what kind of a theory that was, but that was -- that’s certainly one of my earliest memories of going to see my father lying flat.</span> <span id="s112">And it was really from that moment on that he was essentially -- well, in and out of hospital is overstating it, but I -- I do remember coming home from school and my mother saying, put -- don’t take off your coat, we’re going to go see Daddy, who was once again in the hospital, always with his head flat on the -- on the -- on the white sheet.</span> <span id="s113">My mother was always cooking diet for him.</span> <span id="s114">I think one of the -- one of the perhaps mistakes my mother made in her very, very lovely relation with me is to use me as a friend to c -- to -- to co -- to have headaches with and to complain of my father’s illness, which stood for a lot of other weakness and incapacity, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: So your -- your relationship to your father never became as close as your relationship with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: It was not -- my relationship to my father was one of regret, that I was not responding adequately to the affection he had for me.</span> <span id="s117">I understood that I was not responding, and I re -- I was sorry for him.</span> <span id="s118">So was a g -- and my -- th-the man in my life was my Uncle Paul, who was then --</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Not your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: -- seven years younger than my mother, who lived with us while he went to the -- to study at the -- at medic -- at the school of medicine, a -- ma -- University of lon -- of Vienna, and lived with us and read stories to me and played the guitar for me and told me about things like -- I remember that he had a professor called Professor Tort -- I mean, Professor Death, and he told me about -- I -- I can’t think of the word now, hypo -- hyp -- hypnosis.</span> <span id="s121">I mean, here I was in my -- about seven years old, learning these fascinating things from my uncle, who would sit by my bedside and tell me -- tell me -- tell me about the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s123">Was your father jealous of Paul?</span> <span id="s124">A: My father wooed me.</span> <span id="s125">He wooed me by taking me out for ice cream, and my mother had told us not to have ice cream, it would spoil my lunch.</span> <span id="s126">It was always something the matter with what -- what my poor father did.</span> <span id="s127">I have a curious memory around the Christmastime and Vienna was full of -- of Christmas things.</span> <span id="s128">My father said, I’ll take you across the street to look into the toy shop, because it has a Father Christmas there, a Santa Claus.</span> <span id="s129">And I said, I’ve already seen it.</span> <span id="s130">And I st -- to this day I regret not giving him the satisfaction of being able to --</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: To take you.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: -- give me something that I might enjoy.</span> <span id="s133">These are -- I mean, the -- in fact, my relationship to my father seems very vivid, but it is not a -- not a -- it is always a little sad.</span> <span id="s134">And of course, he became very ill.</span> <span id="s135">As soon -- when we -- when we came to England -- one of the chapters in my book is called “The Alien”, and what it’s about is my father being ill in a foreign country.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: You know what it’s like if you’re not home and you have a cold?</span> <span id="s138">Q: It’s terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: And here he was, being ill in a w -- in a world -- you know, he was -- he was supposed to be the one who knew English, but when we came to a -- I’m -- I’m jumping to the next chapter --</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: It’s okay, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: -- but when we came to England it was my mother who promptly learned the language, who managed to do all the things that needed doing -- my father, who was incapacitated, only partly because of his illness.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: So did he know English in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: He knew English, but he didn’t know it when he got to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: England.</span> <span id="s145">But he -- so did you learn some English as a kid, before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: I did, es -- I -- we had English -- English lessons in clu -- in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: In school.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Which I don’t think that did very much except introduce a couple of --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: -- of words, which always seemed to me very peculiarly spelled.</span> <span id="s151">I went around saying pictooray.</span> <span id="s152">How can that be picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Pictooray [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: It makes no sense.</span> <span id="s155">Picstooray.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s158">But then when Hitler came, my cousin Inga and I were sent to a young lady, a young English lady who struck me as alien for two reasons.</span> <span id="s159">She was not Catholic.</span> <span id="s160">It struck me.</span> <span id="s161">I understood, I learned that she was something else, she was Protestant, which seemed to me very peculiar, because in -- in -- in -- in the other people, the other world in -- in -- in Vienna was Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: And the other thing is that when my friend, my cousin Inga and I came outside to go home, outside they waited for her -- her -- her boyfriend, who was a nats -- an SS man.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Did you like school when you went, as a kid?</span> <span id="s167">A: You know, I remember loving school, but when I think back of it, I’m not so sure.</span> <span id="s168">I remember when my children were small and I would go with them or pick them up and I walked into the school, I had a real yucky feeling and I realized, did I really like school?</span> <span id="s169">I’m not so sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: You’re not so sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: That’s for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: So what do you re -- what do you remember about it?</span> <span id="s173">Do you remem -- did you like ta --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: About school?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Yeah, did you like teach --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Oh, I was -- I was -- I was -- I was the good -- I was a good student.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: I was a very good student and I was a prig.</span> <span id="s179">I remember the first time I talk -- well in -- in -- in a Viennese school -- let me tell you about the Viennese school.</span> <span id="s180">You sat at a desk in pairs and you had your hands like this.</span> <span id="s181">I have to show it.</span> <span id="s182">Yeah, I know that, yeah.</span> <span id="s183">Like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Like that, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Your thumb was underneath the desk and your hands were -- I don’t know what they thought you would do with your hands if you let them loose.</span> <span id="s186">God knows.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: You had to stay like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: You had to stay like this.</span> <span id="s189">It seems improbable, but that’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s190">And you did not talk to your person sitting next to you.</span> <span id="s191">Oh, and if you misbehaved, you had to stand next to your desk while the lesson went on.</span> <span id="s192">If you were really bad, you stood in the corner.</span> <span id="s193">The famous you stand in the corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Is that a concept in America --</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: -- standing in the corner?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Well, we stood in the corner.</span> <span id="s200">That hardly ever happened though.</span> <span id="s201">But I once spoke to my -- to the child sitting next to me about some practical thing, like do you have a pencil, and the teacher said Lore, stand up next to your desk.</span> <span id="s202">And I stood up next to my bed and I howled.</span> <span id="s203">My virginity had been ruined, I was no longer the person who had never stood next to her desk.</span> <span id="s204">And the da -- the teacher -- my mother said the teacher afterwards said to her, I had to si -- make her sit down, I was frightened that she --</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: She was howling?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: I was howling.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Did you have lots of friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: I-I -- I -- I had best friends, yes, I did --</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Best friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: -- have best friends, yes.</span> <span id="s211">My cousin Inga was my best friend.</span> <span id="s212">And a couple of other children who had come.</span> <span id="s213">We -- had play -- play -- play dates.</span> <span id="s214">And one of the children actually not in my school, but with whom I had a play date is still an acquaintance, is still a friend.</span> <span id="s215">Now, I ha -- married to a Welsh doctor, living in England and that is the one -- that’s the one lef -- that’s the one person still -- whom I still know from that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s217">This one --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Then there was Ilse.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Who was sent to the camps with her parents, who have diphtheria and was -- was -- became deaf and was gassed.</span> <span id="s221">And I know that because her cousins, the cousins who were with them in the camps came out, and my mother many years later, they -- they made a bakery in -- in -- on Broadway, above -- above colum -- Columbia [indecipherable] Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: University?</span> <span id="s223">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: And my mother was a -- was a -- worked in that -- in that bakery.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: And my cousin Inga came to England early because her father had a -- was an importer exporter and had a London partner, so they came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: This was -- this was a mixed sc --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: We are talking --</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: This was a mixed school, yes?</span> <span id="s230">It was boys and girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: It wasn’t?</span> <span id="s233">Just girls?</span> <span id="s234">A: [indecipherable] only girls, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Is that typical?</span> <span id="s236">A: I think it was universal.</span> <span id="s237">I cannot imagine having any school that was mixed.</span> <span id="s238">I’m just thinking am I -- am I -- no, it was -- it was not mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: It was not mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: And it wasn’t just Jewish kids, it was a mixed --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Well, it was Jewish kids within a week after Hitler came.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: But that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: But before then --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Before that, it -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: -- it was -- it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: And I remember that we learned how to sew.</span> <span id="s249">We made hem stitching.</span> <span id="s250">And th --</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Hem stitching?</span> <span id="s252">A: Yes, one of the things we learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: So was it -- was it a very different kind -- do you know this -- wa -- very different kind of school than the boys had?</span> <span id="s254">Did you -- you had sewing, I’m sure they didn’t have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: I have no -- I have no idea about -- about boy’s school except through my Uncle Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Which is, of course, a generation, or half a generation earlier, who went to the gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Which was a different -- different kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span

id="s263">Do you hear about Hitler in Germany?</span> <span id="s264">[indecipherable] hear things?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yes, I remember -- I remember -- now here I’m coming across one of those problems that what a -- what -- what I me -- I mean, yes, except in my book, for instance, I start with this event of a dinner where this was discussed, but I’m sure it was discussed constantly.</span> <span id="s266">And my Uncle Paul saying we should leave.</span> <span id="s267">Now, this is 30-something, if I remember it.</span> <span id="s268">I mean, I’m born in thirt -- in ’28 --</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: ’28, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: I left in ’38, at 10, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: So when does

id="s281">A: We got our news over the radio, and I remember hearing about the Spanish Civil War and having one of those total revelations.</span> <span id="s282">There is always war.</span> <span id="s283">I suddenly knew as a child, there is no place -- time when there isn’t war.</span> <span id="s284">I understood that, because I had seen the first World War pictures in my grand -- you know, iv -- a -- postcards with pictures of young ladies who -- and -- and messages to soldiers.</span> <span id="s285">You know, in -- in the sort of circular -- the -- the oval sha -- the oval shape.</span> <span id="s286">And I knew about the first World War, and here was the Spanish Civil War, and it came to me that war is one of the things tha-that -- that’s -- that’s always there in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Did that scare you?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: And what -- horrified me, as a -- and it was one of those real-realizations that -- that stays with you for life.</span> <span id="s289">But I do remember my Uncle Paul saying, probably not that realistic, because he didn’t do it either, we should all leave.</span> <span id="s290">And my father making fun of him, saying what do you mean leave, where are we going to go?</span> <span id="s291">Going to go to the jungle and eat coconuts?</span> <span id="s292">And I said to my mother, what is go -- and I had that -- you know, that -- that -- you know that feeling that the -- the -- the release of gall into your -- into your -- I don’t know how you can feel gall in you, but that’s the -- that’s the experience I remember.</span> <span id="s293">And turning to my mother and saying I -- what -- what’s going to happen?</span> <span id="s294">Is there going to be a war?</span> <span id="s295">And my mother said no, no, no, no, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s296">And my thinking, okay, I won’t worry.</span> <span id="s297">I’m just going to not worry, cause I don’t know how to worry.</span> <span id="s298">The problem was, when you’re a child -- or not -- when you’re a grown-up too, somebody mentions a calamity, and you kind of believe it, but how do you imagine it?</span> <span id="s299">What -- what is it going to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: What’s going to happen?</span> <span id="s302">Who’s going to do what to whom, you know?</span> <span id="s303">So, let’s not think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: But for you, you did write a sh -- a l -- a -- before the book, I think, on “Other People’s Houses”, where you start talking about every -- no, it’s something else, but everywhere around you is calamity.</span> <span id="s305">When you -- when you realize when you had children --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: That’s the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: That’s actually the last -- the last -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: It’s the last -- the last line that there’s a calamity all --</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: The -- the -- the thing that I think se --</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: -- surrounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: -- that seems to me something that came to me as a result of hearing about the Spanish Civil War, th-the end of my -- my book says I’m -- at the moment -- in a moment of -- of -- of peace.</span> <span id="s313">I have a husband, I have children --</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: -- my mother is here, nobody is sick.</span> <span id="s316">It feels like a -- an island, the season of -- of peace in the -- on an island, surrounded by calamity.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Surrounded by calamity.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: And by that I mean it isn’t calamity -- it’s not only the calamity -- the -- a political calamity -- I mean death is -- is a calamity, it’s the final calamity, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s320">Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: -- yeah, there are no -- there are no good outcomes.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: But that was -- that was a very, very early --</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: -- it’s a -- was a very early understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Your mother didn’t work when you were a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Wi -- before -- before she came to England --</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: -- right?</span> <span id="s331">But was -- she was a musician?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: She went to the music academy in Vienna, was a talented -- talented pianist, but of -- not -- not -- not in the grand -- in the grand s-style.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I mean, she was not going to be a concert pianist.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: She wa -- she was a -- did not like to perform, but there were -- there was a piano in our house and -- and she wa -- she practiced.</span> <span id="s337">She had th-this imagination of -- I mean, there is always -- there was always practicing going on.</span> <span id="s338">In fact, I remember her playing Chopin and say -- an-and -- and I s -- I used to sit and listen, and I thought this was really something else, this was [indecipherable] lovely.</span> <span id="s339">And my mother would say, Chopin is nothing to Bach.</span> <span id="s340">And I thought, oh Bach -- I didn’t know what Bach was.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: And I don’t know which of those things Bach was, but Bach -- I took -- I took my -- my -- my taste from my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: So you like Bach?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: You che -- I like Bach better than Chopin, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Still?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: -- didn’t re -- oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Oh, I’ve go -- I mean I -- yes, I caught up.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: You caught up and --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yes, I think -- I think pretense is sometimes a very good teacher, because you -- if you say Bach is better, then you begin to listen to Bach, and you say hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: But i -- it takes you years to catch up with your -- with your phony --</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s354">Did your mother teach you piano as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: She did, it was a disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Well, because I -- I didn't want to practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: You didn’t want to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: I -- I did eventually take piano for quite a time and became a reasonable proficient, but the fact that I no longer remember a note is a sign that I was really not -- that was not my -- you know, I thought at one point I was going to be a painter, I was going to be a pianist, I was going to be a -- oh, I was going to be a -- an ice -- ice skater.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: But actually I was a writer.</span> <span id="s362">I was always going to be a writer [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: You were always going to be a writer.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Once I settled down to that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s366">Was your house very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s368">I find it interesting that my grandparents, my mother’s parents, my Hungarian born grandparents did not have any notion of Yiddish and had absolutely no relation with -- with the ortho -- orth -- I-I mean, the Orthodoxy is just too far away.</span> <span id="s369">I don’t think my par -- grandparents would have known when the Jewish holidays were.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: My mother’s family.</span> <span id="s372">However, my grandmother would not eat ham.</span> <span id="s373">She served it to us, but wouldn’t eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Whereas my father’s parents, who had died by the time my mother married, ow -- h-he was -- came from Pressbourg, one of those places that was Hungarian in language, but became Czech by the time the first World War was over.</span> <span id="s376">I gather that they were Orthodox, or that there was -- you know, everybody you talked to had -- everybody’s father or grandfather was chief rabbi of something.</span> <span id="s377">Well, mine were too, except I’ve never -- I’ve never followed through on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: So you’re not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: I’m not sure, but I th -- I’m sure they were religious, and that my father said to my mother, we are going to have a kosher house, we’re going to have a religious house, and my mother said like -- like how?</span> <span id="s380">And then there’s a sort of a nasty story.</span> <span id="s381">This is one of the nasty stories, that my father asked my mother to light Shabbas candles and she did, and then he took out a cigarette and lit the cigarette on the candle, and Mother said -- my mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: That’s the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: That’s the end of that.</span> <span id="s384">That was the end of her.</span> <span id="s385">And yet, she would say the Shema with me every night.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Every night?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Every night.</span> <span id="s388">I -- I mean at some point, I -- I was made to say the Shema by my mother.</span> <span id="s389">I don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s390">And we did spend the high holidays in the synagogue, but it was a synagogue that was created only for the high holidays, it was really a -- a Jewish restaurant.</span> <span id="s391">And I think -- that’s what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: We have to change the tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: You went to Hebrew classes?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes, God save the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: When --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: He-Hebrew classes are famously unsuccessful.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: I went to two Hebrew classes, one in Vienna, and one in -- in the f -- my f -- in -- in Guilford and they were both terrible.</span> <span id="s401">Why are they so awful?</span> <span id="s402">The wa -- I -- I remember the one in Vienna mostly because there was a naughty boy there, and I made it my job to inform him.</span> <span id="s403">I did not do a good job.</span> <span id="s404">My job at reforming him and telling him not to clap the -- you know, to keep opening and closing the -- the -- the -- the lids of the desks, and sitting still.</span> <span id="s405">It -- it didn’t work, but I also remember absolutely nothing I learned there.</span> <span id="s406">I did not -- I was supposed to learn the -- the -- the Hebrew letters, and it’s gone.</span> <span id="s407">I mean, there’s nothing left at all -- of this at all.</span> <span id="s408">I just remember this being unsuc -- unsuccessful teaching.</span> <span id="s409">And that --</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: And you’re trying to keep this bad boy [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: I was -- I was going to reform him, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Reform him, yes.</span> <span id="s413">You have that in you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: No longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: No longer</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: It’s gone.</span> <span id="s417">I got tha -- rid of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Oh, that’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Those were my wild oats, reforming little boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: So why do you think your mother was having you do the Shema?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: I cannot imagine, because she was very disappointed in me, in her old age, because I became fascinated by Hebrew texts.</span> <span id="s422">I ha -- with my -- with my dear friend Jules Harlow, Rabbi Jules Harlow, translated the -- wrot -- did the translation of the wa -- the book of Adam to Moses, which was published by [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s423">I mean I -- I did -- I -- I -- I now attend a -- a -- a monthly Genesis seminar.</span> <span id="s424">My mother is very disappointed in me, she really had -- she was a genuine non-believer and thought this was all a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s425">So her, in my childhood, making me say the Shema is a mystery to me.</span> <span id="s426">Perhaps my father wanted it.</span> <span id="s427">It’s one of those things that has no --</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Was this very uncomfortable for you because you --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Not at all, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: -- not at --</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: -- it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: It was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: No, it was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: I mean, I had my -- I had my bath and said the Shema.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Did you say the -- the Shema in bed, right before --</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Said the Shema in bed, I -- as I remember, yes.</span> <span id="s438">I also remember that those high holidays that we spent in -- in the -- in the synagogue, I remember sitting with my mother upstairs with the women -- must have been a synagogue.</span> <span id="s439">It must have been a synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Must have been a synagogue of some kind if you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: And downstairs I remember my father with his prayer -- with the sh -- what do you call it, the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: The tallis?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: With the tallis, doing the -- that -- that curious, that to me very curious bobbing up and down.</span> <span id="s444">I remember being allowed to go out with the other children when we got obstreperous and w-w-we -- there were -- there were some stairs and there was a little boy and I who made a lot of noise clattering up and down the stairs and co -- and -- and sliding on the banisters.</span> <span id="s445">The shamas came and gave us a bad time and made us go outside, and that’s -- those are th -- my memories of that.</span> <span id="s446">Oh, and we had Seders and the Seders were always -- my father actually, I wa -- think very tenderly of my father sitting patiently at the head of the table, doing what he was supposed to do as the leader of the Seder and everybody else making fun.</span> <span id="s447">My -- my Uncle Paul would put the parsley, th-the -- the bitter herbs into his lapel.</span> <span id="s448">My mother would come down the [indecipherable] and make a line and top them up and ma -- and make a summation.</span> <span id="s449">I mean, was a -- it was a -- it was a good joke then.</span> <span id="s450">And I always, of course, spilled the red wine.</span> <span id="s451">Always --</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: -- spilled the red wine on the white tablecloth.</span> <span id="s454">Every time, yes.</span> <span id="s455">That was my thing for me to do was to spill the red wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: But not on purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Not on purpose, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: But you would spill it.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Every time, as I remember, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: And that’s tough to get out of the white tablecloth, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s461">A: And that was my degree of my Jewish education.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: So, this place that you went to that was a synagogue sounds like it was Orthodox, but you wouldn’t know, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Because of the separation of men and women, one would think that it was in s --</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Oh, but wasn’t that [indecipherable] I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: It’s Conservative as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: I’m not su -- I wonder whether there were in Vienna in 1935, Reform synagogues?</span> <span id="s468">I’d --</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: You think you [indecipherable] I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: -- would they -- I mean you would know more about it than I. I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: No, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I -- I really don’t know whether there was any such thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: I -- i-it’s maybe even Conservative --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: -- am now very much in doubt that mu -- it must have been a synagogue.</span> <span id="s477">I think it -- only that we didn't go there, except on the high holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: That I thought it only existed on --</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Existed on the holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: -- I think that.</span> <span id="s482">I -- I -- I -- that -- that seems to me a more reasonable explanation than -- than --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Now, for those people who may watch the interview, who don’t know what a Shema is, could you explain what the Shema is?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Oh, you don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Well, it is the one -- isn’t it the sort of daily prayer?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: And that’s about as much as I know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Do you remember it?</span> <span id="s490">The Shema?</span> <span id="s491">A: I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: You don’t.</span> <span id="s493">Did your mother translate it for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: No.</span> <span id="s496">She just told you to say it.</span> <span id="s497">Shema Yisrael --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Eloheinu echad.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Yeah, that’s part of it --</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Then the elohein --</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: -- there’s a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: -- there’s an eloheinu echad [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: No, I don’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: And how long did you say this?</span> <span id="s506">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: As long as I was at home with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: In Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: In Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: And that -- not later.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Well, there was no later.</span> <span id="s512">There was no later.</span> <span id="s513">Afterwards we -- we sta -- we spend a little time in Fischamend with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s514">I have no particular memory, but I would have thought that that would be an evening ritual that would continue.</span> <span id="s515">Then, when we got thrown out of the Fischamend house, I had to go and stay with a friend because there was nowhere for us to live.</span> <span id="s516">And from then on I went to -- on the Kindertransport.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Right, and so you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Lived for only four months with a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s519">All the other families I lived with --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Were not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: -- were not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s523">So when you went back with your parents, with your mother and father, that’s -- that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: My father had died --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Died --</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: -- my -- and I was then with my mother ma -- the f -- I lived with my mother for a little while in London where we shared a -- an apart-apart --</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s528">And then sh --</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: -- a -- a room while I went to the university.</span> <span id="s530">Then she went on to join the family in the Dominican Republic.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: The Dominican Republic, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: I then joined them, those -- m-my grandparents and uncle had absolutely no relation with --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: -- with Jewish performance.</span> <span id="s535">But I had a little time of being Orthodox in the first -- with the Cohens.</span> <span id="s536">I loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: You loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: I really liked that.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Well, we’ll get -- we’ll get to that in a -- in a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: But it’s also -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: It’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: A-And then I come back in my -- in my -- in my -- in my late life to a -- a real -- real fascination with the texts.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: And just --</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: I’ve gone to Talmud classes, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s546">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s547">I mean, superficially.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Yes, but it’s interesting --</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: -- that there’s such a move.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s552">Somebody asked me the other day, one of -- one of the many things you get asked, give me your seven -- seven favorite books, right?</span> <span id="s553">The Bible.</span> <span id="s554">Grimm’s Fairy Tales.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: But the Bible comes first, as literature, you know?</span> <span id="s557">So, what can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: But as a kid growing up, there’s very little connection --</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: In -- in Vienna.</span> <span id="s561">There’s these strange kinds of connections, but no real knowledge with respect to what this is, so you don’t even know what the Shema --</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Only one thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Mm-hm?</span> <span id="s564">A: A friend of mine, Ruth Gay -- I don’t know -- you probably know her work.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: I do know the name, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s567">Ruth Gay once said to me, did you have any non-Jewish friends in Vienna?</span> <span id="s568">And I -- I thou -- I looked my -- I thought the kids with whom I played --</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: -- that were chosen for me to play with, or the people who visited my parents, none.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: None.</span> <span id="s573">Not a one.</span> <span id="s574">There were no non-Jewish members of the social world in which we lived, either -- either in my at -- at -- it’s -- in -- at my age, or at my parents’.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: So, not even close friends in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: No.</span> <span id="s577">And that was not by any -- any o-order by any by-law or by any choice, just who would you invite home, or who invited you home, these were always Jewish children.</span> <span id="s578">It’s very strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: But maybe not so strange in a society that really had a segregation to it, that you as a kid can’t help.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: But the segregation at school was self-segregated.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Self, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: We were -- there were cr -- I mean, it was a regular wa -- regular public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: And it was not a particularly Jewish district, so there would be many different -- the wa -- it was not a je -- a Jew -- as it turned out later, it was not a Jewish schooling by any means.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Very strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: And your neighborhood was mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Mixed, totally mixed, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Totally mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: And did you live in a house, or lived in an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Lived in an apartment building that was four flights high.</span> <span id="s593">It was a block through con -- it consisted of one, two, three -- three or four -- fours floor high buildings separated by yards, by square yards, and there was a pathway -- a -- a -- a g -- a -- a way through from one end to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: So there was an inner courtyard?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: There wer -- there wer -- there were two inner courtyards.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Probably two inner courtyards.</span> <span id="s598">Maybe it’s four -- four inner courtyards, probably, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: So did you have a room for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I did not.</span> <span id="s601">It was -- no, there was a -- you know, when I went back in 1938 with my husband, we went up to the apartment and I rang the bell and the woman who lived in it put the chain on and wouldn’t let me in.</span> <span id="s602">But my husband’s -- a-a-and I said, you know, I remember the geography.</span> <span id="s603">Now, I think this is pretty interesting.</span> <span id="s604">We don’t realize that what makes the impact is not the color of the walls, not the quality of the furniture, but the geography.</span> <span id="s605">You walk in, there’s a bathroom here, but the kind of bathroom that’s only a toilet.</span> <span id="s606">There’s the kitchen here, the maid’s room -- the miserable maid’s room o-on -- beyond it.</span> <span id="s607">There’s the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s608">There’s a thing called this gas castle.</span> <span id="s609">I don’t know, it was a ga -- it was a big piece of -- of -- of -- of furniture inside which I suppose was some kind of the ga -- ga -- I don’t know what -- what to --</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Gas?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: I am going to leave this.</span> <span id="s612">I can only tell you was called the gas -- the -- th-the thing that contained the gas.</span> <span id="s613">And then over here is the door that leads into the Herrenzimmer, which is the equivalent of the living room.</span> <span id="s614">Next door is the -- the dining room with a table so huge that there’s only a gangway around it, except my mother’s piano is in there, so my memory is clearly not as efficient.</span> <span id="s615">And then there’s my parent’s bedroom.</span> <span id="s616">And then -- oh, th-th-the -- the f -- the front -- the -- that foyer is L-shaped, leads to my parent’s bedroom, and the -- and the -- and the bathroom here.</span> <span id="s617">And there, very often, one of the uncles stayed.</span> <span id="s618">My -- I had my Uncle Paul, or my uncle -- my -- Mimi, my father’s brother.</span> <span id="s619">And all my grand -- my parents slept in the -- in the -- in the -- that room, and I slept in the -- in the -- in the living room with a -- a be -- a bed put up for whatever uncle was sleeping there.</span> <span id="s620">When my ca -- parents had guests, which happened fairly often, they would -- I would be put to bed in my parent’s bedroom because they would use the living room as a part of the -- of the -- of the events of the evening.</span> <span id="s621">And I would listen to the fun and games, the telling of jo -- I-I think my parent’s social life de -- consisted of telling jokes.</span> <span id="s622">So here would be people sitting around this big table, and there would be one voice speaking, and then everybody would burst into laughter, and then would be another voice.</span> <span id="s623">And I was trying to listen.</span> <span id="s624">And I had this notion that they put me to bed early.</span> <span id="s625">I’ve checked this out with children, my grandchildren for instance, do you hate going to bed?</span> <span id="s626">Yes, because that’s when all the fun starts.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: You listen -- right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Do you remember that?</span> <span id="s629">Q: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: You think that they just getting you off to bed so they can do their thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Thing, right.</span> <span id="s632">And you would listen --</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Especially when there were people there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: So did you hear the jokes?</span> <span id="s637">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: -- but I remember the jokes that -- when there were no guests there, or -- or when I was not in bed.</span> <span id="s640">Those jokes I was sent out of the room for.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: I mean, there -- there were jokes that I was allowed to listen to, those were the bathroom jokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: And then I guess there were others.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: That you were not allowed to listen to.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Which was a waste of time sending me out, I wouldn’t have understood them anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Right [laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: That was a total waste.</span> <span id="s649">But there were those jokes also.</span> <span id="s650">But most of the jokes of Viennese -- of the Viennese class of my parents were bathroom jokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Bathroom jokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Bathroom jokes.</span> <span id="s653">But, well there’s a -- a -- I’m reminded of my grandchildren, all of whom go through the poopy --</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: -- poopy jokes.</span> <span id="s656">I think these were poopy jokes.</span> <span id="s657">I don’t know what else they [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: But they were adult poopy jokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Adult poopy jokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: And then there was a whole class of joke that were about Graf Bobby, o-or -- or -- what is Graf in -- in -- is it Duke Bobby?</span> <span id="s662">They were Jewish jokes about the aristocracy, about the -- the -- the -- the -- the shabby -- the shabby po -- you know, the -- the -- the a-aristocracy that had lost its power and its -- its m -- power mind by intermarriages and so on, and so there were Graf Bobby jokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: But this was about Jewish acris -- a-aristocracy --</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: No, it’s everything --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: -- it was the Jewish joke about the --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: -- about --</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: -- about the --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: -- about making fun of the aristocracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s672">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: I’ll tell you one joke.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Graf Bobby and his best friend Tony are sitting in the park and -- poopy joke -- and the little bird poops on Graf Bobby’s hat.</span> <span id="s676">And Graf Bobby takes off his hat and tells -- and asks his friend for a little piece of paper to wipe it off -- oh no, he -- he starts wiping and his -- his -- his friend give -- oh, that’s it, his friend gives him a little piece of his newspaper and Graf Bobby says, because of that I’m not going to climb up on the tree.</span> <span id="s677">To wipe the behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: To wipe the --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: That’s -- that’s a typical joke.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: This is -- is a typical joke.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yeah, yes, that both makes fun of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s682">And interestingly, the Graf Bobby jokes traveled with us to England.</span> <span id="s683">So one Graf Bobby joke would be Graf cha -- Bobby is now a pilot and is coming to bomb London.</span> <span id="s684">And he goes back to Vienna with the load of bombs still in his plane, and his -- and they say to him, how could you -- don’t you understand how dangerous it is for you to land?</span> <span id="s685">Why didn’t you drop them over London?</span> <span id="s686">And Graf Bobby says, because as -- just as I arrived the all clear went off.</span> <span id="s687">They’re Polish jokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: They’re Polish, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: They’re Polish jokes, but it’s making fun.</span> <span id="s690">I mean, it’s a Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Who is Graf Bobby?</span> <span id="s692">What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Graf Bobby is a universal aristocrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: And what the -- what the Jewish joke is saying is they’re all fools.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: You have to make fools of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: -- who -- who don’t let you join their club.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Club, right, right.</span> <span id="s701">Do you remember your 10th birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Was that significant?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: I remember particularly because my -- my dance teacher was invited and I had a crush on my dance teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Steffi Stile.</span> <span id="s709">I don’t know whether she came or not, but that’s really all I remember.</span> <span id="s710">I -- I also remember getting a -- getting a -- a turtle, but I don’t know whether that was the ninth or the 10th birthday.</span> <span id="s711">And this turtle would not do anything but sleep, until it was put into the bathtub with a little bit of warm water, and then it went.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yeah, I remember my turtle.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Was a teeny turtle, a little one?</span> <span id="s715">A: No, a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Oh, it was a big

id="s728">A: My mother, maybe [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Was -- it’s interesting, why a turtle?</span> <span id="s730">A: I mean, that was the only animal we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: We didn’t have a dog, we didn’t have a cat in -- in -- in -- in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: In Vienna people didn’t have animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: I had a bird.</span> <span id="s735">I had --</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: You had a bird?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span

person you told stories about.</span> <span id="s812">She was the foolish aunt who -- it’s not worth telling those stories, but -- but that’s -- that was her -- her purpose in life was to make ma -- give -- give my mother stories to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: But you have one story that you tell about her for that night, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Y-Yes --</span></p>

her skirts and says, let me see your ne -- do you have new pants -- panties on?</span> <span id="s817">That was one of the stories.</span> <span id="s818">It may not be true, but that was -- that was a Tante Erna story.</span> <span id="s819">Oh, I tell you one other Tante Erna story, when she gave my cousin Inga a new doll for her birthday, she kept the box and wrapped the box again in tissue paper and put it on top so that the doll wouldn’t get dirty.</span> <span id="s820">That was another Tante Erna story.</span> <span id="s821">A true Tante Erna story.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: That’s -- that’s a true one.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: That’s a true one.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: So -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: She wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: -- your cousin never played with the doll.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: No, because it would get -- it would get dirty.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s829">You had dolls as a kid, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Were they important to you as dolls?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Unsatisfactory.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Unsatisfactory.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yes, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Can’t remember.</span> <span id="s837">They were always promised more than -- than -- they were not babies, I think.</span> <span id="s838">Th-Th-They were just dolls.</span> <span id="s839">I can’t remember being particularly enthralled.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Did you want a sister or a brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s842">Yes.</span> <span id="s843">I asked my mother for a sister or brother.</span> <span id="s844">And I think after awhile she said, well you know, Daddy is not well.</span> <span id="s845">We -- we wouldn’t have a -- i-i-i-it’s not a good idea.</span> <span id="s846">I wa -- I wasn’t -- I was not persuaded by this argument.</span> <span id="s847">I did -- that’s why I -- you know, I showed you the picture of my parents when they took me into the Alps, they provided some little kid to play with --</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: -- to make up for this li -- brother or sister I didn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Unsatisfactory, totally unsatisfactory.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s853">And her explanation didn’t work for you either.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: No, I -- I kept wishing.</span> <span id="s855">I-I wish to this day that there was a -- a -- a -- somebody who’ll remember the same things that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s857">They don’t remember the same things, that’s the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: No?</span> <span id="s859">That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: They remember different things.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: But the -- oh, the -- the evening of the 12th, I think there must have been that expectation of calamity, of a mi -- of -- of real calamity, immediate calamity.</span> <span id="s862">My Uncle Paul was there --</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: -- and I remember them -- I -- I mean, I don’t know what was in the newspapers, I remember my Uncle Paul calling a friend of his who was a journalist, and being told not yet.</span> <span id="s865">So there must have been in th -- i-it -- it must have been absolutely obvious what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s866">And in the middle of the meal -- we had the radio on in order to f -- to keep in touch with what was happening, and they stopped the -- the -- they stopped whatever was going on in the radio and Schuschnigg, the -- the ka -- cha-chancellor gave his goodbye speech.</span> <span id="s867">Now, I quote it in my book and it’s -- it’s -- it shows what a bad scholar I am that I didn’t look up what he actually said.</span> <span id="s868">I mean, it is easily r -- it’s on the records, but I -- I put down what I remembered, which is only partially true.</span> <span id="s869">And after he had spinish -- the speech more or less said, I wish my -- my -- there’s going to be a change in -- in regime and I wish you all a bearable future is the way I remembered it.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: And then they played for the last time, the Austrian National Anthem, and my Tante Erna said to my mother, they’re playing it slower than usual.</span> <span id="s872">And my -- and my mother said, it’s the -- it’s probably the same record they -- they always used.</span> <span id="s873">And Tante Erna said, Franzi, you, a musician, you don’t hear that they’re playing it slower than usual?</span> <span id="s874">And my mother said, Erna, you are a cow.</span> <span id="s875">You don’t understand what has just happened to us.</span> <span id="s876">And Tante Erna said, Ernst, my coat.</span> <span id="s877">This is what she has said to me, this is what she calls me.</span> <span id="s878">My mother said, please Erna, I am sorry, we are all th -- you know, in this -- in this th -- your world had just stopped.</span> <span id="s879">Yo-You -- you -- yo-you’re going to be -- probably be -- likely to be dead in the next year and here you are, the nerves are acting in this -- in this human way.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: And Tante Erna and Uncle Ernst left.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: They did leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: They left.</span> <span id="s884">But of course, they come back into the picture, because they are the ones who have the contact with London.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: And they were the ones to whom I sent my letters to help.</span> <span id="s887">So they are make -- play a big part in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s889">Let’s stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Do you remember your mother calling Tante Erna a cow?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Clearly, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: You -- you were sitting there?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Oh yes, yes, I was sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Were you shocked?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: I can’t remember my reaction, but I do remember watching my mother trying to take it back --</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: -- and apologizing, and the apology not being taken -- a-accepted.</span> <span id="s900">But I at that time was already cla -- clearly aware that Tante Erna was the butt of jo -- not the butt of jokes, but the butt of stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: So I al-already understood that.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: That she was a comic character whom one told stories about.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s906">It’s a very interesting use of the word cow though, that -- that your mother uses it --</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: [indecipherable] kuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: -- [indecipherable] just kuh is just stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Erna [indecipherable] kuh.</span> <span id="s910">It sounds better in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Were you at that moment aware that something was going on now in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s915">But of course that event, that little -- little interplay with Erna [indecipherable] kuh --</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: -- it -- it didn’t lighten it, but it gave one -- it’s almost like giving you -- giving you time to breathe before you were fully in it, bef -- let me tell you something which -- which may be irrelevant, but I once watched a shooting from my window on 77nd Street.</span> <span id="s918">I looked -- I happened to be looking town -- ah, down and -- from the 10th floor and a man came running out, holding his hand -- arm like this, which was bleeding.</span> <span id="s919">And I saw somebody -- two people running away and the man was yelling for the police.</span> <span id="s920">And I called my husband to come and watch, and we stood and we watched this.</span> <span id="s921">The man went back inside, he came back outside.</span> <span id="s922">It took some five or 10 minutes before the police came, bef -- all of a sudden there were a mass of people standing around, something had happened.</span> <span id="s923">I’m always been interested in the gap in time between what happened and the world’s reaction, or even one’s own reaction.</span> <span id="s924">And that al -- I always connect that.</span> <span id="s925">I mean, it may be very far fetched, but I always connect that with that -- the b -- the axe has fallen, but th -- a -- a time -- th-th-there’s a time in which you don’t know what to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s927">And you don’t even notice --</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Do you remember in Fahrenheit -- what’s his name -- shows our president --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Bradbury, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: -- sitting with the children whom he was being a president for.</span> <span id="s931">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s932">Do you remember the scene?</span> <span id="s933">Q: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: He sits for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s935">He’s just been told that 911 has occurred, what we now think of as 911.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s937">Ri-Ri-Ri-Ri-Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: He sits.</span> <span id="s939">He does nothing.</span> <span id="s940">He does nothing.</span> <span id="s941">The -- you gi -- you see the -- the aid bending down to tell him this, and he sits.</span> <span id="s942">And then, of course, everything explodes.</span> <span id="s943">It’s that moment, that -- to be [indecipherable] that’s -- that’s what that represents in my memory.</span> <span id="s944">Before you actually sit up and say, now our lives are totally changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: We are now in imminent danger, but it doesn’t hit you.</span> <span id="s947">You have to ha -- you have to have that -- that moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Do you -- do you -- were you around when Hitler comes through Vienna, in that car?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: I was around.</span> <span id="s950">I didn't see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: You didn’t see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: I didn’t see him.</span> <span id="s953">But mine -- my -- mine -- my next experience is of being taken down s -- by my -- to my parents on the very next morning, going to the bank -- you know, when I go back to Vienna, I look fo -- at that -- at that door still.</span> <span id="s954">It’s not a bank any more, but it was a building that had -- Vienna has so-some of the -- the -- the door seems to have been cut off of it.</span> <span id="s955">The door -- i-if you ha -- you have a square -- I mean, a corner --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: -- but the corner is cu -- is -- is cut off so that the door is -- I don’t know how to explain it, geo -- geometrically, but I remember, I still look for that.</span> <span id="s958">And we went to that door, and the door was locked, or in the process of being locked, and there were lots of people standing out on the -- on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s959">People trying to get their money out --</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: -- before -- before it was -- disappeared forever, and we were already too late.</span> <span id="s962">I don’t know what the financial situation was, but we know -- we did not get our money out, certainly not that day, because it was locked.</span> <span id="s963">And my -- and there were -- it was a very bright day, it was one of those beautiful March -- March days with -- that sa -- the -- I always think of the sun in Vienna being whiter and cleaner than anything is nowadays.</span> <span id="s964">Maybe -- maybe in -- in th-the light over the o -- b-by the Great Lakes in -- in wa -- in Chicago has some of that light.</span> <span id="s965">But it was that kind of light and there were flags up and it was jolly.</span> <span id="s966">And people kept li -- raising their hands.</span> <span id="s967">There’s a very, very moving little picture, horribly moving, in -- in the movie “Into the Arms of Strangers” where a grandmother is trying to get her four year old to raise his hand --</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: To raise his hand, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: -- and he won’t.</span> <span id="s970">He doesn’t know what she wants from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s972">But you --</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: But I thought it was very charming, I thought it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s974">And -- and you know, it looked very cheerful.</span> <span id="s975">And my parents rushed me back up home.</span> <span id="s976">So when you ask me what did I know, it’s again one of those very, very unclear -- I did know, and yet I didn’t understand why I was being rushed back into the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: So it didn’t feel dangerous to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Didn’t feel dane -- in fact it felt very gay.</span> <span id="s979">It felt very merry.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: So when they took you back upstairs you don’t recall you --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: I -- but I certainly understood their haste, and their -- that they were upset.</span> <span id="s982">I understand -- understood that very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: You understood that.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: But you didn’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: At the moment I did not know why, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: So, at -- th-th -- th-that’s one of the curious things of what a child of 10 does and doesn’t understand of that large political picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s990">And they didn’t sit you down and say here’s the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: -- and why would --</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: You know something?</span> <span id="s994">It’s so interesting -- we -- we talk a lot about what is and is not told us.</span> <span id="s995">I mean, we are now doing a -- a wrap-up of -- of an event, how -- did I ever sit my children -- I happened to have written a book about it.</span> <span id="s996">But if I hadn’t, would I have sat my children down --</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: -- and explained it?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Explained it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: I mean, explaining the facts of life is -- is one of those awful things that nobody knows how to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: And explaining the facts of history and of politics, is -- if we don’t -- we don’t -- we don’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: We don’t do it.</span> <span id="s1004">We don’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Can you imagine the moment in a life?</span> <span id="s1006">I -- is it after breakfast?</span> <span id="s1007">Is it at breakfast?</span> <span id="s1008">Do you say, when you’ve had your bath, put on your pajamas and I’ll tell you something?</span> <span id="s1009">There is no time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: We don’t explain things to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: It’s -- it is interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: It’s -- it’s -- it’s very interesting --</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: It’s very interesting, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: -- that th -- we -- that is -- you know, is it our culture, or -- or -- or -- or is it just hu-human that we don’t actually have -- it’s not part of what we do, to tell each other, to explain things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Well, especially to children.</span> <span id="s1017">I-I-It’s as if e-either we think that children don’t need to know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Or -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: -- or they get so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: -- they get it anywa -- somehow people get it.</span> <span id="s1022">I mean, often we don’t explain to each other, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1024">I’m really very interested in this.</span> <span id="s1025">There’s -- I kno -- I know the -- the -- they -- there’s now a kit that you can get from the Smithsonian about interviewing your relative.</span> <span id="s1026">But certainly that -- but -- but that’s an un -- it’s an un-unnatural thing.</span> <span id="s1027">It’s a -- it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: It is unnatural.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: -- it’s an artifact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: And it’s very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Very hard to do, yeah, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Much harder to do than someone you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: I think it is.</span> <span id="s1034">I -- I did debrief my grandfather for my book and I got him to tell me his childhood stories.</span> <span id="s1035">But it was be -- for a purpose.</span> <span id="s1036">It -- it wouldn’t have occurred to me to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: To do it otherwise, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: It’s funny, one of the curiosities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: So I know, when I ask somebody who is a child, did your parents explain, there are ways in which I know there’s no explanation --</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: There’s no explanation, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: -- and yet I want --</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: -- yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: -- I w -- I want to know, because maybe there was something.</span> <span id="s1044">But you felt something in their bodies.</span> <span id="s1045">That’s -- you did feel tension.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Oh, for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: For sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: So you knew something was wro --</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: And you become agitated yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: I nearly became frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: And you don’t have -- you -- and how -- and anyway, how would you understand it [indecipherable] really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: I mean how -- what -- what [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: What would you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Now, it’s interesting, when I did ex-explain, I -- I used that scene in my book, be -- the conversation between my Uncle Paul and my father.</span> <span id="s1059">That explains in the book to somebody who doesn’t know, what was happening.</span> <span id="s1060">But I don’t think that was ever -- I -- I don’t think that happened.</span> <span id="s1061">That’s the way a writer -- I mean the writers -- the -- one of thing -- the first thing writers have to do is to introduce the reader to what they’re talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: But in life that doesn’t happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: You have to create something that doesn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Yeah, you have to -- you have to i-in -- you know, you go to an Ibsen play and in the first [indecipherable] the bil -- the beans have to be spilled of what you have to know before you can start the story.</span> <span id="s1066">Not in life, you don’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1068">So when is the first time that you experienced something that has to do with the Nazis, besides seeing the flags and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: I think that’s it, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: And then of course, the next thing is that at school, in the weeks before Hitler, everybody became intensely Austrian.</span> <span id="s1072">And my -- the teacher had made us -- in our class we had made posters that said [speaks German here].</span> <span id="s1073">Red, white, red to the -- to -- to the death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: It’s in -- interesting that I suppose there was still an assumption, at least in my school, from the top down I assume, that we were refusing to be annexed by Hitler.</span> <span id="s1076">On the day we came home after the annexation, they brought big sacks into which we stuffed these posters that we had made, very rapidly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: To hide them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Because now we were on the other st -- th-the other side had won.</span> <span id="s1079">And I remember that very, very, very clearly, the teacher tearing down, mak -- making -- and making us stuff it and tear it up.</span> <span id="s1080">And that one of the children said, hey can I take a -- can I take home the one that I made?</span> <span id="s1081">And the teacher saying, don’t -- are you a stupid fool?</span> <span id="s1082">Put it in there quick.</span> <span id="s1083">Some -- some really rude -- rude word, and -- and in a great agitation, be -- be -- I mean you can’t -- you could get -- you could go to jail fo-for --</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: For that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: -- presumably, for having that.</span> <span id="s1086">And the next thing was -- I don’t know if it was on the same day, but certainly within the next -- within the next moment of

in the front rows, then you left a couple of rows free so that there would be no contamination, which I say now, I don’t think that was said then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: And the Jewish children sat in the back.</span> <span id="s1090">And the next thing that happened was that the Jewish -- the Christian children, the Aryan children were moved to a different school, and my school became ther -- the -- the -- the area school for Jewish children.</span> <span id="s1091">And the other great e-event in those days was that the teacher who was sent in, not a Jewish teacher, who was assigned to teach the Jewish children in my class, came in -- in an Austrian volksschule, in Austrian [indecipherable] the chi -- you behaved very well.</span> <span id="s1092">I mean, you not only sit with your hands like that, but when the teacher comes in you rise to your feet.</span> <span id="s1093">The teacher told us to take out our books -- take your books and read, she said.</span> <span id="s1094">And then she went to the window and stood with her back to us and we could see her crying.</span> <span id="s1095">You could see her -- her -- her shoulders heaving with sobs.</span> <span id="s1096">And there was not -- I mean, they fa -- the old cliché, you couldn’t hear a pin drop.</span> <span id="s1097">The effect of a -- of a grown-up crying and us

moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: What did you think she was crying about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Oh, I think we understood.</span> <span id="s1103">We understood that she didn't want to be -- sh -- it was -- it was a demotion.</span> <span id="s1104">I don’t know what wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: So it wasn’t the situation, it was her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: It was a c -- first of all, this was a grown-up crying.</span> <span id="s1107">It was a grown-up crying cause she had to teach us.</span> <span id="s1108">Oh, that was perfectly clear to me.</span> <span id="s1109">It was clear to me then, it was clear to me -- it’s clear to me now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Right --</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: -- it was clear to me then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: You know, it’s inter -- i-if I were writing that, I would have to find some way of -- of how a child phrases that to herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: And I can’t do that backwards.</span> <span id="s1116">I-I mean, I don’t know how to do that, but I certainly understood it.</span> <span id="s1117">I think we all understood it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: And what ha -- wa -- you knew you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1119">However, you were not religious --</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: -- you knew, sort of, you were Jewish, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: -- yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1123">That’s a very interesting k -- thing, isn’t?</span> <span id="s1124">How did I -- what did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: How did you know this?</span> <span id="s1126">I mean, why didn’t you think you were an Aryan kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: No problem --</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: There was no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: -- no confusion about that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Very interesting.</span> <span id="s1132">I -- I -- I’ve never asked myself that question.</span> <span id="s1133">I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1134">But there was no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: So when the -- when the Aryan kids leave, and it’s only Jewish girls now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Only Jewish girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: What do you th -- wh-wh -- does something go on in your head like what the -- what is happening, why

Everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: -- of all of this.</span> <span id="s1141">Of all of this, yes.</span> <span id="s1142">There are these events, one after the other, and they’re all clearly understood.</span> <span id="s1143">It was clearly understood that our maid -- we had -- we always had one maid, usually sent us by my grandmother from Fischamend, from the village of Fischamend, some -- some -- some daughter of one of the customers, or -- and she had to leave because j -- Jews were not -- because Christians were not allowed, Aryans were not allowed.</span> <span id="s1144">I mean, how did I know the word Aryan?</span> <span id="s1145">That -- that -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Did you have a relationship with her?</span> <span id="s1147">You knew her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: You know, I don’t really remember which one she was.</span> <span id="s1149">We always had a girl, they never -- did never --</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: -- didn't necessarily stay very long.</span> <span id="s1152">Not very much, no, no.</span> <span id="s1153">I knew my grandmother’s maids better, when I went to stay with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1154">There was somewhat a relationship.</span> <span id="s1155">I don’t think there wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: Did she live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: She -- there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: There were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: -- th -- [indecipherable] the kitchen

in England was the cook, she said to my father, this -- di-did we really make our maids sleep in a room like that?</span> <span id="s1162">Shame on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Shame on us, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Serves me right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Now the rule in Germany, I don’t know what it was in -- in Austria, it was what, Jews could not have maids under the age of 45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Only over 45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: I don’t think -- I don’t think that was

id="s1172">A: I do remember -- and I remember it now, that my father would not acknowledge the -- the presence of a maid.</span> <span id="s1173">He would look like this.</span> <span id="s1174">If the maid was walking this way, my father m -- I could remember -- I remember my father sort of, you know, edging away from the co -- from the air contact --</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: -- with this foreign body, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: But I remember how -- she didn’t wait at table, but she brought stuff in and took stuff out.</span> <span id="s1179">My mother did the cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1181">And did she do the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: For the longest time we had not a ma -- live-in maid, but a woman called Frau Raizy, who had a little boy called Eric who would come and play with me under the piano.</span> <span id="s1183">And when I went back to Vienna I looked up Eric and we went to visit his mother.</span> <span id="s1184">There’s that wonderful story which is useless to tell because it a -- it only works in German.</span> <span id="s1185">My mother said something to Frau Raizy, that she should do something that -- Frau Raizy was quite small and had little raisin eyes, that she should do something about that.</span> <span id="s1186">And Frau Raizy said, [speaks German here].</span> <span id="s1187">Now, a shass is a fart.</span> <span id="s1188">And the only way to translate that is, in that -- if -- if -- if Madam wants me to do that, she has just stepped into my fa -- a fart.</span> <span id="s1189">She has -- the fart has entered --</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: -- it’s -- but it’s more, the fart has entered her -- her sole of her foot like a splinter.</span> <span id="s1192">I me -- there’s no way to do that.</span> <span id="s1193">And my mother, who was about to get up on her high horse, put her back head and roared with laughter.</span> <span id="s1194">And from that on, the two women were very good friends and in fact Frau Raizy took some degree of care of my grandparents.</span> <span id="s1195">Her hu -- her husband was a -- was a -- was a -- was a Communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: And she -- she took some degree of care of my -- of my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: -- she bought them food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: So if you played under the piano, it meant you had a grand piano in your house.</span> <span id="s1201">Did you have a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: We had a baby grand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: You had a baby grand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: No, I think -- is there something between a baby grand and a grand?</span> <span id="s1205">Because I think it was bigger than a ba -- I have a baby grand at home and it seemed to me that piano --</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: A little bit smaller.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: -- was longer than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Yeah, there is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Sure, cause they’re different --</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: -- you know, there’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: And it was a Blutner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: It was a Blutner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Yeah, I have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Yes, it’s very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: -- I have to di -- spell that.</span> <span id="s1218">It was a Blutner, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: That’s a good piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: And underne -- it was fun playing with Eric.</span> <span id="s1221">And I -- I -- as I said, I -- I looked up Eric an-and the conversations were not very -- very satisfying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: They were -- they weren’t satisfying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: So school changes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: School changes, my f -- our maid has to leave, and I don’t remember what her name was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: I’m surprised that there was a maid because -- because it was really Frau Raizy who had been our cleaning -- cleaning help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: But there was a maid.</span> <span id="s1230">I remember that, that she had to leave.</span> <span id="s1231">And my father lost his job, and cou --</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: And do you remember your dad lo -- losing his job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: I remember that he no longer went --</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: To work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: -- to the office.</span> <span id="s1236">I remember once my mother taking me to pick him up at the end of a day, we were going to go perhaps do something or other.</span> <span id="s1237">And it was extremely grand.</span> <span id="s1238">It was one of the baroque banking houses, and I remember my father coming down a stair.</span> <span id="s1239">This may be an imaginary memory, but there it is.</span> <span id="s1240">And I remember saying to my father -- we are going back to my -- to the early -- I saying to my father, what is it like up there, what -- and my father didn’t have enough imagination to answer me.</span> <span id="s1241">He just said, oh, I -- I sit and I write numbers.</span> <span id="s1242">Unsatisfactory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: I wanted to -- I was asking a novelist’s question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: Tell me what it’s like so that I can imagine you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Likes -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: You know, that was -- I -- I get back to that in a bit.</span> <span id="s1249">I always needed -- I wa -- I wonder whether mo -- all children need to have a -- a mise-en-scène.</span> <span id="s1250">You need to know how to -- if you want to think of your parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: -- or anybody, you need to s -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: You have to have a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: -- where they are.</span> <span id="s1255">You have to have a picture, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Right, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1257">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: My father was unable to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: To create that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: My Uncle Paul could do this, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: But my a -- father was never able to do that.</span> <span id="s1263">But he was fired, and I know that he got a certain amount of money.</span> <span id="s1264">What would you call the money that you get when you -- when you are dismissed from a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: I forget.</span> <span id="s1266">But there is a -- there is a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: There’s a -- there’s a severance pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Severance pay, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Severance pay.</span> <span id="s1270">The reason I remember it, because at that point also, now I have -- I’m not going to tell you how I think our apartment was taken from us, because I do think that is imaginary, I really don’t re -- there were too many years I did not remember how that happened.</span> <span id="s1271">I just knew that we had to leave, and that we then went to live with my grandparents in the house in Fischamend.</span> <span id="s1272">And I remember my father saying to my grandfather, what I should do is put my severance pay into the shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: And my m -- grandmother saying -- turning to my mother and saying, your husband is a s -- is a fool -- my husband is a fool, your husband is a fool.</span> <span id="s1275">You’re going to put money into a shop when the Nazis are going to take it away from us?</span> <span id="s1276">I mean, it is so -- there is that, knowing and not knowing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: But she knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: She knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: She knew something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: -- that my father -- my father had just been thrown out of his apart -- job and his apartment and he’s going to put it -- what are we -- what -- what does the human head do with these facts?</span> <span id="s1281">But I mean, of course the aw -- aw -- German Jews had been doing that since ’32.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Hanging in there, thinking it was going to go -- all go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: And isn’t it human that if you move to another place, they’re not here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: So, it’s safe.</span> <span id="s1287">The -- so geography seems to protect you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Or at least you want to believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: But what did pe -- I mean, she said this, she clearly was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: She understood it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: She understood it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: I mean, she -- they all understood it, but she faced it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: She looked it in the eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1298">And did your mother face it in a similar way, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1302">My Uncle Paul certainly did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: My Uncle Paul arrived one day from the University of Vienna from which he was about to be thrown out.</span> <span id="s1305">He was a medical student who had screwed around being a -- being a Socialist, being a poet, you know, doing all these things, not getting on with his -- with his studies.</span> <span id="s1306">And he came out with his ear lacerated, cause he got into a fight, from which time on he stayed out in Fischamend, which -- which I loved, because I loved to have him around.</span> <span id="s1307">Then there come the, you know, the series of events I -- I -- I don’t even know how to put them chronologically.</span> <span id="s1308">There is a -- a September.</span> <span id="s1309">There is a -- no, how could it be a September?</span> <span id="s1310">We had left in August.</span> <span id="s1311">There is a -- what I remem --</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: You left Vienna in August of ’38, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: We -- we -- no, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Or is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: -- left in mar -- in April.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: In April to go to fishen --</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: To Fischamend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: April, May, in -- within months of Hitler coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: April, May, June.</span> <span id="s1322">I -- I can’t -- I -- I mean, I -- I really can’t do it.</span> <span id="s1323">I -- I don’t -- it was re -- I know that we were back in Vienna in August, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: -- sometime before then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: I know that I lived for several months in Fischamend, and that my Uncle Paul --</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: -- was my teacher, taught me there because I could not go t -- I ha -- I could not go to the -- th -- to the village school because it was -- because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1330">Now, the village school was of course the school where my uncle and my -- Uncle Paul and my mother have gone as children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1332">How old is your Uncle Paul?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: My Uncle Paul was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: About.</span> <span id="s1335">Is he in his twen --</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: -- seven -- my mother -- I can only do this, my mother was born ’04 and Paul was seven years younger, so he was -- do the arithmetic, four plus seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Four plus --</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Oh 12?</span> <span id="s1339">Six --</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: -- 11, yes, 1911 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: -- when he was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1345">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1346">Let’s stop the tape, instead of moving on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Lore, when you were in Fischamend, were there Nazi kids -- were there young people who were Nazi supporters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: Oh, I would think universally, yes.</span> <span id="s1351">My -- there were the kids that my Uncle Paul and -- and my mother had gone to school with, who had -- you know, had been -- been anti-Semitic, but it didn’t amount to very much.</span> <span id="s1352">I mean, my mother used to say that they had a -- a --a game that was called the old bird seller.</span> <span id="s1353">And the old bird seller was a Jew, and my mother always had to be the bir -- old bird seller, and -- and she was disappointed cause there were other -- other parts like being birds, or being somebody else that she would have liked.</span> <span id="s1354">But it didn’t amount to anything very much until -- you -- you see, this is to -- seems to me so interesting about this whole thing.</span> <span id="s1355">One understands meanness of many kinds, one understands anti-Semitism or racism, but you have to wait for a -- a -- a regime that not only permits but mandates that meanness and that racism.</span> <span id="s1356">And then you get hell on earth.</span> <span id="s1357">These young -- these young people were just automatically mean, anti-Semitic people until Hitler came.</span> <span id="s1358">And then there was the day on which they put ladders up against the windows of my grandfather’s house and walked in -- came -- first they s -- they sat on the windowsills, and then they came in and helped themselves to whatever was in the house.</span> <span id="s1359">These were the age group of my -- of my -- of my -- my mothers and uncles -- they had gone to school together, or their -- or their -- or their children, or their -- or their younger brothers and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: So they’re in their 20’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: The people who -- who wrote Kauf nicht bi Juden, don’t buy from the Jew, in red -- in blood colored letters on the outside of the house or on the windows, and across the street and across the pavement, those were all the people that my -- my parents -- my -- my uncle a-and my mother have grown up with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Did this frighten -- cause you -- you’re sitting in -- in a house --</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: -- was this frightening finally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: You know, lots of people have asked me -- have complained about my book, that it seems to be so cool and I can only -- only say yes, that it is -- e-everybody waits for the expression of -- of horror, and I -- it’s there, but I can’t -- I can’t bring it to the surface.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Some psychological damage, or some -- I mean, I -- I -- I refuse to put it into words if it isn’t there in the feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: But it certainly is missing.</span> <span id="s1370">What is the reaction?</span> <span id="s1371">You know, we’ll come across it when -- when -- when we talk about my leaving home.</span> <span id="s1372">Where -- where was the -- where was the -- th-the depth, th-the -- the intensity?</span> <span id="s1373">I don’t know where it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: You don’t know where it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: I don’t know where it is.</span> <span id="s1376">I remember being horrified when they -- the nats -- the young Nazis came and took my father an -- the men, my father, my uncle and my grandfather to the police station, and I -- to beat them up, I think is too -- too strong a word, but they certainly smacked my father and broke his glasses.</span> <span id="s1377">And that shocked me.</span> <span id="s1378">That -- that seems to me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: It shocked me in a sense that I have a -- a memory of having seen that, which I could not have done because it was done at the police station.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: I remember being frightened because my bed had to be pushed way up against the wall away from the windows because they kept throwing stones until all the windows were broken.</span> <span id="s1383">I mean, that must have terrified me, and yet terror is not -- is not what I can come up with in memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: That’s a -- some kind of failing -- a failure of -- of -- of response on my part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: But let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s1387">When you were younger, before all of this started, how would you describe yourself emotionally as a kid?</span> <span id="s1388">Were you very restrained?</span> <span id="s1389">You’re somehow treated as an adult by your mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: -- because of the inadequacy of the relationship, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: -- yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: So do you then somehow feel as if you have to exhibit a certain --</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: I did not feel that it was required of me to be brave.</span> <span id="s1397">That’s not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: -- that’s not at all what it is.</span> <span id="s1400">It’s a habit.</span> <span id="s1401">It’s almost like somebody preparing to be a writer.</span> <span id="s1402">Let me observe this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Let me see how this looks, how this operates, rather than a gut a-anger, or gut grief.</span> <span id="s1405">And I can’t answer the question because I’ve certainly thought about it, and I don’t know how it works.</span> <span id="s1406">I don’t know how my emotions or my responses operate, I just don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Now, le-let me -- then let me ask you the people around you, because it -- it sounds as if you’re taking stuff in as opposed to giving it out.</span> <span id="s1408">You -- you -- you want to get a sense of what the circumstances are.</span> <span id="s1409">What is -- what’s happening with your mother, with your father, with Paul?</span> <span id="s1410">Are they reacting in a similar way, that -- that you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: I watched -- I watched that awful wonderful -- wonderful awful movie, “Mrs. Miniver” the other day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: They seemed to react in a cool fashion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: As if you watch what’s happening, you -- you know, you -- you -- you deal with things as they come, your house has just been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: -- broken up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: I think it’s -- it was -- I wonder whether that isn’t how many people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Reacted --</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: -- in fact go through --</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: -- I think we -- when we look for the high drama, I think we are thinking of literature rather than --</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Rather than human --</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Human [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: And your mother in -- in the movie, “Into the Arm’s of Strangers”, said something about herself.</span> <span id="s1427">“I just -- e-essentially I went with whatever happened.</span> <span id="s1428">I could deal with whatever happened.”</span> <span id="s1429">So it was -- she didn’t sort of dwell on the fact that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: -- now she was going to be a cook, or now she was going to be a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: You do what -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: What has to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: -- has to be done.</span> <span id="s1435">And I think that’s how -- my father, it seems to me, was hanging onto himself.</span> <span id="s1436">I have a vision of him looking as if he was trying to not throw up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: He was co -- so concerned with staying on his feet, and not being -- coming ill again, that’s what -- that’s what he was up to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: And then, you know, there were things -- i-in the -- the extreme reaction is not one that I remember -- any of us.</span> <span id="s1441">It is curious, isn’t it, because it’s almost as if the reader or the hero longs for some -- some -- the reaction to disaster, and here is disaster happening all around you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: On the other hand, if you react too much, you cannot then act in -- within the context of the disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Maybe so.</span> <span id="s1444">Do you remember that famous photograph which is -- all -- wa -- something I carry almost in my head, of the little boy in the middle of the group of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: -- th -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: With his hands up, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Now, what is the reaction of those people?</span> <span id="s1449">They look horrified, but nobody is howling and screaming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1451">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: I have one other s -- answer to this question.</span> <span id="s1453">When my mother and I were flying from the Dominican Republic finally, to New York, we were in a plane.</span> <span id="s1454">It started fra -- in -- in the Dominican Republic.</span> <span id="s1455">It was full of Dominicans and my mother and me, and it was one of those horrible flights which goes all a -- which seems to descend or fly all the way.</span> <span id="s1456">And all the Dominicans, ay, mamita, ay [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1457">And my mother and I were sitting there with our -- with the white knuckle, holding on, saying not a word.</span> <span id="s1458">And then the plane would steady up and I remember there was one toothless woman who turned around kind of shamefacedly and grinned at us.</span> <span id="s1459">And then there would be another drop, ay, mamita, a didi -- Dios mio.</span> <span id="s1460">There is the -- is there a different reaction that -- that you expect o-of yourself, or I -- it is a puzzle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: It is a -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: It’s a puzzle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: -- it is a puzzle.</span> <span id="s1464">But I have the feeling that -- that often the response comes much later with people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Yes, it comes in terms of my not being able to bear to go to the movies in which there’s going to be a minimum of respo -- of -- of suspense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: You also wrote somewhere -- maybe it was in the introduction to the -- the novel, that you don’t actually like being in the movie theater, in the darkness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: I don’t like it.</span> <span id="s1468">I’m afraid -- I’m afraid it’s going to bother me, it’s going to put me through something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: That you don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: I mean I k -- when somebody in a movie once again goes into an empty room to look through somebody’s desk that they’re not supposed to go into, I close my eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Cause that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: I -- there is -- I -- there’s a -- there’s a danger here.</span> <span id="s1473">I mean, I know nothing’s -- I been there -- I’ve seen that scene many times.</span> <span id="s1474">I cannot bear --</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: You’ve [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: -- I mean, I -- I -- I’ve -- well, cannot bear, I find it excruciatingly uncomfortable and unpleasant to be in a situation of -- of -- of danger.</span> <span id="s1477">I lie in bed -- now my -- I have a wonderful bed.</span> <span id="s1478">My bed, if I look out to the right, I look all the way down to the Empire State Building.</span> <span id="s1479">I look over to the Empire State Building and I think, look, it’s still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: There’s no war on at the moment.</span> <span id="s1482">That’s, I think, what has happened.</span> <span id="s1483">But screaming and crying and howling at the time did not happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: At the time it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Did not happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: What -- what -- wh-what you see, in terms of the rest of your life is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Is a m --</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: -- i -- is this -- there is a -- there is a danger that’s always present --</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Yes, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: -- which is not present in man -- in -- in people who haven’t been through stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Is it not?</span> <span id="s1492">I know people -- I -- you know, I’m -- I’m eager not to claim emotions for those of us who’ve been through this experience that are not universal.</span> <span id="s1493">I really want to be careful not to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Mm-hm, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: There may be -- there may be more -- more expectation of -- of disaster, of calamity, which is the last line of my book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: You mean, in more people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Ye -- in more -- more in me than in most, but I suspect it is not -- it’s not a sp -- it’s not a specialty.</span> <span id="s1498">I mean, it’s -- it’s -- I think it is a human -- human experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: But it’s a human experience within the context of experiences that are -- that match in some ways what you’re talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: That where people have experienced external dangers, that they hold -- that they can’t get rid of, because how can you get rid of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: I -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1503">I will also tell you that any time I’m supposed to go on a trip, including to Washington, I have a -- a week bef -- it is preceded by a week of having every illness under the sun.</span> <span id="s1504">So, you know, it -- it plays itself out somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: In some -- in some other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: I get a cold, I get diarrhea, I get -- I get dizzy.</span> <span id="s1507">And then I’m on the train and I’m having a lovely time.</span> <span id="s1508">So it’s there somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: It’s -- it’s -- it’s gone underground and takes its place a-at -- in a -- it is -- comes up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: And I don’t know if it’s not a rhetorical question to say, what did you feel at that moment, because I -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: I have no answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s1514">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: I was certainly frightened, but I was not out of control frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: I left -- when I left my parents in Vienna, I was not out of control unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: I did something else, I was saying wow, I’m going to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: England, right.</span> <span id="s1521">You have to leave Fischermund [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: -- ermend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Fischermend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Does everybody have to leave?</span> <span id="s1526">Does your -- your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: As I remember it, and I think this is correct, my grandmother, who was persona non grata, because she had a big mouth, as we say, she had expressed her -- her irritation with the customers when -- who came into the -- into the -- into the -- loudly.</span> <span id="s1528">My Uncle Paul, my father and my mother and I had left.</span> <span id="s1529">I don’t know -- no, my mother and my grandfather stayed behind.</span> <span id="s1530">Well, let me just say what happened was that they backed the -- backed a -- a truck against the door.</span> <span id="s1531">By the way, Obama -- Barack Obama the other day used a f -- a simile which -- which -- which was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1532">He said, wait til the -- the Republicans back their garbage truck against the door and dump it.</span> <span id="s1533">And that called up the truck --</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: -- that the Nazis pulled up against my grandfather’s house, and emptied it out, and then made him sign a gift to the vinter -- vinterhelfs fund.</span> <span id="s1536">The Winter Help Fund.</span> <span id="s1537">And it’s es-essentially emptied the store out of -- of anything that was saleable, and it got closed down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: And after that -- that was -- after that -- you know, here -- here is the sort of -- first of all the blood red words on the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: Then one -- my grandfather’s assistant, a young man, came up one day on some message, on some trumped up message and found us listening to the radio, the o -- I forget wh-what the -- I-I mean, so it was what is now radio-free Europe, but I forget what it is.</span> <span id="s1542">Think it was British broadcasting --</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Was maybe the BBC.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: -- I don’t know, but we were listening to it and he found us listening to it.</span> <span id="s1545">The next day one of Paul’s old room -- colle -- schoolmates came up and demanded the radio for use at he -- at Nazi headquarters.</span> <span id="s1546">I mean, there’s several events like that.</span> <span id="s1547">Then there was the Hitler rally, which happened right outside our ha -- store, because the store was on the -- on the main -- main square.</span> <span id="s1548">There was a big pole, on top of which was mounted a radio, a loudspeaker that broadcast the whole -- in the environment.</span> <span id="s1549">And there were all the young people in their Nazi uniforms, including my grandfather’s shop assistant Mitzi who was my -- who was my best friend, I thought.</span> <span id="s1550">And my mother kind of -- my -- I -- I --I want to say, hi Mitzi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: -- and my uncle pulled me into the room and ca -- and closed the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: And then came that really drastic event of their walking i -- up the ladders and into the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: Into the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: That kind of intrusion, that kind of -- I mean it -- it -- yeah, you’re -- you’re coming into my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: You’re invading me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: And -- and then the stones -- the -- the stones throwing that broke every window, and then the -- the stores closed, the men are taken to the police station, I think that is more or less.</span> <span id="s1561">And then we have to go and my -- I think they -- they asked my father, or ordered my grand -- my grandfather and my mother to stay and fi -- close up the shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: And then -- and -- and so then you left to go back to Vienna in August --</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: We left to go back to Vienna, of course nobody having anywhere to live because they’d taken our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: Taken your apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: And we were kind of divided up.</span> <span id="s1566">I was sent to stay with a -- in the book I make it -- in this book I’m -- I’m at pains to -- to m-muddle up who -- who was who, so that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: -- out of -- out of some kind of probably unnecessary tact.</span> <span id="s1569">But my grandmother went to live -- grandmother and grandfather let -- went to live with one of my grandmother’s many sisters.</span> <span id="s1570">She had 15 brothers and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Of whom only three survived.</span> <span id="s1573">All the others ar -- were killed in -- then, including Tante Frieda, whom they went to stay with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: Let me just say something about that.</span> <span id="s1576">There was a movie once on television, I can’t even remember where we were and which -- which disaster we are talking about, but one of the women who was being asked to -- taken on some -- some death march, was hugely big, like my Tante Frieda, who had an absolutely lovely, lovely face, but was obese, and that now, if you want to know when I di -- when I fell apart, at -- watching -- it wasn’t a movie, it was on the television, that’s when I we -- fell apart.</span> <span id="s1577">Because I tried to imagine my Tante Frieda --</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: -- being walked on a two day walk.</span> <span id="s1580">And this women in the -- in the [indecipherable] died.</span> <span id="s1581">Died [indecipherable] because she couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s1582">That got me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: That got me.</span> <span id="s1585">But anyhow, I was taken to live -- to stay with a g -- a friend of mine, a school friend.</span> <span id="s1586">My father went to stay with his brother Max, Mimi.</span> <span id="s1587">I don’t n -- Paul, I think went -- my Uncle Paul went to stay with his -- with his friend Dolph, I think.</span> <span id="s1588">That’s -- that’s -- that’s how I remember it.</span> <span id="s1589">Eventually my grandparents found a house in the Jewish district, the sec -- zweiter Bezirk, the second [indecipherable], and then my parents went to live with him.</span> <span id="s1590">And the last day before I went on my Kindertransport, I stayed, I think one or two nights with them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: Did you have any sense that this Kindertransport thing was coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: I had no idea, all I knew is that everybody of the Jewish community talked literally about nothing except emigration.</span> <span id="s1593">You know, it’s so interesting when people ask us why we didn’t leave.</span> <span id="s1594">Now, what -- what -- I mean, the sensible question is why didn’t you leave before it came because you had every reason to know it.</span> <span id="s1595">But why we didn’t leave then, nobody wanted anything except to leave.</span> <span id="s1596">Our ac -- occupation was going to -- from one consulate to the other.</span> <span id="s1597">Our -- learning hand skills, the one -- the kind of skills that you n -- you -- that you could earn a living if you didn't know the language, my father made little -- little -- m-miserable little leather purses.</span> <span id="s1598">My father and mother went to learn machine knitting, knitting on -- on these mechanized machines.</span> <span id="s1599">My mother learned large quantity cooking, what do you call it, yeah, cooking for many people.</span> <span id="s1600">They learned Swedish massage.</span> <span id="s1601">My Uncle Paul let -- went on -- on a Hakshera with people who wer -- wanted to go to Israel to learn farming, to learn -- yeah, farm -- farm -- farm, do farm work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1603">And who’s providing these classes?</span> <span id="s1604">Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: I should imagine it’s the Kulturschemand --</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: -- the Jewish cultural organization, I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: At least the -- the -- the -- the f -- the Hakshera, I’m sure that they -- they were doing it.</span> <span id="s1610">The rest I think people just found -- found --</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: The places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: -- the places.</span> <span id="s1613">At this point it wa -- became you -- it -- it -- little by little what you co -- were allowed to do shrank.</span> <span id="s1614">You couldn't go shopping, you couldn’t -- th-these were the times when people were hauled out -- my a -- my Uncle Paul’s second wife was hauled out of her house and made to scrub the sidewalks.</span> <span id="s1615">That was a common thing, you would look --</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: -- you would see people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Did you see that?</span> <span id="s1619">Did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1621">I think I see my Aunt Susan do it, but I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: I don’t think I saw that personally, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Did you n -- did you n -- do you remember noticing that the streets are different, that there’s some -- th-there’s something really different here than that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Oh, well, firstly you -- you were -- you were told to hurry home.</span> <span id="s1626">If you went to school, you hurried home.</span> <span id="s1627">And then of course, the big event was -- it was Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Kristallnacht, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: When they told us at school to go home very quickly, and we said why and they say, just go home very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: So you did go -- when you went back to Vienna in August, school starts in September, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: And you did go to a Jewish school then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: I went to the same school that I had been -- that had been made into the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: No, I went to a different Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Because I was living in a different -- in a different district.</span> <span id="s1638">Yeah, that’s right, I wa -- I was now living -- I was no longer living in Josef Stetter strasse, I was living -- I forget where my friend lived, but it was a different school district.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: So I went -- I mean, I now see that I remember, I see a different class, a class differently --</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Arranged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: -- arranged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: And the different tea -- it was a male teacher.</span> <span id="s1645">I don’t really remember who the -- who -- I don’t -- anyway, after -- after the event of the teacher crying, I have no more memory of that school.</span> <span id="s1646">Maybe it was because we left very soon afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: Left soon, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: But the school afterwards, there was a male teacher.</span> <span id="s1649">And we were told to go home quickly, and that was th -- a very great drama because the Nazis came.</span> <span id="s1650">Th-The kind -- th-the way Kristallnacht played itself out in our -- in -- in my friends -- in my friend’s parent’s house is that all the Jewish families who lived in that building -- now, buildings -- I have a memory of a huge building, but m -- there were no huge bil -- there was one [indecipherable] in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1651">My mother went to take me, it was 10 -- 10 stories high, okay?</span> <span id="s1652">So it was a four -- ba -- mise -- m -- wa-was not a -- more than -- I can’t imagine it was more than four stories high.</span> <span id="s1653">But what I do remember is that the Jewish families were being forced to move themselves and their furniture all into our apartment, the apartment of my friend, which had a bedroom, a living room and another bedroom.</span> <span id="s1654">There were three rooms in general.</span> <span id="s1655">Interestingly, I can’t place the kitchen, but there was a kitchen, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s1656">And so, by the end of the night the furniture that they had brought in -- and you know, Viennese furniture is not like this, Viennese furniture is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: Big.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: -- big.</span> <span id="s1659">It has to have weight.</span> <span id="s1660">And when you’re left alone as a child in your room, it creaks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: It creaks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: It -- it’s -- it -- it is alive and the wood shrinks and -- and you hear distinct, ghostly creaks.</span> <span id="s1663">Well, this [indecipherable] and -- and there were upside-down chairs.</span> <span id="s1664">There were tables with their feet up.</span> <span id="s1665">There were people sitting around crying.</span> <span id="s1666">It was a -- it was a -- some kind of a battle scene.</span> <span id="s1667">Not with -- with active battle, but something was wro -- everything was wrong.</span> <span id="s1668">Tables and chairs are supposed to have their f -- legs down and these were upside-down on top of cupboards.</span> <span id="s1669">And the Nazis kept turning the lights off and on.</span> <span id="s1670">I mean that makes of -- the -- the practical jokes against the people over whom you have power.</span> <span id="s1671">The other thing that I remember very clearly is that Tante -- that -- that my mo -- my friend -- my friend was called Dieter, and her mother had a brother who came at that moment to hide out in our -- let me call it our apartment.</span> <span id="s1672">Because they were taking men from the apartment he was living in and of course walked straight into the arms of the -- of -- of the Nazis and was taken away.</span> <span id="s1673">I -- I don’t re -- know -- don’t remember the end of that story.</span> <span id="s1674">What I do remember is the following days.</span> <span id="s1675">It’s such a curiosity.</span> <span id="s1676">I remember one of the men, one of the neighbor -- male neighbors, stayed in his pajamas and whenever there was a ring or a knock at the door, he would get into bed as if he could pretend he had some terrible disease and then they wouldn’t take him away.</span> <span id="s1677">I remember this man in the pajamas playing chess with one of the -- one of the children, one of the boy children.</span> <span id="s1678">There was just this sense of -- of oddity, of pecu -- of -- of a peculiar world.</span> <span id="s1679">And the funny -- a funny consciousness on my part that the man who kept pretending he was sick was lying, and you’re not supposed to lie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: There’s that thing again.</span> <span id="s1681">We’re gonna --</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: And also I -- that -- that is the -- that is one of the times that I do remember crying in terror, because it occurred to me at that moment I didn’t know where my mother was.</span> <span id="s1683">And I do remember sitting down and crying and being comforted by somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: By somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: I think it was Dieter’s mother, whose name at the moment I -- her father was Otto and he was a -- he became a very dear friend, an old -- old -- older friend.</span> <span id="s1686">He knew I was smart and he liked it and he talked to me.</span> <span id="s1687">He, like my Uncle Paul found that it was fun to talk to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: As I now find it fun to talk to my grandson Isaiah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: -- who is very clever, at seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: When you were crying, when this -- somebody came and you -- you think it was the mother, it was -- it was Dieter’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1697">I think so it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: I remember some of the s -- comforting me with a hand, with a voice.</span> <span id="s1700">Can’t remember what they said, but I remember feeling what you might feel if you suddenly realized you were in a -- in -- in -- in the supermarket and you had lost your -- you didn’t know where your mother was.</span> <span id="s1701">It was that -- it was that experience.</span> <span id="s1702">It suddenly came to me I didn’t know where she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: And that’s what frightened -- at that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: That’s what -- yeah, that moment, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: And who knows what really frightened you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: Well, the whole --</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Yeah, the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: -- I understood the whole thing to be a -- a -- a mad scene.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: Something where everything was wrong.</span> <span id="s1711">Everything wasn’t the way it was supposed to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Now, is this before Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s1713">A: That was Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: That wa -- that was the night at --</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: -- that was the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1718">Now, there were much other stuff going on.</span> <span id="s1719">There were -- there were -- this -- th-there were synagogues burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: A-All around Vienna, but I’m -- I -- I knew that later, I did not know that at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1723">So it’s you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: It was not an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: So this was the experience.</span> <span id="s1728">Now, is it a few days later that you are told that you’re going to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: It seems to me it is, yes.</span> <span id="s1730">I think that’s what mobilized my father.</span> <span id="s1731">That this is -- of course, happens off-scene --</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: -- that my mother wanted -- wanted -- my mother -- my parents by -- by this time now, moved in with my grandparents, into this two bedroom little -- little -- little apartment, and my mother wa-was just waiting f -- to bring me home.</span> <span id="s1734">And I think at this point what -- my father -- I mean, this -- I know this from my mother’s story, that my fa-father said, she’s not going to stay here.</span> <span id="s1735">And then he came to pick me up one day and it was within -- it would seem to me within the week, within 10 days of this, while -- you know, I don’t remember that condition of everybody living in this all -- I mean, we-well maybe some 10 -- some 15 people living in, with all their furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: I can’t remember that -- they didn’t -- never moved out again, so I must have moved out.</span> <span id="s1738">My father picked me up and said, you’re going to England.</span> <span id="s1739">And I said, what do you mean I’m going to England?</span> <span id="s1740">Y -- we’re going to eng -- he said, no, you’re going to England.</span> <span id="s1741">Mommy and I can’t go.</span> <span id="s1742">And he took me to a burned out Temple, that’s the b -- that’s -- that’s -- that’s why -- and that’s when I knew.</span> <span id="s1743">It was a round -- a round Temple, a circular Temple, and when you walked across fallen lumber, it was gutted.</span> <span id="s1744">And there were people cleaning it out and then there were people that -- pa-parents and children hanging out down there.</span> <span id="s1745">And then there were people standing up the stairs and along the women’s gallery, waiting to be processed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: In this burned out place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: In this burned out synagogue, yeah.</span> <span id="s1748">And my father and I were called out of line.</span> <span id="s1749">My name was called, Lore Groszmann, and my father walked me past all these people into the office, and there was my uncle ot -- Tante Frieda had four children, one of them was Otto, who was -- unlike my uncle, had finished his doctor -- doctoral studies and was a doctor.</span> <span id="s1750">And he had a girlfriend and the girlfriend worked for the Kulturschemand, for the culture, and she had put my name on th -- tha -- there’s a complication of being in such a situation, of having been pulled out of line and -- i-it -- I -- I have not grieved over it, but I think about it once in awhile.</span> <span id="s1751">Somebody was there because I was there, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: But anyhow, I was told that I was going to go on this -- on -- on -- on this Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s1754">At this point my next memory is being with my grandparents and my parents in this little, very small apartment.</span> <span id="s1755">And my -- I remember the evening before my departure, which was on a Thursday.</span> <span id="s1756">Now, story.</span> <span id="s1757">Cup -- I believe we went -- left on a Thursday, but I have since met a -- a -- somebody who was on it, who was not only 14 years old to my 10, but Orthodox, and he knows we left on a Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1759">Cause in the book you -- book, you clearly say it’s Thursday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: It was thur -- but it was not.</span> <span id="s1761">According to him --</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: He was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: -- and we know it was on the same -- on the same Kindertransport, the first Kindertransport that left.</span> <span id="s1764">But the interesting thing -- and this is something about memory -- I believe what my logic tells me.</span> <span id="s1765">History tells me it was on a Saturday, but I still think it was on a thur --</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: It’s your experience that it was Thursday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: I left on a Thursday.</span> <span id="s1768">Which I think tells you a lot about these things I’m telling you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: And that was th-th -- you know, the gr -- the great drama of my leaving and all the cousins coming and all the friends coming and everybody bringing me candy to take along with me.</span> <span id="s1773">And my mother, who wanted to do something special for me, said, I have to pack you food for three days, what shall I pack for you?</span> <span id="s1774">And I couldn’t -- I wasn’t hungry.</span> <span id="s1775">I couldn’t think of anything.</span> <span id="s1776">So I said, a wurst.</span> <span id="s1777">Which is a sausage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: And my mother said, I am going to get you a wurst.</span> <span id="s1780">And my father, who was very passive I think, or thought until I remembered that it was he who got me on to the children -- by the way, in her 101st year, when I visited my mother in the nursing home, she and I did a revisionist history of my father.</span> <span id="s1781">If he got me on to the Kindertransport, he was not the passive --</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: -- and th-th-th-there’s something we had -- we had left out of the story, th -- she and I together, over the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: But even so, in -- in the novel, that is the one act he performs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: Yes, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: It’s very clear your mother would rather you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: My mother didn’t want to hear about it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: She didn’t want to hear about it, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: -- she didn’t want it -- it to happen.</span> <span id="s1790">She -- she didn’t argue because the situation -- I mean, it was clear by this time, my father had tried every -- see, it wasn’t the only thing he did.</span> <span id="s1791">He was the one who went from consulate to consulate.</span> <span id="s1792">It was he who got our name onto -- on to the American quota, which is why I’m sitting here today.</span> <span id="s1793">So it wasn’t -- it wasn’t all that clear --</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: It wasn’t just the one -- uh-huh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: -- it wasn’t just that one thing.</span> <span id="s1796">In my head it was the one thing, but my -- he quarreled with my mother, they -- he was afraid of her going down.</span> <span id="s1797">What if in the last minute something happens and prevents us from -- I mean, I was supposed to -- I was due to go to meet up with the -- with the children to go on the train that night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: But my mother went down anyhow.</span> <span id="s1800">I wanted a wurst.</span> <span id="s1801">I wanted a sausage and I was going to get that sausage and she was going to go and get it for me.</span> <span id="s1802">And she went down and she got it and she came back and m-my -- the other thing I remember is the anger of one of the aunts, who had twins and how come I got onto the -- my father had got me on the Kindertransport, how come he hadn’t taken the trouble to get her twins on the transport?</span> <span id="s1803">And my father -- this I do remember very clearly, my father sort of standing me between his knees and saying, when you get to England, you have to talk to the English people and you have to tell them to get out -- Mom-Mommy and me out, and the grandparents, and Tante Milla and the twins.</span> <span id="s1804">And I said, oh yes, yes, that’s what I will do, I will get everybody out.</span> <span id="s1805">And it does seem to me an interesting -- a -- a horrendous burden to put on a 10 year old --</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: -- to save some -- some six or seven or eight family members from Hitler, out of Hitler’s Germany -- Austria.</span> <span id="s1808">But I -- I took it absolutely seriously, that’s what I wou -- and I did -- I -- I-I -- I worked at it.</span> <span id="s1809">At least worked at being guilty if I wasn’t working at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: For -- for ye -- for a year or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: Then everybody went to -- they -- they -- the aunts -- the aunts left, the cousins left, and my parents a -- a -- I think that th -- we -- as I remember it, we were allowed to take a rucksack, a backpack and one suitcase, and no more.</span> <span id="s1814">And we had -- we were -- I don’t know at what point we were given the number 152, but it was certainly -- I-I think it might have been when we got -- we -- here, we walked across the bridge and what I remember about that is seeing my father and mother talking over my head.</span> <span id="s1815">They held my hand and over my head they were talking about how -- again, the la -- the conversation about getting out of -- of -- out of Vienna.</span> <span id="s1816">And my mother said something like why don’t you try the Dutch consulate, and my father saying here, you can go to China and go to Beijing.</span> <span id="s1817">And my mother said, why don’t you try the Dutch -- the Dutch.</span> <span id="s1818">And I thought they are talking -- they are already talking about tomorrow and I’m not going to be here tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: And so it was upsetting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: Y-Y-Yeah, and I got angry --</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: -- I got really angry and I -- I withdrew my hands from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: And I said to my mother, “Look, the moon is reflected in the Danube.”</span> <span id="s1825">But they kept on talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">Q: They weren’t paying atten --</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: And it was -- it was -- it was one of the hard, hard things, that here at this moment I am about to leave and they’re talking and they’re not listening to my -- you know, I -- there was a little boy, when I was living in Ellsworthy Terrace in England, there was a lit -- I watched -- looked out the window and there was a little boy walking with two women, one of them was his mother, clearly.</span> <span id="s1828">And the -- the -- the trees in the -- in the street were in bloom and the little boy said, “Mom, look at the -- look at the trees,” and the mother kept talking to her friend.</span> <span id="s1829">The little boy said, “Mommy, the trees, the trees, look at the trees.”</span> <span id="s1830">And I thought, oh, there -- there I go.</span> <span id="s1831">It’s happened again, and they’re not listening.</span> <span id="s1832">Anyhow, we got onto the tram --</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Wait, let me ask you something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: Who packed your ba -- your lugga -- your luggage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Oh, my mother, my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Your mother did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: And your rucksack?</span> <span id="s1840">Did you take --</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: My mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Your mother.</span> <span id="s1843">So she packed everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1845">Who else would do it?</span> <span id="s1846">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: I don’t know, no, was there anything you wanted to take, that you -- that you made a decision about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1850">But the wurst goes into the piece of -- into the luggage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: The wurst --</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: Wurst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: In germ -- Viennese, it’s a wurst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Wurst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: Goes into the backpack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: Into the backpack, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: And I’m not carrying the backpack or the -- or the sum --</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: They are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: -- they are carrying it.</span> <span id="s1860">And we get into the tram on the other side of the Danube, and right across the aisle there is a child who is crying.</span> <span id="s1861">And I said to my mother, look that girl is cr -- little girl is crying.</span> <span id="s1862">And my mother said, yes, and I -- you’re not crying, you are -- you are s -- being so brave.</span> <span id="s1863">And I had a serious doubt on the subject.</span> <span id="s1864">It seemed to me, in my childish wisdom, reasonable to cry, and I was not doing it.</span> <span id="s1865">Cause what I was thinking is, wow I’m going to England.</span> <span id="s1866">Cause I had counted.</span> <span id="s1867">I had been to Austria and I had been to Hungary and I had been to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1868">Now I was going to be -- go to -- to England, that’s going to be four countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: But I can’t count England until I’m there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: But you have a double thing that goes on in you all the time, don’t you?</span> <span id="s1872">Why aren’t I crying, but I’m going to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: So it’s -- there’s the -- there’s this -- some kind --</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: They -- there’s -- there’s the -- the -- the -- the feeling is, this is a -- this is exciting, this is an adventure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: Ought it to be an adventure?</span> <span id="s1878">Oughtn’t it to be a grief and a horror?</span> <span id="s1879">I have a friend, who -- an old “New Yorker” writer, Bernard Taper, who was a child of -- a-an English Jewish child, with hung -- with -- with -- with American grandparents -- grand -- an American father.</span> <span id="s1880">The father died, the mother sent him to America to be out of the war, to be with th -- he had the same -- he did the same thing.</span> <span id="s1881">He said this is -- w-we have talked about this.</span> <span id="s1882">So it’s not -- it’s one way, apparently --</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: Right, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: -- to handle this -- this situation.</span> <span id="s1885">The one -- one o -- it’s not -- it’s -- it’s -- seemed to me unnatural, but it’s one natural way -- thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: I think so.</span> <span id="s1887">What’s interesting about you is that you have an internal conversation --</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: -- of wondering why are you not crying like that little girl.</span> <span id="s1890">And at the same -- as if there’s some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: You know, I will ask him.</span> <span id="s1892">He is still barely alive, but I will ask him if he was doing the same --</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: Same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: -- if he wa -- he was -- also turned into a writer, so I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: -- whether he was both playing that -- that game with himself and also being aware and wondering whether that was kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: Cause you di -- you do this a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: And clearly did it at a very young age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1901">It was not -- I was not very old when I had the distinct -- not so -- it’s not an image, the distinct experience of an entity, an -- a watchful -- an eye, a -- a knowledge, an awareness sitting -- and it’s over here, and taking note of what was going on.</span> <span id="s1902">I wonder if that’s rare or whether that’s -- and I always choose to assume first that this is a human thing you’re doing, not -- not a special -- then you can check it out afterwards, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: I suspect the part that’s rare is the double consciousness.</span> <span id="s1904">I think that what you’re doing, it may not be as rare, that a lot of people do it.</span> <span id="s1905">I’m not so sure that the double consciousness is -- is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: You do -- you don’t have a -- a -- a -- an observer who is fantastically interested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: In what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: Yeah, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1909">Whether -- whether it’s grief or -- or -- or -- or the thrill</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: I’m not -- I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s1911">I don’t know, I have to think about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: I’m going to do a poll.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: You do a poll, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: Oh it’s mostly in polls.</span> <span id="s1915">But we get to an open field, an open -- a large open space behind the [indecipherable], the west station.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: And there are innumerable bodies, people, it’s dark, and there are people with poles on which there are placards that say something like -- mine particular said 100 to -- o-o-of -- one fi -- 150 to 200 -- to 190 -- 199, assuming, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: And I must have had my number before, because we’re -- we’re -- we’re -- my parents take me to this one thing.</span> <span id="s1920">Now, at some point I have the famous little cla -- little -- little wooden -- little -- little pla -- cardboard thing with a number 152, and -- and they -- on -- on a -- on a shoe -- shoestring, with a nu -- with the same number which was attached to the two pieces of luggage.</span> <span id="s1921">And I looked -- and my mother was standing -- my mother had a black pony fur.</span> <span id="s1922">I’ve always tried -- I -- when going into stores and said if they have a pony fur, and they say, a what?</span> <span id="s1923">Apparently there is no such thing as a pony fur, but that’s what I thought my mother had.</span> <span id="s1924">And it had a biz foc -- big fox collar, and inside that fox collar was her face, and it was perfectly red and hot.</span> <span id="s1925">And -- but except for its color, she made a hi -- a -- a -- a monumental effort to neither cry nor look upset.</span> <span id="s1926">In fact, she was talking to me in what sounded like a normal voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: And we were just talking and I -- and my father must have been there but he was very tall and besides he was, as usual, a background figure.</span> <span id="s1929">And then at somebody -- point, somebody told us to line up.</span> <span id="s1930">I think -- I seem to remember that we were supposed to be in -- in -- in -- in a group -- in four or so.</span> <span id="s1931">And my mother put the rucksack on me, and she carried the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: The luggage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: -- the lu -- th-the -- the little suitcase.</span> <span id="s1934">But she kept talking to me, she kept walking beside me and talking until somebody from the organization [indecipherable] took the suitcase and gave it to me, and the next thing I knew I was through the portal inside the station, and my mother was no longer there.</span> <span id="s1935">Now, I had a friend who believed that he could elicit forgotten information.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: And it interested him because I said I remember my mother holding the suitcase, and I remember being inside the train.</span> <span id="s1938">I seem not to have crossed the station, got onto the platform, got onto the train, walked into the carriage.</span> <span id="s1939">And he tried very hard, it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1940">He tried to make -- he tried to retrieve the lost memory.</span> <span id="s1941">I -- I mean, I tried very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: You didn’t succeed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: I didn’t succeed, no, I can’t do that, I can’t do it, it’s gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: Do you remember saying goodbye?</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: No, because as a matter of fact, I was surprised when my mother was not -- oh yes, we said goodbye, we -- I kissed my mother, I must have kissed my father, and then -- but the -- but she continued to walk beside me after that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: -- after that goodbye.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1949">And then all of a sudden --</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: And then I’m inside the carriage and outside is my cousin Otto’s girlfriend, with red hair and who knocked on the window.</span> <span id="s1951">And I could, in those days, and for many, many a decade later, stand on my head.</span> <span id="s1952">So I got down on -- on my head and stood and wiggled my toes.</span> <span id="s1953">I was a great showoff.</span> <span id="s1954">You see, my fa -- I had been -- my -- my family had brought me up to be a showoff --</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: -- they were always saying, oh she’s so -- she can -- she can stand on her toes, she can --</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1958">You’re very -- you were very proud of being able to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: I had got all this -- this -- all this reinforcement --</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: -- yes.</span> <span id="s1962">So I stood on my head for her.</span> <span id="s1963">I think there were four children and four children.</span> <span id="s1964">And I remember that it took an heck of a long time, too, for the train to go.</span> <span id="s1965">It seemed to take forever.</span> <span id="s1966">It didn’t go and it didn’t go and it didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1967">And we were being -- there was -- here’s an interesting thing.</span> <span id="s1968">The Kultusgemeinde is sent with us, of grown -- grown people to help us, to be with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: Who I think tha -- wi -- “Into the Arms of Strangers” backs up this memory of mine, that they had agreed to go back.</span> <span id="s1971">That if they were found to have bolted, there were going to be no more children’s transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: And it seems to me so peculiar, that the Nazis who wanted us gone from the world, insisted on these people coming back.</span> <span id="s1974">There’s so many inexplicable --</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: -- and contradictory things in this -- in that -- this [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1977">Why not make our exit easy?</span> <span id="s1978">They made it difficult as possible.</span> <span id="s1979">What was that about?</span> <span id="s1980">You know, I always remember the story of the pharaoh and the -- and the gi -- a-and the -- and the Hebrews.</span> <span id="s1981">He wanted them gone, but wouldn’t let them go.</span> <span id="s1982">What gives?</span> <span id="s1983">That’s such a -- such a peculiar --</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: There’s some tension between both --</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: Isn’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: And there’s something psychologically peculiar there.</span> <span id="s1988">Go, but don’t go.</span> <span id="s1989">Get out of here, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: But we’ll make it hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: -- we’re gonna close -- or -- close the doors.</span> <span id="s1992">Very strange.</span> <span id="s1993">So these people came with us and as far as I know, stayed a couple of days in the camps to settle us, and then went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: And then went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: Went back into the -- into -- into hell -- into the hellhole.</span> <span id="s1996">Meanwhile, it was -- that -- that was an exciting -- exciting train ride.</span> <span id="s1997">First of all, the tension and the -- the usual nastiness between children, who was going to sit by the window.</span> <span id="s1998">If you were going to lie down, somebody else had to stand up for awhile.</span> <span id="s1999">And then it got to be your turn to sit and the other person to lie down.</span> <span id="s2000">And there were th -- always the girl who would not get up, who wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: Who wouldn’t -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">A: All the way to heaven or hell, that’s got to be the person --</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: -- who will not relinquish her seat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: And with -- were the -- i-in your little cabin were there mostly [indecipherable] --</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: All girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: All girls --</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: All girls -- all girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: -- and mostly the same age?</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: No, no, there were some older wome -- older girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: So, older ones, but not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: So, I mean, the older would be 14 or 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: I was 10.</span> <span id="s2015">There was a smaller child whom I wanted to make friends with, but she was -- she was -- I th -- always connected her with the child crying on the -- on the tram, but there’s no reason to think that she was.</span> <span id="s2016">I always -- I think I always thought she -- it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: The same one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: And she -- she wouldn’t give up her suitcase, she held it on her lap and wouldn’t let it go.</span> <span id="s2019">Then came o -- and the -- and the -- the helper, the woman would come in and -- and say everything’s okay, settle down, we’ll go in a little bit.</span> <span id="s2020">When I got -- was supposed to get up to give my place to somebody, I ha -- either remember or have created the good girl, the -- the -- the saintly girl who had never slept.</span> <span id="s2021">I -- I don’t know whether that’s true, but she certainly was very sweet, very kind to me.</span> <span id="s2022">She sent me to go wash my face in the bathroom, where I discovered the pleasures of green soap.</span> <span id="s2023">Because you could turn it upside-down and green soap would come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s2025">Oh, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: And the other thing that I discovered is that if you go to the toilet and you pee and then you put your foot down, the thing opens up so that the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: The thing goes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: -- pee can go through.</span> <span id="s2029">But you could also see the rails go underneath.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: Oh, there’s a lot of fun going on in the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: Is that the first time you were on a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: I was on a train all the time from -- from Vienna to -- to my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: But I don’t know that that was a proper train, that -- that didn’t count.</span> <span id="s2036">I don’t remember any of these charms --</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: Only these charms that -- right --</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: -- of the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: So finally I had to get out because people wanted to get in.</span> <span id="s2041">I also remember the experience of -- th-there’s always something interesting for children to watch other people sleeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: I remember being rather terrified at seeing my father sleep at some point.</span> <span id="s2044">That seemed very unnatural.</span> <span id="s2045">He was supposed to be up, I was suppo -- but to go along this -- that train and look in and see children sleeping was very interesting.</span> <span id="s2046">I remember it.</span> <span id="s2047">I remember people in the act of waking up and sitting up and looking sort of as if -- you know how people sit up, but they’re still asleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">Q: Asleep, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: I remember seeing that.</span> <span id="s2050">I -- I enjoyed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q: Did -- did a number of kids cry, do you remember, when you were walking through, or were people pretty quiet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A: No, I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: I reme -- then I remember when we got to the border and the Nazis came in, the border contrale.</span> <span id="s2055">And that was really terrifying.</span> <span id="s2056">That I remember being terrifying, because they went from -- not carriage, what is it?</span> <span id="s2057">Ca -- what do you call the -- the -- the subdivision, the -- the -- the cabin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: Cabin, a little cabin, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: And they t -- from our one they took one child out, and don’t know what happened, but she came back and she looked -- she looked frightened.</span> <span id="s2060">And I remember we didn’t ask her what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: She must have been searched.</span> <span id="s2063">I don’t think anything more than --</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: -- happened than that.</span> <span id="s2066">But the -- the girls, the older girls said to us, you mustn’t move.</span> <span id="s2067">And so we all sat down like that.</span> <span id="s2068">You know, when you sit there like that you begin to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: Shake.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: -- vibrate, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: Was no reason for us to sit like that, but it was something to do, I think, to be scared.</span> <span id="s2073">It -- it -- it’s almo -- it’s almost like an occupation.</span> <span id="s2074">To sit like that is better than -- cause you can’t do nothing when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: And then the Nazi, they got off again and the train went on --</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: -- into the -- into the charms of -- of being welcomed in Holland.</span> <span id="s2079">And be given chocolate and apples and it was very sweet, that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: And that was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">Q: Just one small detail.</span> <span id="s2086">When did the kids started singing Zionist songs on the train?</span> <span id="s2087">When you got into Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">A: There is a moment -- y-you’re on a platform and people, women are coming and handing you -- I mean, you are -- you’re in the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: On the platform are these women and they’re handing you food, apples, chocolate, hot chocolate to drink, chocolate.</span> <span id="s2091">We -- the train starts up again.</span> <span id="s2092">The children -- we’re all at the windows looking out and this way and we’re singing g -- wha -- I wa -- I forget how you say that in -- in German, something Princess Juliana -- Ju-Juliana, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Yes, sh --</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Does that sound politically incorrect?</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: That’s -- sounds right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: I mean, go -- I would not say --</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: Is it [indecipherable]?</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: -- God bless, but I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A: And the train gathers full speed, somebody cries, we’re out.</span> <span id="s2101">Now, this doesn’t make sense, because it should be the other way around.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: Other way around.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: Has to be the other way around.</span> <span id="s2104">But it certainly, at some point somebody says, we are out.</span> <span id="s2105">It -- it has to be.</span> <span id="s2106">The scene of the -- of the platf -- people being on this platform has to be afterwards --</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: -- except it -- I can’t make it do that.</span> <span id="s2109">I’ll tell you why I can’t do -- make it do that in my memory.</span> <span id="s2110">Because somebody says we’re out and immediately the -- the train doors open up and the boys come in.</span> <span id="s2111">We were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: -- a -- a -- a -- a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: Segregated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: -- of the girls, and now the boys come in.</span> <span id="s2116">And there is this big -- and they’re some of the bigger boys, and they turn back their lapels and they have -- I mean, how anybody would do that -- they have the Kruckenkreuz of Austria, they -- they -- it’s -- it’s a cross like that and it has -- it has a -- it’s like an eye.</span> <span id="s2117">They have the Pfadfinder, the -- the -- the -- the g-guides -- no, what are Pfadfinder?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: Boy scouts?</span> <span id="s2119">A: Boy scouts, the boy scout.</span> <span id="s2120">I mean, they have all these forbidden insignia on their lapels.</span> <span id="s2121">And there’s -- they were singing, and I think they were singing those Austrian songs, pre-Hitler Austrian songs, and they were singing Zionist songs, none of which I knew.</span> <span id="s2122">And I was hugging somebody, somebody was hugging me.</span> <span id="s2123">Now, the reason I cannot make my memory produce the scene at the -- when we were given the food after that -- because I remember going to sleep in the middle of this.</span> <span id="s2124">That’s what memory does.</span> <span id="s2125">And I remember that the very next thing that ha -- that happened was that somebody was putting my rucksack onto me -- I di -- one of the older girls, or one of the helpers, putting my rucksack on a-and identifying my suitcase and standing me down in the very cold air on the platform.</span> <span id="s2126">So th -- I mean, you know, I -- obviously, this is logically not possible, but that’s -- that’s how --</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q: That’s what your memory --</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A: -- that’s what memory, or memory does to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: Clearly.</span> <span id="s2131">And then we were -- the next thing I remember is being on the boat and being led into a cabin, which was incredibly comfortable.</span> <span id="s2132">Imagine after -- this was a day and a day, a night -- a day -- a night, a day, a night.</span> <span id="s2133">And now you’re in a little room that has a white bed with white sheets.</span> <span id="s2134">And I had a worry, I had a problem.</span> <span id="s2135">I couldn’t brush my teeth and what would my mommy think if I didn't brush my teeth, so that worried me.</span> <span id="s2136">And I had another worry.</span> <span id="s2137">I had been to -- I had been told that when you go on the water you throw up.</span> <span id="s2138">So I went, got into bed, and I prayed.</span> <span id="s2139">I-I was sorry I hadn’t -- I hadn’t brushed my teeth.</span> <span id="s2140">I hoped God would not met -- let me throw up and please don’t get -- take my parents to the -- away [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2141">Which incidentally, having your pa-parents taken [indecipherable] was daily.</span> <span id="s2142">I mean, you could -- we’d always hear of somebody -- so and so having been taken away, mostly men.</span> <span id="s2143">Almost always men, but not entirely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: So your parents being taken away, your father being taken away, it was just -- it wa -- it was what happened instead of going to the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: So -- and then I remember this black steward coming in and I’m s -- I said to him, am I going to throw up?</span> <span id="s2148">And he said no, what you do is you put your head down and you go right to sleep and then you won’t throw up.</span> <span id="s2149">Oh, and I also asked him -- he had brought me something that looked like coffee and he said, no tea.</span> <span id="s2150">And I said white tea?</span> <span id="s2151">And he said, tea with milk.</span> <span id="s2152">Which was my first experience of English tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: Did you have tea when you were in Vienna?</span> <span id="s2154">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s2156">Yes, tea with lemon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: With lemon, but not with milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: Lemon and sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: That was a great experience, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: But not tea with milk, that looked like coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: But he was ex -- he was very sympathetic.</span> <span id="s2165">He was very tall and sympathetic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: Were you alone in this cabin?</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2170">And I was also trying out my English on him and it worked fairly well.</span> <span id="s2171">The next day we arrived and the boat was on -- standing there.</span> <span id="s2172">The next thing as I remember, between then and getting to the camp, was the world of waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: You waited in the boat to be processed by these ladies sitting around the table.</span> <span id="s2175">I was wanting for one of the many photographers to come and take my picture.</span> <span id="s2176">And they didn’t -- and they didn’t take my picture.</span> <span id="s2177">And I tried many things.</span> <span id="s2178">I tried sleeping, I tried hopping, I tried eating.</span> <span id="s2179">Oh, I forgot about the sausage.</span> <span id="s2180">I have to tell you about the sausage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A: Because on the f -- when -- on the -- on the -- on the train, we were supposed to eat something and I took the sausage and I hated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: You hated it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: I couldn’t bear it, so I ate some chocolate instead.</span> <span id="s2185">And the next day there was still this sausage and I tried it again.</span> <span id="s2186">And by that time it was kind of yucky looking and I tried it again, I really didn't like it.</span> <span id="s2187">It was not the sausage I -- I wanted and liked.</span> <span id="s2188">So that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q: You wanted another kind of sausage?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: So I’m -- I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: Uh-huh, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: I mean, when I said to my mother I want sausage, I was just saying something because she needed me to say something, not because I had a taste in my mouth that needed satisfaction.</span> <span id="s2193">So I ate more chocolate, and I had boiled sweets and I had more chocolate.</span> <span id="s2194">And I was eventually processed and given that visa, that -- I -- I t -- that I showed you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: -- th-that c-card --</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: -- that special -- I mean, it was instead of a visa.</span> <span id="s2199">It -- to get a visa from the Austrians was a nightmare.</span> <span id="s2200">It’s like going to the Social Se-Security.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">A: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: That’s what it -- and they -- a-and they meant it to be difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: So we had these alternative things.</span> <span id="s2207">And they either -- the -- either the lady gave it to me -- I don’t know, but it had something to do, I saw that for the first time.</span> <span id="s2208">And here comes another wrong memory.</span> <span id="s2209">I was processed, and now I c-could -- could go with my coat, no suitcase, down the gangplank.</span> <span id="s2210">What I remember is going down the gangplank entirely by myself, seeing an empty dock with workers standing, watching, and that there was a mist, a -- a s -- a -- a -- one of those English -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s like -- it’s like as if mist had been decimated and was hanging in the air, going down to a huge glass and iron hangar where were rows and rows of suitcases and I was told to get mine.</span> <span id="s2211">And the notion of finding mine in all this seemed to me a nightmare.</span> <span id="s2212">So I sat down and cried some more.</span> <span id="s2213">And somebody came and of course all they did was look at the number and then go to the number.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: But here is the puzzle.</span> <span id="s2216">There exists, and it was given me by the wa -- la -- the producer of the movie, “Into the Arms of Strangers”, which deals with the -- with the Kindertransport, they actually found a picture of me coming off the gangplank.</span> <span id="s2217">You can see the -- I have it, I own it, I own this little picture.</span> <span id="s2218">It says 152.</span> <span id="s2219">I have my little cap on and I’m not alone by any means, I’m one of an-any number of children coming down the gangplank.</span> <span id="s2220">I’ve given up trying to dis-disentangle memory from the evid -- from contrary evidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: But if your experience of that was of isolation --</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: Yeah, yeah, it is not -- it -- it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: -- then you would just -- you’d knock everybody else out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">A: -- it isn’t -- it isn’t that puzzling, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: Right, that one --</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: -- perhaps it’s not, you’re quite right --</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: -- that one isn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: -- that’s very true, that’s not that puzzling.</span> <span id="s2229">I had a sense that I was alone in the world --</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: -- going into a world I didn't understand --</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: -- going to do a task which was demonstrably impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: So then we sat in -- on the -- on -- then we sat in a way -- in a place where we waited for a train.</span> <span id="s2236">And then we got in a train and then we sat in a place where we waited for a bus.</span> <span id="s2237">And then we sat in a bus.</span> <span id="s2238">And then a bus -- I wa -- of -- there’s a double-decker bus [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: Did you go to the bathroom in any of this here?</span> <span id="s2240">Did you -- is there any bathrooms in this waiting period?</span> <span id="s2241">A: Don’t remember going.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">A: [indecipherable] remember going to the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: I don’t know, I just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: Okay, I remember the bathroom on the train --</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: -- given our conversation about what we don’t talk about --</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: Yes, I don’t remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: In the train you do, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: -- there must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: Cause it sounds like there are long periods of time after you get off the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: Oh, like a day, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: Yeah, it must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: So it must have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A: But I’m still eating my chocolate --</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">A: -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">Q: And then na --</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: -- and it does occur to me that I’m not going to eat the sausage --</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: -- but there’s nothing I can do about that, so I pack it back --</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: And you keep it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: -- pack it back up and -- I do remember approaching this little -- little city of tiny little huts on the seashore.</span> <span id="s2264">It was adorable, these little -- they look like little dollhouses.</span> <span id="s2265">When I -- later on, when I was with my first foster family in Liverpool, the Cohens, I wrote up this experience that you and I are talking about now.</span> <span id="s2266">And I remember thinking how disappointing it was to just arrive there, no sunset, no sunrise, so I stuck one in.</span> <span id="s2267">Exactly the kind of thing as a grown-up writer that I would never do, I would never you know, tweak it, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: Like that, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: I mean, it’s absolutely against my -- I very -- my -- my -- my deepest morality says you don’t tweak a memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: I mean, it may be a wrong memory --</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: Right, but you don’t tweak it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">A: -- but you don’t mess wi -- you don’t tweak it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">A: You don’t enhance it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: Whatever is there, is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: Yes, and you keep -- in fact, you keep it at its lowest and let it work.</span> <span id="s2278">That’s -- that’s a -- that’s a -- that’s a holy --</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: It’s a holy writ.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: Very few th -- very few holy [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2283">You don’t -- you don’t distort f-for purposes of drama, is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">A: So we --</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">Q: So are you getting antsy in all of this waiting and tr -- or -- or not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">A: Exhausted, tired, sleepy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: You’re -- so you’re tired, sleepy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">A: Sleepy.</span> <span id="s2290">There are no strong emotions, no dram -- no s -- no drama.</span> <span id="s2291">None of the things that would make a good movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: And the other kids?</span> <span id="s2293">Everybody’s the sa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: Everybody --</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: -- is the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">A: Well, if you see -- if you look at the children in the -- in -- in the movie --</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">A: -- nobody is -- nobody is acting up --</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">A: -- nobody is screaming, nobody is howling.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2302">Right.</span> <span id="s2303">It’s very quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">A: They’re howling -- they may be howling interially, but they’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: We were then taken to this huge hall.</span> <span id="s2307">The -- I -- I -- I understand that these -- these camps were w-workers holiday camp, closed for the winter and they had opened them up for us.</span> <span id="s2308">They were su-summer camps, they were not for the winter, so while we were there they were installing -- this turned out to be one of the ha -- coldest winters in memory and they installed ovens, stoves, with -- with those l -- with those long -- with those -- what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: Pipes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: Pipes that were led up out t -- of the ceiling --</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">Q: [coughing] Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">A: -- the glass ceilings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">A: After we were addressed by the camp leader -- I-I don’t remember anything about that, we were sitting there wi -- we were assigned five little girls with one older one, or four little girls with one older one, and assigned to a particular -- one of these little houses.</span> <span id="s2315">And a-after we had put down our -- our -- our suitcases and chosen our beds, we were supposed to go back for a meal.</span> <span id="s2316">And I said I didn’t want to go, because it had occurred to me I had to do something with this scosset -- this sausage, which was beginning to smell noticeably and had been commented upon by the little girls in the -- in -- the little girls in [indecipherable] what -- what’s [sniffs].</span> <span id="s2317">So I said I wa -- I wasn’t hungry, I was sleepy, I was going to stay there.</span> <span id="s2318">And I was going to figure out what to do with this thing.</span> <span id="s2319">And here comes one of the great puzzles in life.</span> <span id="s2320">How do you -- how do you get rid of something that smells bad, which your mother has given you before you left Vienna.</span> <span id="s2321">There is no way that you can throw it out, but there is no way you can keep it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: Keep it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">A: And this is a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2325">You got a big problem here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: You got a big problem and you keep thinking that any moment now, you’re going to figure it out.</span> <span id="s2327">But you’re also sleepy, so you lie down in the bed, and you’re going to figure this out.</span> <span id="s2328">By this time you hear --</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: The kids coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: -- the kids coming back, so you scoot it under the bed.</span> <span id="s2331">I mean, y-you take that -- it’s in -- it’s in a paper bag --</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: -- and scoot it under the bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: Well, who is the horrible person who has made in her bed?</span> <span id="s2336">Yes, who --</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">Q: Who did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">A: Y-You jo -- you join, you know, where’s the thief?</span> <span id="s2339">You join the -- it’s -- it was a problem for -- for many a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">Q: So what did you end up doing?</span> <span id="s2341">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">Q: Nothing?</span> <span id="s2343">Did it just shrivel up, what?</span> <span id="s2344">A: It shriveled up and stank.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">Q: And just stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">A: It stayed there.</span> <span id="s2347">It stayed there.</span> <span id="s2348">I tried several things.</span> <span id="s2349">I tried to bury -- now -- by now the f -- the ground is frozen stiff.</span> <span id="s2350">I took it outside and tried to make a hole for it with the heel of my -- of my shoe, it wo -- it wouldn’t -- it wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s2351">It did occur to me I could throw it in the garbage, but I -- you couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2352">How -- you can’t throw that away.</span> <span id="s2353">Your mommy we -- went all the way down, she had a fight with your father about going down to get it, I mean.</span> <span id="s2354">Anyhow, he -- in -- in the -- in the -- they were -- they -- they -- meanwhile we spend most of our time in this big hall.</span> <span id="s2355">We stand around the -- the stoves.</span> <span id="s2356">They -- we have -- there’s a -- there’s a -- a drawing competition.</span> <span id="s2357">There’s the bodybuilder who came and did a performance for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q: There’s film of that, I think.</span> <span id="s2359">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">A: There’s -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: Oh, was that -- is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: -- there’s a film of -- of a guy play -- wh-who -- a tennis -- a tennis guy --</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: That’s true, you’re right, you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: No, ours was a -- ours -- and I was so impressed with him because he -- all he had on, these little purple trunks and it was really cold, and he could flap his stomach muscles.</span> <span id="s2365">That’s what I most --</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: He could flap -- flap this one --</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: And flap that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">A: -- he’d flap this one.</span> <span id="s2370">And I -- I did feel that it was very sweet of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: To come.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: It was sweet of him to be there.</span> <span id="s2373">The other thing that I remember is that the mayor of lo -- I think it was in Lowestoft.</span> <span id="s2374">They were -- we were in two camps, but we’ll make it in one camp, it’s too long a story.</span> <span id="s2375">We were moved out of the first camp because the next set of -- of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: Kids were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: -- kids were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: And I think they divided boys from the girls cause they were doing things that you’re not supposed to.</span> <span id="s2380">Even in -- even in this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Q: Even in this situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">A: -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">A: Where the little kids were -- were -- I don’t know, but there -- there was a -- there was -- we were separated and moved on in a train to another camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">Q: So the girls were separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A: I do not remember.</span> <span id="s2389">I -- I only remember that I -- well, the people I was with, I was suddenly no longer with, I was with other people.</span> <span id="s2390">Here it becomes -- you know, there’s -- it’s interesting, there’s just so much memory that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A: -- or detail that you can put in, then -- then i-it’s full and -- and there’s no more room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">A: The things rapidly that I remember.</span> <span id="s2395">I remember the mayor coming and my thinking I was going to ask the mayor -- my daddy had said, you must talk to the English people and get them out of Vienna.</span> <span id="s2396">My grandparents, my parents, my Tante Milla.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: And the two boys, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: And so I was thinking I’m -- I will go up to the mayor and ask him.</span> <span id="s2399">And I said to the girl who -- our -- th-the -- the -- the first big girl, I said to her, how do you say to bring out of Vienna, or some -- some phrase.</span> <span id="s2400">And she said, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2401">Now, I was still going to -- I had this -- this idea that once I was face to face with the mayor I would have the right words.</span> <span id="s2402">But of course when it came to the point, I wasn’t even sure which was the mayor and at that moment somebody addressed us, somebody -- he had a bad cold, I remember that.</span> <span id="s2403">The moment never happened.</span> <span id="s2404">And now I-I -- you know, I was beginning to worry that I was not doing this thing.</span> <span id="s2405">My parents were going to be taken to ca -- to -- it wasn’t called concentration camp in the war, I don’t know what it was called.</span> <span id="s2406">But it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Whatever.</span> <span id="s2408">Wasn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: -- whatever it was, they were going to go because I had forgotten to -- I hadn’t got around to talking to the mayor.</span> <span id="s2410">The other thing I remember is that there were all of a sudden in the camp, these kind of -- these kind of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q: What, wires?</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">A: Wires.</span> <span id="s2413">They were all written because they were -- they were -- they were filming it all, or -- or putting it on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s2415">A: And I remember all of a sudden th-there were these me -- these snakes, these big snakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: Big -- real snakes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: No, no, the wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: These snaky looking wires there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2421">Did they take your f -- they obviously took your picture somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: Maybe.</span> <span id="s2423">I don’t -- let me get on with this.</span> <span id="s2424">What -- what I also remember is they were dancing the horah, the children with their arms around each other and I wanted to dance, but I didn’t know if I was meant to join them.</span> <span id="s2425">And I didn’t know how to get myself out of my chair, into the situation of dancing.</span> <span id="s2426">And I thought, I wish somebody would come and ask me.</span> <span id="s2427">So one of the ladies -- there were -- there were lots of ladies in -- suddenly, in fur coats.</span> <span id="s2428">And -- and one of the ladies in fur coat said, don’t you want to dance?</span> <span id="s2429">And I said no.</span> <span id="s2430">And she said, why don’t you come and dance?</span> <span id="s2431">I said I don’t want to.</span> <span id="s2432">And then she went away, and I thought, if she comes back and asks me again, then I will come.</span> <span id="s2433">Course she never came back.</span> <span id="s2434">And I told this story tha-th-th-th-th-th-the Austrian filmmaker took us around and took us to some of these camps that now exist, that resemble these camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">A: And I was telling these tha -- th-there was a -- a-a -- a f-f -- a photo --</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">Q: Camera?</span> <span id="s2438">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: -- camera, who was about 19 years old and there was the -- th-the -- the -- the person with the boom.</span> <span id="s2440">He’s a young, gorgeous young -- young man.</span> <span id="s2441">And I told him this story, I thought it was so peculiar of a -- of a -- of a child that wasn’t able -- oh, they said, I know just how that felt.</span> <span id="s2442">I know exactly wanting to dance and not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Q: So did you ever get up?</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: Th -- I never got up, never got up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">Q: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">A: Sta -- sat in my little coat.</span> <span id="s2447">And you know, the longer you sit, the less possible it is to get up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">A: The -- th-the -- there were ladies walking around with -- with -- what -- what -- what do you call the thing that you -- clipboards.</span> <span id="s2450">And walking around saying -- saying to children -- choosing children.</span> <span id="s2451">They were looking for 20 children to go -- I mean, the whole point of our being in the camp is -- was ba -- while they were finding us foster homes, or schools to go to, or making the arrangements.</span> <span id="s2452">By the way, one of the things my mother said mo-most recently, she said, it just occurs to me that when we sent you away, we had no addresses.</span> <span id="s2453">We didn’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: And that seems so amazing.</span> <span id="s2456">Cause they were still in the process of finding places to put us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2458">And they didn’t know where you were going to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: They didn’t know where we --</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">A: Anyhow, they were walking around and this lady comes up to me and says -- two of them, there were two of them, and one of them came up to me and said, wh-what is your name?</span> <span id="s2462">I said, Lore Groszmann.</span> <span id="s2463">How old are you?</span> <span id="s2464">I am -- I said half past 10.</span> <span id="s2465">And she said, would you like -- oh, they said to each other, she speaks English.</span> <span id="s2466">And one of them said, would you like to go to an Orthodox home?</span> <span id="s2467">I said yes.</span> <span id="s2468">And so they put me down and they said tomorrow you’re going to Liverpool.</span> <span id="s2469">And then when they’d gone, I was writing a letter -- I was in process of writing a letter, I said, by the way, what’s Orthodox?</span> <span id="s2470">Q: You were writing to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: To my parents, what’s -- what does that mean, Orthodox?</span> <span id="s2472">And my father wrote me back and said, do not go to an Orthodox home.</span> <span id="s2473">By that time I was already in being --</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">Q: [indecipherable] over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">A: -- having learned -- I was already doing a good job not tying my shoelaces on a Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">Q: And you liked it.</span> <span id="s2477">You liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A: I liked it.</span> <span id="s2479">I liked it.</span> <span id="s2480">You know, there is something in a confusion, if there’s certain things you know are right and wrong.</span> <span id="s2481">This you’re supposed -- I never learned how they were -- expected me to hold my knife and fork, cause it was different.</span> <span id="s2482">That I couldn't figure out.</span> <span id="s2483">But to not tie my shoes on a -- on a -- on a Shabbas, that I could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: That you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: There were lots of things that were very clear, and I thought it was interesting.</span> <span id="s2486">I thou -- I-I thought that was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: I -- I knew to tell them th-that I -- the -- the ca -- the maid not to put the milk [indecipherable] and the [indecipherable] together, I figured that one out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">Q: It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s2490">When did you start writing letters?</span> <span id="s2491">After you got to the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">A: Oh, in the camp I started --</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">Q: In the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">A: -- writing camp -- and I wrote letters to my parents and my grandparents and I wrote letters to the cousins, here come the cousins.</span> <span id="s2495">The cou -- the -- the -- Tante -- Tante Erna, who had been called a cow, they were already in England because of his business connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">A: And I wrote them interminable letters.</span> <span id="s2498">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">Q: The cow was in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">A: The cow was in England, the cow and her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">Q: And her hu --</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">A: Tante Erna and Uncle Ernst were already in England and they -- I wrote them letters.</span> <span id="s2503">Now, what I think happened is that they sent the letters on to the organization called Bloomsbury House, which was -- you must have come across that, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A: They were the o -- they were the organizers, together with the Viennese Kultusgemeinde for -- for managing these refugee matters.</span> <span id="s2506">Because my parents did, as a matter of fact, by March have a visa to England as a married couple; that is to say as a butler and cook.</span> <span id="s2507">I have always assumed, and I don’t know why I know this, that my uncle e -- Uncle Ernst sent this [indecipherable] or in some way organized this, because I don’t know who else would have organized it, there was nobody in England except I and these cousins, who could have --</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: But your -- your letter, the one letter that I read is extremely poignant, because while you’re talking like a kid about how wonderful things are, things -- but in your heart there’s this fear about your parents.</span> <span id="s2509">And I can imagine someone receiving that letter --</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">A: And being moved by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Q: -- and being moved and si --</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">A: I was also operating like a writer.</span> <span id="s2513">I had -- I had images.</span> <span id="s2514">Out -- outside -- out behind the -- behind the cottage was a rose, and the rose had snow on it and I was saying how will my parents -- if you don’t get my parents out, they will die like the rose in the snow, stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">Q: Like in the [indecipherable], right.</span> <span id="s2516">It’s fabulous, and unusual, it seems to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: And I also thought, that’s really good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: That’s real -- you did.</span> <span id="s2519">You -- you knew it was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">A: Oh, that’s a good one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">Q: It was, it’s a great -- you’re too much.</span> <span id="s2522">Let’s stop the tape and change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">A: I want to tell you about the other image that -- that I remember from -- from a letter which I was proud of, and which I think makes a -- m-ma -- it’s really more interesting.</span> <span id="s2526">Wa -- one of the problem -- one of the problems of getting out of Austria, out of Hitler-land was that you needed a number of documents.</span> <span id="s2527">You needed a visa to get into the other country.</span> <span id="s2528">You needed a -- the people of -- a letter from -- of either a job or people to look out for you.</span> <span id="s2529">You needed an exit visa.</span> <span id="s2530">And all of these things were dated, and all of these things had to be somehow procured and current at the same time.</span> <span id="s2531">And it simply didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s2532">And my image was to say what I’ve just said to you, and say, it’s like winding up a ball of wool that keeps falling out of your hands and unraveling.</span> <span id="s2533">And I thought that was pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: That was pretty --</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">A: And I mean, it even refers to something real, that was a real, real disastrous problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">Q: Yes, because you can’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">A: An-And the w -- yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">Q: -- you can’t catch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">A: -- and the -- it was also the m -- the malice of all the countries like America, who made as many -- who put as many roadblocks in the way as possible, unconsciously, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">Q: When you wrote these letters to your relatives, were you mainly at the Cohens or were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">A: No, these were done -- these were written in -- in the camp, in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: But this -- this one, if this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">A: The one that I’m talking about, the one with the rosebud --</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">A: -- was definitely from the camp because the rosebud was outside the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: But you must have known that you were going to the Cohens, because this particular letter seems to have care of Lore Shelly at the Cohens.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: This somebody else’s writing.</span> <span id="s2548">Look at that.</span> <span id="s2549">That’s a grown-up writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">Q: Oh, you’re right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">A: Somebody put that on, I -- I was surprised to see that.</span> <span id="s2552">Somebody must have added that to my letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: Put it on later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">A: Did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: You’re right, it isn’t your hand -- it isn’t the same --</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">Q: -- you’re absolutely right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">A: That’s a grown-up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">Q: You’re right, cause your handwriting is different, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">A: I mean, we gave the letter --</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">A: -- to the camp person --</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: -- who must then have -- that must have been in that [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">Q: So you’re very self-conscious in writing these letters, of tryi -- of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">Q: Both of being the writer and being this -- a desperate kid who wants your parents out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">Q: And you love the fact that you create these great images at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">Q: You’re very --</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">A: -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2573">It’s not pure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">Q: It’s -- no, no, no, I understand it’s not pure.</span> <span id="s2575">Do you have all these letters?</span> <span id="s2576">Did you ever get all of them back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: I think I do.</span> <span id="s2578">I also have the letters I wrote to my grandparents that are incredibly boring.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">Q: Incredibly boring?</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">A: And later on -- boring.</span> <span id="s2581">I mean, what do you write to your grandparents year -- week after week after week?</span> <span id="s2582">And what do they write to you?</span> <span id="s2583">I mean, at one point I started learning to play the piano and I would tell them what I was learning to play.</span> <span id="s2584">And since I learned to play the same thing through many a month, that’s what was in those letters.</span> <span id="s2585">I have those letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">Q: You have those letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">Q: This one I don’t think has the -- see -- see whether you recognize this letter.</span> <span id="s2589">Can you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">A: Not without my glasses, sorry.</span> <span id="s2591">Here, hang onto that for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2593">This is where you’re writing to ern --</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">A: Is that the letter that was in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">A: In --</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">Q: In the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">A: In the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">Q: In your own book you don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">Q: -- you don’t repeat the letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">A: Today fourt -- is 14th of December.</span> <span id="s2603">We live in a holiday camp.</span> <span id="s2604">That’s -- so that is still --</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">Q: The camp, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">A: -- that is still in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: And 14th of December is only a few days after you actually left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2609">In fact, it must be the first day we were there.</span> <span id="s2610">We left on the 12th, that I’m pretty sure about.</span> <span id="s2611">Should I read it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">Q: So this means --</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">A: Shall I read it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">Q: Yeah, read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">A: Ah, we live in a holiday camp toge -- oh, this is a translation, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">Q: Yeah, yeah, you didn't write in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">A: Y-Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2619">I don’t know if it’s a good translation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">A: “Our address will be Dovercourt Camp, Holiday Camp, Harwich, England.”</span> <span id="s2621">That’s the second camp, the first was Dovercourt, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">A: “Where I am now it is beautiful.</span> <span id="s2624">We live in dark brown huts in which no more than four children can sleep.</span> <span id="s2625">We have two little windows with red curtains.</span> <span id="s2626">When we in the hut put the light on, it looks from outside as if there were a fire inside.</span> <span id="s2627">In front of the hut are small green wooden fences.</span> <span id="s2628">In the morning when I sit up in bed, I can look through the window and see far out across the ocean.</span> <span id="s2629">Sometimes the sun has reddened the sky so that it looks as if there were pink silk drawn across it.</span> <span id="s2630">The juicy green grass, too” -- this is -- this is self consciously pu-purple, all right?</span> <span id="s2631">“The juicy green grass too, adds to the beauty of the region.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">Q: Uh-huh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2634">“Just imagine, it is so beautiful here and yet it is not beautiful.</span> <span id="s2635">I would almost say that it is ugly because whatever I am doing, I must think of my beloved parents.</span> <span id="s2636">Though it is good to think of one’s parents, it is not good when one doesn’t know whether they were still able to sleep last night” -- yeah, this is purposeful.</span> <span id="s2637">Yeah, this is -- this is meant to be a tear raiser -- tearjerker.</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">Q: Yeah, but not every 10 year old, for heaven sakes, would --</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">A: No, I was a special 10 year --</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s2644">No, then it is truly not good to think about it.</span> <span id="s2645">Sometimes when I think about it I have to keep myself from crying, and not out of homesickness, but because of the above-mentioned reasons.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">A: “That is why I beg you a thousand times to give me news of my parents.</span> <span

id="s2662">Q: It’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: Yeah, it’s amazing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">Q: It’s very unusual --</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A: -- yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">Q: -- to think of a 10 year old writing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">A: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">Q: And so it’s not difficult to think that they would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: Be moved, ah, oh surely --</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">Q: -- extremely moved --</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">A: -- surely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">Q: -- and try to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">A: And the anxiety is very genuine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">Q: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">A: I remember -- I-I remember a dream of my grandmother crucified.</span> <span id="s2676">Now, where I get that shape from, she was a -- she was nailed to a wall like this.</span> <span id="s2677">That was a -- one -- one dream that -- from which I woke with a -- with -- with -- in a -- in a sweat.</span> <span id="s2678">And then, after my -- I’ve learned that my grand -- my parents had moved again, to another apartment.</span> <span id="s2679">This is now when I’m living in -- in -- in Liverpool with the Cohens.</span> <span id="s2680">Let me just finish the little story.</span> <span id="s2681">The next morning, after I had said I wanted to go live an Orthodox family --</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">A: -- that my father’s warning about not going to Orthodox reached me -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: While you were there, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: But the next day we went on the train out to Liverpool.</span> <span id="s2686">And it was while I was out in the bathroom here, wa -- out in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s2687">I came back to the -- to the -- to the compartment, that’s what it’s called, and found that somebody had taken down my -- my rucksack, my backpack, opened it up, and there was the sausage.</span> <span id="s2688">Which by now had a different kind of smell.</span> <span id="s2689">It’s no longer active decay, but that sort of musty smell.</span> <span id="s2690">And one of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: So you put it back in your --</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: Oh, I kept putting it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">Q: Oy vey.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">A: Cause I couldn’t throw it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A: And one of the children said, it isn’t even kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">A: And I died.</span> <span id="s2699">I mean, I remember -- here -- here’s a -- here’s an image that I res -- I-I -- do you know, you feel as if the waters close over you, of shame, of embarrassment.</span> <span id="s2700">Now when we got out, I guess it was the s -- in -- in -- in -- in Liverpool, that one -- the two ladies were -- who were -- picked us up said to me, now you can throw it away.</span> <span id="s2701">And I threw it away and I finally hollered.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">A: And I remember -- you know, because you -- you keep commenting on the double consciousness, I remember howling and I remember looking at the two ladies and seeing they were frightened, because they didn’t know what to do with an out of control, weeping child.</span> <span id="s2704">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">Q: Was -- was that your -- your separating?</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">A: It was that -- that sausage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">Q: That -- which was separating from your mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">A: Well, it was -- you know, I mean, we all know -- know that something given us by somebody has --</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">A: -- it -- it becomes a -- it becomes a sympathetic magic, I mean, it’s a magical object.</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">Q: Right, you’re right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">A: That’s why it -- so many [indecipherable] Victorians will have lockets, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">A: Stupid things, but they represent -- they represent the person who gave them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">A: And I think that sausage --</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">A: -- had got a -- had got a wallop of that kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">A: -- of meaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">Q: So this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">A: But I just wanted to bring us to it, to get -- get us finally to Liverpool.</span> <span id="s2723">What wa -- what were you asking me about the letter?</span> <span id="s2724">What -- oh, something about the letters.</span> <span id="s2725">One thing you do when you really need letters desperately, you try and keep disappointment at bay.</span> <span id="s2726">So I would make long arithmetical arrangements with myself.</span> <span id="s2727">I would say, it takes -- it’ll take five days to get to Vienna, it’ll take them five days to answer.</span> <span id="s2728">Then they will -- it takes five days to get back, let’s say six days.</span> <span id="s2729">I’m not going to have a letter for the next 15 days.</span> <span id="s2730">Then of course on the next day you get a letter.</span> <span id="s2731">Happiness.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">A: And I turned that -- I had a little friend called Renata and I turned that into a game with her and she never understood what the principle was.</span> <span id="s2734">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q: She always had the wrong --</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">A: She always -- she always made -- well, she made her letters come as fast as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">Q: Possible, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">A: I was always winning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Q: And you were always winning, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">A: Until she -- until she said she wouldn’t play any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">Q: So this is a real story that you have in the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">Q: This is -- this really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">A: Yes, oh yeah, abso --</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">A: -- oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2747">But I wanted to tell -- I wanted to give you some sense of how -- how it was, that fear for the parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A: Once I learned that my parents had once again moved, now I’m without a -- a visual --</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">A: -- place in which to place them.</span> <span id="s2752">And I had a extraordinarily uncomfortable image of my father on a -- I think it’s -- I think it’s something I got from Laurel and Hardy.</span> <span id="s2753">I think at one point one of them is up on a big po -- th-that -- that connection came to me as ki -- came to me long afterwards, but the-there’s a pole and one of them is straddling on top, you know, with a for -- like -- like a -- like a -- like a -- like a bug that’s -- that’s wiggling its -- and the problem is, as long as I was -- if I tried to think of my parents, they were up on that extremely uncomfortable pole.</span> <span id="s2754">So I had to si -- try to not think about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">A: Which is like the elephant in the room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">A: And it was excruciating, the -- the compli -- the -- the -- the -- the tri -- the attempt to not think about your parents because if you thought about them they would -- they would be uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s2759">It was -- it was a -- for m -- for many days in -- my occupation.</span> <span id="s2760">And I think my -- the foster parents, the Cohens, would see me suddenly get up and run out of the room and come back again in an attempt to get away from the image, with a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">A: -- or to occupy myself in some way so I wouldn’t think about them.</span> <span id="s2763">Very [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">Q: And they -- and they wouldn’t understand, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">A: And of -- they -- I didn’t understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2767">And yet, you couldn’t stop thinking about them in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2768">A: Well, I couldn't stop thinking about them and I had to because it was dangerous for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2770">So you were in an impossible situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">A: It was impossible, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: It was really impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">A: So the -- the stress was not the kind that expresses itself in a flow of tears, it’s this other stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2775">A: Now, there was a tear management that I learned after awhile.</span> <span id="s2776">I would sit in front of the fire on a low stool and I discovered that if you -- if you a -- you -- you can use tears like a blanket, but you didn’t want to cry them, because then -- the blanket then was all over.</span> <span id="s2777">So I would bring them up to here, and sit looking into the fire and to have tears up to here.</span> <span id="s2778">And that -- I got -- I got an exp -- got to be expert at being able to do that.</span> <span id="s2779">And of course these poor people were trying to cheer me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">A: They kept telling me I -- why -- why -- don’t be -- don’t be miserable, and I’m s -- I was saying I’m miserable, I’m not miserable.</span> <span id="s2782">I wish I was properly miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">Q: When you say you brought the tears up to here --</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">A: Up to here --</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q: -- you mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">A: -- that’s how it felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">Q: -- inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">A: That’s how it fel -- up to here, yeah, inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">Q: Up to here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">A: Inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">Q: Inside the eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">A: Before they came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">Q: Before they came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2794">A: Yeah, that was it.</span> <span id="s2795">And you could do that and then they would st -- then they would go away and you’d have to work at it again to -- to get them up there and keep them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">Q: Oh my God.</span> <span id="s2797">So they found it extremely difficult to be with you, because you were not being with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">A: I was not being with them and I was unable to call my foster mother Auntie Lena.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">Q: And she wanted --</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">A: She wanted me to call her Auntie Lena and for some -- for reasons that I don’t understand, I couldn’t get those words --</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">Q: Out of your --</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">A: -- out of my mouth.</span> <span id="s2803">So I couldn’t call her anything.</span> <span id="s2804">So another reason I kept disappearing from the room, because I couldn’t think of a way to address her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">Q: How did you address the father, Mr. Cohen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">A: He didn’t demand anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">Q: He didn’t de -- oh, so it didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">A: He didn’t ask for anything, so this wasn’t a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2810">Only she was the problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: The girls -- there were six girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">Q: That’s a lot of people in this house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">A: Five girls, six girls.</span> <span id="s2814">I have to count them.</span> <span id="s2815">There were a lot of young women, of various ages.</span> <span id="s2816">The youngest was 16, who was my friend, who still is, we’re still in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">A: -- w-we write for the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s2819">I go to see her when I’m in -- in -- in -- in -- in London.</span> <span id="s2820">She is -- she is a Zionist and a poli -- very political, wonderful, wonderful woman, terrific woman.</span> <span id="s2821">And she brought me books to read which I couldn’t because I -- my English was certainly not up to that.</span> <span id="s2822">And she brought me paper to write my story on.</span> <span id="s2823">And that’s when I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">Q: Did she --</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">A: -- wrote this story for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">A: 36 pages full of -- full of sunsets and sunrises.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">Q: But that was lovely of her to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">A: Very.</span> <span id="s2830">She was wonderful.</span> <span id="s2831">She was -- she was very sympathetic and very, very lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">Q: So she was bo --</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">A: The other women -- the other members of that family, except for the father, who wanted nothing except to give my sixpences.</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">A: And sit -- let me sit quietly, without bothering me, without m -- dem -- without making demands on me.</span> <span id="s2836">It was very sweet to sit with my tears right here and he was sitting in his cou -- couch over there, with his big, thick glasses.</span> <span id="s2837">And he would just sit and I would sit, and that was very cozy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">Q: And that was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">A: And as soon as somebody else came in, there was something I was supposed to do, like be cheerful, or cry, or do something --</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">Q: Something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">A: -- that she could understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">Q: So was this daughter with whom you were closer, the youngest of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">A: Ruth, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">Q: -- oh, ru -- Ruth was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2845">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">Q: Wis -- she wasn’t like her mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">A: No.</span> <span id="s2848">She was the child in the family who was fighting her mother.</span> <span id="s2849">Everything her mother did was stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">A: She was the reb-rebellious one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: She now tells me how much she values her parents.</span> <span id="s2854">Those par -- you see -- you saw the parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">Q: Yes, I saw the parents [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">A: And I almost said to her, value what -- value what.</span> <span id="s2857">But I didn’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">Q: You didn’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">A: No, I didn't say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">Q: You would have a long time ago, I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">A: I hope not.</span> <span id="s2862">But she is a classy lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">A: To look at, to talk to, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">Q: That’s funny.</span> <span id="s2866">Is it Aunt Lena who tells you that your parents are coming?</span> <span id="s2867">Who tells you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: Aunt Lena -- I am now at a -- at the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s2869">They put us in a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s2870">I have never -- I -- I look back on that, it’s a -- I think it’s a -- an Orthodox school, for one thing.</span> <span id="s2871">It’s the world at -- it’s that -- it’s the Jewish -- the Jewish world I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2872">It seems s-su -- subclass to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">Q: Subclass?</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">A: Yes, underclass.</span> <span id="s2875">I mean, it’s -- it’s -- I don’t know that world.</span> <span id="s2876">It’s -- i-it’s sa -- it feels to me like as I went into a cave, okay?</span> <span id="s2877">I mean, children were still being beaten with -- with -- with -- with --</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">A: Yeah, ga -- boys.</span> <span id="s2880">Boys --</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">Q: The boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">A: -- boys had their hands beaten with rulers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">A: I -- it’s really -- it was really a -- a -- a -- a -- a place -- a -- a -- an -- land I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2885">Do you know the kind of thing I n -- or don’t -- or don’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">Q: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2887">I certainly don’t know that from experience, no.</span> <span id="s2888">So they put you in that school and the other girls were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">A: All the -- all the children --</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">Q: -- all the children were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">A: -- all the 20 -- 20 little girls went into that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">Q: 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">Q: So you get there when?</span> <span id="s2895">You’re -- you get there December?</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">A: Ah -- I -- this is December -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">Q: Something December.</span></p> <p><span id="s2898">A: I -- I was in two camps for about less than two weeks, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">A: So I -- I we -- I went to -- we came in this -- we -- we arrived on December 14th and I think before the end of the year, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">A: Bef -- before the end of the year --</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">Q: You were with the Cohens.</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">A: -- I was with the Cohens.</span> <span id="s2905">And I -- I got to be 11 years old at the Cohens and they were going to give me a party.</span> <span id="s2906">And on the day of -- the day before or the day of my birthday, Mrs. Cohen came -- I-I was called to the headmaster’s office, and in the headmaster’s office sat Mrs. Cohen and said -- the headmaster said, you can go home today.</span> <span id="s2907">And I understood -- already understood -- I mean, there must have been talk of my parents coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">Q: Cause somebody had to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">A: Which I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">A: I -- there must have been something in the air, and I might not have chosen to know it in -- so as not to be disappointed.</span> <span id="s2912">But, I said, my parents have come.</span> <span id="s2913">And Mrs. Cohen looked at me and waited for me to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">Q: Something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">A: -- something.</span> <span id="s2916">I mean, just as I hadn’t cried efficiently, here I wasn’t happy sufficiently.</span> <span id="s2917">So I -- she said, aren’t you happy, you funny child.</span> <span id="s2918">She does nothing but write letters home, and now I tell her, she’s not even happy.</span> <span id="s2919">So then we got in the car, and on the way I kept producing the drama that meant I was happy, because obviously I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">A: -- I wasn’t -- I wasn’t -- what I felt was very clear to me.</span> <span id="s2922">And I’ve had -- you know, i-i-in -- in the movie, in “Into the Arms of Strangers” the number of people who have it -- describe something like this, the removal of a burden that you didn’t know you were c -- you were carrying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">A: You’re suddenly realize what it’s -- what it feels like to be a person.</span> <span id="s2925">Y-Y-You haven’t known that you were not, but you’re suddenly out from under.</span> <span id="s2926">And the feeling is exquisite and does not express itself in ah ha ha ha.</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">A: You know, it doesn’t express itself --</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">Q: Ri-Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">A: -- in the expressions o -- it’s true joy, and had nothing to do with -- with the things that -- that usually express.</span> <span id="s2931">It seems to me s -- I’ve said to students in my writing classes, one thing you can be sure of, when you feel real emotion, it will not be what you think it’s like.</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">A: Cause what you think it’s like is taken from the last bit of probably not very good literature.</span> <span id="s2934">Whatever it is you’re going to be feeling, you will be astonished.</span> <span id="s2935">And you will -- or at least I didn’t, never manage to behave in that expected literary fashion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">Q: You know, your mother, when she was interviewed for the film, said when you left, nobody could speak.</span> <span id="s2937">The film just says, I didn’t speak when I came home, but if you read the full testimony --</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">Q: -- that they didn’t include, she said, nobody spoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">A: She said my father went, lay down in the bed and s -- s -- lay perfectly still --</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">Q: Still, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">A: -- and unspeaking and unmoving for days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2944">So is that not feeling?</span> <span id="s2945">I mean, clearly it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">A: Well, but is that what you would expect?</span> <span id="s2947">I mean, if you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2948">Q: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2949">I don’t -- I don’t know what

id="s2953">And you know, our -- I have learned to really let people ex -- feel what they feel --</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">A: -- without -- without assuming that I know what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">A: Or waiting for a particular -- I mean, it’s wonderful to wa -- watch movies of the 40’s and 50’s, where everybody does exactly [indecipherable] what they’re supposed to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">A: It’s not so any more, I think.</span> <span id="s2960">We are much more subtle now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">Q: It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2963">Q: It’s true, they were -- they were really giving you a [indecipherable] tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">A: They were telling what you can -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">Q: -- what to feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">A: And then people f -- when they didn’t do that, thought, oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">A: I’m s -- I’m scared of messing up here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">Q: Messing up is right.</span> <span id="s2970">And now it’s much more nuanced.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">Q: But is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">A: And surprising, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2975">But somewhere you -- you wrote about ur-geography.</span> <span id="s2976">When you fir -- when -- a-and the fact --</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">A: Oh that, that’s about bedrooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">Q: Be -- yes, about bedrooms, but it also seems -- cause at the end you said something about Proust said it right.</span> <span id="s2979">A says something to B and B hears something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: Oh yeah, that’s argument, that’s -- that’s in the nature of -- of excha -- yeah, it’ll -- it’ll apply here perfectly well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2982">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">Q: That wa -- one doesn’t

oddly enough I -- I -- I have made that -- that funny connection.</span> <span id="s2987">I as -- I-I -- see, check yourself out.</span> <span id="s2988">Put yourself in your be -- in your earliest bedroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">A: You know where the door is, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">Q: [indecipherable] entering, yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">A: And my point was in that -- in that piece already, that we somehow assume that the other person knows our ur-bedroom.</span> <span id="s2993">And if you don’t know my ur-bedroom, there’s nothing else.</span> <span id="s2994">Everything else i-is not clear to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">Q: That’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">A: And the -- the -- I mean, it’s -- internationally, it is a disaster that we don’t know what the other person wants.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">Q: Wants.</span> <span id="s2998">What they’re saying, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">A: And that they do -- that we don’t -- we don’t understand what -- what their meaning, or their -- their -- their needs, or their wants are.</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">Q: Are you -- I -- when I read that, I began to think about the earliest bedroom that I remember and exactly what it looked like and exactly where things are.</span> <span id="s3001">And I remember explaining something to somebody about the bedroom, but not -- they didn’t ask me where things were.</span> <span id="s3002">But all that I see is where things are.</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">A: Yeah, and I think I mentioned that -- that Ellen [indecipherable] --</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3005">A: -- was -- was -- was eager to point out that what really mattered was that -- what is right and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">A: And what is in front, because we didn’t -- we didn't know.</span> <span id="s3008">And we didn't know it because we thought everybody knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">Q: Yeah, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">A: It is so basic that it didn’t seem to need to be mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">Q: So one thinks that what one is saying -- that people know that wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">A: I mean, I’m not going to tell you that my

<span id="s3054">What --</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">A: I’ve been sitting here trying to remember the first view of them, and I can’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">Q: You can’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">A: It’s gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">Q: Do you remember sitting in the living room [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">A: Oh, I remember many, many moments, but not --</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">Q: The first.</span></p> <p><span id="s3061">A: -- I mean, I’m trying to open this, like my friend --</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">A: -- tried to recover the -- the -- the scene in the -- before I got in the train, I’m trying to open the door, I’m trying to look and I don’t -- I don’t know it.</span> <span id="s3064">What I remember is my mother’s eyes, which were huge and tear laden.</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">A: I remember my father looking ill, sitting in a chair, not knowing what to do with himself, tending to echo what my mother said.</span> <span id="s3067">And I remember their leaving.</span> <span id="s3068">I remember their l -- they stayed a couple of days and one of the things that happened on those couple of days was my birthday party, with a whole lot of children from school.</span> <span id="s3069">They were not -- there was s -- ch-children from the street that I’d played with and children from the school, refugee children from the school.</span> <span id="s3070">And the English children introduced games that I remember -- still remember with horror.</span> <span id="s3071">One of them was you were ba -- you were blindfolded and then told a funny story, which included your putting your finger on something and you -- and when you put your finger it was a -- a -- a -- an -- a tomato.</span> <span id="s3072">So that you put your finger in something that within the story context was really disgusting, like an eye, you know.</span> <span id="s3073">That’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s3074">And I remember looking at my mother, whose eyes were following me.</span> <span id="s3075">Everywhere I went, my mother’s eyes followed me.</span> <span id="s3076">I remember my mother constantly thanking the Cohens, and my father echoing the thanks that my mother was giving them.</span> <span id="s3077">I remember that the neighbors collected money for my parents, who were about to go down south to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">Q: To Kent?</span> <span id="s3079">A: -- Kent, to become -- to Kettles -- the place was called Kettlesell House, to be a -- a cook and a butler.</span> <span id="s3080">And I remember their leaving and I was standing at the top of the stairs, and I wouldn’t go down.</span> <span id="s3081">I -- I wouldn’t go down to embrace them.</span> <span id="s3082">I was embarrassed.</span> <span id="s3083">I was in some way confused by the double -- by the double family that I now belonged to.</span> <span id="s3084">And my mother and my father standing there being -- about to be driven to the train by one of the daughters, and I wouldn’t come down.</span></p> <p><span id="s3085">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">A: I have to make that analogy.</span> <span id="s3087">In the movie, “Into the Arms of Strangers” there’s Erica, whose parents are about to arrive at the end of the war on the same train as her schoolmates and she can’t stand it.</span> <span id="s3088">So she says -- sh-she’s about 13 - 14, and she says, I’ll -- I’ll just run down and put the kettle on for tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">Q: Because it’s too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">A: One of the -- one of the sadnesses of these stories are how hard it was to become reunited with a broken family.</span> <span id="s3091">It’s not -- I mean, you should think of what could be more blissful than to be reunited with your fa -- and it was.</span> <span id="s3092">But it was complicated.</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3094">A: It was unmanageable on both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s3095">Q: Was it worse then the children were older, or when wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s3096">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3097">Q: -- you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">A: There’s a story -- and again, one a -- one a -- one of the stories in “Into the Arms of Strangers” where the -- the 18 year old pushes away his father’s hand from his hair.</span> <span id="s3099">It -- it -- it’s -- it was -- it’s -- and I -- when -- when later on, when I rejoined my parents, I was disappointed that they weren’t English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3100">Q: That they weren't English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">A: They were not English, they were these oth -- these -- these people from some -- some strange past of mine.</span> <span id="s3102">I mean, I loved them, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3103">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3104">A: -- I wanted to be with them.</span> <span id="s3105">Nevertheless, there was something the mat -- there was something wrong with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3106">Q: And you were already more English in some ways, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s3107">A: I-I -- I th -- I knew how to serve tea in the drawing room and my parents were have -- ta -- kept having this coffee on the table.</span> <span id="s3108">I -- I mean, that’s terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3109">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3110">A: I mean, when you think back, I mean, there was a time when I embarrassed and horrified at this.</span> <span id="s3111">Now, I just look back on it as another one of those --</span></p> <p><span id="s3112">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3113">A: -- one of those results --</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">Q: Did your mother talk to you about her memory of that first time that she met you -- she saw you after the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3115">A: She did.</span> <span id="s3116">And what I’m telling you is now -- has -- contains -- or -- wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s3117">Q: Part of her story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3118">A: -- her -- yeah.</span> <span id="s3119">I -- I -- it’s -- it -- it was a -- it was a disastrous, wonderful visit, because I couldn’t -- I c -- y-you -- there wa -- there wasn’t an embrace that will do it, there wasn’t a kiss that would --</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">A: -- I mean, again, literature thinks -- or -- or movies think that -- that -- that -- that -- that kiss, that embrace will -- will -- will close the deal, but it doesn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">Q: It doesn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A: Y-Yeah.</span> <span id="s3124">I have to really think more about that.</span> <span id="s3125">Why that was, why the -- that -- those reunions were so regularly disastrous.</span> <span id="s3126">And nothing like as disastrous as the -- the -- the children who never saw their parents again, who never got over that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3128">A: I mean, and there were only 10 percent of us --</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">Q: Who had [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3130">A: -- accor -- yeah, according to -- to some statistic that ever got reunited with our parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">Q: I don’t know, there must be -- there’s so much that’s unresolved, that seeing each other again doesn’t res -- necessarily resolve it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">A: Well, you know, I mean, al -- there’s enough problems between parents and children --</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">Q: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">A: -- at best of times, and now you add -- you add a separation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3135">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">A: And add the fact that the child that you get back is three months older, or eight years older, and there has become -- has -- has acquired a bit of a different nationality.</span></p> <p><span id="s3137">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3138">A: And a lot of snobbery.</span> <span id="s3139">A wall up of snobbery.</span> <span id="s3140">That one get -- that’s one one gets over.</span></p> <p><span id="s3141">Q: That one gets over pretty quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">A: By the time you’re 80 you’ve got over the snobbery of that -- of those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">Q: You know, I once interviewed a woman whose mother sent her to another family because she thought she would be killed, so this way at least the child would be safe.</span> <span id="s3144">It ended up the mother lived, was reunited with the daughter.</span> <span id="s3145">I met the daughter when she was over 50.</span> <span id="s3146">She has never, ever forgiven her mother for giving her up, even though she knows intellectually --</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">A: She no -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3148">Q: -- she did it to save her life, and her mother is alive and across the street.</span></p> <p><span

there’s someth --</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">A: Do you know in the movie “Secret Lives”, by Aviva Slesin, about the children given away when they were -- Aviva herself was given away to a -- a -- to a p-peasant woman when she was two months old and returned to her mother when she was three years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s3154">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s3155">A: That -- but that is not the subject of the film, but these -- but she takes other --</span></p> <p><span id="s3156">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">A: -- hidden -- hidden children back.</span> <span

Although your father ends up being too sickly to really do very much, or he’s also [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">A: My father was too sick, my father was -- I -- I think it happens so often that the women were more agile, more adaptable, more adventurous in a way, more willing.</span> <span id="s3174">My mother was a -- became a wonderful cook.</span> <span id="s3175">She liked

right.</span> <span id="s3187">Left and right were beyond him in that -- in that condition.</span> <span id="s3188">So my mother would do the cooking, take off her kitchen -- kitchen -- kitchen apron, put on the service apron and wa -- go in and serve for him and come back and take off the c -- put on the other ga -- and make the next -- next course and go in and serve it.</span> <span id="s3189">He could not .</span> <span id="s3190">He could not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">Q: Was -- is it an accurate portrait in the book, of your frustration with him?</span> <span id="s3192">Is -- is --</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">A: Yes, I’m sorry to say, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">Q: -- is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3195">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3196">Well, I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3197">Q: I mean, you were a kid, after all.</span></p> <p><span id="s3198">A: -- I was on my mother’s side --</span></p> <p><span id="s3199">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3200">A: -- and I could see that he was making her life -- she didn’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3201">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3202">A: I’m not sure that she’s -- thought it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3203">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3204">A: But I saw it.</span> <span id="s3205">I saw that he was making her life yet more difficult.</span> <span id="s3206">And you know where I saw it?</span> <span id="s3207">Later on in Guilford.</span> <span id="s3208">The Jewish doctor saw it.</span> <span id="s3209">He saw that she was wearing herself.</span> <span id="s3210">Wasn’t even aware that she was doing all the housework, going to visit him in the hospital, going back to cook dinner and coming back in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3212">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">A: He, at point, forced her into a holiday.</span> <span id="s3214">So I was not the only person who saw --</span></p> <p><span id="s3215">Q: Who saw that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">A: -- that what -- the -- the -- the weight she was carrying was beyond --</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">Q: [coughs] Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">A: -- beyond the possible.</span> <span id="s3219">But I was very angry at my father for being ill, for making life so hard for her.</span> <span id="s3220">For the unreas -- his unreasonableness, in his illness.</span> <span id="s3221">I have thought that my father’s illness, in the weight, in the -- in the -- in the dread of it, was as bad as Hitler.</span> <span id="s3222">I mean, the experience of Hitler was no worse than the experience of my father’s ongoing illness.</span> <span id="s3223">Those two things seem to carry -- have been as -- one as -- as heavy as the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3225">A: I said the -- something like this to my class.</span> <span id="s3226">I -- I teach a class in creative writing at -- for the 92nd Street Y, and I said something about this.</span> <span id="s3227">Somebody asked me about it.</span> <span id="s3228">And one of my students began to cry.</span> <span id="s3229">She said, my brother is ill like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">Q: I don’t know what to say to that one, because it -- it would appear as if the historical weight of what the Nazis were doing was much heavier than --</span></p> <p><span id="s3231">A: Of course it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s3232">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3233">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">Q: However, your experience of it is not so weighted on the Hitler side -- I mean, it’s par -- it’s -- it’s partly that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">A: I think if I had been in -- in the -- in the camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s3236">Q: The camp, you wouldn’t say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3237">A: -- I would not be saying that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3238">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s3239">Yeah.</span> <span id="s3240">I think that’s what I’m thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3242">But let me say that the emigration, the Kindertransport --</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">A: -- was no heavier than my father’s ongoing illness.</span></p> <p><span id="s3245">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">A: And no -- ma-maybe it’s -- may-maybe it’s -- it’s foolish to try and weigh these things, but it -- I’m really only expressing the immensity of --</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">A: -- of my father’s -- of the illness, my father’s illness and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3249">Q: It’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">A: -- everything.</span> <span id="s3251">An --</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">Q: It’s very clear that everything is colored by that, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">A: Yes, yeah, it is.</span> <span id="s3254">I used to -- I had this notion, I think I describe it, I had that notion that things never happen when you expect them, or from the direction in which you’re looking for them.</span> <span id="s3255">Which resulted in my notion that if I kept imagining my f -- well, the things that could be happening to my father at any given moment, that’s not what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s3256">Kept me once again like before, very busy trying to keep on top of all possibility so that it -- to prevent it from happening.</span> <span id="s3257">I mean, h-he -- he had the -- he had strokes, one after the other.</span> <span id="s3258">I was going to prevent another stroke by imagining him having a stroke.</span> <span id="s3259">That’s hard work.</span> <span id="s3260">And there was my mother at that time, we’re now in Guilford.</span> <span id="s3261">We’re -- we’re many -- many -- many ha -- e-events, many adventures later, and she’s working as a cook down in a subterranean kitchen, which I could look down into, because that -- there was a grate, right?</span> <span id="s3262">So here’s my father, continuing to be -- to have -- to bother her by having strokes, and here she is down, working in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3263">Q: And you can’t stand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3264">A: And I can’t stand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3265">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3266">A: And then I would go visit him in -- in what was then the ward.</span> <span id="s3267">I mean, people la -- he lay in a bed, and in this direction and this direction were other beds with men in them.</span> <span id="s3268">And you -- they would get their food and you would look down -- look down the row and you would see the mouse, like that.</span> <span id="s3269">And I would have my -- I had my bag here like that and I had my hand in it on a book.</span> <span id="s3270">And I kept wondering, I wonder if it’s okay for me to take out my book and read while I’m sitting next to my father who is now eating.</span> <span id="s3271">I’m visiting him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3272">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3273">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s3274">Q: You never took it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s3275">A: No, never took it out.</span> <span id="s3276">And I kept my finger in the pages.</span></p> <p><span id="s3277">Q: Did you talk with each other, or was it mainly s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3278">A: He was not -- he -- he kept saying that he wanted my mother to take him home.</span> <span id="s3279">So I would yell at him, please don’t suggest that to her, because she’ll do it, right?</span> <span id="s3280">Then he said, I wish she would write to Paul -- my Uncle Paul, who had -- who had stopped short of getting a doctor’s certification, as if maybe my uncle’s information, medical information, could save him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3281">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3282">A: And then I would try to explain to him that this was not reasonable.</span> <span id="s3283">That was our conversation.</span> <span id="s3284">Not --</span></p> <p><span id="s3285">Q: Nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s3286">A: Nothing else.</span> <span id="s3287">I pitied him.</span> <span id="s3288">I was irritated by him.</span> <span id="s3289">I wish he would stop leaning on my mother.</span> <span id="s3290">I wish I weren’t so bored.</span> <span id="s3291">Bad.</span> <span id="s3292">You know, I had another thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s3293">Q: Mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3294">A: I remember I thought nevermind about my being such a bad daughter.</span> <span id="s3295">I will be old, and I will be ill and my children will not want to sit next to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3296">Q: And you -- and you’ll pay the price?</span></p> <p><span id="s3297">A: I will pay --</span></p> <p><span id="s3298">Q: You thought of this at 10?</span></p> <p><span id="s3299">A: I thought -- no, 10, I’m not 10 --</span></p> <p><span id="s3300">Q: 11, no you’re a little --</span></p> <p><span id="s3301">A: -- now, I’m 15 --</span></p> <p><span id="s3302">Q: -- all right, 15.</span> <span id="s3303">Still --</span></p> <p><span id="s3304">A: -- I’m [indecipherable] big girl, I’m a -- I’m a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3305">Q: You’re a big girl, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">A: [indecipherable] a big girl.</span> <span id="s3307">And I’m, you know, I thought it’s okay, let me -- let me not give myself such a bad time, because there will be a payoff.</span> <span id="s3308">I would -- I would get a payback from this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3309">Q: You’re in five different places in England, right?</span> <span id="s3310">Five different homes bef --</span></p> <p><span id="s3311">A: The -- the -- the Cohens, who -- I think he was a manufacturer of furniture or se -- cellar furniture.</span> <span id="s3312">Jewish Orthodox in Liverpool.</span> <span id="s3313">The next one was -- then I went to stay with my mother and father, who were being a married couple.</span> <span id="s3314">The Cohens wrote and said -- Co-Co-Cohens have had it with me.</span> <span id="s3315">And it was a [indecipherable], so they suggested that it might be happier for me to stay with them.</span> <span id="s3316">And anyhow, they had some aunt or some -- somebody needed care.</span> <span id="s3317">So my mother talked to the lady.</span> <span id="s3318">These were called our ladies.</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">Q: Our ladies, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3320">A: And the lady connected her with the -- with the Tumbridge -- the Tumbridge la --- church ladies’ Committee for Refugees, who found me a home with the Gillams.</span> <span id="s3321">He was a railroad stoker.</span> <span id="s3322">I mean, it’s so sweet to think of somebody being a stoker.</span> <span id="s3323">That meant he was the person who put the fuel in the place that makes the train go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3324">Q: Train go, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3325">A: He was a -- a -- a union man, a -- a charming, witty fellow.</span> <span id="s3326">He had a wife who played the piano.</span> <span id="s3327">He ha -- who in -- sta -- stammered.</span> <span id="s3328">And two daughters, one of whom I’m still in touch with --</span></p> <p><span id="s3329">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3330">A: -- Mari.</span> <span id="s3331">Mari -- oh, this is an interesting story.</span> <span id="s3332">I -- oh it -- probably shouldn’t even tell this story because it was told me in confidence, but it’s so long ago.</span> <span id="s3333">There was also -- these are people, these are working class people who take in the Jewish refugee child and they also took in the orphan from the orphanage.</span> <span id="s3334">And the orphan from the orphanage was a horror.</span> <span id="s3335">His name -- I call him Albert, I think his name was Harold.</span> <span id="s3336">And he was -- he was -- h-he really hated me, because I was the newest -- the newest member an-and a -- I can’t even do Harold.</span> <span id="s3337">But we hated each other.</span> <span id="s3338">And a -- at some point we were wa -- Mari and I went to go to the public school -- oh -- ra -- or the -- the -- th-the s -- city school, and we both won a -- a -- a -- a -- what do you -- what do you call it, a -- a -- a -- a -- we were -- both could have gone to the -- what she called the la-ti-da school, and told me that she wasn’t going to go because it would -- it would betray her class.</span> <span id="s3339">And I certainly didn’t care anything about betraying any class --</span></p> <p><span id="s3340">Q: Class --</span></p> <p><span id="s3341">A: -- and I went.</span> <span id="s3342">Now, many, many, many, many years later, I was in vi -- was in England and I -- Mari and her husband, a -- who was an engineer, a ship -- shipbuilder’s engineer, came to see me and I reminded her of this.</span> <span id="s3343">And she said, that wasn’t why I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s3344">I went because my mother told me that my sister Joy had not made the examination and there would be bad blood in -- in the family if I went.</span> <span id="s3345">So that’s why I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s3346">I said, Mari, would you do the same thing with your children?</span> <span id="s3347">She said, are you kidding?</span> <span id="s3348">A-And -- well then Mari -- and then it was Mari -- what I said in the book, and what I believed was that the discrepancy between our education finally got too much for the Gillams and they said I had to leave.</span> <span id="s3349">They also had an aunt, a blind aunt who needed to be taken care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s3350">Q: Who came, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3351">A: So this is not in the book and I’ve never -- never -- this is not in public.</span> <span id="s3352">Mari then went to the bathroom, and John, her husband, said to me, that was not why they -- you know why they sent you away?</span> <span id="s3353">Because Harold attacked Mari and tried to rape her, and they wanted to get you out of the house.</span> <span id="s3354">So all this time I have been thinking of them in such a demeaning -- or such a m -- not demeaning, cause they were very good, but minimizing way.</span> <span id="s3355">Whereas what they did was to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3356">Q: Was to protect you.</span> <span id="s3357">Try to protect.</span> <span id="s3358">Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s3359">A: If you really -- to judge other people’s motives is just -- it’s a -- just a stupid thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s3361">A: And he said don’t tell her then, that they didn’t want you to know that.</span> <span id="s3362">But I’m glad I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3363">Q: Yeah, I am too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3364">A: Anyway, they said I had to leave, and then I did this amazing thing.</span> <span id="s3365">I borrowed Mari’s bicycle and went to the church ladies’ committee and said I have to leave.</span> <span id="s3366">And they gave me an address, and I -- I motor -- I motored out -- I mean, I f -- I bicycled out to this -- to this other family and interviewed th -- you know, the -- I showed you a picture of the three little children?</span></p> <p><span id="s3367">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3368">A: Those were her children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3369">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3370">A: Sh -- He was a munitions worker and I -- I -- I literally interviewed her.</span> <span id="s3371">She was a very simple young woman.</span> <span id="s3372">And I decided I would come and stay with her.</span> <span id="s3373">I lived with them long enough for him to get -- you know, we do know that the war has started in the meantime, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3374">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3375">A: The war has started, my father has been sent to the Isle of Man, my Uncle Paul has been sent to the Isle of Man, because here there were enemy -- enemy --</span></p> <p><span id="s3376">Q: Aliens.</span></p> <p><span id="s3377">A: -- German speaking enemy aliens.</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3379">A: I came -- went to live with -- wi -- wi -- I forget what their name was, but anyhow, he was sent to Croydon where munitions -- as a munitions worker, and they sent me to live with her mother and father.</span> <span id="s3380">They were old -- sweet, old people.</span> <span id="s3381">He was a milkman.</span> <span id="s3382">He had a pony with a little panel truck.</span> <span id="s3383">And these people -- you know, people take children and take children in.</span> <span id="s3384">They had a daughter called Ruby who went -- who was a -- a ladies’ maid, I -- a -- across town, who went to stay with a neighbor so that they could give me her room.</span> <span id="s3385">I mean, these are -- you know, none of -- I-I’ve said, none of these people were really -- I -- I didn’t have a wonderful time with any of them, but how amazing they were.</span> <span id="s3386">So this Ruby goes to live next door.</span> <span id="s3387">There are a batch of young males in that family and they all live upstairs in the attic, together with a -- a -- a-a -- a -- a London -- what do they call them when they sell the children away from London?</span> <span id="s3388">You know, to -- to -- to -- to avoid the blitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s3389">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3390">A: I’ve lost the word for the moment, but you know what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s3391">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3392">A: So there -- there are any number of people in this household.</span> <span id="s3393">This is when my mother, who was -- had to le -- and I’m leaving out bits, but -- but I -- let me fill in, when the war first started, England went into a -- into a panic.</span> <span id="s3394">First my mother and father’s flashlights were taken.</span> <span id="s3395">Flashlights and maps, in case they were going to give --</span></p> <p><span id="s3396">Q: Signals.</span></p> <p><span id="s3397">A: -- signals to the enemy.</span> <span id="s3398">Then they interned all male, German speaking enemy aliens over 16.</span> <span id="s3399">The next rule was that women also could be spies and needed to be moved inland from a certain mileage to the coast, so they wouldn’t give signals.</span> <span id="s3400">So my mother came and picked me up and we went to Guilford, the last place where we lived, where she and I got -- she got a lovely job with this -- with the best family in the world.</span> <span id="s3401">They were Scots, they were classy Scots.</span> <span id="s3402">He was a architect and he lived -- he was a -- a national trust architect and lived in a s -- in a -- let me call it a 17th century water mill.</span> <span id="s3403">They lived in part of it, the other part was for public -- the public could go and -- and visit it.</span> <span id="s3404">And these are still my very dear friends.</span> <span id="s3405">We go -- we go visit.</span> <span id="s3406">They come and stay with me, I stay with them.</span> <span id="s3407">They are the s -- the salt of the earth.</span> <span id="s3408">The people without class consciousness.</span></p> <p><span id="s3409">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3410">A: The upper class --</span></p> <p><span id="s3411">Q: The upper class [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3412">A: The upper class Socialists.</span></p> <p><span id="s3413">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3414">A: So, [indecipherable] Socialists.</span></p> <p><span id="s3415">Q: And your father is ill enough so they sent him out of the Isle of Man and he comes to Guilford, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s3416">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3417">Q: And are we talking 1941 now, ’42? ’</span> <span id="s3418">41?</span> <span id="s3419">We’re talking about the attack on Poland now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3420">A: ’41 -- ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s3421">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3422">A: I -- I -- I -- I -- yeah [indecipherable] got the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3423">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3424">A: And I went to live with the church -- th-the -- the -- one -- one of the ladies working for the church committee in Guilford.</span> <span id="s3425">Miss Ellis and Miss Wallace.</span></p> <p><span id="s3426">Q: Who were Protestant.</span></p> <p><span id="s3427">A: High church.</span></p> <p><span id="s3428">Q: High church.</span></p> <p><span id="s3429">A: Protestant is --</span></p> <p><span id="s3430">Q: Episcopali --</span></p> <p><span id="s3431">A: Well, it’s not called Episcopalian, but High Church.</span></p> <p><span id="s3432">Q: It’s High Church.</span></p> <p><span id="s3433">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3434">Church of England.</span></p> <p><span id="s3435">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3436">A: Church of England.</span></p> <p><span id="s3437">Q: We have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3438">End of Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s3439">Beginning Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3440">Q: You were starting to talk about the last house you were in, with the High Church women.</span></p> <p><span id="s3441">A: Can I tell you about a one that preceded this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3442">Q: Sure, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3443">A: Because I have not written about it at all.</span> <span id="s3444">This was upstairs and downstairs.</span> <span id="s3445">I lived downstairs in upstairs and downstairs.</span> <span id="s3446">It was an extraordinarily grand house, with seven gardeners gardening the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3447">Q: Seven?</span></p> <p><span id="s3448">A: Seven gardeners and a butler and a housekeeper and my mother was the cook and there were any number of ladies’ maids.</span> <span id="s3449">And there was the cook’s little daughter staying over.</span> <span id="s3450">And you would have thought -- you know, this was th-the -- this -- this was the real McCoy, except it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s3451">Except that the lady of the house was, I think an -- an old -- an old prostitute who was living there with her new young man and the -- and the husband was off somewhere in -- in the city.</span> <span id="s3452">But otherwise --</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">Q: Otherwise it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3454">A: -- it was the experience, you know, all that you learn in -- in “Upstairs, Downstairs.”</span> <span id="s3455">You know what I’m talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s3456">Q: Yeah, yeah, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s3457">A: Wa -- that was how it was regulated.</span> <span id="s3458">It was very interesting, or -- or God -- Godsford?</span> <span id="s3459">It was Godsford.</span> <span id="s3460">Th-The Altman movie.</span></p> <p><span id="s3461">Q: Right, ri-ri-right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3462">A: Anyhow, just want to put that in because that’s very -- it was very interesting to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s3463">Q: Now this was the only place where your mother was working where you were actually living, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s3464">A: I wasn’t living, I was visiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3465">Q: You were visiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3466">A: She was there only for a short period, and I can’t quite fit in -- I -- I can’t -- you know, I don’t -- I’m -- I wasn’t good at dates, but -- I’m not good at dates, and I wasn’t -- don -- don’t know how it fits in, but she was there for several months and I stayed with her for several weeks.</span> <span id="s3467">Y -- and then somehow at that point -- I think from there we went to Guilford.</span></p> <p><span id="s3468">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3469">A: I cannot put it in --</span></p> <p><span id="s3470">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3471">A: -- in -- in -- in --</span></p> <p><span id="s3472">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span

Ellis, two elderly ladies in a Victorian house, where again, there -- I -- I still sometimes look at the confusion of my dinner table and remember how Miss Ellis and Miss Wallace could or -- the orderly upper class procedures, you know, in family life.</span> <span id="s3477">I’ve never been able to repeat it, but I remember it.</span> <span id="s3478">I remember liking it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3479">Q: You liked it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3480">A: Yeah, I liked.</span> <span id="s3481">Miss Ellis ha -- always ha -- ho -- Miss Ellis was a -- was in her -- mu-must have been in her 50’s, she seemed very old to me.</span> <span id="s3482">I think the -- I think Miss Wallace -- I would now imagine Miss Wallace was her companion, but that was never -- it was never brought up, there was never -- Miss Wallace drove an Austin with a -- with a tra -- what’s the seat that you ope -- sit in the back?</span></p> <p><span id="s3483">Q: A trundle seat?</span></p> <p><span id="s3484">A: Trundle seat.</span> <span id="s3485">And it -- it had to be cranked up in order for it to go.</span> <span id="s3486">Miss Ellis rode around town on one of those high bicycles, like -- like -- like ene -- do you know the movie, wa -- one of my favorite movies, “Blithe Spirit”?</span> <span id="s3487">If you ever see Madame Arcati ride some -- looked exactly like Miss Ellis.</span></p> <p><span id="s3488">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3489">A: I love that movie because it looks like Miss Ellis.</span> <span id="s3490">And they had this formal household, Miss Ellis always loved babies, and she always had an -- a maid, who had an illegitimate baby to -- which she could bring into the li-living -- in-into the drawing room, we didn't have a living room, it’s the drawing room, in order to play with.</span> <span id="s3491">And upstairs there was a study for the canon.</span> <span id="s3492">Canon O’Malley, or canon something from the -- from the -- Miss E-Ellis’s church.</span> <span id="s3493">It -- I -- I have -- you know, I have said, and I think I might have shocked people to say that I find it simply am -- wonderfully amazing and -- and terrific that I got to the -- live the inside life of all -- of the class system of England, which most people don’t get to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s3494">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3495">A: I mean, you visited as -- you visited, you are a -- a tourist.</span> <span id="s3496">But I was a member of the household, I was a child just barely less than the child of the family, but almost like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3497">For instance, Ellis at -- I didn’t have a nursery for me [indecipherable] chil -- but I ate -- I didn't eat -- I ate breakfast and lunch with them, but dinner in the kitchen with the -- wa -- or the -- some -- some memory of how children are treated in a household.</span></p> <p><span id="s3498">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s3499">So it wasn’t just because you happened to be this refugee kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s3500">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3501">Q: No.</span> <span id="s3502">This was the way children --</span></p> <p><span id="s3503">A: But

<p><span id="s3516">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3517">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s3518">A: But I’m amazed at the -- I’m amazed --</span></p> <p><span id="s3519">Q: That they were opened --</span></p> <p><span id="s3520">A: -- and they didn’t -- yeah, and some of them got tired of me and got rid of me after several months, but the -- but Miss Ellis kept -- they kept me there for -- well, fr-from 12 to -- til I was sixt -- four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3521">Q: Four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s3522">A: Miss Wallace, who was the -- she was the member of the church committee, she bought a house in -- she bought two houses.</span> <span id="s3523">She bought one house in which she housed English gentry who had lost their money, and she bought a house for people like my mother and father and other refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s3524">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3525">A: I mean, that’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3526">Q: It really is amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3527">A: That is amazing.</span> <span id="s3528">There was a -- a meeting where -- where the refugees met at.</span> <span id="s3529">In fact, it was the auditorium of my -- of my high school that I -- that I went to, where the refugees met on Thursdays, which is the maid’s day off, day out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3530">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s3531">And so you could see your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3532">A: I could see my mother.</span> <span id="s3533">I could also run across to Albury Lodge, which the -- the house that -- that Miss Wallace had bought and go visit my mother and my f-father there.</span> <span id="s3534">And there you see you have the difference between all these -- all these -- all these Jews living together and here was my -- my upper class, English --</span></p> <p><span id="s3535">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3536">A: It took some getting over.</span></p> <p><span id="s3537">Q: To get at -- to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s3538">A: I mean, the orderliness, the handsomeness of the furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s3539">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3540">A: It was a -- i-it was the class -- I was playing -- I was living out the class -- class system of --</span></p> <p><span id="s3541">Q: Of the -- of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3542">A: -- class world of England.</span></p> <p><span id="s3543">Q: What do you think motivated all these people to -- because especially --</span></p> <p><span id="s3544">A: Virtue.</span></p> <p><span id="s3545">Q: Virtue, all of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3546">A: Christian --</span></p> <p><span id="s3547">Q: It’s Christian virtue.</span></p> <p><span id="s3548">A: -- virtue.</span> <span id="s3549">Now, it didn’t make them loving and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3550">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3551">A: -- and -- and -- but it made them take us in.</span> <span id="s3552">Miss Ellis -- you know, I have an image in my mind.</span> <span id="s3553">When I began to menstruate, I have an evening where Miss Ellis is sitting, sewing me my -- what do you call them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3554">Q: Napkins, or [indecipherable] or whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s3555">A: Nap -- yeah, sanitary napkins, she sewed them for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3556">Q: Sanitary.</span> <span id="s3557">Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3558">A: I mean, that is this -- this -- that is amazing, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3559">Q: It is amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3560">A: It’s a very moving, I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s3561">Q: Did she explain to you?</span> <span id="s3562">Did you know what was going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s3563">A: Well, you don’t want to hear that story, that’s just everybody -- every girl has a story of -- of --</span></p> <p><span id="s3564">Q: The story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3565">A: -- of being shocked and surprised.</span> <span id="s3566">You don’t want to hear that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3567">Q: It’s certainly shocking, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3568">A: But there she was, taking care of it once --</span></p> <p><span id="s3569">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3570">So it wasn’t your mother, it was her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3571">A: It was her, yeah.</span> <span id="s3572">I was living -- that’s where I was living.</span></p> <p><span id="s3573">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3574">I didn’t hear --</span></p> <p><span id="s3575">A: By the way, I just wanted to say something about the -- maybe this is [indecipherable] these wonderful people in the mill, the MacGregors.</span> <span id="s3576">They not only -- they took one look at my mother and said, oh you come and eat in the dining room with us.</span> <span id="s3577">When you finished cooking, you come in and eat with us.</span> <span id="s3578">Then my father had his nth stroke and was in the hospital and came out of the hospital.</span> <span id="s3579">They said oh, let him come in -- yous -- he can s -- live with us.</span> <span id="s3580">And I was welcome to play with the children.</span> <span id="s3581">That was a house -- this was during the worst bombing in London, th-the blitz in London.</span> <span id="s3582">And every weekend this house was open to people from -- who were tired of being blitzed.</span> <span id="s3583">They would come out the week and spend the week in the -- in the mill.</span> <span id="s3584">If there weren’t enough beds then you just put -- you put mattresses on the floor and there were always enough coats to cover people with.</span> <span id="s3585">That’s the kind of people they were, they really a -- th-they were and are extraordinary.</span> <span id="s3586">These were people who were -- y-you see, they were good in the way m-most of my -- my m-m -- foster parents were not.</span> <span id="s3587">They did their duty, but these people did their duty out of some -- out of some -- some heart -- un-unthinking heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s3588">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3589">A: I always -- I -- I love them.</span> <span id="s3590">I -- I really think they were -- they were -- they were extraordinary.</span> <span id="s3591">It’s -- it’s it -- almost a -- a -- almost a view of what -- what the world could be like.</span></p> <p><span id="s3592">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3593">A: First of all, the mill is absolutely gorgeous, and -- and -- and it’s built over -- over a wa -- a running water, with the mill wheel, though broken, still -- still there, and the watercress growing on the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s3594">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3595">A: I mean, it’s just physically beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3596">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3597">A: And we all -- we go spend summers there sometime.</span></p> <p><span id="s3598">Q: Do you?</span> <span id="s3599">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3600">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3601">But there’s a great difference between that kind of goodness and that other principled goodness.</span> <span id="s3602">I mean that difference -- I’m making the difference there.</span> <span id="s3603">Miss Wallace certainly was -- was -- was good-natured and -- and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3604">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3605">A: -- careful.</span> <span id="s3606">Miss wa -- Miss Ellis, the older one was -- was not.</span> <span id="s3607">She was doing her duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s3608">Q: But you benefited from all these different --</span></p> <p><span id="s3609">A: Oh, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3610">Q: -- [indecipherable] in -- in extreme ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s3611">A: -- and I -- as I -- as I then add, I have not done the same.</span> <span id="s3612">I have not taken in alien children.</span> <span id="s3613">Most of us don’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3614">Q: Most of us don’t, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3615">A: Most of us don’t.</span> <span id="s3616">Most of us have perfectly good reasons for not doing it, but they did it.</span> <span id="s3617">The Cohens, the Gillams, the -- all of them, and -- and I find it amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3618">Q: It is ama -- when you think about how many people have --</span></p> <p><span id="s3619">A: Think what -- I think what it’s like to have a child in your house.</span></p> <p><span id="s3620">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3621">A: You know, I didn’t have to be a nasty child, I was just a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s3622">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3623">A: And all that involves and all the -- all the thought, all the -- all the -- the -- the noise, the mess.</span> <span id="s3624">And then they go and menstruate.</span></p> <p><span id="s3625">Q: And then they go -- and then they become young women, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3626">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3627">I tho -- I think they were -- I think the English were just wonderful, they were won -- ama -- wa -- amazingly wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3628">Q: Were you following the war very carefully?</span></p> <p><span id="s3629">A: I was hearing the bombs.</span> <span id="s3630">Guilford was on the route from London to wherever the -- the -- the bombers came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s3631">Q: So you could hear the bombers.</span></p> <p><span id="s3632">A: So you see a double -- a double -- ah, you would see our bombers fly in this classic formation, to bomb what they were going to bomb.</span> <span id="s3633">In the morning we would open the windows and watch them come back and you would see where there were holes in the formation.</span> <span id="s3634">You could count how many had been --</span></p> <p><span id="s3635">Q: Been shot down.</span></p> <p><span id="s3636">A: -- had been shot down.</span> <span id="s3637">Meanwhile, the bombers flying back, would very often unload -- unlike Graf Bobby, they would unload and we would very often have bombs in the vicinity.</span> <span id="s3638">They were not -- we were not targets, but they would unload before they flew back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3639">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3640">A: There was a lot of bombing.</span> <span id="s3641">I remember lying in bed thinking, where there ever be a time where there will not be bombs dropped?</span> <span id="s3642">Later in the war, there were the doodlebugs.</span> <span id="s3643">Do you remember?</span> <span id="s3644">Do you hear about?</span> <span id="s3645">They were self-propelled and they made a very particular noise, they went bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, and then they stopped.</span> <span id="s3646">And we were, at that point already knew you -- I forget, you ca -- a count of five and they would explode.</span></p> <p><span id="s3647">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3648">A: And that’s when you wondered whether you were the one they were exploded on top of.</span></p> <p><span id="s3649">Q: And were you -- were you hearing rumors about concentration camps and killing centers?</span></p> <p><span id="s3650">A: I can’t remember when that became conscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s3651">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3652">A: That is Ruth Kluger’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s3653">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3654">A: Her story of -- of the -- of th -- her shock at the unwillingness of the Jews in England and in America to -- to want to hear --</span></p> <p><span id="s3655">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3656">A: -- to want to think about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3657">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3658">A: I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s3659">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3660">A: -- the answer to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3661">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3662">A: I am -- I am shocked that I don’t know the answer to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3663">Q: It’s possible nothing was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3664">A: Now wa -- the -- but England a -- is in the war in a way that really, the States don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s3665">Q: We’re not, obviously, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3666">A: Miss Ellis -- when -- when France fell, Miss -- the -- they create -- they were -- imagine of -- pieces of concrete, about this high with ab -- as -- a pole of iron.</span> <span id="s3667">Imagine four of them.</span> <span id="s3668">Imagine those poles connected with barbed wire, and they went across the whole of England, including through Miss Ellis’s rose garden, to keep out the invasion, the -- the German a -- the Germans.</span> <span id="s3669">Miss el -- Miss Wallace, she’s the one who -- the -- the -- the member of the refugee committee, collected our refugee’s paper, put them in boxes, ready to bury them, so that the nat -- the in -- the incoming Nazis would not --</span></p> <p><span id="s3670">Q: Look at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3671">A: -- identify the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s3672">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3673">A: I mean, it was, in -- in a sense that you were about to be invaded.</span> <span id="s3674">That it didn’t happen was, I think a surprise.</span> <span id="s3675">They would change the names of ro -- of streets.</span> <span id="s3676">They would rearrange street names to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3677">Q: To confuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s3678">A: -- to confuse.</span> <span id="s3679">It just a -- it just happened now to happen, but -- but England was entirely -- and there was the Home Guard.</span> <span id="s3680">My mother was so anxious to play her part that she and m -- an-and my singing teacher from school were Home Guards together to -- to walk up and down the street.</span> <span id="s3681">And she did -- see, this is where m -- where my fa -- where I was angry with my father.</span> <span id="s3682">My father had lost the lo -- was becoming -- a -- e -- couldn’t walk any more, couldn’t -- he -- he was becoming senile.</span> <span id="s3683">And my mother did not only her own evening, but his as well.</span> <span id="s3684">My mother paid the -- the -- the -- the refugee committee paid for my private school and my mother insisted on giving them 15 dollars a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s3685">Q: That’s a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s3686">A: I still have the -- 15 shillings, 15 shillings.</span></p> <p><span id="s3687">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3688">A: I still have the roster of -- of her payments, which is really very touching.</span> <span id="s3689">She absolutely wanted to do everything that was possible to be part of the -- of the solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s3690">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3691">A: And -- except here.</span> <span id="s3692">Here is where we -- here is where we differ.</span> <span id="s3693">One of the other miss -- miss -- Mrs. Biddle of the refugee committee, when I had finished high school, called me in and said you know, your mother is working, your father is so ill -- I had applied for college and got into c -- University of London.</span> <span id="s3694">And she said, you know you can’t go.</span> <span id="s3695">You know that, don’t you?</span> <span id="s3696">You have to go to work.</span> <span id="s3697">And I went home and said to my mother, she doesn’t -- she thinks I’m not going to go to college.</span> <span id="s3698">She thinks I’m going to work.</span> <span id="s3699">My mother said, oh, it’s just ridiculous.</span> <span id="s3700">Ridiculous.</span></p> <p><span id="s3701">Q: Ridiculous, you go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s3702">A: Thinking about -- what’s she talking about?</span> <span id="s3703">Of course you’re going to college.</span> <span id="s3704">The mindset, the Jewish mindset.</span></p> <p><span id="s3705">Q: So is this the end of the war?</span> <span id="s3706">A: This is towards the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3707">Q: Towards the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3708">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3709">’45 -- I went to college in --</span></p> <p><span id="s3710">Q:

a week bef --</span></p> <p><span id="s3715">A: The -- what -- what was the last -- I don’t know what is the last day of the last week.</span> <span id="s3716">Literally, the week before the end of the European war.</span> <span id="s3717">I mean, the Japanese war went on for some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3718">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s3719">But I think it’s May fifth or something, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s3720">A: ’45, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3721">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3722">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3723">Q: So he dies before it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3724">A: He dies the week before.</span></p> <p><span id="s3725">Q: And going back to what’s constant in this story, is you’re trying -- you would tr -- you started walking, trying to cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s3726">A: I did have a paroxysm of crying when I first heard, and then I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3727">Q: You couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3728">A: Couldn’t do it any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s3729">Q: But there must have been some relief as well, because it was so difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s3730">A: Well, the relief takes one of the evil forms.</span> <span id="s3731">I dream of hearing my father’s tap tap of his stick and I’m appalled.</span> <span id="s3732">And wake up feeling monstrous.</span></p> <p><span id="s3733">Q: There’s no end, is there?</span> <span id="s3734">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3735">A: After my father died, my mother had a brief breakdown of her own, but it took the form of buying a pink dress, and almost acquiescing in having an affair with his doctor, at least going around the block with him, and being invited to coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s3736">Q: Oh, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s3737">A: But she -- she couldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s3738">Q: She didn’t -- she couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3739">A: -- she couldn’t -- she couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s3740">But she did buy the pink dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s3741">Q: That’s great.</span></p> <p><span id="s3742">A: She told me, I bought a pink dress.</span> <span id="s3743">I said, you mean a dull pink.</span> <span id="s3744">She said, a pink dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s3745">Q: Pink dre --</span></p> <p><span id="s3746">A: I mean, she wore it twice and then -- and then abandoned it, but -- you see, when I tell my students, assume that when something happens you will not react the way you think, it’s only another example.</span></p> <p><span id="s3747">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3748">A pink dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s3749">A: With -- with white dots.</span></p> <p><span id="s3750">Q: With white dots.</span> <span id="s3751">That’s quite amazing.</span> <span id="s3752">Now, your mother -- you -- am I wrong?</span> <span id="s3753">Was Paul in England also?</span> <span id="s3754">Uncle Paul?</span></p> <p><span id="s3755">A: Paul -- Uncle Paul came to England with his wife Edith.</span></p> <p><span id="s3756">Q: Uh-huh, the one who was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3757">A: A very beloved, a very, very passionate young -- young love.</span> <span id="s3758">They were in the midlands, he was working as a farmer.</span> <span id="s3759">He was over 60 and he was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3760">Q: That he was [indecipherable] yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3761">A: -- a German speaking enemy alien.</span> <span id="s3762">He finds himself in -- on the Isle of Man with Edith still somewhere and speaking not a word of English, in the midlands, living on a farm where she knows nobody and there’s nobody -- now this is that moment when the -- when somebody comes to the camp and says, who would like to go to the Dominican Republic, and everybody says, in the what?</span> <span id="s3763">Who’s heard the Dominican Republic?</span></p> <p><span id="s3764">Q: [indecipherable] right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3765">A: And Paul says, will I be reunited with my wife and they say sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3766">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3767">A: That’s how --</span></p> <p><span id="s3768">Q: And that’s how he got s --</span></p> <p><span id="s3769">A: -- Paul gets to the Dominican Republic.</span> <span id="s3770">When he -- he got there -- domin -- Dominican Republic was -- was the attempt to set up -- make up a settlement of -- of t -- European farmers, taught by American experts on goodness knows what, certainly not tropical farming.</span> <span id="s3771">And I c -- I c -- this is too long a story, though it’s awfully interesting.</span> <span id="s3772">You should -- you should have somebody talk to you about [indecipherable] really --</span></p> <p><span id="s3773">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3774">A: -- it’s really -- but that’s a whole -- that’s its own story.</span> <span id="s3775">Edith died of -- I -- in the store -- in the -- in the -- see, this is what you can do with a novel.</span> <span id="s3776">I -- I -- I did not want to put Paul through what actually happened, so what -- I made her die in childbirth, which is not what happened.</span> <span id="s3777">She was pregnant, but died actually of blood poisoning.</span></p> <p><span id="s3778">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3779">A: After having touched a -- a -- a spot on her face, and I think blood poisoning is a s -- is a si -- a s -- you know, grows as rapidly as the pla -- as tropical plants.</span> <span id="s3780">By the time they got her to Puerta Plata to the hospital, she was already dying or dead.</span> <span id="s3781">And as I say, I think they hurried up -- m-my theory is, my theory, my belief, my fantasy, my knowledge is that they got Paul his parents.</span> <span id="s3782">That -- that -- that th-they got out --</span></p> <p><span id="s3783">Q: Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s3784">A: -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3785">Q: -- because [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3786">A: He was going to go crazy, I think with his grief and -- and -- and when my unc -- Paul found that he could not physically do the land work.</span> <span id="s3787">So they set up in a shop for him, called Productus [indecipherable] where the -- where the cheese and sausages and whatever were sold in the nearby middle -- mid-mid -- little town called Santiago de los Caballeros.</span> <span id="s3788">And my -- when my grandfather became ill, Paul called my mother who was -- she and I were living in London, I was going to University of London, to please come and help.</span> <span id="s3789">Help in the shop, help with my grandfather.</span> <span id="s3790">And my -- and we agreed that I would finish -- get my degree and then join my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3791">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3792">A: All this time we were waiting for the American quota.</span> <span id="s3793">I mean, it took us from August ’38 til May ’51 for the quota to come through.</span> <span id="s3794">But one of my -- one of my thoughts these days is, if -- this was ’48, if it had been ’78, I would have said to my mother, I really like it in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s3795">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3796">A: I’ll come visit.</span> <span id="s3797">Never oc -- what interests me is it never entered my mind --</span></p> <p><span id="s3798">Q: That you wouldn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3799">A: -- that I could say that to her.</span> <span id="s3800">It isn’t that I fought valiantly to -- to do what I had promised, it never occurred to me --</span></p> <p><span id="s3801">Q: To not go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3802">A: -- that -- that I had that choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s3803">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3804">A: And I think that really is a -- a -- a difference of the decades, don’t you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s3805">Q: Probably, yes</span></p> <p><span id="s3806">A: That a -- a g -- a -- a young woman of 21 -- of 20 --</span></p> <p><span id="s3807">Q: Would stay in England, why would --</span></p> <p><span id="s3808">A: -- would -- would stay in England if she chose to stay in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s3809">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3810">So you finished your degree --</span></p> <p><span id="s3811">A: So I finished my degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s3812">Q: And f -- wa -- followed and went to Dominican Republic.</span></p> <p><span id="s3813">A: Went to the Dominican Republic via Trinidad by -- by boat to Trinidad.</span> <span id="s3814">There were only three flights a week from Trinidad to the Dominican Republic.</span> <span id="s3815">Just to give a sense of it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3816">Q: Yeah, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3817">A: -- of the changing of -- I went to stay with my uncle -- with -- with -- with the -- with -- with the f-family in S-Santiago.</span> <span id="s3818">It was interesting that they would not let me help in -- in the shop.</span> <span id="s3819">It was still assumed that I was made for better things.</span> <span id="s3820">It’s -- it’s funny.</span> <span id="s3821">My mother worked there, my grandfather worked there, my grandmother --</span></p> <p><span id="s3822">Q: Everybody worked --</span></p> <p><span id="s3823">A: -- everybody.</span> <span id="s3824">It never occurred to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3825">Q: That you should --</span></p> <p><span id="s3826">A: Another things that doesn’t occur to people, right?</span> <span id="s3827">Didn’t occur to them I was going to be a shop girl.</span> <span id="s3828">I was going to go to sh -- to [indecipherable], live there and teach English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3829">Q: But not work in the shops.</span></p> <p><span id="s3830">A: Not work.</span> <span id="s3831">Didn’t occur to me, didn’t occur to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3832">Q: I -- I have a stupid question to ask you.</span> <span id="s3833">Did your mother ever ask you about the sausage?</span></p> <p><span id="s3834">A: Well, I started wri -- I mean, she read it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3835">Q: And you wrote -- she read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3836">A: -- in the book, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3837">Q: And did she say oh, this is what --</span></p> <p><span id="s3838">A: She was, of course, fascinated by the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s3839">Q: Yeah, I bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s3840">A: Which is dedicated to her.</span> <span id="s3841">No, she didn’t -- I-I mean, I don’t think the sausage meant to her what it meant to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3842">Q: Meant to you, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3843">A: She didn’t think, oh here if I give them a sausage.</span> <span id="s3844">That was my experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s3845">Q: Yeah, it didn’t became an icon.</span></p> <p><span id="s3846">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3847">For her not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s3848">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3849">We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3850">End of Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3851">Beginning Tape Ten</span></p> <p><span id="s3852">Q: I think what we’ll do is we’ll close off this part of the interview and I will come to New York and interview you on your life after the war.</span> <span id="s3853">But I do know that you went from the Dominican Republic with your mother to the United States in 1951.</span> <span id="s3854">But pre --</span></p> <p><span id="s3855">A: Well, let me go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s3856">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3857">A: My -- my Uncle Paul -- my father had died in England in ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s3858">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3859">A: My uncle’s wife Edith died in the Dominican Republic at age 21.</span> <span id="s3860">My f -- grandfather died in the Dominican re -- is buried in the Dominican Republic, in 40-something.</span> <span id="s3861">My father had put our name down on the American quota in ma -- in August ’38, and our quota came through in ’51.</span> <span id="s3862">But it ca -- it came -- th-the quota was -- was given out depending on land of birth.</span> <span id="s3863">So my grandmother went -- came to ing -- to New York first.</span> <span id="s3864">My Uncle Paul -- she was Hungarian quota.</span> <span id="s3865">My Uncle Paul was on the -- on the Viennese quota, came next, and my mother and I came next.</span> <span id="s3866">So the remnant of the family, whoever was leftover and hadn’t died, all came to New York by 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s3867">Q: And were you on the Viennese quota as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s3868">A: I was on -- my mother and I were on the -- both on the Viennese quota, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3869">Q: Oh this -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3870">A: But it also depended on when you had put your name on this -- on this list.</span></p> <p><span id="s3871">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3872">A: Or goodness knows what else it depended on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3873">Q: But life in New York was not so easy.</span> <span id="s3874">You didn’t -- you -- you all had to work in various places for a long time --</span></p> <p><span id="s3875">A: Oh yes, yes</span></p> <p><span id="s3876">Q: -- before you could do --</span></p> <p><span id="s3877">A: Oh yes, and -- and I thought, because I had this degree in -- in th -- in English literature I was going to get some wonderful job.</span></p> <p><span id="s3878">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3879">A: But what I ended up was filing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3880">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3881">A: In Queens, in a shoe factory.</span> <span id="s3882">Badly.</span></p> <p><span id="s3883">Q: Badly.</span> <span id="s3884">Cause that’s not your thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3885">A: No, I’m not good on -- on -- on filing details.</span></p> <p><span id="s3886">Q: But you -- you’re s -- very strong desire as a very young child of nine or 10 years old to become a writer, became true.</span></p> <p><span id="s3887">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s3888">And I had been writing by the -- I mean, in a way I been writing since 1938 --</span></p> <p><span id="s3889">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3890">A: -- in sa -- no, in ’39 I was already writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3891">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3892">A: And in -- in -- when I came to the -- to New York, I -- I discovered, because somebody asked me a question, somebody asked m -- I kept thinking I’ve got nothing to write about.</span> <span id="s3893">Finished.</span> <span id="s3894">I’ve shot my wad.</span> <span id="s3895">I have not been in love, I’ve not died, what di -- what -- what -- what am I supposed to write about?</span> <span id="s3896">And then I was -- I went to the -- I went to a -- the new school fo-for social research and took a course in creative writing.</span> <span id="s3897">And in one of those sessions, or rather in a party afterwards, somebody said, so how did you come to the United States?</span> <span id="s3898">And I had been thinking that everybody knew all those stories.</span> <span id="s3899">You saw them on the newsreels.</span> <span id="s3900">I knew them, everybody I knew knew them.</span> <span id="s3901">That was nothing to write about, but being asked that question, how did you get here, I began to tell my stories.</span> <span id="s3902">And the room was silent.</span> <span id="s3903">And I had the experience, which I’ve had often since, having been a teacher of me talking, other people listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s3904">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3905">A: Delicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s3906">Q: It’s delicious, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3907">A: So I realized I actually did have a theme and I began to write the stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s3908">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3909">A: In -- and when I first came in ’51, they didn't get published until -- ’62 they began to be published.</span></p> <p><span id="s3910">Q: But they finally did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3911">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3912">They were published in “The New Yorker” between ’62 and ’64 and then -- but look what a -- what a -- what a long --</span></p> <p><span id="s3913">Q: It’s a long haul.</span></p> <p><span id="s3914">A: -- a long haul.</span></p> <p><span id="s3915">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3916">But some people never do, so it’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3917">A: No.</span> <span id="s3918">Well, I was going to write anyway, that would have --</span></p> <p><span id="s3919">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3920">A: -- that’s -- that’s all I’m really good at doing.</span> <span id="s3921">So [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3922">Q: Well, it’s been a pleasure to talk with you, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s3923">A: Thank you, Joan.</span> <span id="s3924">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3925">Q: And now what we’ll do is we’ll stop the camera and we’ll do some of the photographs.</span> <span id="s3926">And thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3927">A: Thank you for inviting me to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3928">Q: You’re more than welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s3929">A: These are my mother’s parents, my grandmother Rosa Stern -- Shtern and my grandfather Josey Shtern.</span> <span id="s3930">Do you need more than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3931">Q: And they survived?</span> <span id="s3932">A: And they we -- my Uncle Paul was able to bring them from Vienna to the Dominican Republic even after the war started, I think in -- in 1940, which was a remarkable thing to manage.</span></p> <p><span id="s3933">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3934">Okay.</span> <span id="s3935">Do you need me to [indecipherable] that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3936">Q2: Okay, and who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3937">A: This is my father’s mother, Gisele Groszmann, who died -- she -- well, she and her husband died before my mother was married -- my mother and father were married.</span> <span id="s3938">They lived in Pressbourg, and I know very little about them, except that my mother was once mistaken for her.</span> <span id="s3939">So maybe there was a little family resemble -- a non-family resemblance.</span> <span id="s3940">I think the greengrocer addressed my mother as Gisele Groszmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s3941">Q: And who’s the child here?</span> <span id="s3942">A: The child is Franzi, Franzi Stern.</span> <span id="s3943">She is my -- my mother -- th -- the -- my mother as a little girl, and I want you to know that my grandmother made all her dresses for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3944">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3945">A: And the other one is my mother at, I would say, she -- this is already in the United States, so it must be after fif -- after ’51.</span> <span id="s3946">I can’t do arithmetic fast enough to figure, but this is -- this is how I remember her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3947">Q2: And when was this picture taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s3948">A: This is my mother in her late 90’s.</span> <span id="s3949">She died in -- a-at -- three months before her 101st birthday.</span> <span id="s3950">She disliked this picture very much, but it was taken by a painter called Katherine Kadish, who -- who loved my mother and who thought she was very beautiful in her late old age.</span> <span id="s3951">I love that picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s3952">Q2: Okay, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s3953">A: My mother lived in her own apartment on the ground floor of the building in which I live on the 12th floor and she was able to stay at home until she was 97, and only spent the last four years in a nursing home, quite close -- some 16 blocks -- 13 blocks out from where I live.</span></p> <p><span id="s3954">Q: Great story.</span> <span id="s3955">This one?</span></p> <p><span id="s3956">Q2: What’s this photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s3957">A: This is my father, Ignatz Groszmann.</span> <span id="s3958">He was an accountant in a bank.</span> <span id="s3959">He had been an officer in the Austrian army, briefly, I think.</span> <span id="s3960">And my mother -- I -- my mother married him, firstly because he asked her, and secondly because he was not like all the -- the crude and joke-y salesmen who came to my grandfather’s store in Fischamend and wanted to marry her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3961">Q2: And who’s this little cherub?</span></p> <p><span id="s3962">A: This is little Lore, age about four or five, I imagine, in -- in Hammerling Park, which was the park very close to where we lived, which I went -- went to see when I went back to Vienna and where I remember the words, kina Juden, no Jews, during the Hitler period.</span></p> <p><span id="s3963">Q2: And on the left?</span></p> <p><span id="s3964">A: In the left, my father had -- always had August off from his bank job, and we would always spend a month in the Austrian Alps.</span> <span id="s3965">This is my father, mother and me biting my nails, because my parents had decided I needed some little other kid to play with and they got -- they found -- somewhere found this little boy who was Hungarian, didn’t speak a word of English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3966">Q2: And what’s this photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s3967">A: These are my dolls.</span> <span id="s3968">I’m not sure that I was that interested in ma -- as babies, but I did like to arrange them.</span> <span id="s3969">No, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s3970">Q2: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3971">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3972">Q2: What’s this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3973">A: This is the ti -- a little older Lore, doing her homework.</span></p> <p><span id="s3974">Q: How old do you think you are there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3975">A: I would have to guess six, seven?</span> <span id="s3976">I’m trying to think of my grandchildren, trying to guess how old I would be at that a -- at that -- with that look.</span></p> <p><span id="s3977">Q2: And this group shot here?</span></p> <p><span id="s3978">A: It’s -- it’s -- it seems to be posed for -- for some very s-stiff photograph -- I’m sorry I’m screwing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3979">Q2: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3980">Q: That’s all right.</span> <span id="s3981">No, no, no, it’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3982">A: Have you already d-d-di --this -- Q2: Who -- who is in the shot here?</span></p> <p><span id="s3983">Q: Who is in the shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3984">A: Oh, oh.</span> <span id="s3985">It’s my father on -- on the left, my grandmother in the middle, my Uncle Paul standing behind -- who was then a medical student.</span> <span id="s3986">Little Lore on the table and my mother, Franzi.</span> <span id="s3987">This is a formal shot made for perhaps my grandfather’s birthday or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3988">Q: And how old do you think you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s3989">A: Three, two?</span> <span id="s3990">Two or three.</span></p> <p><span id="s3991">Q2: And where was this document here?</span></p> <p><span id="s3992">A: This is the lifesaving document.</span> <span id="s3993">You will see it says, this document requires no visa.</span> <span id="s3994">And the attempt to get visas and -- and -- and permits and everything at the same time was a -- an almost impossible job.</span> <span id="s3995">So the -- the Kult-Kultusgemeinde in Vienna and the Bloomsbury House and the State Department in England cooked up this particular way of facilitating the -- the imi -- the emigration of children, but only children without parents.</span> <span id="s3996">And this is the document that got me onto the Kindertransport and from Vienna to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s3997">Q2: And what does this represent?</span></p> <p><span id="s3998">A: It is actually not the camp to which we -- in -- in which we were housed while they were find -- trying to find foster parents for us, but it is the closest thing that exists today, or rather this is the only picture that -- that -- that I could find of such a camp, such a worker’s camp, which were used for the children.</span> <span id="s3999">And this is the kind of view that I would have had -- that we would have had from the bus, from the top of the bus, after the crossing the channel and arriving, this is the view we would have had, with the ocean behind it and this little -- little s -- little town of little -- little houses in which we were housed while we were in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s4000">Q2: And what about this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s4001">A: The family Cohen, whom I -- my first foster parents, bought me a little coat and then they took me to the -- to the photographer to have a picture to send to my parents and I was 11 years old, or almost 11.</span> <span id="s4002">This would be 1930 -- ’39, early 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s4003">Q2: And who is this couple?</span></p> <p><span id="s4004">A: This is my -- this -- these are my first foster parents, L-Lena Cohen and the -- her husband, whose name I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s4005">I do remember that he was very dear and very quiet and didn’t ec -- expect anything of me except for me to sit next to him while we -- and look into the fire, whereas Auntie Lena insisted that I call her Auntie Lena and I could never get myself to do it.</span> <span id="s4006">This picture was given me by their youngest daughter Ruth, who was my friend and champion and with whom I am still in touch.</span> <span id="s4007">And who speaks very lovingly of -- of these two parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s4008">Q2: And this shot, Lore?</span></p> <p><span id="s4009">A: It’s a picture of my father, my mother and me, age about 14.</span> <span id="s4010">I think what -- what is most the -- moving and sad is the degree of my father’s illness and the deterioration.</span></p> <p><span id="s4011">Q2: And who are these?</span> <span id="s4012">A: These are the three children of the family of the munitions worker, whose name I can’t remember, but who took me in after the first family, the Gillams could no longer keep me.</span> <span id="s4013">I remember taking -- after I was told they could not take me, I remember borrowing a bicycle and -- and going to -- essentially going to interview their mother to see if -- if I would be taken in by them.</span></p> <p><span id="s4014">Q2: And who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s4015">A: This is Miss Wallace, one of the two ladies -- one of the two ladies with whom I lived in Guilford.</span> <span id="s4016">She -- I -- and her -- and her dog, her favorite dog, she was -- I -- what I can s -- tell you about it is that she bought one house to take care of -- of -- of a -- of pauperized gentlefolk and another house to house refugees like my parents.</span> <span id="s4017">She was a -- a -- a -- a marvelously good woman.</span> <span id="s4018">And I -- probably the -- probably a companion to the other, older woman called Miss Ellis.</span> <span id="s4019">And this was -- they took me in when I came to -- to Guilford, and I lived with them for some four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s4020">End of Tape Ten</span></p> <p><span id="s4021">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives
