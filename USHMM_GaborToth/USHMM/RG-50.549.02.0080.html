id="s20">My name is Joseph Elman, and I was born in 19 -- February 5, 1922, in the city of Pruzana.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Did you always use that name, or would you have been known by your Yiddish name during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: This is -- I always used this name.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: We’re going to jump ahead now to -- from the -- well, to the time of liberation.</span> <span id="s24">So please go ahead and tell me what you remember about being liberated in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: When I was liberated, it was in June, I don’t know exact the date, 1944.</span> <span id="s26">We f -- I remember that when the Russians arrived, they assigned most of the partisans to the army, because the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s27">And I and another group and one of the commandeers were assigned to liberate my town and the vicinity of Pruzana.</span> <span id="s28">So ra -- time when I -- when I came to Pruzana, the most assignments what we were given was to first of all, to s -- look and find most all the collaborators who collaborated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s29">This was one of our mission, and then we were sent surrounding towns around Pruzana.</span> <span id="s30">I recall one place, it was near -- not far -- 50 kilometers from Pruzana.</span> <span id="s31">We went in a little town, I think it was -- let me [indecipherable] the town.</span> <span id="s32">Think it was Bielsk, Bielsk.</span> <span id="s33">And I remember a farmer came over to me, and he was telling me there is -- this farmer was eding -- hiding out one of the Jewish -- a Jew -- a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s34">And the farmer told me, he says, I been trying to tell him that the war is over, come out from there.</span> <span id="s35">He was in the barn, in a hay barn they’re hiding.</span> <span id="s36">And he -- he’s heard -- he didn’t believe him because it was still going on, a lot of bombardments, the Russians, you know, the airplanes, they bombard at the retreating German army.</span> <span id="s37">So I remember I went out to him and I says, come out, I’m a Jew, and I spoke to him Yiddish.</span> <span id="s38">Finally he came out.</span> <span id="s39">Of course, he was all unshaved, dirty and oof -- this is -- this is occasion that I can never forget.</span> <span id="s40">Then, while being -- eventually, when I settled in Pruzana, I came to my house and the house, a lot of houses were destroyed during the war.</span> <span id="s41">My house was still existing there.</span> <span id="s42">And I came to my house and there was a family with a lot of children, awful lot of children.</span> <span id="s43">And she nice to be to me, nice to me -- she tried to be an -- a Gentile ca -- a Gentile [indecipherable] they tried to nice to me.</span> <span id="s44">And she tried to, you know, give me food and I saw they haven’t got much for themselves, they were -- I just asked her a place to stay and sleep because I was still working, I was still in my uniform, was still given a job to look for all those collaborators.</span> <span id="s45">And eventually the -- another historish -- historic movement -- mo-moment, I would say, after a -- a few weeks or a couple mo -- maybe -- maybe six weeks, showed up in sh -- in Pruzana a doctor, her name is Olla Goldfine, and she was a neighbor of mine.</span> <span id="s46">And before the war, you know, I was in y -- you know, listening to these -- to these history what is going on with the Germans, with the Nazis in Germany, and so what I’m [indecipherable] I was only 15 years old that time, I was surprised and she told me -- and she came with a nun, and she told me that she escaped on the second -- this was January the -- I -- I think it was the second transport, January the 28th, 1943, at night from the -- from the cattle car, and she -- sh -- wandered around all night til she reached -- in Pruzana we had nuns -- what is the name?</span> <span id="s47">A c -- a c -- you know, it was a house of nuns.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: A convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Convent, right.</span> <span id="s50">A convent.</span> <span id="s51">And she came there, she was very, very known in the city and respected.</span> <span id="s52">And sh -- one of -- one of the nuns asked them there, the Mother Superior if she can, you know, that -- to accept her there.</span> <span id="s53">But she was afraid and she wasn’t, I would say, it was a problem for her.</span> <span id="s54">So eventually what happened, the nun gave her clothes, and put on a big cross on her, and she took off to a town in central Poland, and there she spend most of -- most of the time til, in 1944 when the Russian moved up to near -- near where she was staying, liberated her, and she came back to Pruzana with a nun.</span> <span id="s55">Of course, I tried, you know, I was able to do a lot of things that time when I was as-assigned to -- in Pruzana.</span> <span id="s56">I helped them very much, and eventually, when I left Pruzana, the nun and the doctor followed me and I brought them out to Poland.</span> <span id="s57">The war was still going on and we settled wa -- in Bialystok because Bialystok was already liberated, and Bialystok was assigned the temporary capital of Poland.</span> <span id="s58">Coming in Bialystok there were already lot of organizations, like different organization from different -- from different nationalities, from churches, some from -- and they helped, you know, that time to find housing and to settle down temporarily.</span> <span id="s59">So, it happened to be my brother, we call him Shmeril, my brother Louis was already in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s60">Now, he was liberated almost the same time that I did, but he was able to get into Bialystok in Poland and I was stuck in Pruzana.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Did he have any interest in going back to Pruzana, to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: I?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: No, your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: My brother?</span> <span id="s65">No, he didn’t want to go back there because he was -- he -- he wa -- a -- he was -- he was lucky that he got out from -- from that -- was -- yeah, this was -- our part was the Soviet, you know, Russia, Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s66">And in 1944, you couldn’t -- you couldn’t get out, you couldn’t -- you couldn’t emigrate, you couldn’t get out from -- from the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s67">And I had a big problem getting out, but thanks to the doctor and to the nun, they smuggled -- I remember they were -- they had papers to go into Poland.</span> <span id="s68">And I got smuggled in somehow, you know, it was a-assigned a -- a horse, you know, a horse and wagon, you can put in all your belongings there, and I was going up in the horse and wagon with straw and we crossed the border and that’s the way I arrived, I arrived to Bialystok.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: So they would be taking a great risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Oh -- then I found out that I was -- they charged me as a deserter.</span> <span id="s71">You know, I left -- actually I left -- I -- when I was working, assigned to pru -- my town, Pruzana, I was in uniform, Russian uniform, and I have a gun, and I have a -- you know, it’s just like duty, like a soldier.</span> <span id="s72">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s74">What -- what did that uniform look like, the Russian uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Well the Russian -- well, we had -- we had -- this is a shirt and pants, khaki.</span> <span id="s76">And the shirt was on the outside, and you had a -- you know, over here you had a belt crossing your shirt.</span> <span id="s77">And -- and you had a cap, you know.</span> <span id="s78">And your -- you had shoes [indecipherable] Russian shoes.</span> <span id="s79">So I heard afterwards that they were looking for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Let me go back to the actual moment of liberation.</span> <span id="s81">Wh-What exactly took place then?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Well, in the -- actually being in the group, being in partisans in my group in the woods, we already heard couple days ahead when -- before we were liberated, that the Russians already are -- you know, are moving forwards and -- and chasing, you know, and chasing the Germans.</span> <span id="s83">Already moving, chasing the Germans.</span> <span id="s84">But they kept us there for few more days and they told us to mine all the main roads and bridges, not to let the German army retreat so easy.</span> <span id="s85">And we did that, and I remember that the German army was in disarray.</span> <span id="s86">Some of them tried to get around the main roads, and they went the side roads, where we caught them near the w -- near our territory, our woods, we caught them that time by the hundreds, and eventually thousands.</span> <span id="s87">And we had to march and was order, we had to march and -- and deliver them to -- it was a camps ja -- in -- in -- in Rujani, about 50 kilometers from town, where we had to deliver them, you -- you know, we had the order that you have to deliver them, you cannot kill them or take advantage of them.</span> <span id="s88">And that’s what I remember before, and after a few days apparen -- after a few days we are, like I mentioned before -- of course my brigade consisted about 800 -- 800 fighters, most of them were assigned on the front, sent to f -- to fight on the front.</span> <span id="s89">And I was privilege enough to be sent with two more Jewish partisans, and Russians, to establish order in the occupied territories.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: You mentioned the young Jewish boy hiding.</span> <span id="s91">Were there a lot of instances of Jews who were hiding in the dense forests, who would come to light?</span> <span id="s92">Were there other -- were there other stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Well, this is already -- this is -- already is a -- a farmer, you know, the farmer risk his life.</span> <span id="s94">And only -- I don’t know what happened to the rest of the family, but it was just one -- some -- it was Jan Vyat, maybe.</span> <span id="s95">He kept them -- for a year and a half, he kept them, and of course nowadays they call those people the Righteous Gentiles, and he is one of them.</span> <span id="s96">And the same thing I want to bring out about the doctor, Olla Goldfine.</span> <span id="s97">Now, the nurse -- the nun who saved her, I’m sure that she is recorded in -- in Washington museum as a Righteous.</span> <span id="s98">Her name, I have it marked down.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Do you remember what it was?</span> <span id="s100">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: I have a name.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s103">We’ll come back to it later, if you like, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: DellaRosa, but that’s not her real name, but then maybe she goes on DellaRosa, but her name is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s105">I have it marked down, because I cannot remember the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s107">We’ll come back to -- to it -- to it later.</span> <span id="s108">Please continue to -- to -- with your story, what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, like I mentioned, when I arrived in Bialystok, and -- with a nun, and with the doctor and I had a cow attached to them, I gave them a cow.</span> <span id="s110">And they came -- well, nothing else, you couldn’t take a house with you.</span> <span id="s111">Well, that time, you figure a cow, you’ll bring it on the other side to Poland, maybe you can ge -- you know, you can get a few dollars, you can -- you can benefit little bit, have extra money, whatever you need.</span> <span id="s112">Because you had to leave everything behind, you couldn’t take much -- much -- oh, much -- the furniture [indecipherable] house, you know, like a mansion I left my house, my house was there, right, and -- and when I came in Bialystok, I got united with my brother, older brother, and th -- it was -- people were coming in, I remem -- in Bialystok, some survivors f-from different kind of experiences.</span> <span id="s113">Some came, you know, some came in from hi-hidden by farmers, some were hidden in the woods.</span> <span id="s114">And it was a mishmash, it was, you know -- you figure at that time that you are liberated already, that time will be f-for the better.</span> <span id="s115">But actually this wasn’t the case.</span> <span id="s116">This wasn’t the case.</span> <span id="s117">That time families from ruta -- uprooted and destroyed, and everybody was looking for survivors, maybe sometimes you had a brother, sisters, parents.</span> <span id="s118">And a lot of organizations was established already Bialystok.</span> <span id="s119">That time they knew what was still going on.</span> <span id="s120">Warsaw, the capital of Poland wasn’t taken yet.</span> <span id="s121">But a lot of Jewish organizations, and a lot of Christian organizations were established in Warsaw -- in -- in Bialystok, and they gave a temporary help, housing, food and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: When you saw your brother Louis in Bialystok, how much time had elapsed since you had last seen him?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I want him -- I want him -- I -- I want to mention my brother Louis.</span> <span id="s124">We escaped together and when we were in a group together, Hassidic Jewish group, and when we were, you know, assigned in the later round, in the -- in the brigades, Russian brigades, he was assigned in a different place, in a different brigade.</span> <span id="s125">And I didn’t hear from him since, for a year and a half, since I was in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Who --</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: But -- but once in awhile, through contact with partisans, I found out that he’s there and he’s still alive.</span> <span id="s128">But no communication at all for yea -- for the -- since a year and a half, over year and a half in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Was that very difficult to lose touch with him?</span> <span id="s130">I-I wondered what your relationship was, and if you very much relied on him at the time when you made the decision to flee to the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Well, we actually -- it’s a difficult, but I didn’t think about it very much, because we were busy, day and night busy, when we were assigned, you know f -- taken in in the kiro brigade in the -- for the Marine corps unit.</span> <span id="s132">We were busy day and night with missions.</span> <span id="s133">And so you didn’t think so much about it, about him, but once in awhile you t -- you -- you was thinking about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: When did you come to terms with the fact that your family had been lost?</span> <span id="s135">Was that when you went back to Pruzana?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: This happened in Bialystok later on.</span> <span id="s137">See, I had been in bial -- bi -- when -- we been in Bialystok for quite a few months.</span> <span id="s138">We arrived, I think, in late 1944, I don’t know exactly the month.</span> <span id="s139">And eventually, when the Russian army pushed ahead, and liberated Auschwitz, people were coming in -- people from there were coming -- going east to this town, to the cities where they belong.</span> <span id="s140">And it happened one time in Bialystok, I met a girl, sh-she was young, maybe she was only 16 years old or something, and she survived the Auschwitz, and she came to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s141">And then she told me that the Bialystok -- that the Pruzana, the Jews were sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s142">And she mentioned, I think I saw your older sister there, but she wasn’t sure.</span> <span id="s143">So at least I know that my older sister wind up in the labor camp to go [indecipherable] the rest, my father and my mother and my sister, they went to the crematoriums, ovens.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s145">Well, your father had committed suicide --</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Well, it wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: -- just a little earlier, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yeah, not wa -- I -- no, I want to retract that, retract that.</span> <span id="s149">My father, my mother and my two sisters, and my grandfather and my aunt and my uncle and two kids, they went together the same -- the s -- the same time -- the s -- when it was, you know, the evacuation, they call it.</span> <span id="s150">Took four ti -- four days, four nights, they couldn’t -- they couldn’t transport all the 12,000 people from the ghetto in one night, so they -- they broke it down in four sections, first, second, third and fourth.</span> <span id="s151">See, my father was -- it happened s -- I think was in Oct-October -- October 1992, we were at that time still in the ghetto, I remember we were operating our group and it came an order the same that all the Jews for the ghetto h-had to get certain -- certain -- certain warning to get ready ce-certain place, this was, I think be -- by the -- by the market in the center of the city, and be ready for transportation the same way as the last time.</span> <span id="s152">That time, the Judenrat, all the Judenrat, the Judenrat, this is the -- the leadership of the ghetto decided to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s153">They thought, you know, it’s already the last minute.</span> <span id="s154">And what happened, I remember the doctor, she arranged the [indecipherable] from the Judenrat, and it wasn’t successful, and I think there was only one died.</span> <span id="s155">You know, she gave them pills and they -- they s -- they -- they lit the stove in order to get the s -- you know, the -- ta -- sa-saphistic, you know, to get -- get the --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Carbon monoxide?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Carbon monoxide.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: To mix carbon monoxide.</span> <span id="s160">This night one of the Judenrat and my father -- my father commi -- didn’t belong to the group.</span> <span id="s161">See, my father always said, I remember, Dad is not going to go and see his family destroyed.</span> <span id="s162">And he planned that, and he planned it with a way that he locked himself up, you could never get in, in one of the sections in our house, and he hanged himself.</span> <span id="s163">Eventually we found it.</span> <span id="s164">But we are fortunate we were able to get -- bury him.</span> <span id="s165">And, you know, with honor in -- in the back of our house in -- in the -- in the yard in back of our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: And it’s -- and with -- you’re able to give him a religious burial, which I gather was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Still -- yeah, yeah, and still -- religious burial and still we’re able to -- we’re able to have the -- they call it -- this happened eventu -- when we stayed in our -- this was we still stayed in our house, that’s why we were able to bury him in back of -- and still, you know, have -- have a minyan and give him services every day, three times a day.</span> <span id="s168">And what happened is later on -- this was, I think it’s around December 2000 or two.</span> <span id="s169">One of my uncles was -- he was, you know, was s -- they used to take you to work outside the ghetto, and he was, I would say, dogs.</span> <span id="s170">They charge dogs to find out how long it take, how long will it take one dog, two dogs, three dogs.</span> <span id="s171">And they ripped them up pieces.</span> <span id="s172">And then we moved in, we had to give up our house because already it’s -- the house was up -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Joseph Elman.</span> <span id="s174">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: So that time we moved in with -- with my aunt, and we were able yet for couple months afs -- in her house -- it’s already two widows, my mother and her s -- her sister, two widows, that conduct the services in her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: How did you -- how did all of you take your father’s death?</span> <span id="s177">Wh-What impact did it have on you and your brother, Louis?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Well, this was -- you know, it was rough.</span> <span id="s179">It was rough especially, you know, especially for the older family, especially for my mother, and -- because he knew, my father knew that we are involved in underground movement.</span> <span id="s180">He knew.</span> <span id="s181">But he was a pessimist.</span> <span id="s182">Little pe-pes -- I’m saying a pessimist is because I’ll never forget -- he was a educated man, but he -- on a piece of paper he described all the countries.</span> <span id="s183">He says, boys, you don’t have a single country, a single like independent or neutral country, which was that time Switzerland and on the other side is Sweden.</span> <span id="s184">You know, encircled here you are.</span> <span id="s185">You gotta go through all this, all this, Holland, and then France in order to -- in order -- in order to reach Austria, in order to reach, you know, this -- even if you’ll get out, you’ll be able to get out, he says it’s a lost cause, boys.</span> <span id="s186">That’s his opinion, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: And that also seemed to be the opinion of the Judenrat, who w-were c-considering suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Well, it -- it was -- the Judenrat, because they still believe this was already the last minute -- beca -- the Judenrat was at the responsible job, while -- while you -- the ghetto isn’t existing.</span> <span id="s189">You know, they had -- they -- they had a -- a responsible job, make sure, because the Germans and all the, you know, the branches, they dealt with them.</span> <span id="s190">If they needed a hundred people here, and a hun -- a hundred people there, it was -- they went to the Judenrat, in charge of the labor.</span> <span id="s191">Minister of Labor, Minister of [indecipherable], Minister of -- of -- of -- of -- of Health.</span> <span id="s192">You know, it was -- so they were responsible and they were responsible, I mean they did a good job til the last minute, even though they were against -- they were against, it has to be sec -- nobody knew about the o-other movement.</span> <span id="s193">My parents didn’t know.</span> <span id="s194">They knew that we gonna -- we think about it, but they didn’t know, the last minute when we went out, we had the bunker, we went out, we had ammunition and all that.</span> <span id="s195">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: And you didn’t tell them, to protect them, wha -- and to -- and to protect yo-your movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Oh, we couldn’t tel -- we -- we couldn’t tell them because they were against that.</span> <span id="s198">And you don’t blame them.</span> <span id="s199">Don’t forget you have to -- you know, there is -- there is a different, you know, with the Nazis, if they f -- they found one person guilty, or a group of guilty, the whole community is responsible for that.</span> <span id="s200">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s201">It’s not, you know, nowadays that you go, you know, children, the brothers and parents are not responsible for them.</span> <span id="s202">You see what is going on, you know where the -- where the -- where the -- those suicide bombers and -- and so far, they -- you know, they farm the k -- young kids, they are trained, they’re coming out, and they -- they blew themself up, they are desperate, you know?</span> <span id="s203">Int -- what you call it in -- they are in -- they get them -- they teach them.</span> <span id="s204">Anyway, so that was -- that was a problem.</span> <span id="s205">You know, we were very careful.</span> <span id="s206">We could do a lot of things.</span> <span id="s207">Don’t forget, you know, the Gestapo came out in the ghetto, one or two by themselves.</span> <span id="s208">We could have killed them easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s210">You were taking --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: But we didn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: -- enormous risks, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: We couldn’t do that because that’s the one thing, you know, they -- they kept a whole ghetto, a whole community responsible for one act of sabotage, or one act of killing or doing something against them.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s215">And when you and Louis fled to the forest, that was just after --</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: That’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: -- one day of lit -- what do they call it, liquidating the --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: One day, ye -- we tried the first day.</span> <span id="s219">We -- the first day, it started January 27, 1943.</span> <span id="s220">But we couldn’t do -- go through -- we -- I mean, we could have -- we had the group already, we had a bunker nearby, and could have went through there, but a mob of people followed us.</span> <span id="s221">You know, th -- people were sleeping on the street, people were all over and they noticed u -- they noticed us, and a mob -- it’s impossible, we would have been -- we would have been betrayed, and we -- and -- and discovered.</span> <span id="s222">So we decided, we retreated.</span> <span id="s223">And the second night -- we went through the second night, and even the second night, about -- I estimate from 25 and over, people who doesn’t belong to our group went through with us.</span> <span id="s224">Elderly, even elderly couples, but -- and some survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: When you were -- when you fled to the forest and were with the partisans, what was the age of most of the men?</span> <span id="s226">Were you all very young, like you and Louis?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Well, most of it -- of course, in our group, 18, there was the commandeer, took his wife.</span> <span id="s228">Mostly I would say, when -- young, you know, y-ye -- mostly younger, younger.</span> <span id="s229">And I would say some o -- some -- our young didn’t have their chance even to serve in the army because you had to be 21 years old.</span> <span id="s230">Mostly young.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: And mostly men.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Now there was a -- th-th -- the -- your leader took his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: And there was one other woman, who is she?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: The leader -- this is a brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s237">His brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s238">The -- he took his wife and a brother and a brother-in-law with his wife.</span> <span id="s239">See?</span> <span id="s240">So even though -- I mean, I could have taken my older sister, too, but I mean, it shows you, they were -- they’re road ready, and they were in the bunker already and they went through with us.</span> <span id="s241">They didn’t belong even in our group.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: But then after the war, you know, there was some -- there was some discussions [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s244">They didn’t like the idea, but listen, a time like that, everything goes, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s246">Did -- did the women survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: The women had a bigger chance -- see, the women had a bigger chance to survive because most of the women worked in the kitchens cooking for -- you know, for the whole brigade, and especially the top brass, they got special meals with special ca -- with special waitr -- with special what you call it, cook, yeah, most.</span> <span id="s250">So it turned out that they were saved, they were never s -- inside, never sent on any missions.</span> <span id="s251">Their job was mostly taking care the kitchen, taking care of the cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: And these forests were so -- so big --</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: -- and so dense that you were able to have fires, and smoke would not be seen, and to --</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Well, at --</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: -- sing songs, and have --</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: -- yeah, this -- it happened already -- this is in the later years, 1943, when we were taken in, incorporated in their brigades, I didn’t realize how strong, you know, how strong your brigade.</span> <span id="s258">We had that time already, planes at night used to come dow -- fly over at night and drop down all kind of ammunition and especially those bombs and those what you need, you know, the -- the toob -- you didn’t have to worry already about going and building those explosive bombs, they were already all ready and there was no problem.</span> <span id="s259">Before that, we used to have to go and look for shells, and make up, you know, make up those -- those traps and bombs for my -- for th-those mines, what you call it, to mine the road.</span> <span id="s260">So life that time, it was actually -- looks like we controlled through the night especially, you control the whole territories.</span> <span id="s261">And the forest were c -- were connected with the other forest, and was stretching from eastern Poland, way up to deep in Russia and deep in -- deep in Belarus and Ukraine.</span> <span id="s262">So there was -- it was established after the war, there were a quarter of a million partisan operating in the woods.</span> <span id="s263">So i-it came to a point that time that we had plenty of food, and of course the food consisted from three meals a day, mostly soup and meat.</span> <span id="s264">S-Soup and meat.</span> <span id="s265">We used to go on for those mission and get food.</span> <span id="s266">Those, you know, cows and pigs taken away not from the farmers, but taken away from the German warehouses where they take away for the farmers.</span> <span id="s267">Came an order already not to rob the farmers any more.</span> <span id="s268">Go and take it away from the warehouses where the Germans rob the farmers and try and to ship it away to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: From the o -- from the enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: For the enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: So was plenty of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s274">What were your living conditions like?</span> <span id="s275">You -- you were a -- a year and a half --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s277">Well, the living conditions wa -- this is o -- the only problem we had, was rough, because the what we called the bunkers where we slept was crowded, and it was bunks on each side.</span> <span id="s278">You know, you had a a-aisle going in, then bunks on each side, and it was -- we didn’t have -- we did mostly straw, we didn’t have mattresses with straw.</span> <span id="s279">The problem was fleas and lice.</span> <span id="s280">You couldn’t help it, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s281">But you got so used to it, the only solution that we learned from experience, we used to make a fire, and the smoke -- and even wintertime, take over -- take over you underwear, you clothes, and just hold it over the top, and not on the fire, the smoke, they’ll drop out.</span> <span id="s282">But it helped a little.</span> <span id="s283">But those people who used to go on missions outside of camps, they were better off.</span> <span id="s284">I used to go a lot of missions.</span> <span id="s285">The reason is, we used to reach at night the farmers, and there, sometimes near, getting certain cl-clothes from the farmer, new.</span> <span id="s286">Drop out the old one and get a new one.</span> <span id="s287">So once you [indecipherable] for awhile, then you liced up, you know, again with fleas, with lice.</span> <span id="s288">This is impossible.</span> <span id="s289">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s290">But later on I think they built, it was, they call it steam.</span> <span id="s291">They -- they build a steam room, so you could go in -- you know, there’s no water we had, but you know, you couldn’t take a bath, you couldn’t take a shower, so they build a steam room, and it was enclosed.</span> <span id="s292">So used to go in once in awhile in the steam room, and that helped you, you know, clean it up, and it helped, you had clean clothes, it helped you f --</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: -- it helped you a lot.</span> <span id="s295">But this was there, it was a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Could you swim in the summertime, you were -- it was one summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Well, w -- first when you went on missions, you were able -- sometimes you go all night during the night, reach a little river on the way, a little -- those s -- where is [indecipherable] the chance, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s298">Even -- even -- even near a -- a water when you had tho -- where you get your water.</span> <span id="s299">So you were able to wash yourself up.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: That was the least of your problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: No, this wasn’t -- no this wasn’t a big problem.</span> <span id="s302">As a matter of fact, I gained some weight there, even though walking nights, ma -- ma -- a hundred miles or more.</span> <span id="s303">The food, because three meals a day and you eat a lot of meat and fat meat you know, they didn’t bother, you know, cut up chunks, and soup.</span> <span id="s304">Mostly the soup is potatoes.</span> <span id="s305">This was most of the time, three times a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: So it’s plenty, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Did you feel that you had widespread support from all the farmers in the surrounding areas?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: We had some support from the farmers, and some -- and some not.</span> <span id="s310">You see, when -- when the war started, when the -- you know, Russian, the Russian-German war, a big army, Russian army in the first days surrendered to the Germans.</span> <span id="s311">It was General Vlasov -- you’ve her -- you heard of, and there’s another c-co -- another general.</span> <span id="s312">See, I don’t remember now.</span> <span id="s313">And what happened, the Germans used them.</span> <span id="s314">They didn’t send them on the front to fight, they used them in the rear, and they established posts all over around the woods, even all over the territories.</span> <span id="s315">And of course, Germans in charge, and they -- they used to do most of the dirty work.</span> <span id="s316">They used to -- but as a rule, the farmers got caught in between.</span> <span id="s317">I-I -- I feel sorry for, they caught in between.</span> <span id="s318">You know, the ch -- the -- the partisan came in and they took certain from them -- from -- a loaf bread, whatever.</span> <span id="s319">They were [indecipherable] in the beginnings.</span> <span id="s320">And then the Germans retaliated because they supported the partisans.</span> <span id="s321">Both side.</span> <span id="s322">Poor farmers.</span> <span id="s323">I feel sorry for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s325">Let’s go back to Bialystok and your linking up with Sam and by then he was married, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: You linked up with your brother Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Oh well, I want to say but -- yeah, in Bialystok, you know, like I mentioned before, there was already a lot of organizations established.</span> <span id="s329">Joint Distribution Committee, HIAS, and -- and some -- it was [indecipherable] in Israel, some from the Haganah.</span> <span id="s330">And they tried, you know, to -- the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s331">They figure the war will end, they tried to organized most of those to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s332">And I mentioned that I met -- I, you know, she -- the girl from there, she told me that she was in -- in sht -- in -- in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s333">Now another thing I want to mention, first days when we -- I was in Bialystok, oh, I met there -- you know there was some survivors like from different, all kind different way, hiding in the woods, hiding in -- by farmers, hiding in bunkers.</span> <span id="s334">And some came from the wa -- survivors from Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s335">Later on came from Warsaw ghetto, I don’t think Warsaw was taken yet, but they were s -- they came to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s336">I met there in Bialystok, you know is very eas-eas -- in the museum, you know, he’s a hero.</span> <span id="s337">Itzhak Perlman and I told him -- he said, Jossel, you are the man [indecipherable] Palestine.</span> <span id="s338">You know, he went to pales -- yeah.</span> <span id="s339">And see, and I says, well, I says, maybe, but this is my only family, what’s left in Syracuse, and I want to -- they send me papers, I like to go to United State first.</span> <span id="s340">And then, so I -- he didn’t have kind -- he didn’t have any relatives, he didn’t have any relatives.</span> <span id="s341">I remember just like that.</span> <span id="s342">But I have a big family here.</span> <span id="s343">He says, you don’t belong there, you belong to go to Palestine, he says.</span> <span id="s344">Itz -- Itzhak Perlman.</span> <span id="s345">He a Perlman or Perlmud?</span> <span id="s346">Per --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: I think Perlman, but I’m not sure, We’ll have to check.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, on -- on -- honestly, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: And of course that was the -- there was a very powerful political push to have the Jews go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so what happened when it was, but it -- the war was still going on, it wasn’t finished yet.</span> <span id="s351">So then they found out about me and from the -- what they call that?</span> <span id="s352">Organization there in Israel.</span> <span id="s353">And they say, oh, you’re one of the partisans, you have your -- did you ke -- did you keep a diary?</span> <span id="s354">I said, di -- what a diary?</span> <span id="s355">Oh, you gotta keep a -- oh, you go ahead and think and study certain things for Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s356">It was [indecipherable] Yad Vashem, but this was for YIVO.</span> <span id="s357">YIVO stands for Jewish Research Organization, e -- I think YIVO.</span> <span id="s358">And then, you know, I try -- I try to thinking and they interviewed me, and I told them a lot of things about the int -- what did you take part?</span> <span id="s359">Especially about you, what day do you remember did you take part?</span> <span id="s360">Do you kill any Germans?</span> <span id="s361">What happened in this day and this day and this day?</span> <span id="s362">So I told him whatever I, you know, I remember, and eventually I know it was -- the write-up is in Israel, and you know, you heard [indecipherable] about [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Something, yeah, the same thing, my story.</span> <span id="s365">What I tell a little bit about here.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Then wha-wha -- when did you move from Bialystok --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, I’m in Bialystok with my brother, and eventually we stayed in Bialystok -- it’s probably we arrived quite a few -- maybe five, six months we stayed in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s368">And eventually there was a family, a whole family was -- survived and the farmers saved them.</span> <span id="s369">And -- and one of -- there was a father and a mother and three daughters and a bo -- and a son, four children.</span> <span id="s370">And eventually my brother ca -- you know, met one and he married one of the ra -- Rachel -- what was their last name?</span> <span id="s371">I forget it.</span> <span id="s372">My brother passed away, by the way in 19 -- 1998, and she -- the my sister-in-law, she’s alive, she’s in Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: So, he get married and then it was already I, my brother and Rachel, and the doctor, and the -- and the nun, and the girl what I met.</span> <span id="s375">I t -- I told her -- she wants to go to Pruzana.</span> <span id="s376">I says, I’m just coming back from there.</span> <span id="s377">You stay here.</span> <span id="s378">I says, I can tell you who survived, there’s no one there.</span> <span id="s379">She was looking for family, see?</span> <span id="s380">And so what happened, this girl -- so we -- from Bialy -- we stayed in Bialystok for awhile, and then when -- you know, til Warsaw, the capital, was taken.</span> <span id="s381">And then Lódz was taken, big city of Lódz.</span> <span id="s382">We came to Lódz with a nun, and with a sister, and I and my brother and my sister-in-law and the girl.</span> <span id="s383">In Lódz we stayed for a little while, of course, til the war ended.</span> <span id="s384">In Lódz -- now I -- I want to mention, I forgot to mention, when I was liberated, being with my brother in Bialystok, we send a letter in 1944, this was about in June.</span> <span id="s385">We send a letter to my -- I knew I have an uncle in Syracuse, because he used to send letters home, sometime you know, in the letter put in a 50 dollar bill, 20 dollar bill.</span> <span id="s386">So I knew there was Uncle Elman of Syracuse, that’s all.</span> <span id="s387">No address, nothing.</span> <span id="s388">So I wrote a letter, after the liberation, it took til May before the war ended, ’45, to get the letter from Bialystok.</span> <span id="s389">And that’s that, he got the letter, and we were moving already [indecipherable] Lódz.</span> <span id="s390">And then he writes that -- in Lódz we got a [indecipherable] of letters, that you boys, you’re moving.</span> <span id="s391">I cannot send you papers til you settle down in one place.</span> <span id="s392">Settle down in one place and don’t move around from one place to another one, because I got to have the address, I got to have the city and so forth and so forth, to make out the papers.</span> <span id="s393">So we settled down, we stayed already in Bialystok for a l -- for -- in Bialystok for a little while.</span> <span id="s394">And this same thing.</span> <span id="s395">We had -- it came in Bialystok, you know, there was so many homes, Jewish homes, we got settled.</span> <span id="s396">The doctor, and -- and the nun [indecipherable] gave her apartment, we have an apartment and we get [indecipherable] that time was rationing, you know, we got food from the UNRRA or from -- we were already Displaced Persons, DP, no par -- you know what I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: -- survivors.</span> <span id="s399">No matter wh-what, you can -- you can re-return to -- you are from Poland, or you are from -- from France, from Greek, from Hungary, you name it.</span> <span id="s400">No passport.</span> <span id="s401">We registered on the Polish quota, so we had a little problem with the Polish quota.</span> <span id="s402">So now, from being in Bialystok, eventually we got in contact with some organizations there, and they were pushing people to Palestine.</span> <span id="s403">Some wants to go especially to Greece and Italy.</span> <span id="s404">I don’t know why, because not to the American zone, but before the American zone they tried to -- Italy and Greece.</span> <span id="s405">Looks like fr -- the kw -- from there there was some connection to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s406">So, eventually we got connected with a group.</span> <span id="s407">I don’t know, you know, through the organization, and they ch -- and 50 refugees that time, we were living Lódz.</span> <span id="s408">From Lódz we went to Austria, Vienna with a tr -- with a train.</span> <span id="s409">One group, somebody had papers, you know, follows [indecipherable] this is a group of Greeks, or whatever, Greek Jews going -- so went to -- we went to -- first was in -- in -- just mentioned -- Austria.</span> <span id="s410">And then from Austria we went to Bratislava.</span> <span id="s411">In Bratislava -- this is Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s412">Then we stopped in -- in -- in Bratislava, we stopped, you know, we were DPs with a group in some kind of hostel, or it’s hotel.</span> <span id="s413">And the first time -- I never, never been in ins -- and a -- on a inside swimming pool.</span> <span id="s414">They had a inside swimming pool there.</span> <span id="s415">And we were slipping on the floor, of course, in the hostel there.</span> <span id="s416">And there ha -- misfortune happened to me.</span> <span id="s417">You know, you fell asleep, they took so -- you know, somebody, while you ab -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side

October the 8th, 2004, in Washington, D.C..</span> <span id="s420">This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow up

id="s424">A: I was carried, you know -- I was carrying a pair of boo -- German boots, good boots.</span> <span id="s425">I didn’t wear them.</span> <span id="s426">I took them, you know, I -- I took them off and they took the boots aw -- they stole my boots, and a briefcase.</span> <span id="s427">I had some, you know, stamps, I was stamp collector all this times.</span> <span id="s428">So anyway, it’s a misfortune.</span> <span id="s429">Then from Bratislava we went to Graz, Austria, and there to the English zone first.</span> <span id="s430">We tried to avoid the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s431">We didn’t want to go into the Russian zone, so we went to the England zone, because from Poland first is the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s432">Berlin had the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s433">So we went -- in Graz, eventually there was a camp there, near Graz, Trofaiach.</span> <span id="s434">And we settle -- it was run by th -- by the British and it was u -- UNRRA sup -- supported by the united --</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Yeah, United Nations, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: -- United Relief Organization, by UNRRA.</span> <span id="s437">And we settled

we had -- of course, we had bunks already there.</span> <span id="s443">We had enough food, but on the walls, and on the ceiling, names from the Russian who got killed there.</span> <span id="s444">It was a camp, the German camp Russian prisoners, Russian soldier by the hundred.</span> <span id="s445">This one -- this one died this and this year.</span> <span id="s446">In case somebody -- this one and this one died this year.</span> <span id="s447">And we stayed in this camp, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: For -- for how long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Oh, probably -- maybe a month or six weeks.</span> <span id="s450">Now, in this camp, the British find out about the doctor, and she told them that she has a daughter -- she had a daughter in France, married daughter, her husband was a doctor.</span> <span id="s451">And eventually they got her a plane, he was sh -- left the camp, went to France.</span> <span id="s452">And that’s it, that’s the

was a b -- it’s not far from the American zone.</span> <span id="s499">But we had to -- I-I remember it now, it where the leader brought us in from Graz to the American zone and we reached Feldafing.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Now, in Feldafing there were already established camp -- DP camp for the survivors, and there was a lot of survivors from -- from my town, from Pruzana, who went through the Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s502">I think there was about 200, I heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s504">Now, Feldafing was a displaced person’s camp near Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s506">Feldafing near Munich.</span> <span id="s507">And there they, you know, they registered us, and we joined them there.</span> <span id="s508">And we stayed in Feldafing.</span> <span id="s509">Then from Feldafing, of course, we moved to Neu Freiman.</span> <span id="s510">This was -- Neu Freiman, that’s was -- near Munich.</span> <span id="s511">A real -- almost on the outskirt of Munich, because my brother -- I mean, th -- was born in -- in Feldafing, had a baby when we arrived Feldafing.</span> <span id="s512">We stayed in Feldafing maybe -- we st -- we stayed in Feldafing -- yeah, I think we stayed in Feldafing maybe five or six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: And your br -- and your brother and his wife -- am I understanding it?</span> <span id="s514">They had a -- they had a child while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: A child was born in th -- in the camp there, so with a child, this is a more little advanced camp, Neu Freiman.</span> <span id="s516">This is a camp, it was already little apartments.</span> <span id="s517">So we all stayed, you know, we got a little apart -- apartment.</span> <span id="s518">And for neu -- neu -- we stayed in Neu Freiman til we got in contact already, you know, I mentioned to you with my uncle and the cousins.</span> <span id="s519">And we were waiting, see -- part in Feldafing and part in Neu Freiman.</span> <span id="s520">The rest of the time we emigrated, I -- from Neu Freiman I went already.</span> <span id="s521">This was in 1947 in -- June seventh , I think, June seventh arrived in the United States.</span> <span id="s522">I came first.</span> <span id="s523">See, my brother came with a baby, he came a com -- a couple months later.</span> <span id="s524">So, direct from -- oh, y-you know, di -- we went to a port of Bremen in Germany, sailed the ship, it was a commercial ship, Marlin -- Marlin?</span> <span id="s525">Marin?</span> <span id="s526">Marlin.</span> <span id="s527">And we arrived, and it was -- yeah, July -- June -- I think it was June eighth, or June seventh, 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Oh, yeah, I did research on this, so June the seventh.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Oh, June the seventh.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Ellis Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Ellis Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: I’m not a little -- you know, it’s -- it’s experience.</span> <span id="s534">Coming -- while we were on the ship, we were given certain spending money, American money, we going over United State.</span> <span id="s535">And we were getting on the ship, you know, we’re getting food, oranges, we -- Poland ha -- was expensive, never had an -- oranges.</span> <span id="s536">And coming over the ship, there was a stand someplace there with oranges, and six for a dollar or something.</span> <span id="s537">Then I discover -- we came back, I was telling si -- oh, don’t -- you could have gotten -- you could have gotten six for a quarter, or something like that.</span> <span id="s538">Everybody was rushing with their dollars.</span> <span id="s539">We had -- I-I think they give you a dollar or something, a day spending money.</span> <span id="s540">So we spent the money on the oranges.</span> <span id="s541">Walking out, oh there is a stand with oranges, everybody was grabbing the oranges.</span> <span id="s542">So we came to Syracuse, right direct from -- from the ship.</span> <span id="s543">Now, ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Oh, you did, you -- so who met you --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: My cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: -- when you arrived in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: My cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Never -- you’d never met him before?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Ah, you know, did I tell you?</span> <span id="s552">Never -- no, I took a train, I came over, I took a train, I ca -- somehow with a train came to Syracuse, and he was waiting for me by the ship there.</span> <span id="s553">Eventually came back, I was asking to Syracuse, they told me go -- this train goes to Syracuse.</span> <span id="s554">So then I discovered -- eventually my brother came, and I had another uncle, and I never knew this actually.</span> <span id="s555">She -- his wife was a sister to my father.</span> <span id="s556">Cooper.</span> <span id="s557">Well, they worked together, and I didn’t know that -- I didn’t even know there was two more aunts in the city, but oh -- they already were -- see, my grandfather was married twice in those years.</span> <span id="s558">He had children from the first wife, and had the children from the second wife.</span> <span id="s559">I don’t know exactly -- he had eight children.</span> <span id="s560">So three or four from the last wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And that was -- your father was --</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: My father -- because the disparity was 20 or -- I don’t know, you know, I -- you know, my uncle, he lived, you know, he was 80 -- when I came over he was 80 -- 80 years old, and I was twen -- it’s a big disparity something.</span> <span id="s563">And we saw -- so, five children.</span> <span id="s564">So that time already, when my brother came, so they divided.</span> <span id="s565">One uncle took one -- sa -- Elman took my older brother, and I worked -- see, I-I didn’t even know he was a very successful biz -- a rich man, businessman.</span> <span id="s566">He had scrap yards, and he has manufacturing, in Watertown not far -- you heard about Watertown, New York.</span> <span id="s567">You heard about water --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Watertown, New York.</span> <span id="s570">And he was -- he had a place there, and a place in Syracuse.</span> <span id="s571">And so my older brother works for the pants factory there, and I work f -- and I was working for the uncle.</span> <span id="s572">But his son-in-law ran here, the uncle was in Watertown, his son-in-law was in Syracuse.</span> <span id="s573">And -- so right away they put me to work, you know, I went -- was -- oh, it was, first of all, yeah, I remember it was outside on the yard, you know, they call it a scrap yard outside a yard.</span> <span id="s574">And he had those -- those years he had those old -- big alligator shears cutting na -- big steel.</span> <span id="s575">So eventually we -- after awhile I [indecipherable] I didn’t complain.</span> <span id="s576">Eventually I had an accident there.</span> <span id="s577">Two men, a helper, had to put in, you know, cutting the steel, the beam, somehow [indecipherable] back and it broke my ankle.</span> <span id="s578">So I was that time in a cast for almost six months, six months.</span> <span id="s579">And of course my aunt was mad because she was ashamed because the son always said, why did they have to put him right away on the yard there?</span> <span id="s580">He could have put him inside [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s581">So she --</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Could you walk on your cast?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: I could -- well, I wal -- you know, those years they had a cast up here, and each time ca -- each time you had to change it, they have to cut a cast to put a new, so it wa -- was six months I couldn't.</span> <span id="s584">But I got compensation, you know, worked for compensation, so worked for -- so then, after this happened, so uncle took me to Watertown.</span> <span id="s585">And there he told me, I’ll -- I’ll -- you know, I was learning already even in -- even in Syracuse on the yard, with the shear trimmer inside, you know, trimming metal.</span> <span id="s586">This is -- this is -- they call that the -- not -- not iron, scrap iron and steel, but this is non-ferrous.</span> <span id="s587">Non-ferrous, that means, you know, all the other ki -- copper, aluminum, brass, stainless steel, all the -- all the --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Non-iron.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: -- non-iron metal.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: And that’s where I learned the business, they took me in Watertown.</span> <span id="s592">This happened in 1950, and I -- in 1947 I worked in Syracuse til sometimes -- ’47 when I came, ’48, and ’49.</span> <span id="s593">But maybe couple years.</span> <span id="s594">Eventually I went, you know, when I got -- my foot got better and all that, he took me to Watertown.</span> <span id="s595">It happened to be at that time in 1950, I was introduced to my wife, Edith Rogan.</span> <span id="s596">She’s -- comes from Brooklyn, a Brooklyn girl, and she had a cousin in Syracuse, a s -- a Holocaust -- he went -- he went through Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s597">Those years when I was -- arrived in Syracuse there was quite a few survivors, they’re most like -- from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s598">And he was engineer.</span> <span id="s599">And I got acquainted with him, and he says, you know, he’s gonna go see his cousin -- no, it’s an uncle that’s -- that’s a cousin, her parent.</span> <span id="s600">Why don’t I go?</span> <span id="s601">And we went.</span> <span id="s602">I -- I was already couple times in New York because I had relatives, you know, from my side.</span> <span id="s603">They were two sisters, my father’s sisters or several -- you know, lived in New York.</span> <span id="s604">And -- but I didn’t -- you know, I didn’t see them too often, I was mostly with, you know, the relatives in Syracuse.</span> <span id="s605">So eventually, you know, we got acquainted, and she was visiting here, and I visit there.</span> <span id="s606">She didn't -- sh-she didn’t li -- you know, a -- a New Yorker girl, for her even Syracuse is lizador -- little town.</span> <span id="s607">So that time -- and I was working -- working in Watertown, I took her over to Watertown.</span> <span id="s608">It was already -- I knew her maybe quite a few months, was a little bit serious, and I introduced you -- you know, to my uncle [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s609">They liked her.</span> <span id="s610">He says, [indecipherable] in Watertown, he’ll give her a job.</span> <span id="s611">She didn't want to [indecipherable] in Syracuse that, you know, made a big party for her, thought maybe -- she so -- eventually [indecipherable] Watertown.</span> <span id="s612">In the same time, while it goes on, I -- I met -- I wasn’t married yet, I met in Syracuse -- he was -- his father, a peddler’s son [indecipherable] he just came on the service in the Jewish Community Center in Syracuse.</span> <span id="s613">I got acquainted with him, he says, you know, you know the metal business -- you know, he was probably p-peddled with his father before.</span> <span id="s614">I know at that time, you know, the rags, they used to peddle with rags that time.</span> <span id="s615">Mattresses and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s616">And it was a place in Syracuse, those years when I came over, and there was a lot of little scr -- it was necessary to have a special permit to operate a little junkyard.</span> <span id="s617">We call it scrap yard, you call it junkyard.</span> <span id="s618">Lot of -- you know, there was quite a few there, elderly had it, and they was -- they retire, they want to sell it, lease it.</span> <span id="s619">So he said, there is a place over here, the Lifsin.</span> <span id="s620">He retired, he wants to, you know.</span> <span id="s621">He’s got -- he’s been here for so many years, 40 - 50.</span> <span id="s622">Let’s rent the place.</span> <span id="s623">So somehow -- by time working for my uncle.</span> <span id="s624">So, they were surprise, i-it -- you know, I want to give credit to my uncle, gratitu -- a smart man, smart man.</span> <span id="s625">A good man.</span> <span id="s626">So he says, you know, Joe, th -- and the wife [indecipherable] the children, they were [indecipherable] he just came over, he says, what the hell, he’s got a job.</span> <span id="s627">Everybody’s got -- working for Cooper, what is he looking for?</span> <span id="s628">What does he have?</span> <span id="s629">Meshuga, you know what?</span> <span id="s630">Meshuga, crazy.</span> <span id="s631">So I told him.</span> <span id="s632">So he says, you know, Joe, you’ll never be tru -- you’ll never be satisfied til you try it.</span> <span id="s633">If you try it, you know at least, and you fail, you’ll come back to me.</span> <span id="s634">See?</span> <span id="s635">And you --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: He was generous.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Genero -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: In his spirit.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Spirit?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Generous, I mean, you’ll never be satisfied because you’ll figure you -- oh, I could have gotten that.</span> <span id="s642">Try it, it’s not so easy, he started to -- then you’ll come -- at least you’ll come back to me.</span> <span id="s643">And so he ha -- I started [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s644">Why don’t you take a truck and go right -- peddle?</span> <span id="s645">I gave him a tr -- he said, you want to start it, take a truck and go out, peddle to the farmers, first learn how to peddle.</span> <span id="s646">So I did, and eventually --</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: And -- and peddle means tr-trade?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: No, peddle -- you know what a peddler means?</span> <span id="s649">Yeah, trade, if those -- those years of -- you know, those peddler used to stop in a farmer --</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: -- and see if he’s the little old --</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: -- old machine, a little -- a little so -- or something, or copper, little stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Yeah, we don’t use --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: And buy it -- to buy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: -- we -- we -- we just don’t use that word as much now, I think, but peddler, peddling, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Well, those years was peddler [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: -- a peddler.</span> <span id="s660">Okay.</span> <span id="s661">Well, I hooked up with this one, and we didn’t -- you know, we didn’t need too much money.</span> <span id="s662">Of course to start it, you need -- that guy had a little money, that guy.</span> <span id="s663">The wa -- he wa -- he was the only son, he had a little money.</span> <span id="s664">I had to put in a little money.</span> <span id="s665">This was a time when I was already -- when I got married, I already got married with my wife when I started up with him.</span> <span id="s666">I worked, peddler work.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: So where did you live then?</span> <span id="s670">And you’d be about 28 then, something like that?</span> <span id="s671">How old would you be?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Fi -- 50 -- it was -- this was the 1950 -- 1950 I was 28 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: I was 28 years old.</span> <span id="s675">So we -- there was some, you know, those years was peddlers, you know, with horse and wagons you never experience -- do you ever experien -- see horse and wagons, a lot of those.</span> <span id="s676">Jewish peddlers, oh, he had a horse, some had pushcarts.</span> <span id="s677">They push that, they pull -- they find little mattress, little rag here, rags, and little pa -- or with paper, too.</span> <span id="s678">And some with wagons, and it was near there.</span> <span id="s679">So we did, it was rough.</span> <span id="s680">It was rough.</span> <span id="s681">See, that time, my wife had a few dollars already.</span> <span id="s682">You needed at least, at least a few dollar, at least.</span> <span id="s683">I think we started up with 5,000 dollar, that year was a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: So we scraped out and we started, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: She was willing to bet on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: She was willing to bet on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Well, I don’t know, she’s willing, yeah, she’s willing.</span> <span id="s690">So what happened here, well then it broke out in 1951 the Korean war broke out, gave us a break.</span> <span id="s691">You know, the war, everything skyrocketed.</span> <span id="s692">And so, just get enough mattresses, get enough this, get enough ca -- metal.</span> <span id="s693">Pillows, get the feather pillow.</span> <span id="s694">I don’t know, they send them, you know?</span> <span id="s695">They were coming in from -- they were coming in from New York called the [indecipherable] people, oh don’t you -- save the pil -- we used to -- everything used to go mixed rags.</span> <span id="s696">Pillowcases, you na -- sweaters, wool sweaters.</span> <span id="s697">It was cold, probably and you needed to process that stuff.</span> <span id="s698">Oh, do -- save all the sweaters, save all the pure wool, save all the wiper, save all this.</span> <span id="s699">So it gave us a break, and then, you know, it -- it’s a lo -- it’s not finished yet.</span> <span id="s700">So after, in 19 -- we stayed 1950 - ’51.</span> <span id="s701">In -- I think in 1952, late ni -- we pr -- he sold -- th-the owner who owns that, we didn’t have a lease.</span> <span id="s702">He says, boys, I’m gonna give you the first preference to purchase the property, the building.</span> <span id="s703">And he had -- he had -- it was the building in the back, a driveway, and he had houses on both sides, you know, the s -- older houses.</span> <span id="s704">But it was, I think a few tenants here, few tenants there.</span> <span id="s705">I didn’t know anything about tenants, you know, income.</span> <span id="s706">Somebody bought it, and it’s an income, and gave us 30 days to move.</span> <span id="s707">It was a [indecipherable] according to the law, 30 days.</span> <span id="s708">It’s tough.</span> <span id="s709">It’s tough, it’s bad.</span> <span id="s710">Finally, well we -- we had to s -- ask the -- you know, ask the owner, give us a chance, let us sell out, whatever, clean it out, it’s not so easy.</span> <span id="s711">You know, we had already a machine, pressing machine, baling machine there.</span> <span id="s712">So resolved -- got resolved in 19 -- 1952.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s714">You wouldn’t have had the capital to buy it?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: No -- well, they say, you know, I did sometimes.</span> <span id="s716">I spoke to Uncle Elman in that time, but he figures, he said 52,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s717">We didn’t know -- you know, because i-income from the houses, somebody bought it, I don’t know, he ask you -- for us 52, we couldn’t afford it, we couldn’t [indecipherable] we couldn’t afford it, we lost that.</span> <span id="s718">So we lost that.</span> <span id="s719">Finally I took that time, I and my brother we got another place joint together, with my brother.</span> <span

id="s995">I don’t think -- I don’t think -- my wife, she knew, maybe I told.</span> <span id="s996">But I wasn’t talking too much about back experiences.</span> <span id="s997">When they grew -- when they grew up a little I mentioned it, you know, I mentioned it, in later years.</span> <span id="s998">I didn’t want to talk too much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: I didn’t want to real fra -- relive this again, every time you talk, it’s not so easy.</span> <span id="s1001">You try to forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Do you feel that your -- that you were changed because of those experiences?</span> <span id="s1003">Because you were a survivor?</span> <span id="s1004">Did it -- did it affect your life in a very deep way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Well, of course I changed.</span> <span id="s1006">Of course I changed, that’s why I saw, you know, I saw myself what happened, what happened to a community.</span> <span id="s1007">You think about -- about my uncle.</span> <span id="s1008">I had an uncle, had a su -- had -- had a f -- had a -- a -- a flour mill and a sawmill.</span> <span id="s1009">Those years -- I don’t know where he got this money, I heard he -- he won a lottery, something like that.</span> <span id="s1010">But this is supplying -- supplying the -- the whole city and vicinity and all the farmers, you know, farmers surrounding, we talk about thousands and thousands of farmers and what -- see what happened?</span> <span id="s1011">See -- see what happened?</span> <span id="s1012">I’m -- I -- a lot of people here in United States, you know, even among the Jewish people, and you tell them, says I -- you have to learn a lesson.</span> <span id="s1013">I mean, it’s too bad you gotta a -- a price with your -- and a lesson what you went through with your whole family and all that, you know, that be good.</span> <span id="s1014">Because money doesn’t buy nothing.</span> <span id="s1015">Even you’re rich, I saw rich people.</span> <span id="s1016">Now, when you tell them, rich people went.</span> <span id="s1017">Rich or poor, sick or healthy, no matter what.</span> <span id="s1018">Everybody went the same, the same way, lost everything.</span> <span id="s1019">So now, you know, I have the experience.</span> <span id="s1020">Now over here some people, some people some time, they -- to them, when it comes to certain things, donations or something, helping.</span> <span id="s1021">It’s nothing.</span> <span id="s1022">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1023">I mean, you live in a free country, you didn’t went through that.</span> <span id="s1024">You have, I mean -- you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: It’s different.</span> <span id="s1027">So, when you pay the price, it’s different, it’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1029">Now did you, with your family, did you observe religious holidays and go to the synagogue regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: You mean, before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: No, no, I meant, your American fa -- the American Elmans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Well, no -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: -- you and Edith and the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: -- I belong to a temple.</span> <span id="s1035">I’m not -- I’m -- I’m not religious at all.</span> <span id="s1036">I belong to a temple because you have to belong to a temple.</span> <span id="s1037">I mean, in this city, in Syracuse if you don’t belong to a temple, you had -- send children to school you gotta belong to the temple, you gots -- you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1038">Day school, Hebrew school, you have -- it’s different than the big city.</span> <span id="s1039">So you have to belong to the temple.</span> <span id="s1040">And I was -- I was not religious at all, even home.</span> <span id="s1041">We were not too religious.</span> <span id="s1042">My father was educated, was a yeshiva bocher, went to yeshiva, but -- but here you have to -- you have to belong with the temple.</span> <span id="s1043">You know, I belong -- I donate a lot of money to the Jewish Federation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: And th-the same federation, I’m active.</span> <span id="s1046">And to me money is nothing.</span> <span id="s1047">I can’t see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Cause life has taught you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Yeah, money --</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: -- a deeper lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: -- money -- it’s as long you have your he-health, health, health --</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: -- that’s what you cannot buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: But money, if you have, for crying out loud.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Did you have any adverse health effects from the rough times living as a partisan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Well I -- well, I -- I had -- I had trouble with my stomach since I came out.</span> <span id="s1058">And when I got married, it’s 1950, I went to -- in New York to Mount Sinai hospital.</span> <span id="s1059">And I always complained I had cr-cr -- you know, si -- no headache, but stomach pain, stomachs, I thought maybe I -- maybe I have -- I checked in Syracuse when I came over ’47, all those years and they didn’t find anything.</span> <span id="s1060">And when I got married, she insisted go and check.</span> <span id="s1061">I went to Mount Sinai hospital, went through all the x-ray, all the -- all the tests, and they says, we don’t find anything wrong, physically, just -- what he says, they call it something like -- not physically --</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Psychosomatic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Psychosomatic.</span> <span id="s1064">That’s what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1066">What about your brother Louis?</span> <span id="s1067">Was his health good when he came to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Yeah, he was all good, but the -- the same thing, he had a si -- see?</span> <span id="s1069">He never complained that -- he had a cerebral helmbridge -- cerebral [indecipherable], and suffered for a year.</span> <span id="s1070">All over she was -- he was -- she was with him in Florida, she was with him Rochester, all the hospitals.</span> <span id="s1071">He wasn’t si -- he had the same thing.</span> <span id="s1072">Stomach trouble.</span> <span id="s1073">He had ulcers, and bec -- eventually -- eventually they cut out -- he had half of his colon cut out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: It’s probably that’s all from -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1076">He -- [indecipherable] affe-affected him, yeah.</span> <span id="s1077">And has to watch his diet.</span> <span id="s1078">Finally decided, colon operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1080">You know, when he was -- when he was a very young man, you mentioned that he was thinking he wanted to come to the United States, really when I think he was in his late teens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: No, he was, let’s see.</span> <span id="s1082">In the 19 -- in the1939, he was 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: 1939 he was 20.</span> <span id="s1085">Before the war [indecipherable] decided, because -- that he wants to go to United States.</span> <span id="s1086">He says --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Why -- why do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Well, he didn’t want to go to Palestine bec -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1089">He was the type -- there was no future there, actually, you know, a young boy of 20, and he went to the Hebrew school, that gymnasium, and th -- we knew already in 1939, we heard, you know, what was going on with the Nazis, they were -- march of the -- of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1090">I think it was, you know, what’s happened to Austria, what happened to Czechoslovakia, in 1938 we heard that.</span> <span id="s1091">And that time, it would have gone if not bro -- maybe if the war broke out not in 1939, the Polish -- the second war, maybe ’40.</span> <span id="s1092">But he applied, the uncle would have brung him in, yeah, he brought in everybody.</span> <span id="s1093">See, my parents could have come here, too.</span> <span id="s1094">But what happened, he didn’t want to come alone.</span> <span id="s1095">He was married that time, and had a child.</span> <span id="s1096">He says, I’m not gonna leave my wife and my child.</span> <span id="s1097">If you can bring us all over, yes, but not -- but you had to -- all the kids who were brought over, they were singles, all the sisters, 18 years old, 16 years old, so forth.</span> <span id="s1098">Because first you come and then you settle down somehow, you bring your family.</span> <span id="s1099">That was the si -- that was the papers, sa -- made out like this.</span> <span id="s1100">You couldn’t bring the whole family out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1102">And it wasn’t easy to come.</span> <span id="s1103">I understand there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: -- an enormous amount of paperwork to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: -- now, let’s -- coming to United States, even for us, from 19 -- we came in -- in f -- i-in Germany, in Feldafing, Neu Freiman in 1945 in June, and we came.</span> <span id="s1107">Two years later, you see, we registered on the Polish quota.</span> <span id="s1108">And the Polish quota was overfilled, because a lot of -- most survivors mostly -- you know Poland had the popula -- three million people before the war.</span> <span id="s1109">And most of us survived.</span> <span id="s1110">Most of majorities from Poland, comparison any other country, and of -- from my city alone of 200 people, well don’t forget, from a population of 15,000.</span> <span id="s1111">So the Polish quota was -- it was impossible.</span> <span id="s1112">Was -- we could have -- wish we’d known, we could have registered [indecipherable] Germans you could have registered you’re from, or Lithuanians, little countries the quota was better.</span> <span id="s1113">But we -- when you got registered, you got -- put in your picture, you couldn’t change it.</span> <span id="s1114">So we have to wait there for two years.</span> <span id="s1115">Okay, I mean, we were in the DP camp, we have -- we have no complaints about food, shelter and medication.</span> <span id="s1116">It was under UNRRA in the American zone, the American government.</span> <span id="s1117">And the same thing -- those camps are, you know, I want to mention, there was a lot of camps, UNRRA camps, they were especially for Jews.</span> <span id="s1118">There were camps for Yugoslavs.</span> <span id="s1119">There was lot of camps for Poles.</span> <span id="s1120">Separate they were, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1121">They had their own sections there.</span> <span id="s1122">And they had their own, you know -- you know, their own UNRRA, the same thing, and -- and the -- those -- it was sometime those who didn’t have relatives -- you know the churches, if you had a church sponsor, was quicker to come in, you know what I mean, than to a relatives, because the churches, they didn’t have the big quota.</span> <span id="s1123">A few here, you know, the church sponsor, they took them right in.</span> <span id="s1124">But the church are responsible for them.</span> <span id="s1125">When they come in they gotta give them.</span> <span id="s1126">So we had a tough time for two years.</span> <span id="s1127">All the correspondent with the cousins, you know, I have so much I like to say, so much correspondent.</span> <span id="s1128">You know, it figures, they thought, they got money, and they send affidavit, if you got, you know, affidavit, 150,000 dollars, I’ll give you example.</span> <span id="s1129">Or a quarter of a million dollars.</span> <span id="s1130">All lot of money, you got a chance to come in quicker than somebody said affidavit, I got the job making 5,000 dollars, and I got a home.</span> <span id="s1131">But it didn’t work this way.</span> <span id="s1132">Doesn’t work this way.</span> <span id="s1133">So we got stuck with it, that’s why it took so long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr

<p><span id="s1200">Q: I-I -- I’d like you to tell me more about what you saw in Feldafing.</span> <span id="s1201">You -- you re -- covered that very quickly, but what -- what do you remember of your time there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Well, in Feldafing everybody -- you know, we were assigned certain, you know, even locally there, you know, some -- there were some teachers.</span> <span id="s1203">I had a cousin taught in school there.</span> <span id="s1204">And -- but I was told, and my brother, the family -- those years in Feldafing and in the other camps, a lot of them you cou -- you were free to go out and you come in in the camp.</span> <span id="s1205">You got -- you got -- you were getting rationing so much.</span> <span id="s1206">You were getting cigarettes, you were getting beer.</span> <span id="s1207">I don’t know, I didn’t smoke a pack a -- a pack a day, a pack a week, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1208">Cigarettes was very s -- ec -- it was very precious.</span> <span id="s1209">People used to go out and barter and trade with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1210">Now, if you get five pack of cigarette a week, or three -- for a cigarette, pack of cigarette, you could have gotten a camera.</span> <span id="s1211">For a pack of cigarette you can sometime a pair of pants or boots or something.</span> <span id="s1212">So people -- but it -- they were to -- you know, there was a lot of black market going on among those.</span> <span id="s1213">And what happened, you had to take currency.</span> <span id="s1214">Now, the Germans, there wasn’t a currency if you want to trade in the American zone, some had -- some had dollars.</span> <span id="s1215">Even among the -- even a-among the camp [indecipherable] in camp, you know.</span> <span id="s1216">Oh, you got a camera, how much you want?</span> <span id="s1217">50 dollars.</span> <span id="s1218">Oh, you got that, you want -- you know, it’s little -- but we were told that -- don’t -- you have to -- maybe they heard don’t get involved with any black market, or any, because this is gonna affect your visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: You know?</span> <span id="s1221">This -- if sh -- if they’ll find -- many cases, if they found a few dollars with you, you know, when you come in sometimes -- in the camp, I remember when we went in, they search you, they check you, the a -- MP.</span> <span id="s1222">Okay, we got the invitation to go in, but I don’t know how they figure those years -- they did check you, they figured now if they find -- if they find a dollar, or a few dollars, oh where do you get the dollar?</span> <span id="s1223">Black market.</span> <span id="s1224">Then you got already a stamp, you know.</span> <span id="s1225">They take you and sometime they arrest you.</span> <span id="s1226">Oh, I got these dollars, I got this dollar my -- oh -- when you say if you got -- if you got a father or somebody survive, brother from Poland, you got to explain that, where did you get it.</span> <span id="s1227">It was -- you had to be clean, in order to get.</span> <span id="s1228">So we didn’t get involved too much.</span> <span id="s1229">I was reading a lot, going to the libraries, reading a lot that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1231">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: -- many people in the displaced person’s camps married very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: They d -- there is a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Did you come close to marrying?</span> <span id="s1236">I -- I think a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: No, over -- no -- well, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1238">I mentioned -- I mentioned the girl I met.</span> <span id="s1239">Now -- and you know, she was maybe 16 years old.</span> <span id="s1240">This was in ni -- in ’45, or may -- no, she probably 16 years old when sh -- they took her, because otherwise, you know -- you had to be -- you had to be already -- I mean, somehow al -- I would say, physically not a childish, you know, in order to pick you to labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: You know, they took men, whatever.</span> <span id="s1243">But she -- she probably -- you know, you got to be a little tall not to look like a child.</span> <span id="s1244">So anyway, so -- yeah, and -- and she want, you know, I like this girl.</span> <span id="s1245">But I couldn’t bring her to United States, because I didn’t registered her.</span> <span id="s1246">My brother -- eventually the letters for we got from my relative who is -- I used to get letters from Joseph and Louis, who is Rachel?</span> <span id="s1247">Well -- and then, who is -- who is the boy, little boy?</span> <span id="s1248">Later on [indecipherable] later was attached.</span> <span id="s1249">So -- and another reason, she had relatives in Cuba, and she thought she’s gonna persuade me maybe.</span> <span id="s1250">Then, was late.</span> <span id="s1251">I could have put her in maybe, said she’s my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1252">Uncle, he would bring her in, you know, s-save another child, you know, it’s not a big deal.</span> <span id="s1253">But she decided she wants to go -- sh -- she has uncles and aunts in Cuba.</span> <span id="s1254">She wants -- and she went to Cuba.</span> <span id="s1255">And I went to United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: So that’s the -- tha -- that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Do you know what happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Well, she married in Cuba.</span> <span id="s1260">She married somebody who made -- who went to Cuba before the war.</span> <span id="s1261">He’s a elderly -- you know, she was young.</span> <span id="s1262">I remember him when I was a kid, because in our city in the 1930’s, a lot of them, those younger ones went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1263">Those, you know, they already dreamed about.</span> <span id="s1264">There’s no future, you know, in a [indecipherable] in Poland.</span> <span id="s1265">Young, they figure they’ll go there.</span> <span id="s1266">There’s some girls went there, too.</span> <span id="s1267">Boys and girls went there, and some went to Cuba, some went to United States.</span> <span id="s1268">We heard -- we heard about that, so we know who went -- who went.</span> <span id="s1269">So she’s -- I think she’s still alive, she is in Florida.</span> <span id="s1270">And I heard -- I used to see her si -- see the group from the Pruzana survivors.</span> <span id="s1271">We used to get together every year for the memorial, January whatever, 27th, or 28th, they made it January the 30th.</span> <span id="s1272">And from all over we used to come down to New York.</span> <span id="s1273">People even from all over United States.</span> <span id="s1274">Some of the people from different countries used to come out.</span> <span id="s1275">So we used to meet each other and it still -- it fall apart couple years ago.</span> <span id="s1276">Most of them got old, and you know, mostly -- I’m from the younger ones.</span> <span id="s1277">And it’s got neglected, and the second generation is falling apart.</span> <span id="s1278">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1279">There’s no leaders from the second generation.</span> <span id="s1280">And this used to meet once a year, oh you know, this one from there.</span> <span id="s1281">So, I heard that she is -- got park -- no, this -- not the Parkinson, the -- it’s a little bit forgetful, what do you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Oh, Alzheimer’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Alzheimer’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1285">But she’s had a -- she’s had a good life, I hope.</span> <span id="s1286">A: Oh yeah, she -- yeah, she wa -- she was married.</span> <span id="s1287">She was married, her husband in Cuba had that store, a business, I think a ladder business, if I can recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1289">What was the mood like in Feldafing?</span> <span id="s1290">Were people -- were people optimistic about their future?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: Well, that’s the same -- it’s -- at Feldafing this is already the last stop.</span> <span id="s1292">So like I mentioned before, after the liberation, everything was -- all Europe was in a mess.</span> <span id="s1293">Everything was in a chaos.</span> <span id="s1294">People were moving from one place in another.</span> <span id="s1295">People were looking for some relatives, whoever survived, and eventually where they wa -- you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1296">They were going to here, they’re going to there, maybe -- oh I heard this one had got somebody, a brother survived.</span> <span id="s1297">But eventually, later on when you settled in Feldafing, that was already the last -- you know what I mean, finally the last journey.</span> <span id="s1298">From there you go someplace.</span> <span id="s1299">That means if you know or -- don’t go to United State, you go -- you go -- well, some people stayed there, I don’t know, in the camps, still 19 probably 50 some -- a lot of them went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1300">And of course there’s some, not too many, some went back, those survivors [indecipherable] just went back to their own countries.</span> <span id="s1301">Not too many like from Poland or France, or -- or Lithuania, Latvia.</span> <span id="s1302">A few wanted to go back and settle there.</span> <span id="s1303">Well, now you know that the ca -- now those countries are different, you know, now those countries are trying to absorb as many as they can, the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1305">Have you had any interest in going back in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: -- recent years to Pruzana?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1309">I -- the reason is I saw Pruzana after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1310">I came into Pruzana, I saw what -- what’s the remnants, what it’s left, the few.</span> <span id="s1311">So what I’m going to do there?</span> <span id="s1312">It’s no -- you know, it’s different if somebody oh, survived they never went back.</span> <span id="s1313">Some of them going back now.</span> <span id="s1314">Now it’s easy because my town is now incorporated in Belarus.</span> <span id="s1315">And Belarus became a country, independent country.</span> <span id="s1316">Now some -- this is all part of Poland.</span> <span id="s1317">Part of Poland was now -- is Ukraine, became a country, Ukraine, right?</span> <span id="s1318">Lithuania is a country now.</span> <span id="s1319">So what happens now, now it’s easier to go, but I don’t want to go my age already, it’s too -- no.</span> <span id="s1320">Haven’t got no interest to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: What about your children?</span> <span id="s1322">Do they have much interest in your -- in the Elman side of their history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Well, my -- well yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1324">My son -- especially my son.</span> <span id="s1325">My son, if not for my son, he encouraged me, he says [indecipherable] that he said he’s gonna disown me if I’m not gonna come out and tell my story.</span> <span id="s1326">You have to, he says.</span> <span id="s1327">You have to tell it for the -- you know for -- for generation to come, you have to tell for those people who cannot tell themselves.</span> <span id="s1328">So I’m blessed to come out and tell the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1330">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1331">And you -- while you -- while there -- there are no more Elmans in Europe --</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: -- of your immediate family, then you have now quite a large and thriving family here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: Well, I have five grandchildren -- I have five grandchildren, three children.</span> <span id="s1335">Now my wife, on her side, she’s got two chi -- two children and three grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1336">So all together --</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: -- see, the big family from ma -- my wife’s side now, in Syracuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: She’s got a big family al -- otherwise I wouldn’t have nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1342">Well you’re richly blessed in that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: But you’re also -- you’re also being very philanthropic as a community member.</span> <span id="s1345">You -- it seems to me your -- you’re a -- a good citizen in supporting worthy causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Well, like I say, well, I ca -- I can -- thank God I can afford, so I can, I’m doing that.</span> <span id="s1347">Even if I couldn’t afford, I would, so I’m -- I’m doing that.</span> <span id="s1348">I belong -- you know, I was giving to the Jewish -- United Jewish Appeal since 1958.</span> <span id="s1349">In 1958 I was assigned -- I was in charge of that certain division.</span> <span id="s1350">I didn’t bring you that -- that I have a -- I have a -- you know, a thank you from the United Jewish -- ni -- 1958.</span> <span id="s1351">So it’s already, I would say, 45 years I’m giving.</span> <span id="s1352">It’s not, you know, giving to the federation, and the temple.</span> <span id="s1353">I’m a good member of the temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Tell me about the Jewish Memorial Sanctuary in Dewitt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: Well -- well, it happens in -- when we were a group yet, you know, coming and later on, the later years -- I think this was in the 19 -- I would say 19 -- beginning 1990.</span> <span id="s1356">And we were -- and we had our organization there from the survivors, a group from the survivors.</span> <span id="s1357">And used to meet once in awhile, you know, just social.</span> <span id="s1358">Tell, you know, what -- what’s going on, how you’re doing.</span> <span id="s1359">And we were discussing about, you know, there is so many different cities like they have memorials, sanctuaries you know, where they -- where they memorialize their families.</span> <span id="s1360">And, you know, they just build -- they moved, the last 15 years, I think this is.</span> <span id="s1361">And -- and of course it was a drive for the ca -- you know, for the building front, I gave them money.</span> <span id="s1362">So we thought it would be nice, why not -- why not in Syracuse?</span> <span id="s1363">We deserve.</span> <span id="s1364">So they figured well, you got -- cost a lot of money to build it on the outside, you know, something.</span> <span id="s1365">But strange, somehow it’s no -- not too much help from the outside, they wanted -- they wanted we should pay for the whole expense, you know?</span> <span id="s1366">And there was not too many people can afford that.</span> <span id="s1367">You know, we had a group I would say maybe around 20 couples, it’s fr -- you know, what -- I would say 40 survivors there, 20 -- some singles.</span> <span id="s1368">And they were discussing, they would try to get some money, but there is no money coming out.</span> <span id="s1369">You had to -- you had to da -- you know, you had to -- many times fight for that.</span> <span id="s1370">So eventually they decided, okay, inside a building, inside the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s1371">And they decided -- there was three.</span> <span id="s1372">You’re gonna [indecipherable] the sanctuary is going to be -- have thris -- three nominations.</span> <span id="s1373">The Wall of Remembrance, Contemplation, and Library, three.</span> <span id="s1374">So I picked the Wall of Remembrance.</span> <span id="s1375">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1376">You want to know how much I gave, I’ll tell you how much I gave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: And also, tell me about the -- w-would you -- on the Wall of Remembrance, would it list the names --</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: -- of people who had died --</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: -- relating to Syracuse families?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: So your sisters --</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Yeah, all -- all syra --</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: -- yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: -- for the Syracuse, yeah.</span> <span id="s1387">All -- they have a chance, you know, because the temples don’t have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Temples, you know, they have, but they don’t have that from somehow, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1390">So we decided Jewish, the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s1391">Yeah, so I donated them.</span> <span id="s1392">I gave them 15,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1394">Good for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Good for you.</span> <span id="s1397">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: I’m still not through with that.</span> <span id="s1399">I’m still planning to -- in Syracuse, if everything goes well, i -- I don’t know, they want me through the organization.</span> <span id="s1400">But my son i -- my son, he’ll -- he’ll probably [indecipherable] a certain amount for the study of -- the study of the Jewish Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: Is there quite a strong Jewish community in Syracuse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Well, they have about 8,000 families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: 8,000 families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Out of a total number of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: Population?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Population is -- used to be not quite 200,000.</span> <span id="s1409">Used to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1411">And di-did -- I mean, I -- w-was there a big increase in Jewish settlers there after World War II, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: You mean -- you mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: I just wondered if a lot of se --</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: -- in ge -- in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: Or just survi --</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: No, I just wondered if there had been a Jewish community there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: -- for a hundred years or more [indecipherable] they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: -- yeah, well, I would say we are actually losing, not getting more.</span> <span id="s1421">We are losing, in general.</span> <span id="s1422">Not only Jew, in general the city, Syracuse, it is a lot of -- there’s a lot of industry lost, and a lot of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Oh, as --</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: -- we’re losing -- we’re losing a lot of -- a lot of people, families, because don’t forget, we had -- we had a big industry in Syracuse, we had -- we had the cr -- Chrysler -- Chrysler plant.</span> <span id="s1425">We had -- we had -- it’s -- it’s falling apart, you know?</span> <span id="s1426">Take for instance Bristol-Meyers, we have it still.</span> <span id="s1427">Okay, they moved up, moved a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1428">Then we have Carrier corporation, big, it started in Syracuse, and it -- it employed one time 10,000 that’s left now what is about 15 -- 1500.</span> <span id="s1429">So you see, a lot of those engineers, they -- they going out -- outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: We lost a lot of industry.</span> <span id="s1432">General Electric closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Oh, of course, loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: General Electric, big plant in Syracuse.</span> <span id="s1435">They clo -- I mean, they not gone, they closed the plant.</span> <span id="s1436">And mention -- could mention a lot more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Did you ever, in those early years, did you ever feel that there was anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Well, actually, I wasn’t -- you know, the people I dealt with, I had, you know, mostly Gentiles outside.</span> <span id="s1439">I didn’t feel, you know, sometime th -- the opposite.</span> <span id="s1440">You know, they liked me, and I was getting inv -- they like you sometimes, you know, you ca -- you know, they -- you getting business.</span> <span id="s1441">I ca -- I ran -- I ran it honest, the one thing is, you gotta be honest and -- and loyal, especially honest business, because in this business, when you weigh -- you have a scale and you weigh certain materials, they trust you.</span> <span id="s1442">If they trust you -- if they don’t trust you, for instance, they not going to come to you.</span> <span id="s1443">But they find out, you know, you’re honest, at least you know, you -- your -- your word is what -- good, and you -- when you give a price on the telephone, or you make a contract, you follow up that.</span> <span id="s1444">That’s very important I learned, for the business.</span> <span id="s1445">You gotta be honest and follow the rules, otherwise you don’t last very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1447">I’m going to jump back now to something that you said earlier.</span> <span id="s1448">And this is when you were telling me about the -- one of the reasons for you giving time to speak about your experiences, wa-wanting the world to know of the resistance efforts.</span> <span id="s1449">And you mentioned the -- the Bielski brothers.</span> <span id="s1450">Tell me about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: The Bielski brothers?</span> <span id="s1452">Well, they were located not far where -- from my brigade, I would say in the forest connecting.</span> <span id="s1453">We were in the Michalin forest, and Bielski was in Nowogrodek forest.</span> <span id="s1454">That’s a -- that’s about 50 - 60 kilometer apart.</span> <span id="s1455">And we heard about the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s1456">They were there before I was even there.</span> <span id="s1457">I think the Bielskis, they e -- they escaped there in -- in -- in 1941, right away when the war started, because they were located right a -- they were -- the father had a windmill someplace in a little village, was only family there, and they were raised, brought up in that village, and not far from this village, there were forests there.</span> <span id="s1458">And he already, I think the -- i-it was three brothers, but I heard about a first one, what’s his name?</span> <span id="s1459">What was -- he was a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1460">Bielski.</span> <span id="s1461">Anyway, they were hiding already in the forest since the war started.</span> <span id="s1462">And eventually, of course, after the liquid -- later on, they saved a lot of Jews around from there, and took them in in the forest there.</span> <span id="s1463">And a -- and eventually they grew -- they grew, I think they -- they had, I would say over a thousand, or 1200 or 15 something, something grew to, and th-they -- among their group there, they had a lot of those sp -- those professional craftsmen.</span> <span id="s1464">They have tailors and they have shoemakers.</span> <span id="s1465">They have blacksmiths, you know, for the horses, and they have -- you name it, they a -- they -- they used to make -- they had -- they had -- they established a factory there where they used to make leather from the hides from the -- from the cows, so -- and those Russian -- the top, you know, leaders and some, in order to -- used to come in, and they wanted a pair of boots, they wanted -- they wanted clo -- know, make a sheepskin, you know, clothing and all that.</span> <span id="s1466">They -- they got in -- in return they ask for some food, and certain, you know, products.</span> <span id="s1467">Because they had a lot of -- a lot of families with children, women, pregnant women, elderly and they had an obligation, you know, to support all those groups, people.</span> <span id="s1468">And that’s eventually grew, you know, that’s -- it grew to a st -- to like a community, you know, a Jewish community there, on account, because, you know, they were helpful, you know, we need it, we needed those craftsmen, we needed those people.</span> <span id="s1469">And they accepted, that’s the only -- I remember, they accepted escapees who cou -- wouldn’t be accepted in the -- in the fighting brigades, because elderly, of women and children.</span> <span id="s1470">So they used to, you know, send it, when they were found in the woods, go to -- deliver them to the Bielski [indecipherable] I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: How -- yeah, now the -- they -- they were a Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Jewish, all Jewish [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: And they were -- what age would the brothers be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Oh, they were young that time.</span> <span id="s1475">One was already -- one was already a soldier in the Polish army.</span> <span id="s1476">I would say, you know, sometime 21.</span> <span id="s1477">When you go in the army, 21 til 23.</span> <span id="s1478">They could be in the middle 20’s and 30 you know, from the upper 20’s and the 30’s.</span> <span id="s1479">You know, because -- because they were already -- he’s a soldier, he was th -- you know, he served in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: And how was it that they escaped attack?</span> <span id="s1481">How did they protect the people in their community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: There?</span> <span id="s1483">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Oh, they -- they protect communi -- besides, they had a lot of young -- younger -- beside the elderly and those, you know, families, they call -- this was a family brigade.</span> <span id="s1485">And a lot of stuff was brought in to them.</span> <span id="s1486">You know, that was a -- you know, feed and -- and -- and clothes, 1500 people, you gotta have a lot of -- it’s not -- you gotta have a lot of -- a lot of territor -- I mean, lot of help.</span> <span id="s1487">A lot of help in order to go in and get the food for them.</span> <span id="s1488">And -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: -- with Joseph Elman.</span> <span id="s1490">This is tape number three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: You sta -- getting a lot of help from the rest of the brigades surrounding, because they did a job, you know?</span> <span id="s1492">They d -- you needed -- you needed those craftsmen, fix -- fix a rifle.</span> <span id="s1493">Clean -- you know, fix machine gun.</span> <span id="s1494">Make a part, a machine -- machinist -- they had machinist there, and like -- like I sa -- mentioned, and all those craftsmen, shoemaker, blacksmithing.</span> <span id="s1495">No f -- there were some horses, you know, the commanders were riding horses.</span> <span id="s1496">A fleet of horses.</span> <span id="s1497">There were dozens, hundreds of horses around in the territory there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: Now th -- wh-when you think about weaponry, I’m reminded that we haven’t talked about your -- your -- your job with th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Well, I was trained --</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: -- anti-gun --</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: See [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: -- equipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: The reason -- is gotta be a reason why I was treated and I was honored in the group, because it was even -- it was anti-Semitism, even in the g -- in the brigades.</span> <span id="s1504">Mostly from the local -- you know what -- local.</span> <span id="s1505">It means from the local Belarus, that was Belarus, from the local Ukraines, local Poles.</span> <span id="s1506">There was all kind of nationalities.</span> <span id="s1507">But the -- the east -- the Russians, they would never -- they -- th-they -- they -- th-they didn’t -- we never felt -- but sometimes they used to, you know what anti-Semitism it means.</span> <span id="s1508">They tr -- do -- de -- they -- we were treated, you know, otherwise, but sometime called names.</span> <span id="s1509">You know, call name.</span> <span id="s1510">I have a name, so okay, call me, you know, I’m Joseph.</span> <span id="s1511">Jusef in Polish, Jossel in Russia.</span> <span id="s1512">No, it’s Moshka.</span> <span id="s1513">You know, give you a name Moshka.</span> <span id="s1514">Jew Moshka.</span> <span id="s1515">Like the Poles used to sometime, anti-Semitism, they used to call -- they used to call --</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Is that Moses, Moshka?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Yeah, Moses, something mo -- Moshka.</span> <span id="s1518">So they said, oh Moshka.</span> <span id="s1519">I got a name.</span> <span id="s1520">Was -- do this.</span> <span id="s1521">I’m -- oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1522">What happened?</span> <span id="s1523">Now, I was assigned to carry -- we had in our brigade, we had in the beginning one anti-tank gun.</span> <span id="s1524">And the purpose of the tank at this -- it was a old fashioned one, but it was heavy, and you had to car -- weighed 150 pounds.</span> <span id="s1525">And we used to use this gun in order to go and shoot locomotives, stop the train.</span> <span id="s1526">We didn’t ever stop -- shooting at ta -- we didn’t ever get involved with Panzer tanks and that [indecipherable] that’s unusual, you know, it’s useless.</span> <span id="s1527">This was, you know, this was important, because at night you reached that -- this destination, you find a place where you lay in ambush.</span> <span id="s1528">You figure the train, you know, among bushes [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1529">The train is gonna come down.</span> <span id="s1530">The first thing when it comes,, it’s [indecipherable] shoot the locomotive.</span> <span id="s1531">Now I was assigned, I was strong, you know, young, strong.</span> <span id="s1532">Number two, carrying the ma -- it was a number one, a number two and three.</span> <span id="s1533">The number one shoots.</span> <span id="s1534">He doesn’t have to carry nothing, he just -- comes the time, he gotta shoot.</span> <span id="s1535">The number two has gotta carry.</span> <span id="s1536">And the number two has gotta change and carry.</span> <span id="s1537">Because when we go out on those missions sometime, we -- we walk 50 kilometers during the night and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1538">It happened one time, we lay in ambush, that’s not far, you know, in the partisans, we mined the road and two truckloads with soldier -- German soldiers arrived.</span> <span id="s1539">We mined the -- we mined the roads, we knew they have to go through this road, because farmers, they don’t have a -- they don’t have trucks at night, usually.</span> <span id="s1540">So you wait.</span> <span id="s1541">Either they’ll go through, they’ll come or not, we’ll retreat.</span> <span id="s1542">But actually, they went through, and blew up one truck on the mine, on the -- you know, on the main road, blew it up.</span> <span id="s1543">And scattered.</span> <span id="s1544">And the next up, that other truck stopped, we opened [indecipherable] you know, with plier.</span> <span id="s1545">We stopped the other one.</span> <span id="s1546">We killed a lot of them there.</span> <span id="s1547">But reinforcement came in and they cut us off.</span> <span id="s1548">We tried to retreat, you know, on our side, the road towards -- towards our destination, and they cut us off, and we running.</span> <span id="s1549">You know, we [indecipherable] a lot.</span> <span id="s1550">See, in 15 minutes, we thought we gonna hide there and the s -- I would say awful lot, lot of Germans because fi -- a fi -- 15 - 20 - 25 wouldn’t dare go in in the woods there, maybe couple hundred.</span> <span id="s1551">Now group was only had -- the most was [indecipherable] maybe was 25 or 28.</span> <span id="s1552">I was carrying that gun, and we running, and they chasing out in the woods.</span> <span id="s1553">It was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1554">And I has -- and I asked, you know, the guys, I says, you know, I’m gonna drop it, I cannot run any more, save it, take the gun.</span> <span id="s1555">Nobody wants to take the gun, nobody.</span> <span id="s1556">And where was the Germans, right in back over, the German.</span> <span id="s1557">The commander is there.</span> <span id="s1558">I s -- told the commander, I says, I says -- I asked -- I says, nobody wants to take the gun, I’m gonna drop it, I says save the gun, don’t save me.</span> <span id="s1559">He took the gun away from me.</span> <span id="s1560">And then that’s helped me.</span> <span id="s1561">Then I became a hero with them, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Because you s -- pointed out --</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: -- the importance of the gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: -- because I said, save the gun, don’t save me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1567">So your stock went up, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: He took it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: And what happened eventually, they chased us.</span> <span id="s1571">He got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: The command -- he got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: And he was carrying the gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: Well, eventually he gave it to so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: -- it -- it quiet down already, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: Eventually -- and he went to a village, and he figured he’s gonna go in, and in the village were Germans, and they caught him there, and he got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: I think him and a couple other guys.</span> <span id="s1582">So see, that’s why, after that, you know, they respected me.</span> <span id="s1583">So -- so -- I used to go -- eventually I told them -- very seldom used to use the gun, going on this mission, not too often.</span> <span id="s1584">Because most of the time you carried a -- you carried a bomb made up to, you know, to just lay it on the -- or dig it in under the railroad or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: It wasn’t useful so much, that.</span> <span id="s1587">And it -- you didn’t have to carry that.</span> <span id="s1588">So eventually I ask him, I says, I want to go on missions.</span> <span id="s1589">I-I want to go on missions instead that, it’s safer and it’s better.</span> <span id="s1590">Because on missions, when you go they send a small group.</span> <span id="s1591">Five or seven with, you know, with -- with this dynamite, with a bomb, tell you what to do, either on the bridge or on the road.</span> <span id="s1592">And that time you find a quiet time, you take off, it’s qui -- then you go into the farmer’s house, and you have -- you gonna have a picnic.</span> <span id="s1593">You ca -- sometime you got a little booze.</span> <span id="s1594">You know, this is all the farmers which you know them.</span> <span id="s1595">They have connection, you know what I -- we knew certain farmers worked with us.</span> <span id="s1596">So we reached there, and we stayed a couple nights, and it was -- we spend a little time.</span> <span id="s1597">So it was -- it was -- a more convenient.</span> <span id="s1598">First of all, you get some time for a change, better food, because you get tired of that -- you know, if you get a little bread, even a little -- with a little garlic --</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: -- you know, that’s missing.</span> <span id="s1601">You wa -- get a little bread or garlic.</span> <span id="s1602">Or you get a little bread sometimes with a -- with a -- with a kielbasa, you heard what -- you know what kal -- a little kielbasa, som -- we didn’t have that.</span> <span id="s1603">All the time just meat and meat and -- and ca -- and slonina, you know what slonina is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: You know they used to eat, you know the pigs?</span> <span id="s1606">The fat of the pigs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: You know, you trim it, sometime it’s two inches thick.</span> <span id="s1609">They send you f -- you know, many time with -- with bread and a slice of this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: -- yeah, well, see, that’s what -- that’s -- nowadays over here they say crazy, it’s so fatty, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: What do you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Well, it’s for -- it’s -- it -- we would think of it as too fatty, but it would be rich in flavor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Yeah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: The bacon rasher, or the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: The ba -- yeah, the -- see the -- the Germans ate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: The German soldier ate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: So after -- so -- so fa -- after that I have it, you know, the respect, I mean, I had it.</span> <span id="s1622">That’s why they sent me to Pruzana, otherwise I wind up on the -- otherwise I would wind up on the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: They respected you and sent you there to do that work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Checking out -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1626">Well, I wonder if there’s m-more you wanted to say about resistance on the part of Jews.</span> <span id="s1627">You were fighting as part of the resistance, but there were many acts of resistance that went on in the ghettos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: They went on -- yeah, th-the -- well -- well, the resista -- in the ghetto -- the resistance in the ghettos is -- this is resistance.</span> <span id="s1629">Because if you resist in the ghettos, like I mentioned you before, we could have killed those SS men coming in in the ghetto, they have a guts.</span> <span id="s1630">And that -- you know, and the chutzpah, the guts to come in in two, three in the ghetto, where is going on turmo -- so much turmoil.</span> <span id="s1631">And now they’re afraid they’re going to get killed.</span> <span id="s1632">But they c -- you couldn’t get killed.</span> <span id="s1633">They could have, but you couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s1634">I couldn’t do that because I didn’t want to have the responsibility on my conscience that after that, on account me, all the ghetto is going to be going on fire, destroyed.</span> <span id="s1635">No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1637">There’s wise resistance and there’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Couldn’t do that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: -- unwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: -- it’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1641">It’s one the reason that it was impossible, but it was exceptions in some, you know, there was -- I read there was some uprising in -- in one of the concentration camps that blew up a -- a -- one of those ed -- there the -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1642">Ovens, ovens [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1644">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: That was a big, big obstacle.</span> <span id="s1646">But there was, you know, there was.</span> <span id="s1647">That’s why I want to bring out that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: That it was not easy, but it was -- it was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1651">Now, there -- there would be some Jews who would believe that it was wrong to resist, is that right?</span> <span id="s1652">Was there a tendency of Orthodox Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: -- t-to feel this was God’s will, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: -- well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1656">I -- o -- you know, is -- I-I -- I don’t know [indecipherable] the or -- the Orthodox Jews, we had some Orthodox too.</span> <span id="s1657">I don’t know why would sh -- well, first of all, the Orthodox Jews don’t believe even now, they don’t believe in defending.</span> <span id="s1658">You know, Orthodox Jews, they don’t believe in defending yourself.</span> <span id="s1659">If you get killed, God wants that, okay.</span> <span id="s1660">It’s the same thing like you say the -- the terrorists, they say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1663">They -- God wants it, the Jihad, with the parents tell you, you get killed you go to heaven, and there you gonna have a party, you’ll met your parents in paradise.</span> <span id="s1664">All this, huh?</span> <span id="s1665">But th-the leadership from the ghetto, the Judenrat wa-was against that.</span> <span id="s1666">And they had a reason to be against it, they don’t want to be responsible for the -- you know, for the -- all the community in the ghetto, and they don’t want to be killed themself first.</span> <span id="s1667">They didn’t -- but later on, later on they ch -- they wanted to join, it was already too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1669">Did you feel after the war that you -- that your -- that you needed to mend?</span> <span id="s1670">Did you feel a trauma that your suffering was so great that you needed time to heal?</span> <span id="s1671">Or did you feel that you were pretty well balanced to go on with life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: Well, I didn’t -- I didn’t feel really too much trauma because comparison what they went through, I remember, you hear what they went through, eventually we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1673">So what, comparison, we didn’t have it as bad as they, we had okay.</span> <span id="s1674">I mean, it was rough in the beginning and -- but eventually, you know, we had enough food and listen, you can’t compare that.</span> <span id="s1675">You can’t compare that, you were fighting, you know what, you figured, you know, that -- but it’s still, you know -- you know, it always comes to you, you know, that here you had parents, or it comes to you you have sisters, and you always wonder, I hope they’ll forgive me that, you know, that I didn’t went with them.</span> <span id="s1676">I don’t know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1677">This I cannot tell.</span> <span id="s1678">Why I’m better than them, they can say, see?</span> <span id="s1679">I went.</span> <span id="s1680">They knew I escape, but I didn’t know -- they didn't know if I’m alive or not, eventual was gonna be there.</span> <span id="s1681">And maybe they thought -- maybe thank God, maybe the boys gonna survive and take advantage.</span> <span id="s1682">I don’t know what was their mind.</span> <span id="s1683">They knew that we are away.</span> <span id="s1684">They knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: I th -- I would think your mind should be at ease on that, that you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: -- but -- but these are things you ponder over, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: Well, it comes, you know, every once in awhile, if you dream, it comes.</span> <span id="s1689">This you cannot help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: I ra -- I don’t want my wife to know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1693">Did you ever get depressed in those -- in those -- either during the war, or -- or later on, or -- or were you spared any -- I ju -- I just wondered if you had any difficult periods when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: The worst --</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: -- when your spirits sagged and you couldn’t keep going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: The worst period of my life, it was when we broke through and escaped in the woods.</span> <span id="s1697">That time we were marching.</span> <span id="s1698">We heard, you know, the reason, that’s supposed to be some partisans there.</span> <span id="s1699">And we marched.</span> <span id="s1700">It was January 28th, you know, in Poland, cold.</span> <span id="s1701">But way below zero.</span> <span id="s1702">And we had, the first day, we took certain, you know, products, bread and certain stuff with us.</span> <span id="s1703">But we have to, in the woods, wandering around for over a week, maybe 10 days, with our water and without, you know, without.</span> <span id="s1704">And that time, this was, I remember, because I remember my brother was sitting by a tree.</span> <span id="s1705">He was almost -- and I says -- I says, what are you doing here, come.</span> <span id="s1706">He almost would -- froze to death.</span> <span id="s1707">He says, oh, I’m s -- I want to go home.</span> <span id="s1708">I want to go home, get warm.</span> <span id="s1709">This was -- this was the worst we acce -- I mean actually -- actually this was, I can remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Touch and go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: -- was tou -- no, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1712">We didn’t know that we gonna make it, and we were -- it was just a matter of time, we figured, well -- but after th -- after s -- a week, we met a couple partisans.</span> <span id="s1713">And they told us that if we have ammunition, guns, or money, then they would take us in.</span> <span id="s1714">Otherwise -- and they helped us that time.</span> <span id="s1715">They went with one of the group, and they helped us to get a little food.</span> <span id="s1716">And they told us to build a home, a bunker.</span> <span id="s1717">And they told us how to make a fire, and how to get water out of snow.</span> <span id="s1718">Boil snow to make water.</span> <span id="s1719">But this is -- this is as far as my -- was the worse than in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1720">This is worse than the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Well, what has been -- that was the worst of times, what do you think has been the best of times?</span> <span id="s1722">You -- you mentioned feeling great satisfaction when you were successful in blowing up a train.</span> <span id="s1723">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Well, that gives you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: -- that gave -- that li -- it gave you some satisfaction.</span> <span id="s1727">As a matter of fact, I f -- I -- I-I don’t know what to say.</span> <span id="s1728">I [indecipherable] volunteered.</span> <span id="s1729">Volunteered.</span> <span id="s1730">I volunteered --</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: -- f -- to go and -- and for these missions.</span> <span id="s1733">This was easy.</span> <span id="s1734">This was easy.</span> <span id="s1735">Many times I remember -- I remember we were assigned three brigades.</span> <span id="s1736">Took part, I think maybe hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s1737">And we had to destroy three garrisons.</span> <span id="s1738">Three, in different kind of places.</span> <span id="s1739">And they are entrenched there, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1740">They are there entrenched with bunkers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: In trenches?</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: In trenches.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: Yeah, literally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: And a rocket -- a rocket, blue racket was sho -- got shot out [indecipherable] in order to see when to attack, you know?</span> <span id="s1745">And the same time, and we had to attack and we had to kill -- destroy the three garrisons.</span> <span id="s1746">There was about f -- let’s say this is maybe hundreds of us.</span> <span id="s1747">There was 50 in this one, 80 in this one.</span> <span id="s1748">This was Germans, and the -- and the Russian, the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1749">They had garrisons, and they would watch all around and tray -- you know, to trace us and kill us.</span> <span id="s1750">And it was at -- you know, the only th -- came to a point sometimes they speak Russians.</span> <span id="s1751">But [indecipherable] distinguish.</span> <span id="s1752">Every day we had -- we had code [speaks foreign language here] I’m going to shoot you.</span> <span id="s1753">Tell me the code.</span> <span id="s1754">If he doesn’t have a code, boom, you get killed.</span> <span id="s1755">It’s not bec -- everyone before going on the mission had a code, and for all this -- you know, it was ce-centralized, organized, that anybody doesn’t know the code is a spy, had to kill him.</span> <span id="s1756">So a lot of missions like that, I mean it -- what I -- what I participated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: Mr. Elman, we were talking about the -- why the allies didn’t intervene, and was that a question that you would ask yourself when you would be with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: Well, when we were with the partisans, we didn’t hear either you know, from the Russian side.</span> <span id="s1759">They never mention anything, even if -- I don’t even know if they knew -- if they knew they didn’t say in the partisan, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1760">We mostly wa -- it was a radio in the central location, and whatever Moscow tells them, the -- you know, whatever each day what’s going on with the war, it was repeated.</span> <span id="s1761">We knew that before that the advance of the Russian army already reaching here gonna be near us pretty soon, then -- then -- so we know what was going on, but it was ne -- never mentioned during the war about the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1762">No, they never said.</span> <span id="s1763">Yeah, I don’t know if they knew, because the allies, this was later on, you know what I mean, when the Russian reached there, to the Auschwitz and before, you had -- most of the camps were in the Polish -- in the pa -- in po -- in the Polish territory.</span> <span id="s1764">So even if they, you know, reached before, it was the first camp al -- what is that belez -- belez -- belez --</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: No, no, no, this is -- this is -- no.</span> <span id="s1767">Belzec.</span> <span id="s1768">Bel -- it’s a co -- a concentration camp in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Ber --</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: Then it was Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: And then was Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: And then was -- and then was Belzec, Majdanek, Sobibor --</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: Oh right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: -- Treblinka and Auschwitz were all in Polish territory.</span> <span id="s1777">And -- and -- well, when I was liberated, there was -- the camps were on the west [indecipherable] you know?</span> <span id="s1778">Those -- they didn't reach any camps there so I couldn’t hear anything, maybe, if they knew or didn’t know, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: But I never heard -- I never heard aft -- if they never heard, but they saying we reach here, or we found something.</span> <span id="s1781">We heard about Babiy Yar, which of course on Russian territory.</span> <span id="s1782">This was in 19 -- when was ba -- Babiy Yar was 1941.</span> <span id="s1783">Ni -- yeah, I think it was 1941.</span> <span id="s1784">We heard -- they were mentioned something later on when we were in 19 -- late ’42, ’43, ’44, mention Babiy Yar there.</span> <span id="s1785">But what was going on, they killed so many, they took some from Kiev, or from other cities.</span> <span id="s1786">But never -- never heard about the camps, you know, about Auschwitz, and -- and Treblinka and the other ones.</span> <span id="s1787">So that’s why I was just wondering.</span> <span id="s1788">But the Americans were bombarding, see?</span> <span id="s1789">The Russian were not bombarding those places, they were -- they were tied up in the east there, you know, chasing the Germans.</span> <span id="s1790">But Americans, when they started -- the second front started, they already bombarded the territory, Germany, right?</span> <span id="s1791">They bombarded Germany.</span> <span id="s1792">Berlin, there was so much Berlin, and -- and -- and -- and all the other places.</span> <span id="s1793">But this is the only question of -- I was -- and even about the Jewish community, United States, the reaction.</span> <span id="s1794">I never found out what was their reaction.</span> <span id="s1795">Did they knew, what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: We have two unanswered questions on our --</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: Oh this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: -- on our -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: We’ll find out more, if you do.</span> <span id="s1801">W-When you were -- when -- when you were first here, did you feel different?</span> <span id="s1802">Did you f -- I mean, as a -- as a new American?</span> <span id="s1803">I mean, I know you -- you adjusted to life here very successfully.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: But did you always feel that you we -- that you were different or -- or -- or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: Over here?</span> <span id="s1807">No.</span> <span id="s1808">No, I didn’t f -- since the minute I came in t -- to this country, I right away adjusted myself, because I right away became, you know, got a job and got paid.</span> <span id="s1809">Became independent, which I never had it my coun -- you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1810">I was young yet.</span> <span id="s1811">I never expected to have this opportunity in my country.</span> <span id="s1812">And it was -- it was open for you, you know, all opportunities in the world.</span> <span id="s1813">Because to me it was -- it was like a paradise.</span> <span id="s1814">And it’s like a paradise.</span> <span id="s1815">First of all -- I mean, you can -- you can do what you want.</span> <span id="s1816">You free to sp -- you know, you free -- you free to -- t -- you’re a fr -- you’re a free man.</span> <span id="s1817">You can follow your religion.</span> <span id="s1818">You can -- you can -- you can mingle.</span> <span id="s1819">I mean, there’s no discrimination like, you know, what I went through in Poland when I was a kid, you know, and I went to schools.</span> <span id="s1820">So it was -- what a different.</span> <span id="s1821">And I was fortunate enough besides that I have relatives here, so I was not completely cut off.</span> <span id="s1822">And they recept -- they accepted me and my brother, you know, with all they could.</span> <span id="s1823">And they were proud of us, and proud of me for going through that, all this.</span> <span id="s1824">And I mean, it’s -- is a fr-free country, opportunity for everybody, if you follow the rules.</span> <span id="s1825">That’s all i -- that’s all.</span> <span id="s1826">And I -- I took, you know, had the opportune -- opportunity, whatever I wanted to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: I could never have done that in my old country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1830">You had to learn English.</span> <span id="s1831">You knew Polish and Yiddish, or --</span></p> <p><span

spoke, you know, we spoke with my family Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1841">And a pa -- and Polish, I went to the Polish school.</span> <span id="s1842">Then I went to the Russian school from 1939 til 1941.</span> <span id="s1843">This part of Poland was incorporated to the Russians.</span> <span id="s1844">We expected the Germans and they came in in town and we didn’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1845">And two days later they disappeared and the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s1846">This was the secret pact between Stalin and Hitler.</span> <span id="s1847">So I was -- had opportunity at to go to the pole -- to the Russian school.</span> <span id="s1848">I went to Russian school there two years, I learned Russian and -- and -- under the Germans, you know, I learned Germans a little.</span> <span id="s1849">Germans a little, and Hebrew I learned from my father, he was a Hebrew teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: So you’ve -- you have many languages, but w -- have you been able to use this knowledge at all in your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: No.</span> <span id="s1852">Not -- no -- not -- not really.</span> <span id="s1853">Not really.</span> <span id="s1854">I -- I did ha -- i-it’s useful, very useful because I had -- I had customers, you know, Polish customers.</span> <span id="s1855">I had customers, German customers.</span> <span id="s1856">I had -- I had -- I had Lithuanian in this country, that’s a mixture of [indecipherable] all nationalities.</span> <span id="s1857">And eventually they found out, so they -- I spoke to him -- I spoke to him th-their language.</span> <span id="s1858">It helped.</span> <span id="s1859">It helped, using all the languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: When --</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: Of course there -- this is older generation, the younger generation, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1862">When I came over was young, but the people already those -- dealt with the people that were ready, all the generation, middle class, all the generation.</span> <span id="s1863">50 - 60 years old, 40.</span> <span id="s1864">I was 25.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1866">When you retired, did you sell your business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: I just sold my business.</span> <span id="s1868">I retired in 1996.</span> <span id="s1869">And I was -- it’s actually when my wife got sick, I tried to sell the business, because the ki -- all the kids are outside [indecipherable] no one in Syracuse with me.</span> <span id="s1870">And it was hard, I decided that’s enough.</span> <span id="s1871">And I had to spend some time with my wife.</span> <span id="s1872">As a matter of fact, I went with her -- stayed with her in reha -- rehab, almost for two years.</span> <span id="s1873">Left the house and stayed with her in rehab and -- and different places and finally to the last place.</span> <span id="s1874">We have, in a retirement place in the -- this is in-independent, they have those -- those help you -- those retirement arti -- but in a retirement place.</span> <span id="s1875">I left the house and I was, you know, it was hard for me.</span> <span id="s1876">But eventually I found a buyer in 1996, I found a buyer and he was from German descent.</span> <span id="s1877">A young, young boy.</span> <span id="s1878">And they bought the business, and they very successful.</span> <span id="s1879">They didn’t bil -- they didn’t buy the property, they bought the business, my recycling business, with equipment and all the customers, all the accounts.</span> <span id="s1880">But he just lost his job, too, and eventually he outgrew me.</span> <span id="s1881">He moved to a ex -- bigger -- bigger place.</span> <span id="s1882">This was -- this was too small for him already, because he needed a warehouse.</span> <span id="s1883">He knew I had a warehou -- I sold the warehouse f -- actually, and it was hard for him.</span> <span id="s1884">But anyway, I sold the pr -- I sold the bi -- the property last year, too.</span> <span id="s1885">So I sold everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: Oh so you -- now you’ve sold the buildings as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: The building -- I sold the buildings as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Yeah, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1889">And you are now spending a lot of time working on Holocaust memorial causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: Yes, I spent -- after -- when -- after my wife passed away, so I started, they -- they knew about me in the community and since I wrote the articles, I think it’s 1998 or so -- the articles, I -- in -- in the two papers, I got a lot of calls from personal and from organizations and from schools, so I -- I’m very active to -- in the schools, quite a fe -- all the schools, and -- and I was -- I -- in Syracuse University I spoke to them.</span> <span id="s1891">And in -- I have now a summer home in Florida, so I spoke to the -- the Florida -- what they call it -- Florida University -- Florida University, Boca, yeah.</span> <span id="s1892">Florida U. in Boca.</span> <span id="s1893">And so every once in awhile -- I don’t know how long I’ll be able to, but I’m still active in tr -- and try to teach them the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: So hopefully -- we hope it should neve -- never happen again, but it’s obligation, I say, it’s obligation to tell the story while you’re alive, so the younger generation -- for the younger generation, so they should learn and know what happened.</span> <span id="s1896">What -- it can happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: It shouldn’t happen again.</span> <span id="s1899">What happened to humanity, it shouldn’t happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: Well, there are l -- there are profound lessons, and -- and there -- there are many lessons, I think.</span> <span id="s1901">Wa -- I -- I think of the m-much smaller part of it, which is the emigration.</span> <span id="s1902">I mean, issues that tell me that it was very hard for you to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: Oh, oh, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: -- leave after the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: -- and remember the St. Louis?</span> <span id="s1907">Wasn’t that the vessel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: -- of the coast of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: -- well, it’s a -- it is comparison especially when you tell people now, it -- th -- the emigration during the war, it was -- it was strict and forbidden, very -- I mean, even -- can you imagine, even if you got out, you had a chance, it was tough to get out, even when you got out and reached certain destination, you weren’t accepted.</span> <span id="s1911">The fact is Cuba and the United States, they shipped -- you know, they shi -- the sh-ship wa-was -- was turned back, you know, over 900 people.</span> <span id="s1912">That’s what I know, I don’t know any other incidents where ship back.</span> <span id="s1913">So we can see the different in immigration those -- even when I c -- my immigration -- my immigration, considering being the pe-person in Germany after going through all t -- all the hell, and having relatives trying to bring you over and they s -- to bring you over in this country and you couldn’t get in.</span> <span id="s1914">You had to wait for two years in order to get your permission visa.</span> <span id="s1915">Compare nowadays, ca -- ca -- people are coming in from all over.</span> <span id="s1916">I mean, legal, or not legal, or even you know, or -- or even for temporary visa.</span> <span id="s1917">My relatives, they -- anyth -- they would do anything even to bring us over temporarily til the -- but the laws were -- the laws were so strict.</span> <span id="s1918">So you t -- so what I’m saying, it’s hard to -- people don’t believe that, honestly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A: When you tell them, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: It was difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Now, I’m going to jump around with some questions that have -- that I feel we haven’t mentioned.</span> <span id="s1924">When you had your own children, you named them names that to me seem very American.</span> <span id="s1925">The -- the old Polish tradition would have been to name them after their forbears, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: Yeah be -- yeah -- well, my -- the first child, my daughter Cheryl was named after my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Caroline.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: Cheryl, Cyril.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: My second daughter --</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: It’s spelled differently, but the same name again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: Yeah, that’s Cyril [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: And my son Barry is named after my father Benjamin [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: Barry is Benja-Benja -- it’s actually Benjamin Elman, in short it’s Barry Elman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: And Marsha was named after my wife’s parents.</span> <span id="s1939">No, aft -- [indecipherable] they were -- let’s see.</span> <span id="s1940">No, more fr -- more -- my wife’s family, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: So they were traditional, they seemed to me very American names.</span> <span id="s1942">Barry Scott, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: Oh, Barry Scott.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: -- or Marsha Kaye.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: Well, they [indecipherable] well, Marsha Kaye --</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: But -- but they really --</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: -- well, they -- I’ll tell you, Marsha Kaye, Kaye is for -- this is a cousin of ours in Syracuse.</span> <span id="s1948">She passed away, a close cousin, was Marsha Kaye.</span> <span id="s1949">But Marsha was named -- this is -- this is -- I gave the same thing.</span> <span id="s1950">This is from my wife’s side.</span> <span id="s1951">I got two from my side, and one from -- you know, she had lost a lot of -- my wife had relatives in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: Oh, so on both sides of your family you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: She had -- father came to this country the same thing, before the war, but they had -- there’s a lot of -- lot of brother, lot of from the -- from the father’s side perished.</span> <span id="s1954">And that’s a old story about, you know, about -- but this is nothing to do with the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">A: This is nothing to do with the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1958">Do you still play chess?</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: Well, I used to play.</span> <span id="s1960">Not lately.</span> <span id="s1961">I used to play chess when I was young, you know, before the war.</span> <span id="s1962">We didn’t -- we used to play soccer.</span> <span id="s1963">My father was a [indecipherable] chess player, he learned how to play chess.</span> <span id="s1964">I did play here with my son.</span> <span id="s1965">This was, oh about 10 years, but otherwise I don’t -- no, I don’t play too much chess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1967">I know that the museum has a photo of your -- of your unit in the forest, and it -- someone has a guitar there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: But I just wondered if you love music and enjoy singing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: No, this was -- it -- actually I didn’t even know they took pictures there.</span> <span id="s1971">But it’s -- it -- this is exactly what used to happen there.</span> <span id="s1972">We used to, sometimes, in the evening, on a holiday in the evening, certain group, this is, you know, each brigade had the [indecipherable] they c -- they call it rotas and -- and you know, [indecipherable] 250 and from 250 [indecipherable] on 25.</span> <span id="s1973">This is [indecipherable] this is like a -- a group, it happened and in the evening there was, especially in, we use -- in the underground th-there was a lot of players.</span> <span id="s1974">The Russian, they play the ham -- what is that?</span> <span id="s1975">Harmonic --</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Harmonica?</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: Harmonica, the Russian and dancing.</span> <span id="s1978">They used to -- we used to play that and they used to dance at night, he is -- you know, and she’s [indecipherable] girl.</span> <span id="s1979">Yeah, there were some musicians that -- so, used to play.</span> <span id="s1980">Came a time already sometimes even -- that was -- that was so safe, even [indecipherable] the later, you know, later on.</span> <span id="s1981">Because, see, the Germans, they getting bitten, they were -- they were -- they were knocking the hell out of them, the Russians where they marched.</span> <span id="s1982">Terrible.</span> <span id="s1983">And -- and s -- so -- see, I forgot already where I started.</span> <span id="s1984">We talk about [indecipherable] play.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Well, we’re talking about playing music.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: Y-Yeah.</span> <span id="s1987">They -- they played.</span> <span id="s1988">Even sometime -- some -- sometime during the day, a lot of music, a lot of music and sometime a lot of dancing, round, you know, in the fe -- in the woods.</span> <span id="s1989">S -- we had certain places was knocked out, they knocked out all the -- all the logs for -- for cooking and you know, for heating.</span> <span id="s1990">And around there there was a space you know like a -- like a field, you know, used to have entertainment, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: Even -- even -- even -- even during the day, even.</span> <span id="s1993">It’s -- it’s amazing.</span> <span id="s1994">Sometime it’s unbelievable, where sh -- ek -- a -- a whole -- a whole unit, a whole army in -- in the back, in the -- you know, in the rear.</span> <span id="s1995">But they didn’t have enough, they -- they were bleeding.</span> <span id="s1996">They didn -- they couldn’t do anything because they had to had a million army to -- you know, in order to -- they never, never went through the woods, the main roads.</span> <span id="s1997">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s1998">You know, the -- many times there were so many roads, which, you know, trucks or tanks can penetrate through the woods.</span> <span id="s1999">Once in awhile, since I been in the woods, I remember they decided to cl -- go, a clean up operation to get after the partisans.</span> <span id="s2000">And they came in.</span> <span id="s2001">They pulled out from the front -- this was in late 1943, three divisions with tanks, and they went through the woods.</span> <span id="s2002">And what happened with the tanks, we -- we are -- we are -- you know, when you with -- got tipped off in advance, so we retreated.</span> <span id="s2003">We didn’t get involved, you know, with -- with the army, with an army di-division, 30th, you know, 90 or 50,000.</span> <span id="s2004">So we retreated from -- they found -- they did found.</span> <span id="s2005">This is the only time where they found on a -- a -- you know, the bunkers when we were -- where we were living.</span> <span id="s2006">And this was all over t -- the territory.</span> <span id="s2007">Even -- even the Bielskis, you know, they pulled away, they went in the -- they went in the swamp sometime near -- near -- this is city near Pinsk, Pinsk [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2008">They went there, retreated.</span> <span id="s2009">So what they do?</span> <span id="s2010">They -- they did found -- and that’s -- we came next day when they retreated, next day, they -- they didn’t have the time and they couldn’t afford.</span> <span id="s2011">This is the only time they tried to clean us out.</span> <span id="s2012">But it was a job that were in that time, and we had to go in in -- in mud, in those swamps, up to here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: Up to your waist.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: Up to here.</span> <span id="s2015">They could have -- you know, they never -- they knew where we are at the other side, but they were afr -- they didn’t want to go in the swamps like that, you know, the -- the soldiers and all their tanks, how would they get in in there?</span> <span id="s2016">So we bit them, we sh -- you know, it was -- it was predictable, they couldn’t win the war with the partisans, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: Couldn’t win the war with the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: Then I want to jump back to a -- an unrelated question.</span> <span id="s2020">The -- the ghetto in Pruzana, would -- how is that protected or fenced in -- I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: I know what you mean.</span> <span id="s2022">Yeah, when they established the ghetto, this is their system, you know, all over, because if they establish a ghetto, they figure it -- they gonna herded in th-the community from the -- and bring some out from different towns and [indecipherable] villages, if -- in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2023">Otherwise, the smaller communities, they killed them right out, you know, with -- they had their system the beginning, with trucks and the mobile --</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: Mobile kill units and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">A: Yeah, you know,</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: They didn’t have yet -- they didn’t have yet the -- the -- the -- those camps, you know, the mass -- the mass -- mass killing.</span> <span id="s2028">They didn’t -- weren’t ready yet for the mass killing.</span> <span id="s2029">So when they tr -- they t -- they picked a section in a town.</span> <span id="s2030">Of course the section is mostly the poor section, dilapidated section and all were mostly -- those Jews they were -- lived in the section, 10 blocks, whatever.</span> <span id="s2031">And they surrounded the section with barbed wire, and they have one gate open from that ghetto section that -- to come in and to go out.</span> <span id="s2032">Workers, every time.</span> <span id="s2033">So the system with the ghetto, it was -- they established a Judenrat, because before they do the ghetto, establish a ghetto, when they needed work, a certain -- any kind of work, they used to grab -- oh, you had already wearing -- you were wearing it, that time, already, that yellow --</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: -- oh, star, they knew you are Jewish while you still wasn’t in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2036">So you mixed with the population.</span> <span id="s2037">But when the ghetto established, that’s it, you were [indecipherable] used for -- herded there.</span> <span id="s2038">And they used to come in, the SS, and the -- the mayor, Burgermeister, and all the other re -- you know, German in the ghetto, whatever they needed at, they asked for.</span> <span id="s2039">Labor, money, gold.</span> <span id="s2040">You know, you couldn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s2041">Cameras, we -- okay, well there is no televisions, telephones, that -- it’s not allowed.</span> <span id="s2042">And they as-assigned, when you were in the ghetto, they knew how many people are in the ghetto, because if sometimes -- the reason I know that, see, my father belonged to the Judenrat, he used to tell us what’s going on.</span> <span id="s2043">Somebody died, you have to report it, less your portion, then you get le -- and you were getting portions for so many -- so many humans, so much every day.</span> <span id="s2044">Bread, then they give little sometime, not butter, margarine and sometimes little Jell-O.</span> <span id="s2045">And little those -- make soup, for instance, I don’t know, those are grain -- grain from the mill.</span> <span id="s2046">And they supposed to supply this to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2047">Now, people were c-coming out and c -- okay, you coming out, it means it’s always was a leader for the labor, or whatever, one man in charge, and you represented the group, whatever, a hundred, a thousand.</span> <span id="s2048">And coming in in the ghetto, you wa -- have to go through the -- that gate, they call it in German, schlaband, the gate, and there was a sa -- you know, a soldier [indecipherable] SS, and they watch you and check you and search you every time you come in.</span> <span id="s2049">Now, besides the barbed wire in the ghetto, they had patrols patrolling all the time.</span> <span id="s2050">And they have posts -- post, let’s see, every couple hundred to so -- or 300 feet, a post and there is look -- see in -- hi -- l -- can look, see what’s going on in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2051">That was -- this was the system in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2052">So of course it was every time you ca -- you came in, you were searched.</span> <span id="s2053">Impossible to smuggle in.</span> <span id="s2054">You couldn’t -- even they found a piece of bread -- sometimes you know, in you worked for the German, there was some -- they f -- they felt sorry for you, they g -- they’ll give you.</span> <span id="s2055">You -- you know, they throw it out so much food for the dogs there, for the cat.</span> <span id="s2056">So they’ll see us, they’ll give you a piece of bread, whatever.</span> <span id="s2057">She’ll cake -- take it home for your parents or for your sister.</span> <span id="s2058">And -- but you’re coming in sometimes they find you, they beat you up, they take it away.</span> <span id="s2059">You know, that was strict in the ghetto, so you were -- so you were locked up, locked up.</span> <span id="s2060">That’s the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2061">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: But -- but for a long time, in Pruzana, you said it was the -- the ghetto was there, but you lived beyond it and w -- and were able to come and go.</span> <span id="s2063">That would probably be at an early stage in the war.</span> <span id="s2064">So f --</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: In the -- in the A list, well, our house -- our house was outside, you know, our house was outside of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: It took a lit -- eventually you know, we had to -- we had to abandon the house --</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: And move in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: -- and go in in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2070">But we had some -- there was a group before we left, this is a group, you know Betar?</span> <span id="s2071">Belonged to organization Betar.</span> <span id="s2072">I don’t know if you heard Betar?</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: Yeah, Betar.</span> <span id="s2075">And Beryl Segal was the leader of the pe -- of my -- I belonged to Betar, my brother -- Betar.</span> <span id="s2076">He was the leader.</span> <span id="s2077">Now, he was able to get out the ghetto before the ghetto was liquidated.</span> <span id="s2078">Months before, and he went with a group of nine people that’s all belong to our group, and they went in the woods.</span> <span id="s2079">And they got contact with some peop -- you know, partisans, Russians and Polish in the woods.</span> <span id="s2080">But they were still working independently, you know, they were -- it’s -- it’s before we got incorporated there.</span> <span id="s2081">Now, this group used, once in awhile, used to come in in the ghetto, and find out and told us what is going on.</span> <span id="s2082">You stay or you had to get -- try and get some more ammunition, try and get some.</span> <span id="s2083">And a way -- and they used to come in the -- later, before the liquidation, they used to come in in the Judenrat and they knew already when it was.</span> <span id="s2084">We knew it’s -- it’s a matter of time, because the first -- the first c -- what they tr -- when they gave the order to assemble, and it wa -- and it was [indecipherable], I mentioned to my father this was in October, so this -- they [indecipherable] all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s2085">I don’t know, nobody knows the reason, it was just the same.</span> <span id="s2086">And so they used to come in and tell us what was going on.</span> <span id="s2087">But we never -- we had a problem when we came to the woods, remember I said, the worst time of all?</span> <span id="s2088">We couldn’t find them.</span> <span id="s2089">We couldn’t find them.</span> <span id="s2090">And what happened, later on when we found a c-couple, you know, a few of those Russians, partisans, they helped us and they told us about them.</span> <span id="s2091">Eventually, later on, we -- they steal -- they were already hooked up with a group Russians there, but we were still independent.</span> <span id="s2092">That’s when we had some contact.</span> <span id="s2093">We -- we knew what’s going -- what contact on the outside, and they were coming in and we were telling them, you know, what’s going on, that you know, we c -- we -- we got some medication, cert -- you know, like pills, or -- or -- and --wh-which was needed, and bandages, and -- and all, you know, for first aid, certain for first aid, in case they needed.</span> <span id="s2094">So we used to, you know we used to give it to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: It was little organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2098">I just -- I just knew that the different -- different ghettos --</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: -- had different f -- different barriers, fences, walls --</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: Yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: -- what have you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: -- now -- now, the system, they built ghettos, but if it’s smaller ghettos and a bigger ghettos.</span> <span id="s2104">Ghettos like in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: In Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: -- in Warsaw ghetto, 400, it’s -- you cannot 400,000 Jews that herded in there.</span> <span id="s2107">It’s impossible to feed 400,000 people, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s2108">Even when you smuggle in sometime, maybe they barter, it was a way.</span> <span id="s2109">We only had 12,000.</span> <span id="s2110">It was, in many occasions, you know, I know because my father s -- they used to bribe the Burgermeister, you know, the mayor of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: What the hell does he care.</span> <span id="s2113">Used to give him [indecipherable] gold.</span> <span id="s2114">Used to bribe him he should give little more flour.</span> <span id="s2115">We didn’t get bread, we got flour, and the flour mill, you know, and each one from the flour used to, sometime, bake your own bread.</span> <span id="s2116">We got rationed flour, not bread.</span> <span id="s2117">So once in awhile when it -- you could have bribed certain time, even the SS, what do they care?</span> <span id="s2118">As long as they enrich themeself.</span> <span id="s2119">You know, we give them diamonds, gold, money, whatever.</span> <span id="s2120">You let -- you let in sometimes a cow, you’ll smuggle in it -- in it.</span> <span id="s2121">It’s -- it wasn’t so strict comparison Warsaw ghetto with so many people.</span> <span id="s2122">And besides, Warsaw, we had surrounded with, you know, farmland, woods surrounding, you could smuggle in faster.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: That’s the different between small -- small ghetto -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Joseph Elman.</span> <span id="s2126">This is tape number four, side B. Le-Let me go back to June 1947, and Ellis Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: Well -- well, we were coming with that -- we arrived, I think it was the seventh, yeah, seventh of August, 1947 in Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s2128">We went through there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: Se -- it was seventh of June.</span> <span id="s2130">We -- we --</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: Oh, wait, it wa -- that -- that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: -- yeah, we do -- we’re just getting -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: -- no, June.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Yeah, seventh of June, and I know we went through there.</span> <span id="s2136">And I came from there, I came to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: Was it -- was it very exciting to you or did you pretty much take it in your stride?</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">A: Well, it was little -- it was little exciting there int -- in -- a-actually a-at -- we were told ye -- I think we are -- I don’t know if we the leader there, going through there, and it takes a little time from there to reach, isn’t it, from -- to reach New York, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: It probably does take a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: We had to register there, and then, like I told you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: What time of day would your boat come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: It was -- it was during the day.</span> <span id="s2143">Otherwise, you know, at night -- it was during the day.</span> <span id="s2144">Because I remember s -- having -- o-on the outside there was some stands with fruits and vegetables, oranges.</span> <span id="s2145">So we are -- we were trading our dollars for the oranges.</span> <span id="s2146">I don’t even reme --</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: And then you would travel to New York and get on a train --</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: I think from there -- from there we traveled to New York, I think by train, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: Could be, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: Yeah, we had to go, either by -- I had to go by train, or I’m -- I’m sure we di -- I didn’t -- we didn’t fly, we went by train or by bus.</span> <span id="s2151">This is something I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: I remember -- I remember coming to New York and they brought us a certain spot there in New York and my cousin’s supposed to -- my cousin’s supposed to pick us up in New York.</span> <span id="s2154">And somehow I missed him and I took a train to Syracuse and I came to Syracuse.</span> <span id="s2155">Then he came over to Syracuse, he was laughing.</span> <span id="s2156">How did you -- how did you -- how did you get to the train, I don’t know, I just got to the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: And -- and right away they had fixed up accommodation for you in Syracuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: Well, ye-yeah, well, we came -- I came first.</span> <span id="s2159">My brother came, I think, three months later because the [indecipherable] child.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: And the wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: And the wife.</span> <span id="s2162">And yeah, I came, and it was arranged.</span> <span id="s2163">I -- it was arranged.</span> <span id="s2164">I think the first thing, I stayed with a -- a -- a old woman.</span> <span id="s2165">This is my uncle.</span> <span id="s2166">She c -- you know, she gave me a room, and -- and meals til -- for a little while.</span> <span id="s2167">Then when my brother and my sister and the child arrived, then we got apartment near -- in the Jewish section there, apartment, and I stayed -- I -- I stayed with -- you know, with my brother or my sister-in-law til -- this was -- yeah, I -- I s -- I stayed with them all the time til I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: That would seem --</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: Then -- yeah, I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s2170">And then, when I got married already, then the first -- the first night we rented -- we rented.</span> <span id="s2171">It was a furnished apartment.</span> <span id="s2172">And we stayed there for a couple years, and then I remember we applied -- there was a ap-apart this -- there was a apartment building, but it was hard to get into that bu -- you know, those years you had the big waiting list and I th -- I don’t know, I think we had to pay a little money under to get in.</span> <span id="s2173">And fi -- this was a nice -- this is already -- this is after you have to -- marriage, and we stayed there for -- in this -- in this place for quite a few year til the parents -- when her parents came to any -- from New York.</span> <span id="s2174">Then we bought a two family house and we stayed that time together.</span> <span id="s2175">It is -- probably it was in the f -- middle 50’s.</span> <span id="s2176">Got married 1950, five or six year later they came, they settled, sold the business in New York and they settled in Syracuse.</span> <span id="s2177">So it was easy for the children, my mother-in-law, you know, helping u -- he-help -- helped to raise the children, it was easy for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2179">Nice for both generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: Firs -- were there -- in your years in America, have there been foods that you’ve loved to have that reminded you of childhood?</span> <span id="s2182">I mean, were -- were there -- were there sausages or sweets or something that you would have had a child that your wife would indulge you with?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: Spec-Special food?</span> <span id="s2184">Oh, s -- well, actu-actually, in the beginning, see, my sister-in-law, she used to cook, you know, like she used to cook the same thing, while being in the [indecipherable] in Feldafing and the other one, and steal all the old European type cooking, yeah.</span> <span id="s2185">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s2186">And I’m still -- took me a long, long time to get used to it, especially to the Italian -- you know, you go in Italian restaurant?</span> <span id="s2187">Meatballs and spaghetti, we didn’t have that, or -- or your co -- what else, your [indecipherable] you got the -- from -- the chicken parmesan and the veal parmesan.</span> <span id="s2188">That’s good now, I like it.</span> <span id="s2189">I like it, it’s good.</span> <span id="s2190">So I’m -- I’m learning.</span> <span id="s2191">You know, when my wife was sick, I was learning a little cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: So, not fancy, but I know how to, you know, broil fish and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: -- broil hamburgers, and chicken.</span> <span id="s2196">You buy now a chicken, you don’t have to cook.</span> <span id="s2197">You buy all broiled, roasted chicken.</span> <span id="s2198">Here it’s easy.</span> <span id="s2199">Here is very easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: Well, you make me think now about gender issues and ways in which -- you know when we were talking hours ago about your father and I was wondering if there was a -- a different burden on him because he was a man, and I w -- I was thinking of a gender difference, that as the head of the family, would he have felt even more devastated by the fact that he couldn’t save his family.</span> <span id="s2201">I mean, I just wonder if a male f --</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">A: Well, you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: -- felt worse about things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: -- it -- it’s -- it’s actually, it was a big shock to us.</span> <span id="s2205">We never believed that, but you see, he made up his mind, he told us he made up his mind that he’s not going to go and see, because we -- til the last, you know, even til the last minute, we weren’t -- I -- I -- we weren’t told, because the first night we tried to go through, and th -- I remember the order it came, that you have to get ready in the morning, this and this date, and that’s all that’s allowed to take each one a backpack and be ready.</span> <span id="s2206">In the center of the city was a farm -- farmer’s -- farmer’s market.</span> <span id="s2207">You know, like over here you have those -- you got malls, there was a hundred stores in one building, big.</span> <span id="s2208">The farmers used to come down, sell their products, and used to buy.</span> <span id="s2209">Each store had, you know, pharmacies, you name it, and groceries and -- and all that.</span> <span id="s2210">Tobacco products.</span> <span id="s2211">And so everybody was, you know, everybody c -- but was a question, the -- you didn’t really say what, where you gonna go, they say you’re gonna be transported.</span> <span id="s2212">Never forget.</span> <span id="s2213">You’ll be transported, and you’re going to be working.</span> <span id="s2214">But they didn’t say where, what.</span> <span id="s2215">What [indecipherable] they probably didn’t know -- you know, those local police, whatever.</span> <span id="s2216">They probably knew, or maybe didn’t know, because -- you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s2217">In -- I don’t think all the Germans knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: I don’t know if they told them from the top command.</span> <span id="s2220">All they heard, you gotta, you know, get them ready, they’re going to be shipped.</span> <span id="s2221">But about all this -- you know, pregnant women, sick, elderly, children, and you would s -- they going to be placed?</span> <span id="s2222">They won’t be able to work, I mean, you got [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2223">Oh, they gonna -- I mean, they used to tell this story, but people believed that.</span> <span id="s2224">People believed that -- some, I don’t know if all, because you could never believe, you know, that human beings, to a -- you -- you [indecipherable] yeah, I mean planning and it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: -- it’s -- it’s planned, a planned destruction, an annihilation of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: It was too awful to be believed, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: I mean -- I mean, those year, you heard, you know, certain things.</span> <span id="s2229">At ch -- how can you, you know, there’s so many, how can you kill so many people?</span> <span id="s2230">It’s impossible, we never in history heard s -- s -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: -- atrocities like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: Anyway, it may not have been -- I was just thinking of the roles of men and women and whether they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">A: Yeah, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: -- felt things differently and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: So, that’s th -- see, and he made up, you know, I tol -- I told you, he -- he -- he draw a map and he told us, he says [indecipherable] boys, even if you get out, you gotta go through such a, you know -- I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">Q: He couldn’t see hope for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: No hope.</span> <span id="s2239">He says, you couldn't -- hostile territory.</span> <span id="s2240">If you not gonna get caught, you gonna get caught here.</span> <span id="s2241">And you know what he says?</span> <span id="s2242">That’s all they have to do, to pull down your pants.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: And they’ll know who you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: And they’ll know who you
