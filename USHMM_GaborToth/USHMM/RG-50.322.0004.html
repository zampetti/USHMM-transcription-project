of textiles, spinneries, I mean, where they got the yarn and also rubber bands quite a bit</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: And do you know how or when your family came to that city?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Well my family originally came from another part of Germany, the Maifeld region near Koblenz and Mayen.</span> <span id="s27">I don’t know whether you know these towns or not.</span> <span id="s28">In fact my parents were cousins and my father was born in Munstermaifeld which is a small city and my mother was born in Polch which is a small overgrown village and you could walk it in an hour and fifteen minutes, the distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What did they do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: My father was a typesetter and hand

then he went to Elberfeld after eight.</span> <span id="s36">Besides later on in life when he had already bought him home he also did beauty care and such for animal, I mean dogs.</span> <span id="s37">And I mean trimming and clipping ears and all this kind of stuff that goes with it, so he had a sideline to supplement his income.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: And he did this as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s40">In fact I had to help him sometimes to hold the dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: And were they very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Uh, my mother was somehow religious.</span> <span id="s43">My father was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: He didn’t go to temple?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Did your mother send you?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: I went to Hebrew school in preparation to be bar mitzvah and I was bar mitzvah against my own will because I was dead set against it.</span> <span id="s48">I had a difference of opinion with our Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s49">I resented his favoring the children of the rich people and I told him off in class and walked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: That sounds just like my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: I walked out on him.</span> <span id="s52">I said I wasn’t coming back and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s53">I had to be coaxed by the cantor, you know, that I be prepared for bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s54">I didn’t want to be bar mitzvah at that time, you know.</span> <span id="s55">So, I got bar mitzvah and I used to know how to read.</span> <span id="s56">I made it my purpose to forget all about it and I can’t read anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did your father want you to be bar mitzvah?</span> <span id="s58">Was…</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Uh, that was more like my mother more than anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I had one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Was she older or younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: She was just less than a year younger -- or older.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: And did anybody else live in your house with you, grandparents or aunts or uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s66">No family members.</span> <span id="s67">We had tenants.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: You had tenants?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Did you live in an apartment building?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: No, no, we owned a private home, but the upstairs was divided into apartments and we had three tenants.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Do you remember what they were like at all, were -- or did they change all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No they didn’t change too often, but there were about 40 people let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s74">All gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Were they men-gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yeah, gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Usually men or couples?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: They were families.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: What languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: German only.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: No other languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No other languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Your parents didn’t practice or learn in school any other languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Did you at all?</span> <span id="s86">Learn in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Did you learn in school, any languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: What was your social standing?</span> <span id="s91">Did you think of yourself as a little richer than everyone else or a little poorer?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Just average –</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: We were a family of the laboring class, working family.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: And did your parents have any Jewish friends or any gentile friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: No.</span> <span id="s97">Almost exclusive gentile friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: And so they were pretty much assimilated into –</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: They didn’t live in a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Did they go to any social events at the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: My mother used to attend services and my sister sometime would go.</span> <span id="s104">It was the male part of the family didn’t show much interest in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: That’s interesting because usually the women didn’t go and the men did.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: So that was the opposite.</span> <span id="s108">Did they belong to groups, then, outside the synagogue?</span> <span id="s109">Did they belong to clubs or –</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s111">My father was very interested in dog breeding, racing, and my mother used to have all kinds of fowl for hobbies.</span> <span id="s112">I mean chickens, geese and ducks, and turkeys -- all this stuff -- and used to join organizations that way, I mean.</span> <span id="s113">In fact, he used to raise prize-winning Pomeranians.</span> <span id="s114">Had a house full of silver cups and all this stuff and personally when I was growing up, I belonged to the Socialist Labor Youth.</span> <span id="s115">I was a Socialist.</span> <span id="s116">I’m still a Social Democrat by heart and so was my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: That was a little risky wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: I was very active and later on I joined the Reichbanner which was the Socialist militia and I was well known and that’s why later on things began to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s120">When you were young did your parents go to the theater or to concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Once in a while yes.</span> <span id="s122">I mean I used to go to variety performances with my dad and so on.</span> <span id="s123">I used to go to see it sometimes.</span> <span id="s124">See some of the operettas.</span> <span id="s125">Operas – I could never understand what they were singing about even in German.</span> <span id="s126">Operettas, yes, I mean “Fledermaus” and “The Merry Widow,” something like that.</span> <span id="s127">And we had the necessary supply of records of the orchestra music.</span> <span id="s128">And my father used to raise canaries.</span> <span id="s129">When it comes to animals we like ‘em all.</span> <span id="s130">And my grandparents lived in the country, both sides, they usually had cows and horses and that was a joy to me.</span> <span id="s131">I used to make pets out of the horse or the cows.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: So your childhood -- In your childhood you were pretty much surrounded by animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s134">On the average we had about a dozen dogs.</span> <span id="s135">I mean we were breeding anyhow, and one or more cats.</span> <span id="s136">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And do you remember very much about your childhood before you started school?</span> <span id="s138">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Uh, not much.</span> <span id="s140">I spent part of my really early youth with my grandparents --World War I. See I went to school at my grandparent’s home until I was almost close to 8, I mean, one or more years of school there because they had something to eat and there was nothing to eat in the city.</span> <span id="s141">In fact my sister and I were split up.</span> <span id="s142">My sister was with my grandparents on my mother’s side, and I was with the grandparents on my father’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: So that was for economic reasons because they…</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Because there was no food in the city.</span> <span id="s145">World War I, in the aftermath, yes.</span> <span id="s146">I was about 8 years old when I came back home and started to go to school in my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: And what year was that when you came back home, when you were 8?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Well, now, let’s figure it out.</span> <span id="s149">8 years -- I was about 8 years old.</span> <span id="s150">That was about ’21, 1921 or ’22, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: OK, let’s see and then when you came back -- well, when you were with your grandparents were you in public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yeah, in fact in the city where I was with my grandparents they didn’t have any real public school, they had a seminary school where the seminary students like interns taught in their last years of their education.</span> <span id="s153">We had a different teacher each hour.</span> <span id="s154">Almost -- it was a good school, yes, and in fact the teachers were not allowed to lay hands on us.</span> <span id="s155">If we misbehaved we stand in the aisle and the -- I don’t know what they called him, the name.</span> <span id="s156">The guy who was in charge of the church.</span> <span id="s157">Not the priest.</span> <span id="s158">Used to come every hour around and ask, “What did this one do?</span> <span id="s159">What did that one” -- and he used to beat the devil out of us.</span> <span id="s160">Oh, yeah, I’ll never forget his name.</span> <span id="s161">He used to do a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: So he could spank you, but not…</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: I got it only once, that was enough.</span> <span id="s164">He used to use the hickory stick you use to hang the sausage in the smokehouse with so -- very effective.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s167">So I went to school there for almost two years and then came home and then I started going to public school.</span> <span id="s168">Well, I was a fire redhead and very quick- tempered and consequently at school I did not tolerate a female teacher to spank me and I found that I changed schools.</span> <span id="s169">Oh, I got nasty grades, too, on account of it, because when she put me over her knee, I had a safety pin in my lapel and I used it.</span> <span id="s170">She didn’t attempt to spank me anymore, so.</span> <span id="s171">Then I switched to a school which was free of that action and that was a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s172">I think, or whatever, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s173">Anyways there I was alright.</span> <span id="s174">I used to fight, I mean, I was short, but I could fight.</span> <span id="s175">Consequently, I got along.</span> <span id="s176">Somebody call me a dirty Jew, I’d slap their face before I even knew it.</span> <span id="s177">The fight was on.</span> <span id="s178">Or any name.</span> <span id="s179">So I went through school and as far as qualification was concerned I never had any problems with the subjects.</span> <span id="s180">I was always among the leaders.</span> <span id="s181">I used to have competition for a prize where composition was concerned or math I was among the first three at all times and after that my father wanted to send me to higher education, but I was afraid of my dad.</span> <span id="s182">I figured, if I flunk it once he’ll beat the living daylights out of me.</span> <span id="s183">Because when he found out I got a spanking at school, I got another one at home.</span> <span id="s184">That’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s185">So I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s186">So I became apprenticed plumbing and tinning for four years, took my exam.</span> <span id="s187">I’m a journeyman plumber and tinner.</span> <span id="s188">I still have my diploma.</span> <span id="s189">Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: How old were you when you started your apprenticeship?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: I left school when I was fourteen.</span> <span id="s192">I mean that’s the usual time over there.</span> <span id="s193">That’s when you’re done with grade school.</span> <span id="s194">Now, there when I was apprenticed I also attended the occupational school one day a week and took additional courses in mechanical drawings and such.</span> <span id="s195">In other words, I got a complete education as a plumber and tinner including copper spinning.</span> <span id="s196">I mean I still can do it, but the thing is that my first master -- we had a difference of opinion.</span> <span id="s197">I didn’t want to work overtime and he fired me so I got a second master to finish my apprenticeship and I got fired from him because he cheated me out of part of my wages.</span> <span id="s198">I got paid for the first year instead of getting the second and third year apprenticeship, so the minute I got done with the third year I got fired, naturally and I was unemployed.</span> <span id="s199">In fact I did my pieces for the exam in another man’s shop.</span> <span id="s200">Alright, so I was unemployed for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Uh, let’s -- go back to your public school years.</span> <span id="s202">Was there a lot of anti-Semitism in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Uh, not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: You weren’t treated…</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Every once in a while you were called a dirty Jew and that’s when the fight started, I mean, I used to beat the hell out of ‘em.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Just the other students, then, no-teachers didn’t…</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: No teachers, no, no, you didn’t feel it especially in the school without religion.</span> <span id="s208">It was a more Socialistic direction and we got along fine and besides that I used to fight so well that if someone were foolish enough and we got into each other and realized we were an even match then we became friends.</span> <span id="s209">Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: And then during your apprenticeship were you apprenticed mostly to gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Only.</span> <span id="s212">Exclusively.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And they never treated you badly?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: No.</span> <span id="s215">Oh, my second boss, he made a mistake once, he slapped me once and he never repeated that because I threw a piece of equipment at him and missed him.</span> <span id="s216">If I wouda hit him it wouda killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Oh, boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Like I said.</span> <span id="s219">I was quick tempered.</span> <span id="s220">And I just warned him that he better never do it again.</span> <span id="s221">He never tried it.</span> <span id="s222">No, uh, then I was unemployed after my apprenticeship was up and drew unemployment compensation which wasn’t very much.</span> <span id="s223">Any rate the fifth of March, 19833, was the last so-called legal election…</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: How old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Well, uh, let’s see 1933.</span> <span id="s226">I was 20 years old.</span> <span id="s227">They broke into my parents’ home to come and get me.</span> <span id="s228">But before that they once threw a bomb in the house that went off and I slept right through it.</span> <span id="s229">Yeah.</span> <span id="s230">We lived on the main floor, but I was sleeping on the third floor.</span> <span id="s231">I never heard it.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Now why did they know you?</span> <span id="s233">You said you were well known.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Because I was active as a member of the Socialist Labor Youth and also later on with the Reichbanner which is the Socialist militia.</span> <span id="s235">Each party had their own militia.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: When did you join the militia?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: When I was about 14 years old.</span> <span id="s238">Something like that -- 15.</span> <span id="s239">I also was a member of the labor union.</span> <span id="s240">I was active.</span> <span id="s241">So, at any rate, the fifth of March, they broke into the house -- they’re coming for me.</span> <span id="s242">And I went out he back fence into my neighbor’s place which was a restaurant and a bowling alley, and that woman politely opened the doors for the storm troopers to come and get me.</span> <span id="s243">And they come in, they surrounded me, one of them laid the, uh, hit me with the rubber truncheon across my chest and later I had blisters under the skin.</span> <span id="s244">At any rate -- and then started to lead me out and the minute I was out the door I threw my arms around -- I used to be strong -- threw them aside and started running zigzag at first, but they were getting too close and they were firing at me, but they were getting too close and then I abandoned zigzagging and ran straight.</span> <span id="s245">I got hit in the lung because I spit blood.</span> <span id="s246">I knew it was my lung and a little later on I got shot in the knee, but I could still run and I got to the police station.</span> <span id="s247">And at that time they were not formed as member of the political party and there I asked them which hospital to go to, because I knew which one of them was fair and they called an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital.</span> <span id="s248">And I spent four years-weeks in the hospital and while there I had a brace on my leg up to my seat and I used to take that darn thing off and go to the bathroom and that made my knee swell up again and they had to apply it again for a while longer.</span> <span id="s249">At any rate, when I was released from there -- it was a Catholic hospital.</span> <span id="s250">They were very good to us.</span> <span id="s251">The Nazis, they were not allowed to come in, so, uh, I mean, just to show you something -- you see that one?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: That’s the bullet hole.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Right there by your kneecap.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: It just grazed my kneecap.</span> <span id="s256">It didn’t, uh, bother it.</span> <span id="s257">However, I still maintain a high sensitivity over here (indicates the area where the bullet existed on the outside of his left leg.)</span> <span id="s258">In fact, for a year, I couldn’t stand a sheet on my leg.</span> <span id="s259">I had to sleep with my leg stuck out.</span> <span id="s260">Well, so the day I was released -- the same morning I took off on a bike and started visiting all my relatives.</span> <span id="s261">I had some in Cologne.</span> <span id="s262">I had some in, uh, Munchen-Gladbach and I was heading toward my grandparents in Munstermaifeld, visited all of them, kept on going, and procured some spending money by knocking on a Jewish family’s door, so, uh, in Jewish they say a schnorer.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">(Both laugh)</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: I know the meaning.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Because I had to have some money, see, I did that for a while and I stayed with a relative in a small place, Kaisersesh, I mean, not too far from the (near Kochem on the Mosel.)</span> <span id="s266">And then I decided to move on and I worked my way into the Saar Basin.</span> <span id="s267">On the border I got rid of my bike and I smuggled across the border without a passport.</span> <span id="s268">Hell, I never had one in my life ‘til I came to this country.</span> <span id="s269">Then…</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: What border did you cross?</span> <span id="s271">Into what country?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Uh, the Saar Basin was separate.</span> <span id="s273">I mean the French were occupying that after World War I and you had to cross the border at night.</span> <span id="s274">So I got into the Saar Basin.</span> <span id="s275">I had to work my way down to the French border and in Forbach I went to the police station there.</span> <span id="s276">I mean a Jewish organization and they referred me to the police station -- now wait a minute.</span> <span id="s277">Back, back, back.</span> <span id="s278">I went to the Sheriff’s station down in – is your, are you running out?</span> <span id="s279">– Anyway, I forget now, I can’t think of the name of that place down there, oh, in Saar Basin I went to the Jewish help station and they referred -- told me where to cross the border into France.</span> <span id="s280">I mean, you have to walk across.</span> <span id="s281">At nighttime I walked across and that night I spent in the woods.</span> <span id="s282">The next day I went to the foreign office.</span> <span id="s283">The foreign office which was in the police station in Forbach.</span> <span id="s284">It was French.</span> <span id="s285">Still is.</span> <span id="s286">And there I got a so-called passpartout instead of a passport which allowed me to be a political refugee.</span> <span id="s287">I was political because they knew my whole story.</span> <span id="s288">And then they shipped me off to Metz and in Metz I got asked, “Would you like to go to Paris?”</span> <span id="s289">Now Paris was like a magnet, you know.</span> <span id="s290">The city of lights.</span> <span id="s291">Naturally I wanted to go to Paris.</span> <span id="s292">So, fine, first we nearly starved to death because we got down, I think it was a Saturday there.</span> <span id="s293">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s294">Yeah, we had to wait for the Sabbath was over before they fed us.</span> <span id="s295">At any rate, the next day we had to go to welfare to get a ticket, and the ticket was as big as a legal paper, to go to Paris, but in Paris we were referred to the Jewish HIAS and report there which, uh, provided us with a place to stay and meal tickets.</span> <span id="s296">Oh, it sounded so good.</span> <span id="s297">They gave us lodging at the palais de peuple that’s how they present it, “people’s palace.”</span> <span id="s298">You know what it was?</span> <span id="s299">Salvation Army.</span> <span id="s300">Yeah, Salvation Army.</span> <span id="s301">Well, we got over there, we had a cubicle there and one meal a day.</span> <span id="s302">I nearly starved to death.</span> <span id="s303">Besides I was a heavy smoker and I was running out of money.</span> <span id="s304">I used to sell some of the meal tickets to buy tobacco.</span> <span id="s305">Well I stayed there.</span> <span id="s306">Then they moved us from there -- Salvation Army -- to a Kasern on the perimeter of Paris.</span> <span id="s307">No, first they moved us outside of, I can’t think of the name anymore -- not too far from the side of the Seine, in Kaserns, and then they tried to ship us into the south of France as agricultural workers.</span> <span id="s308">And I’m not gonna go, I told them, I got a trade.</span> <span id="s309">So they shipped us back into town, I mean the ones who didn’t want to go and we were in a cecern n the boulevard.</span> <span id="s310">I was in one for a while and then later on into a small pension/hotel combined in town -- one meal a day.</span> <span id="s311">I nearly starved to death.</span> <span id="s312">So I started working as a plumber without permit.</span> <span id="s313">You need a work permit in France.</span> <span id="s314">Just for meals.</span> <span id="s315">There were some huge restaurants there and they had some plumbing to do so we did it.</span> <span id="s316">Any rate, after I’d been there nine months in Paris, that was the heavy season of the year, I got tired of starving.</span> <span id="s317">I mean one meal a day.</span> <span id="s318">I lost weight.</span> <span id="s319">I went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s320">Which wasn’t -- I mean back to the south.</span> <span id="s321">I just went back to my relatives.</span> <span id="s322">And they didn’t like the idea, when I wanted to go back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: When did you go back, what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: I was certified a political refugee, I mean, it seems like a fool.</span> <span id="s325">I went -- I got shot, and so on.</span> <span id="s326">I went back in ’34.</span> <span id="s327">That was in ’33 when I went over and in ’34 I went back and I bummed around from one relative to the other, when my parents wrote me when it would be safe and to come back.</span> <span id="s328">Be alright.</span> <span id="s329">Well, now we were corresponding under an assumed name.</span> <span id="s330">I mean they never knew my address.</span> <span id="s331">It used to be, uh, whatever they call it, poste restante.</span> <span id="s332">You know that system?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Well, in Europe you can -- in other words, it’s a post office box anybody can use.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Poste restante means “resting mail,” you know, it rests until you pick it up.</span> <span id="s337">So we used to correspond that way.</span> <span id="s338">I never had a return address or anything.</span> <span id="s339">I just -- where they sent it to the poste restante.</span> <span id="s340">So then, after much hesitation, I mean, first off I went to some of my relatives and the first time I got there for a Friday evening meal I couldn’t hold it.</span> <span id="s341">I was down to ninety-five pounds.</span> <span id="s342">I was sicker than a dog.</span> <span id="s343">I was half starved.</span> <span id="s344">At any rate, I bummed around and eventually I went back home and I didn’t feel so good coming back, but they left us alone and I was drawing unemployment insurance.</span> <span id="s345">Things were not very well, I mean, but you weren’t bothered too much.</span> <span id="s346">They came out with one decree after another, quite a few decrees to limit your movements.</span> <span id="s347">You were not allowed to have -- I used to have a motorcycle which I had -- my father sold later on.</span> <span id="s348">And you weren’t allowed this and that, and at any rate, I saw an ad in the paper -- somebody wanted a plumber and tinner -- and I went and applied, but I told him right away, “Now I want you to know that I’m Jewish.”</span> <span id="s349">And that man told me, “I don’t have any city orders.</span> <span id="s350">It doesn’t make a bit of difference to me.”</span> <span id="s351">And I offered to work for him for one week, if he wouldn’t be satisfied, he wouldn’t have to pay me, because I knew my trade, and so he took me on and I got paid after a week and I worked there until papers came through from my relatives here signed for me to go to the States.</span> <span id="s352">I quit the job.</span> <span id="s353">And I got out…</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Uh, ’37.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: And you’d been communicating with your relatives here about coming to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yeah, but they only signed for me, not for the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Did the rest of your family -- they didn’t want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: They perished.</span> <span id="s360">No, they perished.</span> <span id="s361">They didn’t sign the papers for them and that’s one thing I still hold against my aunt who is still alive.</span> <span id="s362">She’s 96 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Did -- and your -- did your parents want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Sure, they wanted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Why didn’t she, uh…</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: (shrugs) They had enough money to do it, believe me.</span> <span id="s367">They had -- at that time I didn’t speak English, but I saw they had $100,000 there, in real estate there, and all this stuff.</span> <span id="s368">So that is something I -- inside of me I still hold against them because I was young and I was able and ready to work.</span> <span id="s369">I would have supported them.</span> <span id="s370">So, uh, at any rate, I went back and I worked for the man.</span> <span id="s371">I had letters of recommendation and all.</span> <span id="s372">So I came over here and I didn’t speak the language, I had about 2 or 3 hours of lessons in English.</span> <span id="s373">In the meantime, I had learned enough French in Paris that I got along very well.</span> <span id="s374">In fact I took my wife back twice, I mean the first time we went to Paris -- we spent last October -- we spent 18 days in Paris and I didn’t have any trouble.</span> <span id="s375">I speak about 70% French, but when it comes to grammar, forget it.</span> <span id="s376">Uh, I said it unintentionally, the French word grammar.</span> <span id="s377">But I am not that good.</span> <span id="s378">I talk okay.</span> <span id="s379">I know it, however, I can converse and, uh, get along.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Did you meet your wife in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No, right here.</span> <span id="s382">She’s a native Daytonian.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Oh, really.</span> <span id="s384">So, how old were you when you came over, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: I was twenty-two years old, around there.</span> <span id="s386">I came in ’37, I was -- no, I was 23.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Now let’s go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s388">In 1930 it was beginning -- to -- anti-Semitism was beginni9ng to increase…</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Well, at that time, it wasn’t so bad, I mean, you had the storm troopers building up.</span> <span id="s390">I mean, you were living in Kaserns and so on.</span> <span id="s391">They had demonstration marches that they marched and so on, they used to have their nasty songs already, but at that time I was active on the other side and at times the Communists and Socialists combined to fight the Fascists.</span> <span id="s392">In fact, before, we beat the hell out of them a couple of times they were not even allowed to show their uniform.</span> <span id="s393">I mean the uniform was forbidden for a while.</span> <span id="s394">Hitler attempted to come one to Wuppertal, but he realized that was too dangerous for him.</span> <span id="s395">My hometown was red and Renscheidt.</span> <span id="s396">I mentioned before, was red also.</span> <span id="s397">They had mined the place where he was supposed to speak.</span> <span id="s398">I mean my hometown was always more socialist or communist than anything else.</span> <span id="s399">So he changed his mind and he arrived in Dusseldorf he didn’t come to Wuppertal.</span> <span id="s400">Goebbels was raised with Catholic money in my hometown, and educated with Catholic money.</span> <span id="s401">And he was hated like poison, too.</span> <span id="s402">The Nazi movement was starting, and they were gaining more and more votes during the elections and it kept building up from ’30 to ’33 when the old man who practically was in his second childhood turned over the government to Hitler as the chancellor and that’s when they came with the so-called law, to give him power and they start out outlawing the opposition parties.</span> <span id="s403">When they set the Reichstag on fire and blamed that poor Dutchman and killed him for it and all these subterfuges.</span> <span id="s404">Then they outlawed all the opposition parties.</span> <span id="s405">After the election of 5th of March, 1933, they came with the so-called auxiliary police who were nothing but storm troopers carrying weapons.</span> <span id="s406">They went on the rampage taking revenge.</span> <span id="s407">They killed one of my friends.</span> <span id="s408">They were doing this in his own doorway, they shot him to death.</span> <span id="s409">I don’t know whether it will be worthwhile mentioning the name or not.</span> <span id="s410">I’ve forgotten his first name but his last name was Ziegfried Laufer.</span> <span id="s411">In his parent’s home they shot him to death, I mean, in the doorway.</span> <span id="s412">And that’s the same way they came after me, they were gonna take revenge, they were gonna kill me and I knew that and I’d rather get shot to death than beaten to death.</span> <span id="s413">I had that choice.</span> <span id="s414">No!</span> <span id="s415">Uh, ask a question.</span> <span id="s416">It may be more pertinent.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: I guess what I’m wondering is, was that -- was it in 1933 or so that you began to feel that your political activities were not going to be able to stand up against the Nazi party?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Well they were outlawed then.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Yeah, and that was when you began to think about just leaving instead of fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Well, I always had the notion to go to the ‘States.</span> <span id="s421">You see over there everybody thinks the gold lays in the street, you just bend over and pick it up.</span> <span id="s422">Well, it isn’t so, you work for it.</span> <span id="s423">But freedom and everything else -- it wasn’t as much -- I mean originally my plan as you were asking refers to my telling him that he would have lived a very different life if the rise of the Nazi party had not forced him to leave his homeland was very simple.</span> <span id="s424">I was a journeyman.</span> <span id="s425">The next step would have been the master exam.</span> <span id="s426">We had a place where I would have had my shop, already, it was an addition to the house that was planned, but due to all this business then and stopping bullets and so on I was more tempted to leave and go to the ‘States.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: So that was a thought that had been in the back of your mind…</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s429">Yes.</span> <span id="s430">And then they signed the papers there was no holding me then.</span> <span id="s431">Get ready, get all the -- get the passport and so on, get all the permits and clearances and I felt a sign of relief when I was aboard ship, it was an American ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: And that was 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: That was 1933 when I left Germ -- I arrived in the States on February 27th and I could even give you the date when I -- we left Hamburg, because I got the old passport yet.</span> <span id="s434">I don’t recall right now off-hand how long it took, but we left the tenth or 12th.</span> <span id="s435">I don’t know it took that long to come over.</span> <span id="s436">I came on the President Roosevelt which was later sold to the British government and was sank in World War II.</span> <span id="s437">It had a sister ship, too, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: So, you arrived in the United States Feb…</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: 27th.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: 19…</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: ’37, yeah.</span> <span id="s442">And I stayed overnight in New York with a relative of mine.</span> <span id="s443">I had a cousin there and an aunt and then the next day, practically, on the bus, I came to Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Why did you come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Because the aunt who signed the papers for me was living in Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: And what about was her age at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: At that time?</span> <span id="s448">Well, now, let’s see.</span> <span id="s449">This was ’37 that makes it 47 years ago .</span> <span id="s450">at that time I was 23 and she is 96 now.</span> <span id="s451">Then, how we gonna figure that out?</span> <span id="s452">Well, she was about 42 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: And was she married?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: And you moved in with them at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Uh, I stayed with them until I started making the marvelous sum of 12 dollars a week and then I moved out and I rented a room On Cambridge Avenue.</span> <span id="s457">I, uh, they got me a job as an errand boy, an apprentice in an optical place, I mean, as optician.</span> <span id="s458">I became the errand boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: What was the name of the company?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: It was the Valley optical company.</span> <span id="s461">It was owned by Dr. Le Montree.</span> <span id="s462">Maybe that name has shown up here, who had three nephews who he put through school, and they were all optometrists and the second one passed away not too long ago.</span> <span id="s463">They were the Slutsky brothers, there’s a younger one yet, Jerome, yah.</span> <span id="s464">I became an optician, I mean, a benchman.</span> <span id="s465">That means you cut lenses.</span> <span id="s466">I mean, you, uh, you pick out the lens you need for the prescription, like, they hand you the prescription, mark ‘em and cut ‘em in a machine that grind the edges and drill holes in them if necessary or bevel them on the machine and put ‘em in a frame, Or-I know you can’t see without your glasses.</span> <span id="s467">I can see that, too.</span> <span id="s468">I can tell what prescription you have.</span> <span id="s469">You are very near-sighted.</span> <span id="s470">I can tell by looking at you.</span> <span id="s471">So you learn that and you don’t forget anymore.</span> <span id="s472">So I worked there until I, uh-oh, by the way, I forgot to say when they reestablished the compulsory service in the military in Germany I had to muster.</span> <span id="s473">And the same day when I had to go muster I spit out the bullet which was in my lung.</span> <span id="s474">They couldn’t remove it.</span> <span id="s475">I spit it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Isn’t that something.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: It worked up.</span> <span id="s478">I still have it.</span> <span id="s479">It was a 32 caliber.</span> <span id="s480">So, I mustered and I was found qualified, however, they would not take any Jewish citizens.</span> <span id="s481">And when I came to this country when the draft came I had to muster again and I was found qualified and my boss, a man by the name of Gordon Krauss -- I don’t know whether he’s still alive or not.</span> <span id="s482">He should be a little older than I am, I don’t know if he’s still alive.</span> <span id="s483">Well, he applied for deferment and I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s484">One way I thought I was missing something, the other way I thought I didn’t care, so he kept getting them one after another and suddenly there was no more deferment and in my job he was going to replace me with two women, not just one -- two of ‘em.</span> <span id="s485">So in ’42 I had my choice, they asked me whether I was ready or willing to bear arms for this country because I wasn’t a citizen yet.</span> <span id="s486">I had taken my citizen course and all this stuff, in fact I was becoming close to becoming a citizen -- five years.</span> <span id="s487">So I came over here with the idea of staying and also you can’t just take, you have to give and so I thought “Yes I’m ready, I guess,” so I was in the service and I was drafted.</span> <span id="s488">It didn’t take too long to become corporal and I was an optician -- I tried to get in the medical corps, but, uh, you know the army selection -- they call so many names off the roster and “step over there” and some more names and “step over there.”</span> <span id="s489">I ended up in the signal corps.</span> <span id="s490">I became a wire chief eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: I’d like to ask you something, to just go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s492">I’ve talked to a few people and listened to some interviews and it seems very common that people who had skills in Europe came here and ended up in very different professions.</span> <span id="s493">Now, how is it that a plumber becomes an optician?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: I tell you why.</span> <span id="s495">When I attempted to approach plumbing enterprises, including Jewish ones I was told, “Well, it’s unionized, and you’d have to start as an apprentice again.”</span> <span id="s496">And you know what I told ‘em then.</span> <span id="s497">I mean, I don’t want to go into details, but I had no intention of being apprentice for four years again.</span> <span id="s498">That’s why I didn’t follow my trade.</span> <span id="s499">And without bragging I knew my trade and I still can do my trade, but I’m not interested.</span> <span id="s500">Now, like in this house, I took out all the galvanized pipe and replaced it with copper.</span> <span id="s501">I don’t need anybody else to do it for me.</span> <span id="s502">No, that’s the reason why I didn’t follow this trade.</span> <span id="s503">Now, I was working there and I never was one to do job-hopping from one to the other, so I stayed with them and eventually I was making a decent wage, too.</span> <span id="s504">So then Uncle Sam wanted me worse than the boss and I was in the service and I went in and within six months or so I was a corporal and it didn’t take much longer to become a sergeant, too.</span> <span id="s505">I was in the signal corps, I mean, I must have done alright in school, I mean, uh, you know, school.</span> <span id="s506">Went overseas as a buck sergeant.</span> <span id="s507">Overseas eventually I applied for military government or counter-intelligence and I ended up in counter-intelligence.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Uh, where were you first when you went overseas?</span> <span id="s509">What country did they send you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Well, we landed in England and we flew to France and then I was a member of a flying detachment that looked for German equipment.</span> <span id="s511">I was as far as Dresden in the Ural -- in the, uh, I don’t know what kind of mountains over there looking for German equipment and I specialized -- I was a member of the Air Force then.</span> <span id="s512">They had a landing system which was better than ours.</span> <span id="s513">We used a gyro for each function and they had one gyro for all of ‘em.</span> <span id="s514">The for -- Foreigncare system I think it was called.</span> <span id="s515">I forgot.</span> <span id="s516">At any rate we went after that and the Russians were already there.</span> <span id="s517">We went after the equipment as far as Dresden and further out and back -- I was in Stendal on the Elbe when Germany surrendered.</span> <span id="s518">The German Fifth Army Corps surrendered to us.</span> <span id="s519">I was temporarily a guard in a prison camp.</span> <span id="s520">I had the unpleasant job of guarding SS women.</span> <span id="s521">Now there…</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Now, where was this again?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: In Stendal on the Elbe.</span> <span id="s524">And there I didn’t have any doubt about it that I would shoot to kill.</span> <span id="s525">I want to give the impression that “you want them to flee, I shoot to kill.”</span> <span id="s526">I meant it.</span> <span id="s527">I had a shell in the chamber I wouldn’t hesitate one moment because I hate the sight of SS.</span> <span id="s528">In fact when we were on the move into Germany in Traben-Trarbach I was given a SS man as a prisoner.</span> <span id="s529">Now, I went overseas with the idea that the first one I meet as long as we are armed, one of us is gonna die.</span> <span id="s530">However he was disarmed and I’m not a murderer, so I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s531">In fact I had the pleasure of taking the police chief in Windsheim/Aish prisoner.</span> <span id="s532">He had forgotten to indicate on a form -- I mean, I remember he was SS.</span> <span id="s533">Now we were always digging and one morning I walked in there and I had my pistol in front of me.</span> <span id="s534">“Alright give me your weapon,” then I said -- I told his assistant there, “Lock him up.”</span> <span id="s535">Now, we had found out he was a member in the SS.</span> <span id="s536">That was in the questionnaire.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Now, this is still during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s539">I mean, after Germany surrendered.</span> <span id="s540">That was when I was an investigative officer.</span> <span id="s541">Counter-intelligence.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: So this would have been ’46?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I was overseas ‘til ’47, working as a counter-intelligence officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: So your job was pretty much to find SS members and take them into custody?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Uh, my job was counter-intelligence activity, to dig in the records and so on and find them out.</span> <span id="s546">And also reviewing what they had on the questionnaires.</span> <span id="s547">Oh, I had a mess of people under me and commissions to move around and I continued when I came back to this country.</span> <span id="s548">I was in the service till ’49.</span> <span id="s549">I ended up in the Intelligence Section First Army Headquarters governor’s Island.</span> <span id="s550">There I had all the German scientists under my control.</span> <span id="s551">They were limited in their movements.</span> <span id="s552">They had to get permission and I also had control over construction.</span> <span id="s553">Aerial photography.</span> <span id="s554">I had to approve whether they could get through or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: This was after you came back to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yeah, back from overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: You were observing the German scientists who were working on…</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: They were over there after the war, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: …the rockets?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: You see, they were forced in – in fact I participated in some of this gathering of German scientists.</span> <span id="s561">I won’t disclose any details, but we’d just come in with a few vehicles, and that was in regard to map-making, and we’d come in where they were making -- you know, “You go with me.</span> <span id="s562">Pack a little suitcase, you’re on your way,” you know.</span> <span id="s563">I mean just like that.</span> <span id="s564">“Your wife, your family can join you depending after a year,” and they were on their way to the United States.</span> <span id="s565">Whether they liked it or not.</span> <span id="s566">Russia was doing the same thing.</span> <span id="s567">That was how we got scientists.</span> <span id="s568">So after this we did some of these things.</span> <span id="s569">We had operational things which I won’t mention because we -- somehow I feel obligated -- the undercover details which are secret, you know, top secret.</span> <span id="s570">I don’t tell about them.</span> <span id="s571">I had a top secret, secret clearance in New York.</span> <span id="s572">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s573">Amazing it seems, I was a foreign born, they send me back to Germany and they gave me a top secret clearance here, too, while I was in the service.</span> <span id="s574">Well, at any rate, that’s about it in a nutshell, unless you have some more particular questions you want me to answer .</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Well, I’m curious about just a few things.</span> <span id="s576">When did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: I met her when I came to this country.</span> <span id="s578">I used to go to the Massada for awhile.</span> <span id="s579">In fact, after I was able to converse -- I mean I learned it whether I like it or not -- I was taking out a different girl almost every night for awhile.</span> <span id="s580">Oh, I got to know quite a few of ‘em.</span> <span id="s581">I got to know her and well, it got kinda serious and I got in the service and eventually I got sent over to Saint Louis -- to Saint Louis for awhile.</span> <span id="s582">Couldn’t even think of the name of that darn place.</span> <span id="s583">Walter Winchell used to call that place the hellhole of the Army.</span> <span id="s584">I thought I was in the army…I was still a member of the air force, but there the thirty mile hikes and all this stuff.</span> <span id="s585">At any rate she came down there and actually we got married by the Justice of the Peace down there, but we didn’t consummate any marriage.</span> <span id="s586">Back in August suddenly I had a -- I was transferred all of a sudden I got a leave.</span> <span id="s587">No, I think it was down South.</span> <span id="s588">I shipped in new recruits and I got a leave.</span> <span id="s589">I had to borrow the money to come home, uh.</span> <span id="s590">I’m getting mixed up there.</span> <span id="s591">I had to borrow the money one time to come on a leave -- to come from the South.</span> <span id="s592">But we got married here in, uh, August the 15.</span> <span id="s593">I got leave, I came home and we got married by the Rabbi and all that whole business.</span> <span id="s594">And then we lived in Columbus awhile together.</span> <span id="s595">That’s where she became pregnant and my daughter was eventually born, but by that time I was already back overseas and after I got back from overseas, well we began fussing and fighting again and we had a difference of opinion.</span> <span id="s596">My mother-in-law and I couldn’t get along.</span> <span id="s597">In fact I got thrown out of the house.</span> <span id="s598">She told me to get the “H” out of here and I did get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Now, Your wife was living with her parents then?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: So.</span> <span id="s601">Anyway I came back and my son was born thirteen years after my daughter, yeah.</span> <span id="s602">But he is my pride and joy in fact -- (tape runs out) End of Side One.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Begin Side Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">[Julie Orenstein had asked what Donald Bender did to learn the fates of his family members]</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: …and in all that time on a leave I had to give his home address because I was gonna go to Holland and you were not allowed to go into the British zone -- you did not have a free zone -- and my home town was in it, so I just plainly lied.</span> <span id="s606">I was gonna go to Holland and had no intentions of going to Holland.</span> <span id="s607">When I got to my hometown I looked up my childhood friend.</span> <span id="s608">I had a friend there who was a Social Democrat just like myself and his military service -- he was transferred.</span> <span id="s609">First chance he had he surrendered to the British.</span> <span id="s610">He was a British prisoner for awhile.</span> <span id="s611">And first thing I looked up and I was happy to find out the war didn’t eat him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Now, he was a gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: And he visited my parents the last man -- in fact I think he loaned them the money and even a suitcase.</span> <span id="s614">How he endangered himself by visiting them, so, naturally, we’re still friends.</span> <span id="s615">Fine, that was one time.</span> <span id="s616">Then I made inquiries -- there was a Jewish community there.</span> <span id="s617">Couldn’t find out very much except they were carried to the East.</span> <span id="s618">I sent some of my informants East, but I couldn’t find out much.</span> <span id="s619">See I was a member of CIC [Counter Intelligence Corp.] I could write tickets and food.</span> <span id="s620">I made them all available in order to be able to bribe my way through.</span> <span id="s621">Cigarettes, you name it.</span> <span id="s622">Even silk stockings for the women, just to get ‘em to talk.</span> <span id="s623">I’ve had Germans working for me that -- I was driving an Opel or a Mercedes and got stopped on the way -- sitting next to me reach for his kenncarte and I reach for my kenncarte.</span> <span id="s624">That German policeman never knew he was dealing with an American.</span> <span id="s625">And even the German, he didn’t know that he was working for an American.</span> <span id="s626">And that was part of my work.</span> <span id="s627">I was in civvies all the time, except I was armed which the German policeman didn’t know.</span> <span id="s628">I had two sets of identities; the American as an officer and also the German.</span> <span id="s629">So that was one thing, now, how I found out -- you coming back to this -- I couldn’t find out too much there, however, I went and made contact with a German writer who wrote the book “Dachau Started in Wuppertal” and I wrote to him for a copy and I also wanted to find out where he got all the information.</span> <span id="s630">The last time I was in Germany I made it my business -- he was on vacation -- I made it my business to wait till he come back and get together with him and I had a copy of a list of all the people being deported.</span> <span id="s631">They went to Theresienstadt, I believe.</span> <span id="s632">That’s where they were carried.</span> <span id="s633">I went that far and the next time we were planning to go to Israel this past May, but my wife was sick, that’s when I intended to go down there and see what else I can find out.</span> <span id="s634">In the book he mentioned my sister and her children, that’s why I went back to him.</span> <span id="s635">And there are dates.</span> <span id="s636">And I also investigated I was in Kaisersesch.</span> <span id="s637">I know where my uncle who moved to Cologne got taken away from Cologne.</span> <span id="s638">I know.</span> <span id="s639">I investigated that as much as I could and that’s how I found out.</span> <span id="s640">And we added up the ones who were carried away, about 40.</span> <span id="s641">My sister married after I left Germany, had two sons, and she married a gentile.</span> <span id="s642">However when it became time for them to report to be deported or “resettled in the East,” as it was said, he volunteered to join his family.</span> <span id="s643">He went along and, naturally, perished too.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: So they were in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No, they went to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s646">No, I had the list, the copies.</span> <span id="s647">My name was on there also.</span> <span id="s648">I made photostatic copies.</span> <span id="s649">I got that far.</span> <span id="s650">So that’s how I know.</span> <span id="s651">And I investigated my grandparents home, so now my grandparents -- when my grandfather dies and my grandmother came to this country and lived one week --now, I made the statement then, then when I heard they were going to bring her over here, that she’s unable, I think, I mean somebody else could have taken her place.</span> <span id="s652">She died within a week.</span> <span id="s653">She’s buried in Appleton, Wisconsin because I have an aunt and uncle that live -- she’s on the outs with me now.</span> <span id="s654">She got mad at me because I am lazy when it comes to writing.</span> <span id="s655">So at any rate, I checked that out.</span> <span id="s656">I mean, they were carried off.</span> <span id="s657">I had them in Kaisersesch, Munstermaifeld, Cologne, Bonn, Munchen-Gladbach.</span> <span id="s658">I checked them all out.</span> <span id="s659">Now I had a lot of cousins.</span> <span id="s660">Now, I have some of them in this country…</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Now most of them that are in this country, did they come before you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s663">No, there were some that came after.</span> <span id="s664">Right after this, for example papers for an aunt of mine and the family came over here.</span> <span id="s665">I got a cousin in New York, now, one of the uncles of mine, they came to New York to the other one who signed the whole family.</span> <span id="s666">There were several families who came the same time or a little later when it was still permissible.</span> <span id="s667">Afterwards, you couldn’t come out anymore.</span> <span id="s668">See, I left legally.</span> <span id="s669">I got a passport.</span> <span id="s670">I got permission, and I got certificate that I didn’t owe any taxes, you know and all this stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: You left when you could still do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s673">I came with the total sum of $40,00 and so I was allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s674">So I was legal there.</span> <span id="s675">So, we lost that many people that the war carried away, and sooner or later I got some restitution that paid for the house we own.</span> <span id="s676">It wasn’t very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Now, how did you find out that you could get restitution?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Well, somehow or another my aunt in Pittsburg -- I mean the one who came a little later -- they had started procedure and they wrote to me and I just joined the game.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: And how was it all -- did that go through the UN?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: No, that went through a lawyer in Mayen which is not too far from there.</span> <span id="s681">And it dragged on and on and a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s682">In fact, when I came to Germany, you know, on my first time, I knew who had participated in shooting me.</span> <span id="s683">I went to the police to see them and started proceeding against them.</span> <span id="s684">The guy died before they finally had him in the court.</span> <span id="s685">He claimed it was his brother, he had two brothers, but I know which one he was and he died before the court proceedings got done.</span> <span id="s686">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s687">I pressed charges.</span> <span id="s688">So, no, they had started proceedings over there and I just followed.</span> <span id="s689">I joined them.</span> <span id="s690">And I had my parents declared dead, an un-natural death, had them declared dead the fifth of May, 1945.</span> <span id="s691">That was when Germany surrendered.</span> <span id="s692">So, I’m the sole heir.</span> <span id="s693">I got compensated.</span> <span id="s694">Some of the money is in this house, too, so anyway, later on they kept sending me papers applying for compensation, I mean Social Security.</span> <span id="s695">Well, for a while I didn’t bother.</span> <span id="s696">Too much paper works.</span> <span id="s697">Well at the last minute I found out about it and I wrote them a letter and I had the papers approved, see, so I could claim -- I think I had 16 years I think on my family.</span> <span id="s698">I think I was four months left, of it would have been finished and after I applied for a couple of years or so then they finally agreed to pay me and I got back pay of about $11,000 to start with.</span> <span id="s699">See I could prove -- I mean, the way they had it set up, I think you had to prove four years under employment and they would give you ten years.</span> <span id="s700">And I could easily prove, for I had the recommendation of my oldest boss and so that wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s701">And then, uh, they paid me and I get Social Security from Germany, too.</span> <span id="s702">And then I came back, they should contribute to my health insurance this year then I got another small increase and they have an annual cost of living increase also, but the problem is this last one they increased in, I mean, they lowered the contribution to the health insurance, so it’s a matter of about $10,00 more a month.</span> <span id="s703">See that process was on a commission basis.</span> <span id="s704">I think there was five percent of the annual pension input for five years, so what the heck, I might as well have that money, too.</span> <span id="s705">I still have some left, so I’m not too bad off I mean and I got pay from my employer which isn’t too much, but it all counts.</span> <span id="s706">Right now I got an estimate I’m going to have central air for the whole house and this one is just about $2,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: That’ll be nice to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: That’s the next thing.</span> <span id="s709">Well I have three estimates.</span> <span id="s710">I always go with three and the last one I like best.</span> <span id="s711">Not that it is cheaper, no, but I like the compressor and the kind of equipment he’s going to use.</span> <span id="s712">He’s using the biggest compressor and I’d rather have the biggest one, even if it costs a little more that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Now, let me, let’s see.</span> <span id="s714">I’m just going to get a timetable.</span> <span id="s715">You came back to the United States after serving in the Air Force…</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Three years maximum, it was, for an officer, Air Force, so I came back in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: ’47.</span> <span id="s718">And then did you -- were you a civilian at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: No.</span> <span id="s720">I stayed in until ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: And what did you do in this country?</span> <span id="s722">What was your -- oh, you were telling me you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: As a serviceman?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: You were observing the German scientists.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: No, here I was in charge of running the Three-O-First ‘C’ Detachment.</span> <span id="s726">I was Acting detachment commander.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: And what did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: They investigate subversive activity within the limitation of the country, that’s the limitation on that.</span> <span id="s729">I supervised the German scientist, control, uh, construction projects by aerial surveillance, so they wouldn’t get into sensitive areas and so on.</span> <span id="s730">You had to prove this, that was our job, and also make the write the reports about all kinds of things, you know, in the service you’ve got all kinds of reports; equipment report, personnel report, that was all my assignment.</span> <span id="s731">I was the Acting Commander.</span> <span id="s732">I used to approve rations, quarters for our men.</span> <span id="s733">As the Acting Commander I assigned them by order of the Major who was in charge.</span> <span id="s734">In fact, the Major wasn’t visible very often.</span> <span id="s735">I was the Commanding officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: And then after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Then after my wife didn’t want to join me, I could have gotten quarters as an officer -- I applied for release from the service.</span> <span id="s738">See, you don’t get discharged, you have to apply for a release.</span> <span id="s739">And I left the service in ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Now, what part of the country were you serving in at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: I was at Governor’s Island, New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: New York.</span> <span id="s743">And she didn’t want to…</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: No, she didn’t want to join me, for she didn’t want to leave her sick father.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Oh, I see, so she was in Columbus?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: She was in Dayton.</span> <span id="s747">Right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: She was in Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Oh, she left me in Columbus, again, to go back home and I went on step by step.</span> <span id="s750">I went in Columbus and then when they called -- came, they needed interpreters – I went to Windshein/Aish.</span> <span id="s751">I was transferred to Germany and I went overseas and then I went, after my fighting days were over -- I mean I had battle scars.</span> <span id="s752">I could prove I was in a fighting zone.</span> <span id="s753">And after the fighting was over I applied for military government and counter-intelligence, and counter-intelligence got me first and I went to European intelligence school in OberAmmergau, a nice area, four weeks -- it was make or break.</span> <span id="s754">Either you made the course or you got kicked out of counter-intelligence.</span> <span id="s755">So I didn’t get kicked out.</span> <span id="s756">And later on I was working as satisfactorily to my superiors that they asked me to apply for a commission.</span> <span id="s757">Now, I didn’t know the difference between a second lieutenant and warrant officer and I applied for warrant officer and I had to go to a (word missing) in Frankfurt and be interviewed by my superiors and believe me I nearly got blinded by all the brass.</span> <span id="s758">Generals and full Colonels and all.</span> <span id="s759">And that quiz was such a way that eventually I came to the point I didn’t care whether I made it or not, just get me outta here.</span> <span id="s760">I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s761">But apparently I satisfied their questions and February the 15th, uh, February the first, 1947, I became a Staff Sergeant because the ratings is open and closed, open and closed, I went in all the time and the 15th of February I was called to Frankfurt to accept or reject the appointment as a Warrant Officer and we went in, we had to wear uniform, and we went in, two of us, we were Staff Sergeants and had to raise our hand and take the oath of an officer before they signed the second page of our discharge.</span> <span id="s762">They didn’t take a chance on it.</span> <span id="s763">They wouldn’t sign both sides because, if they didn’t have us take the oath of office, we would have been civilians.</span> <span id="s764">So we were sworn in as officers they pinned the insignia on us and we came outside and here come a coupla GI’s and they salute they salute and we looked at each other and we thought, “Who the heck” -- we forgot we had them things on our shoulder.</span> <span id="s765">We snapped to it and returned the salute and we had to go to the officer’s mess and PX because that was off limits before.</span> <span id="s766">We had to see what it was like.</span> <span id="s767">We were not allowed in there otherwise.</span> <span id="s768">And from there on the way back we were stationed in Ausbach, then, I believe, on the way back to the railway station we picked our insignias off our shoulders -- counter-intelligence doesn’t wear insignias.</span> <span id="s769">I was at that time in charge over Full Colonels -- it didn’t matter where I was even in charge.</span> <span id="s770">The same thing happened to me in Columbus.</span> <span id="s771">I had generals were even taking orders from me, for I was an instructor bombsight so we picked them insignias off and then I worked as a counter-intelligence officer.</span> <span id="s772">In fact I was in charge of a branch office in Windsheim for a while.</span> <span id="s773">I had the key to the city hall -this long.</span> <span id="s774">You couldn’t carry it in your pocket, you know, those old fashioned keys and people there used to -- they just shot somebody -- a political prisoner --“terminal discharge.”</span> <span id="s775">They had to report to me in the office and it didn’t matter to me they were always handcuffed and they sit on a cushion and it didn’t bother me, because they were bad enough to be automatically locked up so I didn’t feel mercenary.</span> <span id="s776">So they were sick, so what?</span> <span id="s777">They didn’t bother about other people being sick, but they had to come to me to extend their stay at home.</span> <span id="s778">Always, the arrested people, I had to carry them to the next place they going along the -- like a concentration camp, likely.</span> <span id="s779">I had one Obersturm fuehrer under arrest and he asked for information whether he could go home to pack some things.</span> <span id="s780">I took him to his home I told him, “Look, you make any attempt to escape, I’ll have to shoot to kill you,” but I helped him, I suggested things for him to take along and so on, for I knew he was gone for at least a year.</span> <span id="s781">So.</span> <span id="s782">But he hadn’t done a thing.</span> <span id="s783">He was the least of the captivity and we had to arrest him.</span> <span id="s784">And I had investigated him and he hadn’t done a thing or hurt anybody, I knew he hadn’t.</span> <span id="s785">So I treated him like a human being.</span> <span id="s786">See, don’t forget, there were a lot of members from the SS who were not volunteering.</span> <span id="s787">They were pressed into this service.</span> <span id="s788">They were draftees and then switched into the SS.</span> <span id="s789">Which I found out afterward.</span> <span id="s790">I wanted to hang a lot more, but the Nazis said that, I knew, before when I went to school, so that’s one of the things.</span> <span id="s791">I enjoyed my work.</span> <span id="s792">I stayed on as long as I could, because of wife and I were not on the best of terms.</span> <span id="s793">Well, that happens…</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: When you’re away a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: We were not even corresponding.</span> <span id="s796">My mother-in-law had something to do with it, because I didn’t hesitate to tell her right to her face to mind her own business.</span> <span id="s797">Try to run my life and that was out.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: So, when you came back in ’49, did you get a job then?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: In ’49 first off my wife and I had a meeting at the former Gibbons to see whether we get together or not, because she wrote to me what am I going to do about her?</span> <span id="s800">I wrote her back, “You waited this long, you wait -- I plan to be back in the ‘State at such and such time -- you’ll wait ‘til then.</span> <span id="s801">And we had a meeting and then we made another -- we decided to make another attempt, so, fine, uh.</span> <span id="s802">What then?</span> <span id="s803">Oh, at that time my mother-in-law had died, I think.</span> <span id="s804">Yeah, she had died.</span> <span id="s805">And my father-in-law asked me to move in with them.</span> <span id="s806">At any rate, I was an optician and I went first off at that, so I looked for work and I had set my price.</span> <span id="s807">I wasn’t going to work for a certain amount and I wasn’t going to settle for less, I forgot what it was, $75,-- a week, or something like that.</span> <span id="s808">And I didn’t apply for unemployment.</span> <span id="s809">I mean, I had that -- what was it -- $20,00 a week for 6 months or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s810">That -- I didn’t even apply for that, or ration cards.</span> <span id="s811">I had enough money saved I could live without it, so eventually I found a job at a Valley optical place here in town for the price I wanted to work.</span> <span id="s812">So my job which was supposed to be waiting -- the whole company wasn’t there anymore.</span> <span id="s813">They had sold it, so that finished that, so I started working and I worked for about one month, for my father-in-law asked me to join him and he was paying the wages I was making then, plus he was going to pay the tax.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Was your father-in-law an optician?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: He was in the grocery business.</span> <span id="s816">Yeah.</span> <span id="s817">And so I joined him and he was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s818">You couldn’t find a nicer guy, I mean may he rest in peace.</span> <span id="s819">And after the first year together -- I didn’t invest a penny -- I set out to buy a car.</span> <span id="s820">Now, I had enough money to do that and also -- I worked with him.</span> <span id="s821">After the first year he split the profits with me -- I didn’t have any money invested.</span> <span id="s822">So -- and then he decided to sell out to my youngest brother-in-law and I as equal partners and he had enough money he didn’t overcharge us, and then my youngest brother-in-law was called back in the Korean war – he was a captain.</span> <span id="s823">He had studied to become a Professor of Sociology.</span> <span id="s824">At any rate, we were partners until he was called back and then I made up a contract with him that I was going to pay him six percent interest, which you couldn’t get in a bank his investment, took inventory and whatever increase later on that would have been half his, too and then I made money.</span> <span id="s825">I put more equipment in and I made money on the grocery store.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: What was the name of the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Knollwood Market.</span> <span id="s828">Originally it was Block’s market but since his name was Block and mine was Bender we called it Knollwood Market.</span> <span id="s829">I made money.</span> <span id="s830">I was saving about $500 a month regularly, so, uh, not bad.</span> <span id="s831">So, anyway when he came back he didn’t want to stay.</span> <span id="s832">He wanted to get back to school and finish his education, so I thought, “Fine, I’m not going to be paying him any investment, so I might as well pay off.”</span> <span id="s833">I took inventory, paid him half of what it was worth with interest and it was my store after twelve years.</span> <span id="s834">And then come the 1-75, I had to get out of the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Aw.</span> <span id="s836">What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Uh, I forgot.</span> <span id="s838">It was in ’61.</span> <span id="s839">I moved away from there.</span> <span id="s840">Then I bought a store called Western Market -- an aunt of mine, I mean, my father-in-law’s sister owned the building -- and I bought that store and it was a bona fide lemon.</span> <span id="s841">I was stuck with that thing for 5 years and I lost money on the average about $1,000 a year, it cost me.</span> <span id="s842">I finally auctioned it off and I went into insurance.</span> <span id="s843">I didn’t even know you needed a license to go into insurance.</span> <span id="s844">I found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: So you became an independent insurance salesman?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: No, I had a business and the first time I flunked the exam for the license by one point.</span> <span id="s847">It still makes me mad when I think about it.</span> <span id="s848">You needed 65 out of 100 and I got 74.</span> <span id="s849">Then I got so darn mad and I really studied.</span> <span id="s850">The first time I took it easy.</span> <span id="s851">The next time when I took the exam -- they don’t tell you the score, but I kept score where I had any doubts and I am positive I made about 97.</span> <span id="s852">I’m positive of that.</span> <span id="s853">So the first year I needed another $1,000 to support myself.</span> <span id="s854">I wasn’t making enough money, but then I started and now I’m getting maximum social Security.</span> <span id="s855">I was an independent agent in the end, I mean, a general agent.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Did you start with a company then?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: With which?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Inter Ocean, which are now -- they used to be independent, but they’re now part of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and I was with them, I mean, counting retirement benefits for 30 years, but actually I was with them 16.</span> <span id="s860">See they changed my whole set up.</span> <span id="s861">They made everybody a general agent.</span> <span id="s862">No more retirement accumulation, nothing.</span> <span id="s863">So in three years I didn’t have any accumulation.</span> <span id="s864">But I worked as a general agent the last few years, prepaid my taxes.</span> <span id="s865">If I tell you I gained $1,500 every month then I tell you something.</span> <span id="s866">I mean I was estimated under $22,500 and I went over it and my wife was working as a teacher.</span> <span id="s867">Now her money was estimated too, but there were times when we still had to pay more even with a 38% profit we made, so… Q; Where did she teach?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Well, she teaches at the public school system, City of Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Elementary level?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s871">For a couple of years she taught at Roth in high school and then she gradually worked from the seventh grade down to the second and third as she got older, so she’s got 21 years.</span> <span id="s872">At any rate, my son started schooling.</span> <span id="s873">Now my son used to go to Camp Ramah and we used to go up there on visitor’s day every year, that was routine.</span> <span id="s874">I love it.</span> <span id="s875">It’s in Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s876">I love it.</span> <span id="s877">And then he started -- he selected Washington University in Saint Louis and was accepted there.</span> <span id="s878">He also was a little bit on the lazy side -- he was on probation for a little while.</span> <span id="s879">He majored in History and Political science.</span> <span id="s880">What are you going to do with it?</span> <span id="s881">Work for the govt.</span> <span id="s882">Anyway he got to meet a nice little lady in Rockford, Ill, or somewheres, place with his friends.</span> <span id="s883">I mean some of his camp friends are there and she went to University of Iowa in -- where is it?</span> <span id="s884">Iowa City, I think, and so eventually I got him a car.</span> <span id="s885">Usually he was running back and forth, eventually he asked permission whether he could transfer there.</span> <span id="s886">I put a few stipulations on it.</span> <span id="s887">If you are behaving and your grades not dropped, alright.</span> <span id="s888">I let you transfer.</span> <span id="s889">He transferred and he graduated a little bit later than she did, almost the same year.</span> <span id="s890">I mean he had to take a summer course in between to make up for the grades he lost and soon.</span> <span id="s891">At any rate, he graduated there and he started -- and she graduated with honors.</span> <span id="s892">She took accounting got 3 stars on her gown.</span> <span id="s893">She’s got that gown at home.</span> <span id="s894">I’ve seen it, yeah, nice lady.</span> <span id="s895">So, he started working.</span> <span id="s896">Chicago was his magnet.</span> <span id="s897">Started working for the Gap and I wasn’t very happy when he did that.</span> <span id="s898">You know Gap, uh, clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Oh, the clothing store, the jeans…</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Yeah, oh that stuff’s crazy.</span> <span id="s901">Well, he found out soon enough and then he got a job with CNA, a large insurance firm, as a claim adjuster and he worked for them several years until IWE was after him he they wanted an insurance broker, and he’s a broker with Merrill-Lynch now.</span> <span id="s902">And his wife started out with, oh, a well known auditing firm -- oh, what the heck.</span> <span id="s903">I can’t think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: H&amp;R block</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s906">A bigger one than H.R. Block.</span> <span id="s907">I mean, all the big companies.</span> <span id="s908">In the town, in right downtown in Chicago.</span> <span id="s909">And them – they use to get the cream of the crop.</span> <span id="s910">They’d take 20 or 30 graduates at one time, and eventually she got laid off, I mean they reduced the staff, so she started working for some insurance company and she still works for another one now, but I couldn’t even tell you the name, but there she is in a managerial position already and I don’t know what the girl makes, but she makes as much as my son, maybe more.</span> <span id="s911">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s912">She’s a…</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: They have kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: No, not yet.</span> <span id="s915">She’s a licensed auditor, a certified accountant in Iowa and Illinois.</span> <span id="s916">No, they don’t have any children.</span> <span id="s917">She is a couple of months older or so than my son.</span> <span id="s918">I heard her say when she was still a girlfriend she wants to work till she’s 30 before she thinks about a family.</span> <span id="s919">But I think she ought to do it because my son’s going to be 27 and she’s 27 now.</span> <span id="s920">They’ve bought their first home and she’s a lovely little girl.</span> <span id="s921">She’s shorter than I am.</span> <span id="s922">I have my son’s -- I don’t carry any pictures except my son.</span> <span id="s923">There is his high school graduation picture and this is his wedding picture and now let me take it out…</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: His name is Howard, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: I went to school with him!</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: You know Howard?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Yes, I recognized him.</span> <span id="s929">I was in 5th grade with him at Jefferson.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: At Jefferson and later on to that school -- it now belongs to the Girl Scouts, uh, Shoup Mill.</span> <span id="s931">He was bussed out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: No, I never…</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: That’s Howard.</span> <span id="s934">And this is -- let me see if I can get it out of there.</span> <span id="s935">That’s his wife.</span> <span id="s936">And there, now you can see it better.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s938">I always knew he’d be successful, he was such a nice boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: He’s my pride and joy, what are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: I remember him very fondly.</span> <span id="s941">He was -- Well you know that school was pretty bad and he was a nice boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Well, but I tell you something, you know.</span> <span id="s943">I was kind of a mother hen there, and you know he ended up at Col White and I threatened Mr. Thomas, I think it was -- wait a minute.</span> <span id="s944">What was that principle’s name?</span> <span id="s945">Not Thomas.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: I went there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: The guy who brought in all his mess.</span> <span id="s948">Thomas was one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Lacey was, uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: I don’t know, but I threatened him on the phone if necessary I’d come over there with a pistol in my hand and I managed to get him out of there and get him over to Fairview.</span> <span id="s951">And then I used to take him to Fairview and pick him up, too.</span> <span id="s952">I used to make it my business to be there at the right time.</span> <span id="s953">And Howard, when he was born I was home and I helped raise him and -- Is that thing still running?</span> <span id="s954">I hope not -- oh, for heavens sake you don’t want that on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: mhm, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: So, I gave him all the bath till he was able to take his own.</span> <span id="s957">In fact that little stinker, I never had diapered a baby in my life and after he was about a week old or so momma had to go someplace and here he messed up his pants and I wasn’t going to leave them.</span> <span id="s958">The pants didn’t bother me as a grown up that doesn’t bother you, he had #2 in there, but I wouldn’t leave him lay in that mess.</span> <span id="s959">I cleaned him like I see momma do him and I oiled him and I powdered him and then I got the great big tent, I mean that’s what the diaper looked like on that little bittty bottom, I did the best I can, but he must have been comfortable, he fell asleep.</span> <span id="s960">So momma came home, I told her, “Look, I diapered him the best I could.’</span> <span id="s961">You know, I had to fold the thing and she repinned it.</span> <span id="s962">But I always made darn sure of one thing.</span> <span id="s963">I had a principle -- if somebody is stuck it’ll be me, not the baby.</span> <span id="s964">And I got stuck a few times, you know with the pins, but I won’t stick him.</span> <span id="s965">But I took care of the baby and I got the milk back, too, that’s such a lovely thing, when your baby gets a bottle and all of a sudden this mess is all over you and the only thing you can do is make them comfortable and then you go to the bathroom and undress.</span> <span id="s966">That’s all you can do.</span> <span id="s967">And we did everything together.</span> <span id="s968">Howard was a member of the Civil Air Patrol and daddy used to take time out to take him out there and time to pick him up and daddy would see that he got the full uniform, but Howard is such a gentle person, that when he went up in rank and he had to start giving orders that went against his training and he quit.</span> <span id="s969">Oh, he would have gone way up there.</span> <span id="s970">He was getting them one by one.</span> <span id="s971">He was lining up to become commander, but he could not give orders so he quit.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: I seem to remember now that I was also in an English class in our freshman year in high school with him, and I think he read the part of Romeo and I read the part of Juliet in a play, once.</span> <span id="s973">I remember him quite well, he was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: What is your maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Rollins, Julie Rollins.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: He didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s977">No, I tell you we did everything together.</span> <span id="s978">Now, my wife never could go on -- maybe on a merry-go-round, maybe, but she got dizzy very easy.</span> <span id="s979">There wasn’t an instrument of entertainment that Howard and his daddy wouldn’t go on.</span> <span id="s980">I mean, if the darn thing put you in a cage and turn you upside down, it didn’t matter to me, because I always was that way.</span> <span id="s981">The only thing I would not go on is a roller coaster because when I was approximately 12 years old or something like that I nearly sailed out of one of them once.</span> <span id="s982">They had an exhibition right alongside the Rhine in Dusseldorf and I felt being lifted out and I held on for dear life I would have ended up in the River Rhine.</span> <span id="s983">And I wouldn’t go on one of those things anymore.</span> <span id="s984">That was the only exception, but anything else which threw you around or -- daddy went with him.</span> <span id="s985">And Howard was interested in the Indian ruins and there were some on the other end of Ohio.</span> <span id="s986">I can’t even think of the name of the place.</span> <span id="s987">We spent a whole Sunday going clear across Ohio driving over there.</span> <span id="s988">When we got there we were disappointed it was hardly anything worthwhile, but we went there.</span> <span id="s989">Anything Howard wanted to do, if it was possible, daddy and he did it.</span> <span id="s990">And the week before he got bar mitzvah I had another week -- he had another week to spend -- vacation or so on.</span> <span id="s991">Or I had a week of vacation.</span> <span id="s992">Howard and I went to Canada.</span> <span id="s993">And, listen, daddy never fools around.</span> <span id="s994">We left at 8:30 in the morning, at 5:00 in the evening I called momma from the other side of Buffalo, I mean, on the Canadian side.</span> <span id="s995">We had already a motel.</span> <span id="s996">Momma didn’t believe me, I mean, I told her, if you don’t believe I’ll give you the number-call back.</span> <span id="s997">We -- I don’t waste any time.</span> <span id="s998">At that time 70 was the speed limit, but I went as much as 95.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: So Howard, of course was bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1000">I guess I’m curious -- how is your religion different?</span> <span id="s1001">After you came to the United States, did you find that you were more religious as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: None whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Are you a member of a temple?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: No, I’m not a member.</span> <span id="s1005">I became a member and then they started raising my dues without asking me, automatically.</span> <span id="s1006">And I finally got disgusted.</span> <span id="s1007">You don’t spend my money for me, you don’t know what I have.</span> <span id="s1008">And I quit.</span> <span id="s1009">I’m not a member.</span> <span id="s1010">My wife is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Where is she a member?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: At the BAU.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Where is…</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Right here on the corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Oh, at Beth Abraham.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1017">No, I have nothing to do with religion and I sweat blood, literally when Howard got bar mitzvah because my father-in-law was very religious.</span> <span id="s1018">In fact he was -- he had a function there.</span> <span id="s1019">I don’t know, I’ll have to look at the diploma sitting in there to find out the name of it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1020">He was high up there.</span> <span id="s1021">I sweat blood because I didn’t want to mess up his bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1022">Because that Howard was his pride and joy, he used to thrill him.</span> <span id="s1023">But fortunately they had a little plastic number there, so I could read it and I know how to intone it and yet I was a little -- and my father-in-law told me I did fine.</span> <span id="s1024">See, they don’t just read, dead reading.</span> <span id="s1025">I can and I know that sing-song, you know.</span> <span id="s1026">I did it only for my father-in-law and my son.</span> <span id="s1027">I wouldn’t spoil a thing for my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Is Howard religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Howard was raised that way, however, he is not like I am.</span> <span id="s1030">I mean I’m almost an atheist, let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s1031">In fact I intended to join the atheists when I was young and my mother hooped and hollered so much I figured alright I don’t have to join them.</span> <span id="s1032">I’m still going to think that way.</span> <span id="s1033">So, I didn’t join.</span> <span id="s1034">But that’s -- I grew up that way.</span> <span id="s1035">And I refuse to be an old hypocrite.</span> <span id="s1036">And that’s what I feel like if I pretend.</span> <span id="s1037">So, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1038">Now, Howard was raised religious, he -- in fact he can translate and so on.</span> <span id="s1039">He speaks some Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1040">I mean, he was in Israel and he took the East European tour and he took the tour to Israel.</span> <span id="s1041">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1042">One year he went East European class to Moscow and back down to Israel and we had arranged -- we were going to Europe.</span> <span id="s1043">He called us from Israel while I was in my hometown and we talked and talked $75.00 worth in one conversation.</span> <span id="s1044">We were glad to hear from him.</span> <span id="s1045">So he was raised religious.</span> <span id="s1046">He be -- I think he belongs to a synagogue or shul in Chicago, already, because his wife was raised religious they both -- and they got the mazuzahs already in the house, already, and had the Rabbi say his things.</span> <span id="s1047">Which doesn’t mean anything to me.</span> <span id="s1048">I mean they’re here, too.</span> <span id="s1049">Now, my wife was raised religious in fact she is so religious she says her prayers before she eats and all this stuff and she sits and holds her head.</span> <span id="s1050">I turn away because to me -- I don’t make fun of her, but it looks comical to me!</span> <span id="s1051">In fact, I made her one problem from this.</span> <span id="s1052">She usually lights the candles Friday evening without my participation.</span> <span id="s1053">There comes a place or time and, uh, the first and second time -- well I’m kind of used to it now.</span> <span id="s1054">I’ll sit there quietly.</span> <span id="s1055">I won’t participate, but before they get start with that, I have something to eat because I’m not going to wait that long for them to get finally to it.</span> <span id="s1056">The longer I sit the hungrier I get and the more aggravated I get.</span> <span id="s1057">And then my daughter, she -- I told her already, “you should become a Rabbi.”</span> <span id="s1058">I mean she embarrasses -- the Hagaddah alone isn’t enough she comes with two, three, four different books to add to it, yet, stories and all, “Rabbi such and such did such and such and so on.”</span> <span id="s1059">Oh!</span> <span id="s1060">And I’m always waiting to get done with it so we eat.</span> <span id="s1061">But that’s the way it is, I mean, I’m not going to be a hypocrite.</span> <span id="s1062">In fact, I think the last time I was in a synagogue -- Howard’s bar mitzvah and the Howard’s aufrauf and that was it.</span> <span id="s1063">Oh maybe somebody was buried or dead.</span> <span id="s1064">I mean her father attended the services, but otherwise I have not been back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Do you consider yourself a Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: No, definitely not.</span> <span id="s1067">Now I -- let’s put it this way, my son claims -- somebody tried to persuade me that I am a Zionist.</span> <span id="s1068">Let’s put it this way, I’m not against Israel.</span> <span id="s1069">But I’m not a Zionist.</span> <span id="s1070">I don’t believe that all the Jews should go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1071">In fact in the 30’s or so I had the chance to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1072">I mean, Hise was soliciting, uh, looking for young people to go.</span> <span id="s1073">I started along and then I thought later uh-uh, I didn’t feel like it and I changed my mind because I didn’t believe I would feel happy among Jews only.</span> <span id="s1074">I mean, I guess it’s my way of living.</span> <span id="s1075">My friends are always gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: And even now I got more gen -- Oh, I got some Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s1078">I mean, maybe it’s a sign of benevolence.</span> <span id="s1079">I mean, I help people sometimes.</span> <span id="s1080">I don’t remember, like Mr. -- what’s his name again.</span> <span id="s1081">Mr. Pinkas when he was sick and still had his store I would go over there.</span> <span id="s1082">I had already retired.</span> <span id="s1083">I cut meat for him under his direction because I used to cut meat in my store, but gentile way, not the Jewish way, so I had to cut it under his direction.</span> <span id="s1084">Theirs is cut different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: You had to learn how to cut it kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: Yes so, fine.</span> <span id="s1087">I helped him ‘til -- and he offered that place to me.</span> <span id="s1088">I told him no.</span> <span id="s1089">I mean, I could have walked in and taken over.</span> <span id="s1090">I told him no.</span> <span id="s1091">I don’t want it and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1092">You see, the thing is, I used to be redheaded.</span> <span id="s1093">I wanted to say something else, but uh, I want to keep it clean, so -- I’ve been in the service and I know, every cuss word, I hardly use any.</span> <span id="s1094">I was just using an expression which sometimes is denoted with three letters and so, the last letter is a B. I mean, I used to be redheaded.</span> <span id="s1095">So, I knew darn well sooner or later I would have spoken my piece.</span> <span id="s1096">Some of these Jewish women can be a bona-fide pain in the neck.</span> <span id="s1097">I’ve seen them in butcher shops and so on.</span> <span id="s1098">But I wouldn’t be able to take it.</span> <span id="s1099">I’d speak my piece and lose a customer, maybe more than one.</span> <span id="s1100">So I’m not interested.</span> <span id="s1101">So I used to have a temper.</span> <span id="s1102">The same way there’s -- my wife befriended a Mrs. Cantor, I don’t know whether you know her or not.</span> <span id="s1103">She lost her husband just about a year ago.</span> <span id="s1104">Well, she hasn’t got anybody and so on.</span> <span id="s1105">Well when we go to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1106">My wife -- the first attempt my wife made to keep a kosher house, the kids were crying, “kosher, kosher.”</span> <span id="s1107">I told her, I said,” If you start a kosher house I’m going to walk out on you.”</span> <span id="s1108">I meant it, because I wasn’t going to be the criminal in the eyes of my children, because I eat anything I feel like, pork, beef, veal, anything.</span> <span id="s1109">Except poultry I won’t touch.</span> <span id="s1110">I had too much of it when I was a young child.</span> <span id="s1111">My mother even raised them in the house.</span> <span id="s1112">I will not eat ‘em.</span> <span id="s1113">So, about the second time that she asked, I said, “Well if it makes you happy go ahead.</span> <span id="s1114">I think it’s a bona-fide nuisance.”</span> <span id="s1115">But I won’t do a thing here to spoil them, I mean, I won’t mix them up or so on.</span> <span id="s1116">I’ll keep the dairy food and meat food separate and the dishes and so on – What are you going to do, reload?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Oh, we’re gonna – no, we’re fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Fine, and now we go to Cincinnati to buy meat and I mean I found out the chuck meat, or hamburger, the best one comes from New York frozen.</span> <span id="s1119">Better than Cincinnati or Chicago.</span> <span id="s1120">Chicago is better than Cincinnati or Columbus, so we were using that and also she is using the frozen chicken.</span> <span id="s1121">So we go to Cincinnati and buy them at Bilker’s because they’re much cheaper than here.</span> <span id="s1122">For $1;39 or something a pound you get whole friers or something and he had $1.99 or something like that and I buy about ten at a time anyhow, so it pays me.</span> <span id="s1123">So she got a friend or her sister over there.</span> <span id="s1124">I’ll take her along or bring her some.</span> <span id="s1125">Or she has to go someplace, let her call me, I’ll give transportation.</span> <span id="s1126">I’ll take her and I take her to the store.</span> <span id="s1127">I do that once in a while, but that’s all about the Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s1128">I mean, a lot more know me than I know.</span> <span id="s1129">Because I was married to a grocery store.</span> <span id="s1130">And you don’t have time to socialize.</span> <span id="s1131">But religion Howard, I mean they don’t keep a kosher house.</span> <span id="s1132">Not that I know, they use pork.</span> <span id="s1133">Now, I don’t know when they eat out, like myself, too, order anything you feel like it.</span> <span id="s1134">I mean I mix the cheese and the meat, yes.</span> <span id="s1135">But otherwise they do a certain amount observe, I mean, they go home for the holidays one way or the other, I mean, either her home or ours -- his home.</span> <span id="s1136">We were disappointed -- thought they’d make it for Seder this time.</span> <span id="s1137">They went the other way.</span> <span id="s1138">So, well.</span> <span id="s1139">They’re more religious than I am, I am the outcast when it comes to religion, religion -- I still believe the saying of the Second International.</span> <span id="s1140">“Religion is an opium or a crutch for the people.”</span> <span id="s1141">I still believe it.</span> <span id="s1142">And as long as you believe that you can’t be religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">End Side Two.</span></p></body></html>
