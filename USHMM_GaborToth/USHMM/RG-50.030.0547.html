2008.</span> <span id="s12">Dear Paula –</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: – thank you for agreeing to talk with us today, and to share your life story and experiences.</span> <span id="s15">And as we always do, let’s start at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family, where you were born –</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: – whether you had siblings, what kind of circumstances your family was in, and how you came to be in this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s21">I was born September the eighth, 1937 in Eindhoven, Holland.</span> <span id="s22">I – at that time I only – was an only child.</span> <span id="s23">And that area, until my hiding, I really don’t remember much.</span> <span id="s24">But, I have a picture that I carry around, that my father used to carry around and now I’m carrying it.</span> <span id="s25">It’s of my mother, who is wearing the Jewish star, and myself; I was about four and a half, walking in the streets in 1942 in July, visiting my aunt, my mother’s sister-in-law, who just gave birth to twins in the hospital.</span> <span id="s26">And she’s carrying this picture – I’m carrying the picture, but she’s walking down the so – sidewalk with a bouquet of flowers, which is what you always do in Holland; wherever you go, you bring flowers.</span> <span id="s27">And myself – and we’re both looking very sad, and this is the picture that I’m handing you.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Oh my, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: And that’s – that’s the last picture that we have.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: The last photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: To – to th – yeah, the last photograph for that – that period, until after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: What a sweet girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yes, I think I was.</span> <span id="s34">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Can you tell me, can you tell me your mother’s name, your father’s name, what kind of families they came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: My mother’s name was Fayge(ph) Buchla(ph) Rappaport.</span> <span id="s39">She came from Warsaw, Poland with her family, and the family was settled – they settled in France, I believe it’s in Paris.</span> <span id="s40">But – okay, and that’s where my mother had her life and her [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: So was she a first generation French citizen?</span> <span id="s42">Did the fam – when did her family go from Warsaw to France, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: I don’t know the dates.</span> <span id="s44">And – it must have been in the 20s.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I’m sure, because my father, he comes from Poland, and his parents – I don’t know the city offhand where they came from, but when my father was 14 – fa – either 14 or 16, his father told him go, get out of here and make your life.</span> <span id="s47">He put him on a train and wherever you can go, go and try and survive, because there’s nothing here.</span> <span id="s48">And this is 1928.</span> <span id="s49">So – and my father was born in 1911, so he was about 15 - 16, somewhere around that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: And – and that father, his father did that with – they had three sons, and they did it with both –</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: The three?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: All three.</span> <span id="s54">Because his father was more or less, very religious.</span> <span id="s55">And all I know is from the stories that all he did was pray all the time, and I think he was one of, like a habah(ph) type of person.</span> <span id="s56">His mother named – my fa – my grandfather, my father’s father was named, I think, Isadore.</span> <span id="s57">And my grandmother’s name was Sarah.</span> <span id="s58">And she was a little more educated.</span> <span id="s59">So my father traveled wherever he wound up, went to Germany and all this, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: And his name was – your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Oh, my father’s was Solomon.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Salamone.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Gerfine(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Gerfine(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Gerfine(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Ah – who had three brothers, Mark – Marcus and Ted.</span> <span id="s68">So, my father came to Holland, wound up in Holland, and I think that’s where he met my mother.</span> <span id="s69">Somehow my mother wound up with her family, live in Holland for awhile.</span> <span id="s70">And then my mother’s family went back to Paris, and that’s where they settled.</span> <span id="s71">My mother had, was a total of five children from her family, and my father had three, there were three brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Did you know your uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Yes, I know my uncles.</span> <span id="s74">They all settled here in the States, all wind up in the States.</span> <span id="s75">My father – well, my mother passed away in 1960 f – in 1975.</span> <span id="s76">That’s when we came to America, that’s another – you know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: We’ll get there, we’ll get there, we’ll get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s79">My father passed away in 1997.</span> <span id="s80">I found letters at that time that my father had corresponded, or da – my – his parents have corresponded with him from Poland, trying to get to Holland.</span> <span id="s81">And the letters were all in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: And what year were they written?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: 1933 and ’34.</span> <span id="s84">And I f – was trying to find an interpreter for those letters, and I did, through my child survivors group that I had joined in the 90s.</span> <span id="s85">And I had those letters interpreted the best that that person could, because she told me there was a lot of dialects of Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: And they’re writing that they needed money, like five – whatever the currency is –</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Zlotys?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Zlotys.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Slocky(ph).</span> <span id="s92">Five slocky(ph) to give to where they were renting a house.</span> <span id="s93">And they needed si – they were very, very poor.</span> <span id="s94">And by being very, very poor is why he sent his sons away.</span> <span id="s95">So, actually from 1920 on, ’28 on, my father never saw his parents and the parents never saw their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: What a hard thing it must have been for that fa – for your grandfather to do, because he didn’t – he didn't send them away cause he wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: He want – he wanted them to have a better life.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Have a better life, exactly, exactly.</span> <span id="s100">And – and then my father just found his –</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: [coughs] I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s102">So we’ll continue, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s104">So, my father, I had that picture at home of him getting off the train station, I – either Germany or wherever it’s at.</span> <span id="s105">So he settled in Holland, in Eindhoven.</span> <span id="s106">Somehow became eind – Eindhoven.</span> <span id="s107">And I – like I said, I believe that my mother’s parents came to Holland, and that’s how my parents met each other.</span> <span id="s108">My mother’s father was a – a le – dealing in leather goods.</span> <span id="s109">And then they wound up back in France, and like I said, my mother had five – family of five.</span> <span id="s110">She had one sister and three brothers.</span> <span id="s111">Three, four, five, yeah.</span> <span id="s112">Okay, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Now what do I say –</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: So let’s go ba – let’s go back to your father and his brothers.</span> <span id="s116">Did his brothers end up in Eindhoven as well, in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: One of them – the younger one did.</span> <span id="s118">Ther – they were two years apart.</span> <span id="s119">The older brother, Ted, he – I don’t know too much about him, how he wound up in America, but he hid on a ship or something like – as a cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: A stowaw –</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: A stowaway, yeah.</span> <span id="s122">And that’s how he came to America.</span> <span id="s123">And – and he’s the one who wound up sponsoring us.</span> <span id="s124">So, I have a picture, and it must have been before he wound up in America, when I’m a – a baby, and my parents are taking me – my father had a Ford, a car, and it must have been 1930 – probably 30 – late thes – ’37 or ’38, and they put me in the back of the car, like a little hammock.</span> <span id="s125">I mean, very safe.</span> <span id="s126">And I was – that’s how they traveled to Paris.</span> <span id="s127">And I have a picture of my Uncle Ted and my parents and me in Paris.</span> <span id="s128">And that’s where my mother’s family was, so they traveled to – to visit them.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: So, you know your grandfather’s push, your grandfather’s will got realized pretty early on, because for a young boy of 15 to leave a very poor place in Poland –</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: – in the late 20s, and within a decade to have a car, in those years was a huge thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s133">I don’t know what he was doing, I – that part, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s134">I also have a picture of a very nice, low house, because they’re all connected.</span> <span id="s135">And the way my mother was dressed, overall, they were doing very nicely, apparently.</span> <span id="s136">My father later on, and maybe that’s what he did early on, was in the hosiery and socks and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: So, you don’t know your father’s business when he – you know, you don’t know how he made a living when you were born?</span> <span id="s138">A: Before – no, no, I do not know.</span> <span id="s139">Never talked about it.</span> <span id="s140">And the problem is, I never asked questions.</span> <span id="s141">You know, children, we didn't ask questions.</span> <span id="s142">We had a nice – I was dressed very nicely, everything was fine.</span> <span id="s143">So when I saw the pictures, and they were still alive, and I just looked at the picture, oh how nice.</span> <span id="s144">But I never asked any questions.</span> <span id="s145">I was – I was a child, I just did what had to be done and I listened.</span> <span id="s146">And when the time came that I had to go into hiding, I don’t know if I asked why, but they always – I think they just gave a story, well, you’re gonna stay with – should I say the name?</span> <span id="s147">Yeah, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: No, let’s – let’s – le – we’ll get to there.</span> <span id="s149">I want to – what I want to ask you now is, what are your earliest memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: My earliest memories, actual, physical memories are from the hiding time.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: So you don’t remember your life before at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No, only what I see on a picture, but nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s153">My hiding life is –</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: But how old were you when you –</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Four and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Four and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yeah, cause this is the time, that picture that I showed you, just a little after that is July 1942, we had to go into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: So, what you learn about the – the background to going into hiding is everything from what is to – had been told to you later, okay, is that correct, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Yeah, that’s correct, that’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Then, in that case, can you tell me a little bit about what you had been told, and then we’ll get to your hiding experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: How did your parents explain – was it your mother or your father who told you, or both?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No, well, my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s166">She said that I had to go and live with these people and they were going to live with some other pe – they were gonna go away, not live, going away to – to be with these people, but they’ll come back to see me, and we’ll all be together again.</span> <span id="s167">And that’s a time that –</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Do you remember that date?</span> <span id="s169">I mean, di – not the date, do you remember being told this, at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: I – yes, tha-that’s when they took me to these people that they knew prior and arranged, made this arrangement that I would go be living with them.</span> <span id="s171">They had no children of their own, and – and they, like I said, would be coming back to take me home.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: And you remembered being brought there, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Oh yes, and I remember crying after them leaving, and they were crying and – and I ran after them.</span> <span id="s174">And the people that I stayed with, which I wound up calling Tante and Omaya(ph) are holding onto me and not letting me run too far, but yes, I remember that like yesterday.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Those are the memories I – I really have so strongly.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Well, that’s not surprising, in a – in a way, because for a child it’s so traumatic, when you already know who your mother and your father is –</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: And then – and that – you’ve never known what it’s like to not have them.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s181">No, we always seemed to have – I must have had a very good life because there’s nothing traumatic for me to – to remember.</span> <span id="s182">And it’s like children – like my own children, they don’t remember that time either.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s186">So, what can you tell me about – fi-first from your memory of the people that you were brought to –</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: – what kind of impressions you had.</span> <span id="s189">And then filling in some of the facts of what you learned later.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s191">The people that I was staying with was – I called her was Tanta Rowter(ph), that was her last name, a real Dutch name because sh – actually, she was German, but she had lived there for a long time and married this Dutch man called Yap(ph) Rowter(ph).</span> <span id="s192">And they were – had no children.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Were they older people?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: To – in my eyes, they were older, and they probably were in their maybe late 30s, early 40s.</span> <span id="s195">They were old people, because my parents were so much younger.</span> <span id="s196">Cause my father – my mother was born in 1912, 1912, and my mother was born in 1911.</span> <span id="s197">So in 1942 – well, maybe they were more or less the same age.</span> <span id="s198">But – so I st – I – I lived with them, I was to be their niece, and I had to live their way, their last name, their religion, which was – they didn’t really have much of religion, but there was Protestant.</span> <span id="s199">And I was going to be raised Catholic.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: They were Protestant and you were going to be raised Catholic?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Because they had a – a – a maid, a young girl, 18 or 19, she came every day.</span> <span id="s202">And she’s the one who taught me the Catholic-ism type of thing.</span> <span id="s203">And because that way I could go to the church and with – and go to school with the nuns.</span> <span id="s204">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And what wi – did you have another name?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Rowter(ph), Paula Rowter(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Pa – so you si – made –</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Just as Paula –</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: – it into Paula Rowter(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: – Rowter(ph), yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: And that was my name, and I went to school for about three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: At age four and a half you started –</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Well, now it’s five.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Age five, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s217">And I did the catechis – I – you know, I do remember this church and the nuns and the water that’s on the side, and – and I ha – I was so excited, this maid who was there, she gave me a rosary.</span> <span id="s218">Oh, and that was such a personal thing that was mine, you know.</span> <span id="s219">I don’t know if I knew that I had been, or was Jewish.</span> <span id="s220">I don’t know because I never dealt with that until afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Well, what was the maid’s name?</span> <span id="s222">What was she like?</span> <span id="s223">You don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: I don’t remember her name.</span> <span id="s225">It was a real Dutch name.</span> <span id="s226">And she was very nice, she helped me a lot and – and – and when I was living there with the tante, I was normal.</span> <span id="s227">I had a normal life.</span> <span id="s228">I guess I forgot about my parents, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Well, I wanted to ask you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Did you have any nightmares, did you cry for Momma, or – or – or Father?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: I don’t seem to remember that.</span> <span id="s233">But if I really think deeply and go back a lot, that I mu – I think I must have done that in the first few days, because my tante gave me a doll with a little carriage to, you know, keep me happy and to just divert my attention.</span> <span id="s234">And I think, you know, when I really go deep now that I’m talking to you about that, about my own past feelings and all that, I can see the carriage and I can see the doll.</span> <span id="s235">And also I can see her kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: What did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Was a big kitchen, a real bare room with a big, black stove.</span> <span id="s238">And she would be cooking with the maid, who would be helping.</span> <span id="s239">I was also with the maid now, helping her clean rooms.</span> <span id="s240">See, the people, they ran a boarding house, so they – it was a big house, and they had lots of rooms and the maid would work in the rooms, or clean the bed and the bathroom, and I would be helping her, becau –</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: That’s a na – I-I’m sorry to interrupt, but it’s a bit unusual.</span> <span id="s242">I mean, the first thing that strikes me is, oh my goodness, hiding a child in plain sight, because if you have a boarding house, you have a lot of people coming through.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yeah, but I was dur – her niece from – wherever that niece came from, where my tante was German, but I didn’t speak German, I spoke Dutch.</span> <span id="s244">So, the niece was either from the husband’s side, my Oma, cause he was perfectly Dutch, he was all Dutch.</span> <span id="s245">And I don’t know whose niece I was, but she always said I’m her niece.</span> <span id="s246">And like I said, I did go to school for a little bit, and I had a first communion, whatever that age was, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Seven – well, usually it’s age seven, but it could be earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: It had to be earlier, cause I was not allowed – the first few months I was out, they had children next door, the neighbor had children, a little boy and a girl, and I would play with them.</span> <span id="s249">And they had a, like a – they built a – where you go hide when the bombs come.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: A shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: A shelter, a shelter.</span> <span id="s252">And I would play with these children a few times, and then they start to ask questions of me.</span> <span id="s253">I was not blonde and blue-eyed, you know, I was dark haired.</span> <span id="s254">And they would say, are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s255">And I would ask my tante, what does that mean, am I Jewish?</span> <span id="s256">She says, now you can never go outside any longer, because the parents of those children –</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Were curious.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: – were – by talking.</span> <span id="s259">They also had that big shelter, which they dug down and that’s all sand, you know, like a – like a little [indecipherable] like a little mountain.</span> <span id="s260">And Tante had asked the parents if we could go in there if it needed, for the bombs, and they said no.</span> <span id="s261">They said no.</span> <span id="s262">So they were very anti.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: So, did you – when you – when you asked Tante, what does this mean, and I Jewish –</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: – and she said, you can’t go out there any more, did she also answer that you were Jewish, or did she tell you anything?</span> <span id="s266">A: No, no, no, she never told me that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s267">She says, you just cannot play with, those are not nice children, you cannot play with them.</span> <span id="s268">Okay, I’m a nice little girl and I listen.</span> <span id="s269">And she said, you cannot go outside any more, and I didn't ask.</span> <span id="s270">I was content in the house.</span> <span id="s271">And between her, she was very sweet to me, and my uncle, who was very nice, he – they had no children, they enjoyed – I would – I was allowed to go in the garden with my oma, cause he was growing vegetables.</span> <span id="s272">I remember that, and I was going with the maid to help clean the house, and I played with my doll.</span> <span id="s273">That’s what I called, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Okay, hang on a second, so you stayed home and you’d play with your dolls?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Or go out – was their garden visible to the other family, or was it walled?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yes, because there’s no walls.</span> <span id="s278">In Europe there’s no walls, at least in Holland at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No, they had a – a dirt area somewhere, I don’t know, because the back of their house had like a water, a little – not a river, but something that flowed, with beautiful Weeping Willows.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Oh, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: I’ll never forget the Weeping Willows, it was just so pretty.</span> <span id="s283">Her front yard had like a little fence full of roses.</span> <span id="s284">And the house was a very nice house, I – I – when I went back in 1985, I found it and I – but anyway, that’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: We’ll get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: We’ll get there.</span> <span id="s288">And you don’t remember feeling that somebody – something was taken from you that you couldn’t play with the children any more, you just accepted it and – and went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Did you continue going to school, to the Catholic school?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: No, at that time I couldn’t do anything any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Because of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Because of this.</span> <span id="s294">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: So they kept you in the house.</span> <span id="s296">However, during the few months that you had been there they had gotten you –</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: – they had gotten you to take first communion?</span> <span id="s299">That’s a huge thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: That’s a huge thing is right, but I could not go outside any more after those children.</span> <span id="s301">Maybe it was a little longer period than what I’m remembering, because I remember going to the nuns, and I think the nun knew who I was.</span> <span id="s302">But they were very nice, very sweet, but I remember doing that, and then I remember I couldn’t do anything any more, I had to stay inside.</span> <span id="s303">And it got heavier, I think, when the Germans got more prominent there.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: And did they become more prominent there?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: How did this take – how did this unfold?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: My – because of my tante and omaya(ph) having this big house – excuse me – the – they had to take in an SS officer.</span> <span id="s308">He had to live in because they had the room.</span> <span id="s309">And that’s how heavy it got when he is there and I’m there.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Did you – were – do you have memories of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: What did he look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: I don’t have a face.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Just a uniform.</span> <span id="s316">Ugly black, horrible black, black uniform with big, black boots.</span> <span id="s317">Those uniform and the boots are with me 24/7 if I allow it to come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: I don’t know his face.</span> <span id="s320">Very scary, cause I’m in the house there with people and so on, and now we have this guy there.</span> <span id="s321">I sit on his lap, he puts me on his lap, I talk to him like a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: So you remember doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: And do you remember being scared while you were on the lap?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: On and off.</span> <span id="s326">I kind of got to know him, you know, he was there fo – seemed to me for a long time.</span> <span id="s327">Til the end.</span> <span id="s328">He was there until the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: And you don’t remember his face?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: No, I have no vision of his face.</span> <span id="s331">I-I either didn’t – don’t want to remember it – I don’t know, because to me the – the uniform is all I know, is the uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: And did you – did your – did he seem – why was he scary to you?</span> <span id="s333">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Because I have never seen a person with a uniform like that.</span> <span id="s335">I mean, that’s a horrible thing, I – I am young, and I was – lived in a nice area at home, there was no uniforms.</span> <span id="s336">Tante didn’t have any uniforms.</span> <span id="s337">The people that lived there were no uniforms.</span> <span id="s338">And then comes this guy with the – the boots, you know, and it click-clacked the way it – that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: And nobody told you that this is someone to take – this is someone to be careful around?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: No, they wanted me to be just casual, because I’m – you know, and I was taught, and being me, I was told never say what your real last name is, and just I’m your tante and I’m your oma, you’re just living here with – with me.</span> <span id="s341">And that – that was it.</span> <span id="s342">He did have other ones, other soldiers came to the house.</span> <span id="s343">When that happened, when other SS officers came to the house, I had to go to the basement.</span> <span id="s344">I wasn’t allowed to be around, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: It could be for many reasons, I mean, i-if a child –</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: – is told that it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re in mortal danger, it means we have too many people in the house, children have to go upstairs.</span> <span id="s348">Was that kind of the – or downstairs –</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Some – yeah, downstairs.</span> <span id="s350">Just something, you know, there’s too much, and that they’re talking and all that, and you’ll just be in their way.</span> <span id="s351">So I had to go in the basement, and I took my dolly and my – my – my – I forgot the name of it now – the rosacal – what do you call –</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: The rosary.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Rosary, yes, that was always with me.</span> <span id="s354">The rosary was my savior.</span> <span id="s355">I was taught that that’s my savior.</span> <span id="s356">Whenever there’s something bad, I need to pray with this rosary.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Did you – did you learn prayers?</span> <span id="s358">A: I learned prayers, I don’t remember them, cause right the war was over, I did away with all that, and I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: But you learned them at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: But I remember having them in my hand, and knowing how to inter – interlink them in my fingers, and making the cross, and had my little dolly.</span> <span id="s361">And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: And how long did you live at the fa – with the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Did you ever see your real parents during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No.</span> <span id="s368">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: That’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: That’s amazing, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: That’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: – I didn’t see them, I didn't – I might have asked my tante a few times, and after that I became so much like a child, well, now you’re living with somebody else.</span> <span id="s373">This is your life now.</span> <span id="s374">This is how you have to survive, and this is – this is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: How would you describe yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: As very timid at that time.</span> <span id="s377">Not today, but at that time.</span> <span id="s378">And always listening to what I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: A good girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: A very good girl, yes, and I s – good girl.</span> <span id="s381">Had the big bow in my hair, you know, all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: And did photo –</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: And whatever they did for me – told me to do, I would do, go with him – Tante, go with Omaya(ph) now and this and that.</span> <span id="s384">Or go with – now I wish I remember the name of that cleaning lady – that mai-maid, or whatever they called her.</span> <span id="s385">Yeah, I was.</span> <span id="s386">I’m getting emotional.</span> <span id="s387">I have – I have not been emotional about this, because I’m emotional about something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: What about this brings it up?</span> <span id="s389">A: I don’t know, about the way I was when I was a little girl, that’s all I remember.</span> <span id="s390">And maybe cause I miss – miss the people I lived with.</span> <span id="s391">They were – they were nice.</span> <span id="s392">And you know, when you talk about every little detail, brings back memories, and my state of my – my being at the moment is very touchy because I lost my husband seven months ago, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: – I think that’s why I’m more emotional than I usually am.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Well, we’re also talking about losses.</span> <span id="s396">And so, we’re starting from the beginning where there are attachments, and then there are losses.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: You know, and that’s the – when you’re a child – I remember growing up – you know, one of our roles is to talk as little as possible, but you know, the – the – it creates a frustration.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Because when you have somebody telling you things, you want to say oh yes, and this reminds me of this.</span> <span id="s401">Well, let me share with you what this reminds me of.</span> <span id="s402">I remember growing up and hearing how much parents love children, you know.</span> <span id="s403">I grew up in – in a family where I was loved, and hearing about parents love children.</span> <span id="s404">And when I had my own child, this revelation happened, that when I would walk in the room, her face lit up.</span> <span id="s405">When I’d come home from work, she would jump up and down in her crib.</span> <span id="s406">And I realized, it’s a two way street.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: That ch – that love that that child is giving me is real, and I feel it and it energizes me, and it is amazing and it is pure.</span> <span id="s409">And there’s no farce to it whatsoever, it is genuine.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: And so when I hear you speak about the people that you were living with, I imagine a little girl who’s a good child, who does as she’s told, who has this inherent trust that she is being protected by good forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s413">And now, that’s exactly the feeling that it is and that’s bringing tears to my eyes because I can’t imagine that – that all that happened.</span> <span id="s414">But you know, I remember so much of that period, and so much of afterwards, too.</span> <span id="s415">But I think it’s a little bit because of my –</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Also you’re going through another loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Huge loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s423">My sympathy to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Oh, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s426">Are there any other memories that you can come to mi – that come to mind whe – through that time that you were with this – with Tante Rowter(ph), and Oma Riap(ph)?</span> <span id="s427">Any other people in the boarding house besides the – the black suited SS man?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Yeah, there was a – there was a man there and there was a woman there.</span> <span id="s429">I don’t know their names, but I remember, vaguely, their faces.</span> <span id="s430">See, I remember their faces, I remember this girl, the maid, her face, but not this SS officer’s face.</span> <span id="s431">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: That’s really uncanny, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: So maybe inside of me I knew it was danger, because this man with boots and a uniform, that would represent to any child –</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Scary, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: But – and for you in particular, really scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yeah, exactly.</span> <span id="s440">I mean, I don’t know if we’re ready for the end of it, because of something that – that he did at the end, how –</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Well, tell u – tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: – when the war ended.</span> <span id="s443">Well, during the war, I – I – with the bombing, two doors down, there was another shelter there, and those people let us in because we did have the bombing scares, and we were in the shelter, and all of us, the people th –</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Were these allied bombers?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: No – ye – yes.</span> <span id="s446">Well no, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s447">No, I think there’s – German?</span> <span id="s448">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: That part I don’t know, I – all I know is bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: And we all went in there and I remember in that shelter, I prayed like anything, because the girl was with me and I went – boy, I went to town and prayed and prayed and prayed that we wouldn't get hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: With the prayers from the rosary?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yeah, with the rosary and the whole thing.</span> <span id="s455">Yes, I remember that.</span> <span id="s456">I remember the shelter cause they had like shelves of beds, you know, in there in case we had to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: A big shelter, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yes, a big shelter.</span> <span id="s459">And when it was over, the raid was over, the house next door to Tante, that got bombed, but we did not, our house was saved.</span> <span id="s460">So, I – all that praying I did helped our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: I’m sure of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s463">So, when they ended the war, the two and a half years have gone – well, no – yeah, it must have been at that time, he – he had to leave, of course.</span> <span id="s464">And when he left, we stood at the front door, and that’s another vision I have, just right now.</span> <span id="s465">My tante is here, I’m over here, he is outside facing me, and he’s looking right at me.</span> <span id="s466">And his finger comes up, and he says, Paula, now you can go free.</span> <span id="s467">Now, he’s speaking German, and my tante knows German.</span> <span id="s468">And I’m standing there and he says, you can go free.</span> <span id="s469">After he leaves, tante looks at me, because now I’m – I’m seven, and she says, he knew.</span> <span id="s470">He knew.</span> <span id="s471">Now I know that I’m Jewish because I’m seve – I’m older, maybe they told me, or – and then she says, he knew that you were here hiding, or something, another word that she said.</span> <span id="s472">And that’s what he said, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: And you remember him saying this?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, I remember him standing there, I don’t see a face, I see that uniform and that finger coming right at me, pointing.</span> <span id="s475">He says, Paula, you can go free.</span> <span id="s476">So this guy either had a heart, either he has his own child, cause I did sit on his lap, and he didn't turn me or them or anybody in this whole household in.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Who knows, maybe he was the protector of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: And then I thought maybe all my praying worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: There would be people who will say, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s481">I [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Because such things are mir – such things are miracles.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: You know.</span> <span id="s485">And when you – when y – when you heard that, did you have a certain feeling?</span> <span id="s486">Did you freeze, did you kind of go numb?</span> <span id="s487">Do you remember, like, what feeling unmasks –</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Well, I remember I couldn’t understand, I didn’t quite comprehend what all that meant.</span> <span id="s489">So, I’m sure I talked to Tante about that and I think what she said is now, pretty soon, Mommy and Daddy are gonna come –</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: To get you.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: – to get you, yeah.</span> <span id="s492">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: So, she must have known they’re still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: She must have, because she knew that they were coming at a certain day.</span> <span id="s495">So, either they were able to, through their hiding place – places, they had several hiding places – my father had a fight with a German soldier on top – on the roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s497">We can get to that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: [indecipherable] yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: But they must have known how to get in touch with each other, one way or the other, to say this and this date, you know, they’re gonna come and get you.</span> <span id="s501">But I remember in the house, when it became close to the liberation time, we went – it was e – nighttime I’m not – evening time, it was very dark out, and we went up on the – they had little windows up in the attic, and I guess they heard on the news or something that the liberators were coming.</span> <span id="s502">And they were going to come by parachute out of the plane in Sun, s-u-n, that’s a name of a little town near Eindhoven.</span> <span id="s503">So we all went up there, I remember that, looking out the window and there’s all these white parachutes, one after another, after another, after another, and we were so happy to see that, cause they were going to liberate us, and – and if you watch the movie, the – “The Longest Day” –</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: – with the Battle of the Bulge and all that, and they talk about Eindhoven and they talk about the parachutes coming down.</span> <span id="s506">So when I see that movie and – and wait for that particular scene, it just all comes right back and there’s just such a great feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: America, och, America, then the soldiers walking down the street and the English ones, the Americans and they give you the chocolate and – and they’re wearing nice uniforms, not this ugly, terrible black uniform and oh – that – whenever I would see soldiers, you know, walking around and all that, I just felt oh, they’re – they’re my savior.</span> <span id="s509">They’re – they’re – they’re wonderful, wonderful people, you know, you can trust them.</span> <span id="s510">You couldn’t trust the ugly ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: No.</span> <span id="s513">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: So when did your parents come?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Well, they came, it was 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Do you remember the –</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: They did not come when Holland was liberated in ’44.</span> <span id="s518">We weren’t always – I think, not sure that we were free s – until the war actually was over.</span> <span id="s519">And when Tante says, now we’re gonna go outside and wait for them on the street.</span> <span id="s520">And the time came, there they were.</span> <span id="s521">A lot of people walking around now and all that, and they came down the street, and I ran to them, I knew them.</span> <span id="s522">And they ran to me and that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Oh God.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: – just a – yeah, they made it and I made it and that was a great feeling, very healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Did you feel – when you saw them again, yes, I know you?</span> <span id="s526">A: Mm-hm, oh yeah, absolutely.</span> <span id="s527">And they had said they will come back, and they did.</span> <span id="s528">And that was – I must say, they stayed a few days at Tante’s house until they could find a place for us to move into.</span> <span id="s529">But that was the last time that I was their little girl.</span> <span id="s530">The feeling of parents and children.</span> <span id="s531">Because either what they went through – never talked about what they went through, except that only – later on they talked about it in – in – when we were here in America, my father would say a few things, and told me what happened to him.</span> <span id="s532">But at that time they had to find the place, they had to go back and make a living, and there was no closeness.</span> <span id="s533">The closeness was gone.</span> <span id="s534">I hav – was so close with Tanta and Omaya(ph), I didn’t have that closeness with them, either because the two and a half years of separation, and I am now a little more grown and loved the way I ha – was being treated for those two and a half years.</span> <span id="s535">Now I’m with my parents, who have nothing, and they can’t give all that feeling any more.</span> <span id="s536">And from then on in, life got hard, life was tough, versus the two and a half years that I had to endure the basement and all that.</span> <span id="s537">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: In what ways was it tough?</span> <span id="s539">How was it tough?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: It was tough because they were so much in their own, with their own problems that they had, and not knowing how to really deal with me, to – in other words, to pick up from the day that they, you know, left me, until the day I – I – we – we were together.</span> <span id="s541">The – the feelings just was okay, we have to eat now, we have to do this now and you have to go to school now and – but nothing – I don’t remember any, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Warmth.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: – all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s546">And then my mother got pregnant, so now I have a little brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Before we do that –</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: When you moved away from ta – did you – did you move – then they stayed with Tante and Omaya(ph) for a few days, and then you moved away with them.</span> <span id="s550">Did you go – did you move far?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: It wasn’t a – yes, from – well, in Eindhoven, you know, nothing is far like it is here, but still, yeah it was a different area, trying to find where they could somehow – home – they had homes with upstairs and downstairs and – or even three times up.</span> <span id="s552">This family was willing to ta – give us part of a – a floor, and I’m sure my father had to pay.</span> <span id="s553">And how all that worked I have no idea, it never was discussed about money and nothing – and I feel bad that I didn’t ask later on, you know, these things and what can I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: But that means like, when you were – I – I guess what I’m asking an-and I’m wondering, is that when you’d have, let’s say, a lonely moment and you’re with your parents, did you have the ability and possibility to go back to Tante and spend the afternoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: I could have, but it was a long walk.</span> <span id="s556">I didn’t have a bike yet, so that was a long walk.</span> <span id="s557">That’s another thing.</span> <span id="s558">Yeah, then we moved somewhere else, I’ll tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: No, at this – this place is just – this was called Willem de Zwijgerstraat.</span> <span id="s561">My husband Bernie and I went there, I know exactly the window and everything.</span> <span id="s562">No, it was like a bad area of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: But, it was not far from the street that we had lived in prior to the war, Nassaustraat.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: And this is Willem de Zwijgerstraat, you can see from Nassaustraat the place that we wound up living after the war.</span> <span id="s567">So that, from there wasn’t – you know, that was in the same area.</span> <span id="s568">So I think maybe that’s why my parents wound up in that area, cause they knew – and where my tante lived, there was a little nicer area.</span> <span id="s569">It was separate houses.</span> <span id="s570">This was like all low houses and it was a different area.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And – but did you see them then, afterwards?</span> <span id="s574">Did you go visit them?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: I saw them.</span> <span id="s576">We did not stay long in this particular place, cause it was a bad – neighbors and a – we didn’t.</span> <span id="s577">So my father found this other house called binnin – in the Binnaeusstraat, which was close to Tante’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: And one of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Mm-hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: – I could go, and I walked very often to Tante’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: So you – you didn't have a total cutoff?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No, my parents played bridge with them.</span> <span id="s584">So, I don’t know if they knew them before the war, or if they became friends after the war.</span> <span id="s585">That I don’t know, but they spend New Year’s together, they played bridge at their house or our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: So, there was – and they got along well, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: See, some other people have said that sometimes there was some tension between the people wh-who saved or hid the children, and the parents who returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Either because one was – the parents were unsure –</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Unsure.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: – and the – or the people didn’t want to let go, or – or whatever.</span> <span id="s593">And you didn’t have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yeah, I can understand that, not – not – not that I know of, because they knew each other and they – like I said, they got together, played bridge, I remember.</span> <span id="s595">That’s when we lived – yeah, in Binnaeusstraat, I’m pretty sure.</span> <span id="s596">Or was it – I don’t know which house it was in.</span> <span id="s597">No, I was older, it had to be Binnaeusstraat.</span> <span id="s598">They would pull up the rug.</span> <span id="s599">My uncle was there, Omaya(ph), Tante and my parents, listening to the radio, putting up music, and they danced.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: How nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: And that’s how I learned – my Omaya(ph) taught me how to dance, me standing on his feet, and I learned how to dance the foxtrot, and the English waltz.</span> <span id="s602">And I’m now – oh, I’m eight or nine or 10 or something like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s605">That was nice, but then it also – that was a nice day or something, but the regular days, going to school was not nice, because I was the only Jewish girl, and everybody made fun of me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s608">So the years after were not –</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: So why did they – I mean, da – Holland has such a reputation –</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: – of being open and tolerant, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Well, there were a lot of them that weren’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: There’s a lot of them that weren’t.</span> <span id="s615">There were a lot of people who got turned in by – we were very, very fortunate.</span> <span id="s616">And – and Tante dealt with it very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: What was it like in school, what were the kids saying?</span> <span id="s618">Do you have memories of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Well, they wouldn’t talk to me because I looked different for some reason, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s620">And they weren’t – especially the boys, they were nasty, yeah.</span> <span id="s621">Some of the girls were okay.</span> <span id="s622">I have a book, they call it a poetsy(ph), it’s – you ges – it’s like a poem book that all – everybody in school would get that, with little paste things, stick-ums that you put in there and then you write a little poem of the person that – you know, like you do at high school here –</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: – they – they write –</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Autograph books and things.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: – something like that.</span> <span id="s627">And I do have that book with – there were two girls that lived around the corner in Willem de Zwijgerstraat when I first started school.</span> <span id="s628">Her name – one was Anika(ph), and there was a little redhead, ri-wi – Rita, I think her name was, something like that.</span> <span id="s629">And they wrote in my book.</span> <span id="s630">But I would never want – went to their house, I couldn’t associate with them, so only at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Sounds like a lonely chil – a lonely time.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s633">Oh, I was very much by myself, very much.</span> <span id="s634">And then when my brother and sister came along, I had to take care of them.</span> <span id="s635">Now, we’re nine and 11 years difference.</span> <span id="s636">And if I wanted to go outside and did play with the marbles, you know, the little children’s play, I had to take my brother with me.</span> <span id="s637">I was always like a caretaker of them, and I had to help.</span> <span id="s638">I never had a time, you know, by ourselves.</span> <span id="s639">Later on, we got a little older, the Jewish area built up a little bit, and there was a youth group area, and that’s where I met this girl named Frieda.</span> <span id="s640">And a lot of the Dutch people know her too, and she knows a lot of people.</span> <span id="s641">And we’ve been in touch ever since, together.</span> <span id="s642">But the only nice time I had with a girlfriend, and that was her, because she was Jewish, and she lived quite far away, but I had a bike then, and we’d bike to her.</span> <span id="s643">And she had little cooking utensils and we would cook applesauce from scratch.</span> <span id="s644">That was a big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Sounds like fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Yeah, it was fun, but then, that was a day of having a nice day, but the rest of the time, this – in Willem de Zwijgerstraat, the house that we were in was right on the corner and there was train tracks right next to it.</span> <span id="s647">And several times the train would stop, and it was loaded with coal.</span> <span id="s648">So I had to go and get a – a pail and [indecipherable] and climb up in the train – and everybody else did that, mostly guys – and I had to climb up there and steal the coal, so we would have coal in the house.</span> <span id="s649">Now, the train must have stopped there maybe for a purpose, I don’t know, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: No, not fun.</span> <span id="s651">Not fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: – I was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s653">Not fun.</span> <span id="s654">I didn’t have a teenage years.</span> <span id="s655">There was nothing about me, you know.</span> <span id="s656">Very, very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Were y – did you get on with your parents in a different way, or was there distance, they were too busy, or – tell us – tell me a little bit about how – how that went, how that evolved.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: You know something, I don’t know any details, but I remember my two and a half years with Tante.</span> <span id="s659">My – the rest of my years before I came here is mostly what I remember ome – you know, ask my mother, I want to go after school, go and play with them.</span> <span id="s660">No, you have to do this, and you have to take care of your brother and you have to take care of your sister.</span> <span id="s661">Or you have to help me, and you have to do this and you have to do that.</span> <span id="s662">That’s all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: No fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: I don’t remember no closeness, where my mother say, oh let’s go shopping, just you and I, let’s go, you know.</span> <span id="s665">No, because my father was gone basically seven days a week, earning a living, trying to earn a living by selling his socks and so on, on the mart, different cities.</span> <span id="s666">On the weekend, on Saturdays, I would have to go with him, because you have to unpack the pack.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: So you weren't religious?</span> <span id="s668">It wasn’t if –</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: No, no, there was no religion.</span> <span id="s670">She never benched th-the light, the candles –</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: What does that mean?</span> <span id="s672">Ah-hah, she didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: [indecipherable] no.</span> <span id="s674">I’ve never done it either.</span> <span id="s675">I do remember going to a temple, I do.</span> <span id="s676">Another thing is I remember I was being taught by a rabbi to read Hebrew.</span> <span id="s677">And that’s when we moved to Binnaeusstraat.</span> <span id="s678">I was a little older, and I remember going to the temple once.</span> <span id="s679">But no, nothing for holidays, except Friday night we had chicken soup, you know, and Paula gets the – the – I got a – a polka – a leg and a neck, that’s what I got.</span> <span id="s680">But see, my wardrobe consists of two of this and two of that, and that was it.</span> <span id="s681">Little skirt and a little top, I don’t remember my mother taking me shopping or anyth – I don’t remember any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: How sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Because the other part overtook that, always having to take care of them, that I just was –</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: You were gone.</span> <span id="s685">You weren’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: I wasn’t – I was just there to be – for that purpose.</span> <span id="s687">I didn’t have that closeness being the daughter, the first daughter, you know.</span> <span id="s688">And that’s – could very well be because of what my parents went through, and I’m sure that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Did they – when di – did they ever talk to you about any of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: No.</span> <span id="s691">No.</span> <span id="s692">Oh, you don’t know, and you don’t need to know, or you don’t remember anything, you were too young, and – nothing.</span> <span id="s693">So either they were protecting me, I don’t know why, you know, that’s – I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: A lot of people thi – a lot of people – I – I think that this is something that comes up a lot in – in future relations after some traumatic event.</span> <span id="s695">A-And it’s more than trauma.</span> <span id="s696">I mean, it is – it is when people have been subjected to humiliations.</span> <span id="s697">When people have been stretched to their limit, they think that – that if they don’t say something, they can keep that kind of vulnerability from the children –</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: – and maybe their children will be protected from it.</span> <span id="s700">But then another hole develops, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: In that child, or in the relationship, that there’s a silence there.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: And – and it’s hard.</span> <span id="s705">It’s hard, I think, to know when is the rent – when is the right time?</span> <span id="s706">Am I damaging my child if I say something?</span> <span id="s707">Am I going to lose it if I say something?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s709">So, I know that all the time I lived in Holland, I would never say that I was Jewish, I would never talk to anybody about it.</span> <span id="s710">I tried to assimilate or be like everybody else, but yet, I knew I was different, because there the fi – the girls at school, their – their way of doing things, the way the ate, the way they – their behavior was so different than mine.</span> <span id="s711">I had uns – not really n – realizing it, I had this stuff on my shoulder of what happened to me, and I could not talk about that.</span> <span id="s712">So, I always was different, and that took me a long, long, long time to get out of it.</span> <span id="s713">The only time I could – finally got out of it is when I joined the survivor, the child survivors’ group.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: That’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Before that – a very long time.</span> <span id="s716">Not until the early 90s.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: That’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s719">I would not talk, I worked and I – and – and people find out, oh, you’re – you’re from Holland.</span> <span id="s720">Yes.</span> <span id="s721">Were you there during the war?</span> <span id="s722">Yes.</span> <span id="s723">Well, what happened?</span> <span id="s724">Nothing.</span> <span id="s725">You know.</span> <span id="s726">How I’d never wear a Jewish star, I – I have o – I have them, but I wouldn't wear them.</span> <span id="s727">I’d – never the identification that I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s728">And that only – even in America, you know, at the beginning, I wouldn’t say that I was – not Jewish, but in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Take me up to the point where you’re already an adult – I mean, if there is more t-to add to, teenage years or other events that you want to remember, or something significant about your parents and – and – and what happened during the war years, fine –</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: No, I just – I think I – I kind of talked about that, because they wound up being friends and they s – you know, played cards together and – and – well, we just had a very simple life, nothing exciting, it was just surviving life.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: And you came to the United States in 19 seven –</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: ’50 – ’53.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Oh, in 1953?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: ’53, with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Oh, I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: So, you left Holland fairly early on?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Yes, I was 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s743">So then my Uncle Ted, who had gotten here somehow –</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: – from New York, he wound up in California, and he sponsored my father, for us to come.</span> <span id="s746">And so we came in ’53.</span> <span id="s747">We took the – the – my father came in 1952, he –</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: To set the – s-see – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: To see [indecipherable] yeah, to see how it’s gonna work.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: And then my parents, my mother had to sell the furniture they had.</span> <span id="s752">I don’t know how they got all this furniture back after the war, or I don’t know anything about that.</span> <span id="s753">So we came on the – we first went to Paris, her family lived in Paris, so, to say goodbye.</span> <span id="s754">And – oh, during the – before that, when I was younger, my mother sent me to Paris to live – to visit my grandparents.</span> <span id="s755">Now, my grandparents spoke French and Yiddish, I spoke Dutch.</span> <span id="s756">I understand Yiddish, but I can’t speak Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: When you were a baby, was it – did they speak to you in Dutch, your parents, or in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s758">Before the war.</span> <span id="s759">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: You just know that you spoke Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: I know I spoke Dutch and I could understand Yiddish, from hearing it from them, I suppose.</span> <span id="s767">So I – I did spend a week in Paris with my gram – grandparents, and we couldn’t really communicate.</span> <span id="s768">So we went – before we left to come to America, we went to Paris and – to say goodbye, and board the Île de France ship.</span> <span id="s769">And we took the ship across; took about seven days I believe.</span> <span id="s770">And me with motion sickness, that didn't work too well, but – so we got to New York.</span> <span id="s771">My mother’s girlfriend from Europe, who lived now in New York, picked us up and we stayed for one day and then we caught the train to go to California.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: And we were on a train and with my little brother and my little sister and me, so I had to deal with that.</span> <span id="s774">And then we come to Los Angeles, and my uncle and my father pick us up, and they drive us to this – the mountains, which is unbelievable to see, huge.</span> <span id="s775">It was very scary, because Holland, you know, is flat.</span> <span id="s776">So the drive – we come to this area where my uncle had a quote, a ranch, he ca – which he called the Bar Mitzvah ranch.</span> <span id="s777">He had a cow, skinny than anything, and several animals, and chickens, and that was the ranch.</span> <span id="s778">So we come now there, and my father had a trailer there, small trailer that he was living in, and now there’s four of us.</span> <span id="s779">No – yeah, four of us coming and – in that trailer.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: In the trailer.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Of course there’s no room.</span> <span id="s782">Paula wound up living in the house.</span> <span id="s783">I had a room that my Tante Ted’s wife, Clair, and she took me under her wing.</span> <span id="s784">She told me, you gotta get a haircut, you gotta take off these little gold earrings, they’re childish and you gotta grow up now.</span> <span id="s785">Okay.</span> <span id="s786">So, ti – they sent us to school, I went into the eighth grade just for a few months, cause we came in March of ’53.</span> <span id="s787">And I went to this eighth grades class, where they assigned one of the pupils that sit next to me, to kind of teach me what’s going on.</span> <span id="s788">Now, I had some English, a little knowledge, cause at school in Holland, the – the high school there, you learn all these languages.</span> <span id="s789">I learned Dutch – of course, Dutch; English; French and German.</span> <span id="s790">Which I hated.</span> <span id="s791">So – so, come September, we’re moving now to this town called Lancaster, California and my father now has a chicken ranch, 20,000 chickens.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Oh, my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Tiny baby chicks, and he’s raising chickens.</span> <span id="s794">That becomes his livelihood in the States, where he was more of a businessman.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Poultry farmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s797">And he buys this property with a house, one bedroom.</span> <span id="s798">And now, you know, the five of us.</span> <span id="s799">So, my brother, sister are small and they live – they sleep on a couch that makes into a bed.</span> <span id="s800">That house had like a little outhouse, not a bath, but an outhouse there, just a – a little room, and that’s where I’m – I’m at.</span> <span id="s801">There’s no heat, no air conditioning.</span> <span id="s802">They did have some light that they hooked up from the laundry room, which was next to the garage.</span> <span id="s803">And that’s where I’m now.</span> <span id="s804">I have no – I have nothing of me, I’m just always being outcast, you know.</span> <span id="s805">Okay, Paula, you do this Paula, that, and – and I had to work in the chicken house before school.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: The minute you – yeah, the minute you said to – you said to me he was a poultry farmer, I thought, oh my gosh, that’s labor intensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s808">And everyday before school, after school, seven days a week, I had to help feed the chickens.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: I would have thought, I can’t wait to get away from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: And it was all manual.</span> <span id="s811">Eventually he wound up getting automatic feeders and automatic water, but not while I was there.</span> <span id="s812">And – and my little brother, who’s six, he also had to start helping.</span> <span id="s813">And the school, we had to go by bus to school, and I had never the opportunity to go with some of the friends, or girls at the school, to go to a movie, or visiting them, or spending time with –</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Being a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: – girls, being a teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s818">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s819">When I was in Holland –</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Did you have fights with your parents, or were you so quiet you just kind of gave up?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: I didn't fight, because it didn’t lead to anything, I still have to do what I – what I had to do.</span> <span id="s822">I told them I didn’t like it, but I had to help support, you know, the livelihood.</span> <span id="s823">I also, across the street, there was a family there that had no children, and she needed somebody to clean the house.</span> <span id="s824">So, besides doing the chickens and all that, I went there, but I loved it, because it was an American house.</span> <span id="s825">She had a piano, and I was able to do a little piano.</span> <span id="s826">And I, for lunch she would make me a sandwich on this nice bread, and I got to drink a Coke.</span> <span id="s827">And so, I enjoyed that, that was my enjoyment.</span> <span id="s828">Yeah, I’m a teenager.</span> <span id="s829">She’d be doing so many other things, and this is what I was doing.</span> <span id="s830">So I was really kept back and I became a late bloomer.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Did you go to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s835">I – I got married right after high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: To Bernie?</span> <span id="s837">How’d you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Lancaster had the beginning of a temple in – in a house.</span> <span id="s839">And we did go to that, because we got to meet people there, you have a congregation.</span> <span id="s840">There’s a woman there, when she saw a new girl in the group, there was a – I think there was one – one boy there, Matt was his name, who went to high school, and I went to high school there and she was going to try and fix me up.</span> <span id="s841">You know, in those days, you got married very early.</span> <span id="s842">So she was trying to fix me up and she found Bernie.</span> <span id="s843">Shall I talk about how he got to Lancaster?</span> <span id="s844">He was new y – he comes from New York, the Bronx.</span> <span id="s845">He comes from a – a six kids family.</span> <span id="s846">And he came to visit his brother, who lived in Lancaster and worked at Edwards Air Force base, Lou.</span> <span id="s847">And he came in November of ’54, got off the plane, dressed with the – it was so cold in New York and he comes to California, his brother picks him up in shorts and sandal and hawa – a shirt, a Hawaiian shirt.</span> <span id="s848">He turns and he tells him – and he calls his mother when he got settled, I’m never coming back to New York, cause this is wonderful.</span> <span id="s849">Anyway, he gets a job in haberdashery, in men’s clothing, and this lady, Belle Miska(ph) found him at the store, at – Herman’s was the name of the store, and she s-says, oh, I have a girl for you.</span> <span id="s850">And he was 24, and now I’m 17.</span> <span id="s851">So, she wound up at – in a – a meeting for her – for me and him, and so that’s how we met.</span> <span id="s852">And I invited him to my graduation and he took me out, I had my first shrimp dinner.</span> <span id="s853">And I’m 17, and I’m still a little unaware of anything, I don’t know a thing that’s going on in life, I’m so uck.</span> <span id="s854">But I got – we got engaged on my birthday in September, and we got married in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: So, it was a six months togetherness, and he would come and visit us every Sunday in the afternoon and – anyway, so I got out of that house.</span> <span id="s857">I could not deal with it.</span> <span id="s858">It was either that, my Aunt Clair, who had moved away from the Bar Mitzvah ranch to the San Fernando Valley, I was gonna go live with her and go to college, one – one way or the other.</span> <span id="s859">So that’s how I met Bernie.</span> <span id="s860">And I had a whole new life, and it’s – then it was good, and it was good for 52 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Oh, that’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: That’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s864">How many children did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Three sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Martin, Danny and Joel, and I have two grandsons from Danny, and their names are Aaron and Kevin, and they are now 18 and 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Too young to be a grandmother o-of grown boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Well, yeah, see, I got married so young, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: – and wanted to have a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: When did you learn about what your parents had gone through?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: In Lancaster, later on in years, when – of course when I was married, and we would visit, and somehow it’s – we talked a little bit.</span> <span id="s874">I started to ask some questions of them.</span> <span id="s875">My mother would never talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Were they together in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yes, they were together, so I think she let him, if he did talk, you know.</span> <span id="s878">And he would mention some names of where they were, but they went to different houses, because they got turned in.</span> <span id="s879">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Oh, they – someone betrayed them?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Yes, yes, several times.</span> <span id="s882">And they ran acro – from ups – from the attic, cause they were in the attics, they climbed out the window, on the roof, and ran to other houses, to get back down, out in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: And is it on one of those roofs that he met this –</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: So – yes, on one of them he told my mother to keep on running, and he wound up fighting with a soldier.</span> <span id="s885">Now, he had a billy club, and I don’t know if the soldier had a gun or not, because there was no shooting involved, but there was fighting, and the soldier hit my father on the nose with the billy club, and it was bleeding very heavily.</span> <span id="s886">And somehow, with however it went, he got away from that soldier.</span> <span id="s887">And were – and then they wound up at other places, but I don’t know anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Of their – nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Of their – no, no, I have no information.</span> <span id="s890">And that’s all he ever talked about.</span> <span id="s891">He only talked about his heroism of fighting that soldier.</span> <span id="s892">But otherwise, I – I don’t know anything else.</span> <span id="s893">And that’s all he talked about, you know, that particular scene, over and over and over.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: It really sounds that there wasn’t much closeness between yourself and your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: What a grief.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s898">Even when my brother and si-sister were older, and my sister would come and visit my mother with her children or so on, my mother would call me and say oh – my sister’s name is Helen – Helen is here today.</span> <span id="s899">Now, I have three sons and – and I’m working full time.</span> <span id="s900">I said, oh, that’s nice.</span> <span id="s901">And my mother would say – see, that’s just the conversation I remem – remember – she would say, why don’t you come over?</span> <span id="s902">And I said, well, I’m busy with the kids, I’m doing the wash and I have to go grocery shopping, all this and that.</span> <span id="s903">I said, why doesn’t she come here and visit me?</span> <span id="s904">Well, she has one of the babies, they’re sleeping, the babies are sleeping.</span> <span id="s905">I said, so?</span> <span id="s906">You have the baby in the carriage or wherever you traveled, you know.</span> <span id="s907">What difference does that make?</span> <span id="s908">My mother would always stand up for my younger sister.</span> <span id="s909">And there was never any – any close – a real closeness, there was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: And wa-wha-what about with your brother and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: With my brother, he had a very rough time.</span> <span id="s912">He had a very bad time when he was young, he had no life either.</span> <span id="s913">He became a stutterer.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: And he worked in the chicken ranch, how – whatever.</span> <span id="s916">My husband and I, Bernie and I would, if we would go for the day to the beach – I loved the ocean, we would go to the beach, we would ask Helen, my younger sister to come along, and she would come along.</span> <span id="s917">She did not have to work in the chicken house, she pretended that she would faint.</span> <span id="s918">So, she’s the baby –</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: She figured it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: She figured out, and she didn’t work in the chicken house.</span> <span id="s921">So that only left my brother, after I left.</span> <span id="s922">And we would ask, well nor – my brother’s named Norman – for him to come and spend the day with us, and my father would always say no, he stays here with the chickens and those five acres, that’s what the property was he had, this is the place for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Oh, what a poor boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Yes, he – he had a very – he joined the – the army right away when he was old enough, and – and he’s – he’s always had a problem.</span> <span id="s925">Also very slow, and not worldly, you know.</span> <span id="s926">That was – that was rough, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Did you maintain ties [coughing] oh, bless you, hang on.</span> <span id="s928">Did you maintain contact with Tante Rowter(ph) and Omaya(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: When I came to this country, we kept writing letters.</span> <span id="s930">Cause before we left, you know, I did say goodbye, and I think we cried.</span> <span id="s931">She – she re – she really cared for me.</span> <span id="s932">And so then we were in touch with letters.</span> <span id="s933">I could never afford to go back to Holland until – not until 1985.</span> <span id="s934">She passed away.</span> <span id="s935">I would get the letter with the black border.</span> <span id="s936">First Omaya(ph) passed away, in the early 60s.</span> <span id="s937">And then Tante passed away July 31, 1975, which is the same day my mother passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Double whammy, yes.</span> <span id="s940">I had made an afghan, I crocheted an afghan and sent that to my tante.</span> <span id="s941">And she s-started to get ill.</span> <span id="s942">And then, after the funeral, whenever that, then I got this letter showing her – that she died and – the same day as my mother passed away.</span> <span id="s943">So that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: That was tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: That was hard, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: That was tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Yeah, it’s very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Did they have – did they have children – no, they didn’t have children –</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: No, they didn’t have children.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: – but did they have family?</span> <span id="s951">What happened with their house?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: I don’t know, cause I never knew the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: I never found out anything.</span> <span id="s955">If my tante wrote something in the letter, I don’t know where they’re at, or where it was.</span> <span id="s956">And in 1985, when we were able to come – go back, Bernie and I went – wanted to go to Holland, we stayed – we stayed in a – in a hotel in Heeze, which is outside of Eindhoven, and I said, okay Bernie, I n – I know exactly where to go to the house.</span> <span id="s957">My girlfriend Trix(ph) from school, I’ve always been in touch with her, she’s not Jewish – and we always corresponded.</span> <span id="s958">So they came to the hotel, and I told him how to go to the house in Huidenstraat also, but then Trix(ph), I think, knew where that was.</span> <span id="s959">But Bernie and I had done that first.</span> <span id="s960">And I could tell him, you take this street and that street, I don’t know how I did that, but anyway, we got to the house in 85, and my – my friend says, Trix(ph) says, oh, why don’t you get out and ring the bell?</span> <span id="s961">Well, I was frozen in my seat, I could not get out of my – the car.</span> <span id="s962">I started to cry and I said, but if I ring the bell, it’s – Tante isn’t there.</span> <span id="s963">There’s other people living there.</span> <span id="s964">I don’t want to see the way the house is for them.</span> <span id="s965">I want to remember the hou – how the hou – how the house was for me, with Tante.</span> <span id="s966">So I never did go in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: You didn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: No.</span> <span id="s969">But, there were the roses outside in the front, and then we drove, cause it’s next to a – a plane, we drove around there and got to the back of the house with that water and the Weeping Willows and all that, and it just phew, floods, you know, comes back of memories.</span> <span id="s970">And that – that – that was good, that – I needed to do that.</span> <span id="s971">But there was nobody else there that I knew, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: And in 1991 you say, the first time you felt like you could have that burden lifted from you, is when – or put words to things, was when you joined the child survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Yeah, I joined it early 90s, I don’t exactly – was it ’92, I – I don’t quite remember the year, but I know it was in the very early 90s.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: What happened when you joined?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: When I joined that group, and they had group workshops or whatever you call them, and I got there and I see all these people who have gone through s – this type of, you know, either in camps or hiding, I was just overwhelmed, I was just shocked that there’s so many people.</span> <span id="s976">I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: And it wasn’t just you?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s979">And then I – it – the person who held that workshop was Daisy Miller.</span> <span id="s980">I don’t know if you’re familiar, but she’s – she did the whole – the conference here, part of it.</span> <span id="s981">But she was so good and she’s – people are sitting there and they’re talking about what happened.</span> <span id="s982">And I don’t know if I spoke the first time that I went or not, because I was just overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s983">I know Bernie stayed outside, he said he didn’t want to go in, so he stayed outside.</span> <span id="s984">And – and maybe I did say, you know, I’m – I was – they must have asked where I’m from, and I said from Holland.</span> <span id="s985">But most people were from Amsterdam, not Eindhoven, no, I haven’t found anybody, except my friend Frieda.</span> <span id="s986">It was just unbelievable, and people were talking and all that.</span> <span id="s987">And it just – I thought, wow.</span> <span id="s988">So I went often, whenever they had the meetings, and I started to talk.</span> <span id="s989">And it felt so good.</span> <span id="s990">It felt so good to do that, that I was getting a little courage.</span> <span id="s991">And I started to f –</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Did your children –</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: – I started to find out a little bit about me, you know.</span> <span id="s994">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Did your sons ask you, as they were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: No.</span> <span id="s997">I really – I – I didn’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Do they ask you now?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: No.</span> <span id="s1000">I have talked and told them, my grandkids and everybody, they know.</span> <span id="s1001">But they never come to me and say, you want to talk, or ask questions.</span> <span id="s1002">They don’t.</span> <span id="s1003">They all feel – when you go to these groups, sometimes the subject is, are your children, or do your children feel that they are hindered or something, because of the mo – par – the mother’s background, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: – going through the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1006">And I thought to myself, no.</span> <span id="s1007">They’ve never talked about it, never said, oh, because you did this, that’s why you’re the way you are, and something.</span> <span id="s1008">So when I came home I asked them.</span> <span id="s1009">I called them and I asked them that particular question.</span> <span id="s1010">And their response was, what are you talking about, Mom?</span> <span id="s1011">What?</span> <span id="s1012">There’s nothing there because of you.</span> <span id="s1013">No, you were always okay, that – but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1014">I’m very confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: It doesn’t sound that way.</span> <span id="s1016">It doesn’t sound that way.</span> <span id="s1017">But you never know what kind of effect – when you’re living, you don’t know what kind of effect the things that you have experienced could have on a person who wasn’t there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: You don’t know those things.</span> <span id="s1020">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1021">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: And you asked the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: I asked them –</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: You gave them –</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: I asked, because I also heard so many people tell me that their children, even grown up now, have a real, severe problem, so many of them have to have therapy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Well, it could have been that for you in your life, it sounds like your parents were stripped bare of, you know, of whatever giving they might have been able to give.</span> <span id="s1027">And so it sounds like there was a real ef – cause effect of what the war did, and their –</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: – and their hiding.</span> <span id="s1030">But that doesn’t necessarily mean that it goes on to another generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: It possibly, but not necessarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Not necessarily.</span> <span id="s1034">Well, the one thing that I know when I got married with Bernie, when I was 18, he comes – well, he is, and I guess he comes from very strong parents who came from Russia.</span> <span id="s1035">And growing up in New York, you have a different way of growing up than I did, of course, but he always told me that I should become more independent and be strong.</span> <span id="s1036">And he – he really had influenced me for that, and it helped.</span> <span id="s1037">He never said, oh, you don’t need to go to these meetings, that doesn’t gonna help you, you know, and he was always there, and wanted me to do what I needed to do.</span> <span id="s1038">And he was my support, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Sounds like he loved you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Yeah, he did.</span> <span id="s1041">He did.</span> <span id="s1042">I loved him very much.</span> <span id="s1043">He was a wonderful guy.</span> <span id="s1044">He was a good father, very good husband.</span> <span id="s1045">He was – I have a picture here of him and me for our 50th anniversary.</span> <span id="s1046">And he really made my life full and – and complete and – and with no hang-ups.</span> <span id="s1047">And I – I – I’m very, very blessed for that, because he – he made me stronger, and he made me appreciate everything and it was just – he
