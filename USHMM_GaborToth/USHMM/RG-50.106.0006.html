children, you know, in the Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s34">And there were -- my mother was the youngest, and then she had five brothers.</span> <span id="s35">And they lived comfortably in this section of Rome.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: What can you tell us about your father's family?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: My father family stayed -- his mother was -- her name was Maria Vizeron (ph).</span> <span id="s38">She was Catholic.</span> <span id="s39">She was in a convent in this region of Abruzzi, and she met my grandfather -- name was Ettore Funaro.</span> <span id="s40">He was a merchant, and he -- you know, he was going from town to town selling merchandise.</span> <span id="s41">And he met this young girl in the convent, they fell in love and she ran away and they got married, and they had five children.</span> <span id="s42">And they lived in the small town called Avesano which unfortunately was destroyed by earthquake, so my father lost all his family in this earthquake.</span> <span id="s43">And also his grandmother was Catholic, but she had decided to bring her children, the boys in the Jewish faith and the girls in the Catholic faith.</span> <span id="s44">So my grandfather was Jewish, and my father also was brought up in the Jewish faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Did you live right in -- within the city or on the

Kippur, Pesach.</span> <span id="s67">But we were not kosher, no.</span> <span id="s68">In Italy, I don't think hardly any Jewish family keep kosher in the homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Did

the date, you know, the Fascists entered Rome.</span> <span id="s91">And that's where, you know, my Fascist education started because in order to enroll in a school, you had to belong to the Fascist

old, did you have any unpleasant experiences --</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: -- because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No, never.</span>

<p><span id="s134">A: I was pretty aware because it was very important to us, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: And your personal life changed when?</span> <span id="s136">When did you first notice the first change in your personal life?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Well, when I had to leave my school, you know.</span> <span id="s138">We couldn't have any maid in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: That was in 1938, '39.</span> <span id="s141">We had to get rid of our radio; marriages, you know, with the Catholic were forbidden and especially the school, you know, I had to go to a special school that was organized for Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: But in 1935, '36, '37 your life went on as usual?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: What did you do in those years aside from school?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Well, we used, you know, go to my

--</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: -- life?</span> <span id="s150">And you mixed with Jews and nonJews?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: It didn't make any difference to us, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: And then came 1938, you said --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: -- and these changes began?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Do you remember what your feelings were in the very beginning in 1938 as a young child?</span> <span id="s159">You were only --</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: It puzzled me.</span> <span id="s161">It puzzled me.</span> <span id="s162">I couldn't understand why, you know, because I'd never noticed a difference before.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Did you talk this over with your parents, the changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Well, yes, but we decide, you know, to stay in our faith; we didn't want to do anything of baptize or things like that.</span> <span id="s165">And we didn't want to leave our country.</span> <span id="s166">You know, we were very Italian, and we decide to stay and make the best of it, never thinking that, you know, the wars would come.</span> <span id="s167">But then Jews from other countries started to come, and they used to go to our synagogue.</span> <span id="s168">And, in fact, one day they rang our bell, you know, and I opened the door, and I was very scared because this person became, you know, very nasty toward me, say that he needed help badly and that we were blind not to see the danger, that we would go through the same thing.</span> <span id="s169">And so I told my mother and my father, and they say, you know, we're giving our help to the synagogue, and these people probably are exaggerating.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: When was this?</span> <span id="s171">Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Well, we were still in our house, so must have been before 1940, yes, mm-hmm, 1939, '38, 1939, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Any other experiences in 1938 that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: This I remember very clearly because it was really shocking to me.</span> <span id="s175">But we knew, we knew -- In fact I have a cousin who was from Poland; you know, many were coming.</span> <span id="s176">And one of them married one of my cousin, for instance.</span> <span id="s177">And so they used to tell us a story what was happening in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: And did you and your family believe what you were hearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Yes, but we thought that that would happen only in other country, not in Italy.</span> <span id="s180">That's what we thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And then you said you had to leave your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: And where did you go ?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: For one year we went to the school that was organized in Rome and --</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: What kind of school was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: It was the gymnasium in the lyceum; that was what it called, you know, the high school.</span> <span id="s187">And we had Jewish teachers, you know; they also had to leave the university, so they became our teachers.</span> <span id="s188">They were very skilled, and it was a very positive experience for me.</span> <span id="s189">But then unfortunately I had to leave it because, you know, we had to hide so there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: So you were in this Jewish gymnasium for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Only one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: One year?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yes, mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Did you sense any apprehension among the other students in this new school?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: It was a very, very happy experience for us.</span> <span id="s196">We finally found, you know, our friends -- Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s197">We had parties in the afternoon, you know, and were just enjoying being together.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: And you felt free to go to anybody's house still?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: At that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: No, no restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yes, mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s205">So then the year passed, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: And then I continue -- I went to -- just for to learn English in a private school just in case, you know, we should leave the country, my father thought it would be important for me to know another language.</span> <span id="s207">So I went to a private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Was this a private Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: No, was nuns, in fact, was --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: And you were permitted to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Now, you and your parents were still living in your same apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s215">And you went to this school for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Well, as long as we didn't have to hide so probably year and a half or two and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: But there was no problem that you as a young Jewish girl getting into the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: No.</span> <span id="s219">These were French nuns in Rome.</span> <span id="s220">Also I went to the English nuns who have -- who give a certificate, you know, to learn English.</span> <span id="s221">That's where I went, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: And they were very accepting?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s224">We thought, you know, to go into a religious school wouldn't last much.</span> <span id="s225">And the public school we were not allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: How did you feel as a young child not being allowed to go to public school?</span> <span id="s227">Was that very upsetting to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: What were your thoughts if you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Well, I felt like, you know, rejection, yes, a rejection.</span> <span id="s231">And I thought that this would pass and that I would be able to go back, but I never did.</span> <span id="s232">And that changed my life completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: So you were in this school -- this school run by the nuns learning English?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: And still living in your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: With your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: And was your father still able to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: So he was still going to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span

No.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: And then what happened?</span> <span id="s248">What was the next --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: The next was, you know, when the Germans started to ask -- you know, the -- Rome was occupied, you know; meanwhile we had gone through all the -- you know, the changes, and Rome was occupied by the Nazi.</span> <span id="s250">After they got these relation of Badoglio and the king and -- And so they ask for -- you know, for gold.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: They asked the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: The Jewish community telling us, you know, that if we would give 50 kilograms of gold, they will leave the Roman Jews alone, you know, and we would continue our lives.</span> <span id="s253">And so in 36 hours we were able to collect the 50 kilograms of gold.</span> <span id="s254">It was said that the Pope, you know, Pacelli, had help us to fill, you know, the difference, you know, but it wasn't true.</span> <span id="s255">We were able to do it all by ourselves.</span> <span id="s256">And -- but unfortunately, you know, they --</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: So this was family jewelry?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Everything that we could get, yes.</span> <span id="s259">Yes, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Did you as a child have to give up anything --</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s262">I gave up my bat mitzvah ring and things, you know, that I collected, yes.</span> <span id="s263">My family, they -- you know, their wedding rings, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Were you very upset as a child to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s266">But we were trying, you know, to save our lives, you know.</span> <span id="s267">We started with our lives; we had to do what they told us to do.</span> <span id="s268">There was no choice, so we had to do it.</span> <span id="s269">And -- but then, you know, they went to the synagogue and actually went to the synagogue, and evidently they got all our names, and they never kept their promise because on October 16th, that's -- you know, they came in each house.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: They came to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: And were you home?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: I was home.</span> <span id="s274">You know, I was home with my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s275">My sister was -- just got married, and she was four months pregnant.</span> <span id="s276">And in the morning 6:00 they went all over the section of Rome called Trastevere with machine guns and -- Excuse me for a moment.</span> <span id="s277">This, you know, remembering makes me -- And we woke up, and our neighbor, such a nice person, she came to our door, she say, "Run, run because the Nazis, the SS are downstairs, and they're getting all the Jewish families, and I don't know what they're going to do with them."</span> <span id="s278">So we never had the chance to get dressed; we just ran out of the house.</span> <span id="s279">And we saw, saw the soldiers right at the corner of our building, but we ran.</span> <span id="s280">We ran away and --</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: How big was your apartment building?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: I wish I brought the picture with me.</span> <span id="s283">But it was, you know, like a apartment house.</span> <span id="s284">And there were about, I would say, three or four more Jewish family.</span> <span id="s285">And fortunately they didn't come up.</span> <span id="s286">I don't know why; maybe they didn't have our address or what, but they just stopped right in front of our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: And you looked out your window and saw them on the corner?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s289">They took families I didn't know across the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: But they did not come into your building?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: They didn't come in our -- in our house.</span> <span id="s292">They didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: What was your neighbor's name who came to warn you?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Her name was Carmella Pellegrini; she was a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s295">She owned a pharmacy not far away from us.</span> <span id="s296">And when I go to Rome, I always go to say hello to her son because they had become our friends forever, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: So it was you and your pregnant sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: And your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: And -- no.</span> <span id="s301">My father -- My father realized, you know, that it was dangerous for the men to be in the house because they were collecting men to bring them to the war zone for labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: When did they start to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: They started soon after the collection of the gold, started right away.</span> <span id="s304">So the men were not in the house anymore; only the women were left in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: And where was your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: And my father decide to have a hernia operation; he had been needing it for a long time, so he thought this would be a good time to have it, you know, and stay in hiding.</span> <span id="s307">And that's where he was that morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Of October?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s310">October 16.</span> <span id="s311">My mother and I ran.</span> <span id="s312">And my sister -- one of our cousin who was Catholic had promised, you know, to shelter her if, you know, there was need, so she went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Your sister went to her -- your Catholic cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Yes, she did.</span> <span id="s315">And my mother and I first stopped to a friend's house, you know, where we used to live to see if they were home.</span> <span id="s316">But the house was empty already; they already taken them.</span> <span id="s317">In fact, they died.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: What do you mean where you used to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Before, before this apartment where we lived, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Oh, you had lived somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: The same section of Rome, not far away from us, yes.</span> <span id="s324">So we stopped there, and the house was empty; they already had gone, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: And what did you do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: So my mother took the telephone, and she thought of calling, you know, our cousin because she had told us that she would go back home.</span> <span id="s327">She was hiding, and she had decided to go back home because the children didn't like the hotel where she was staying.</span> <span id="s328">And she was already, you know, been taken out, so she wasn't there; she didn't answer.</span> <span id="s329">Then we got really, you know, scared, and we got into a trolley car, and we went to my father's hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Was there much confusion on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Was it quiet?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Everything was normal.</span> <span id="s334">Everything was normal, just, you know, we would see -- but we always used to see, you know, the SS going all over the city, so we didn't -- I didn't see any, you know, other Jews, you know, taken, no, I didn't fortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: So you decided to go to the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s337">So we went to the hospital, and we knew, you know, the nun that was taking care of my father -- Suor Foncina was her name -- she was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s338">And she told my mother that she could stay but there was no room for me or for my sister; you know, was a small hospital room so -- So then my father, you know, tried to find a place.</span> <span id="s339">Meanwhile, the first few nights I slept all over I could.</span> <span id="s340">I slept in my maid's house; I slept in another convent; I slept wherever I could, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: With your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: No, no, alone.</span> <span id="s343">My mother stayed in the hospital but --</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: You were the one that had to --</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s346">I didn't know where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: How did you feel being separated from your mother?</span> <span id="s348">Because you were how old then?</span> <span id="s349">You were --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: About 18, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Eighteen?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: A few years old, yes.</span> <span id="s353">i don't know -- I just -- You know, I didn't have any clothes.</span> <span id="s354">I didn't have a -- I just slept wherever I could; I ate where I could, you know.</span> <span id="s355">I just -- I tried to get in touch with other of my relatives, cousins, to see where they stayed.</span> <span id="s356">In fact, I found my cousin, they were staying in a convent.</span> <span id="s357">So she says sleep over, you know, here for tonight and then see what happens tomorrow and --</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Were you able to stay in touch with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: With my parents?</span> <span id="s360">Yes, I could go --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: You could stay in touch?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Yes, I could go there whenever I wanted, but I couldn't sleep, you know, was impossible because other people -- you know, other nurse or doctors would come during the night, they would, you know, find it unusual that, you know, there would be three in a room, so I could not stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Did you look very Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: No, I don't think I do.</span> <span id="s365">Do I?</span> <span id="s366">Well, due to the fact that I'm blonde, so nobody thought that I would be Jewish but --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: So when you walked down the street, it wasn't obvious?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s369">No.</span> <span id="s370">No.</span> <span id="s371">In fact, all my relatives, after we found each other, they used to tell me "Could you go to my house, you know, and get me this and get me that?"</span> <span id="s372">And I would go and not realizing, you know, how dangerous it was because nobody would think that I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: What kind of papers did you have when -- at that point when you were 18 ?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Did you have any special papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: No, I didn't, but I needed an identification because they used to stop you in the street and ask you for identification.</span> <span id="s377">So somebody told me to go to this convent which is in the center of Rome near Piazza di Spagna.</span> <span id="s378">And I went there, and I met this Father Filippo; that's all I remember about him, but he was very nice --</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Did the convent have a special name?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s381">It's the Dominican priest, but I don't know; I don't remember the name.</span> <span id="s382">Yes.</span> <span id="s383">And he gave me this identification.</span> <span id="s384">He took my identification practically, and he changed the name from Funaro with an "n" to Fumaro with an "m."</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: And why did he do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Because Funaro is a very Jewish name, but Funaro could puzzle other people, you know, not knowing that it had been changed so -- I don't know how safe could that be but --</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: So he gave you fresh papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s389">He just corrected mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Oh, he changed the "n" to an "m"?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: So it looked, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: So you had your original paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: And on the original papers did it say that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: No.</span> <span id="s397">That wasn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: -- listed?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: They didn't ask for religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s402">So he changed that.</span> <span id="s403">And then what did you do?</span> <span id="s404">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: So meanwhile, my father was trying to find us a place.</span> <span id="s406">And, you know, I told you he was in the lumber business, so he got in the construction of many buildings.</span> <span id="s407">And he called up one of his friend who was an architect, and he didn't have to explain much; he understood right away.</span> <span id="s408">And he said that he would, you know, find a place for us.</span> <span id="s409">They had just built this place near the University of Rome for women coming out of town, you know, and attending the universities.</span> <span id="s410">And there was brand-new building still there.</span> <span id="s411">I don't know if you've ever been in Rome --</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Like a dormitory, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yes, like a hostel, you know, for -- And the Mother Superior said yes, she had already hidden other people for political or racial or so.</span> <span id="s414">She said yes right away.</span> <span id="s415">And meanwhile my sister had been sent out of the house of our cousins; they didn't keep her, yes, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Because they felt it wasn't safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No, it wasn't safe because, you know, they put posters all over Rome that, you know, whoever would shelter Jews would be sentenced, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: These were posters on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s420">So they got very scared, and they sent her out, and my sister was very upset, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: And she was far along in her pregnancy?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Four months pregnant, yes.</span> <span id="s423">So she came with me to the convent.</span> <span id="s424">Her husband also was hiding in the country near Rome, so she didn't know where to go, and she stayed with me in the convent on and off, yes.</span> <span id="s425">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Your experience up to this point with the Catholic church was very positive?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: It was, yes.</span> <span id="s428">Yes.</span> <span id="s429">They were very understanding.</span> <span id="s430">Of course, they tried to convert us, and my sister had to play the organ in church.</span> <span id="s431">You know, we had to go to sing, the prayers, you know, and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Was this familiar to you?</span> <span id="s433">Were these rituals and ceremonies familiar to you since you had Catholic relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: In a way, yes, you know, we were familiar.</span> <span id="s435">But we had to learn all their prayers, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: I felt that I was praying my God.</span> <span id="s438">I felt so much that I needed pray that I didn't care if I was in the church or in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s439">They have, you know, the confessional, you know, was very comforting to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: So you and your sister were together, she was four months pregnant and you went to this dormitory, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s442">We had very comfortable rooms, and it was very cold, very cold, terribly cold and --</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: What time of year are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: We're talking about November, December, you know.</span> <span id="s445">From October, you know, by the time we went there was November.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: And it was cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: What did you have with you?</span> <span id="s449">Did you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: I didn't have --</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: -- clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: No, I didn't have anything yet, you know.</span> <span id="s453">But finally our neighbor, you know, she took everything from our apartment because our apartment was -- how can you say -- taken by the Roman --</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Confiscated.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Confiscated.</span> <span id="s456">And they put in it -- in the apartment people who had come from the south of Italy.</span> <span id="s457">You know, during the occupation of the Americans some of the Italian Fascists, you know, ran north -- or antiFascists, I should say, ran north.</span> <span id="s458">And so we had to give the apartment, you know, to them, because the way they continue the war, the raids, they couldn't live in Naples or in other country of the south.</span> <span id="s459">So our apartment was occupied by this family, but our neighbor took everything, you know, our clothes and our valuables --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Personal things?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Yes, personal things in her apartment.</span> <span id="s462">So once in a while, I used to go to the pharmacy, you know, that she owned --</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: To your neighbor's pharmacy?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yes, and she would, you know, give me a package with the stuff that I needed.</span> <span id="s465">So slowly I got, you know, my stuff back.</span> <span id="s466">And I stayed in that convent for nine months, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: And what did you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Well, during the day we could have -- you know, go anywhere because the curfew was at 6:00.</span> <span id="s469">So I used to run to my mother and see my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s470">And I had already a boyfriend, so I used to go to see him if I could.</span> <span id="s471">And then I got into -- you know, get in touch with some of the partisans; already, you know, they were formed.</span> <span id="s472">So I belonged to some kind of organization that was called a Christian, you know, for freedom, something like that.</span> <span id="s473">And we used to ask each other, bring news from one place to another and see that everybody would be sheltered, they would need food, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: How did they get in touch with you or how did you get in contact with this partisan group?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Well, we'd meet, you know, somewhere for coffee -- or there was no coffee, but for something.</span> <span id="s476">Not in the homes, it's somewhere and --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: And you heard about the group through friends originally --</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: -- and you got involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: And these were young people like you?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: And did you say you had regular meetings or you --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: No.</span> <span id="s485">No.</span> <span id="s486">Never, never, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: And it was just informal how you got information?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: And you carried messages?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Who did you carry messages to?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Well, other people that, you know, might need help.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Did you ever feel your life in danger --</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: -- when you were a courier?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: No.</span> <span id="s497">No.</span> <span id="s498">No.</span> <span id="s499">I talked to German soldiers all the times.</span> <span id="s500">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: In what language?</span> <span id="s502">In Italian?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Italian, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">{Pause in the recording.}</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Courier with the partisans and you were talking to German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s507">Occasionally, occasionally, but occasionally.</span> <span id="s508">If I would meet somebody, I would never, you know, show what I was or what and not realizing, you know, how dangerous it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Did you have any particularly difficult experiences at this time, the end of '43, beginning of '44, any frightening experiences, anything that was difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Well, of course, you know, at night especially we could hear shooting continuously.</span> <span id="s511">You know, the partisans were starting to fight also in the city.</span> <span id="s512">And also the Allied had landed in Anzio, so we could hear the war advancing very closely.</span> <span id="s513">And we wished they would come already, but I mean, while we didn't know our destiny, we didn't know if they would go -- if they would keep their promise that Rome was open city or not.</span> <span id="s514">Would they destroy it?</span> <span id="s515">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s516">We didn't know what was expect.</span> <span id="s517">And that was very scary, you know.</span> <span id="s518">And also we had two very bad air raids.</span> <span id="s519">I lived in the section of Rome called San Lorenzo near the Catholic and Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s520">And seems like the Germans were hiding, you know, their supplies in there.</span> <span id="s521">So we had two very bad air raids and --</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Where were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: I was, you know, coming down the stairs.</span> <span id="s524">Right in front of the window I see this airplane coming, you know, and the bombs falling.</span> <span id="s525">And I got on the ground, you know, and I was very, very scared, yes.</span> <span id="s526">And my whole family, in fact, got very scared because they knew that I was the only one living there.</span> <span id="s527">But all the windows broke in the building, but fortunately, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: How was your sister making out being pregnant at this time?</span> <span id="s529">How were things going?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Well, she was very brave, but the nuns were getting very -- the nurses -- the nuns were getting very nervous; you know, they didn't want a baby born in their convent.</span> <span id="s531">So every night they used to knock at our door, is your sister feeling all right?</span> <span id="s532">Do you think she's going to have a baby?</span> <span id="s533">And what.</span> <span id="s534">My sister said, "I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s535">Where should I go?"</span> <span id="s536">Well, finally my brother-in-law's family, they decide to rent an apartment in a very nice section of Rome with false names, making believe they also were refugees from the south.</span> <span id="s537">So my sister was able to go to live with her husband's family, and she had the baby in April.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Of '44?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s540">And my first nephew Stefano was born, you know, during this period with the false name.</span> <span id="s541">And I remember very clearly that we were in the room and somebody came to visit us; we never knew who this person was --</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: This is in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Yes, because my sister felt that I knew her and --</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: You thought she knew her?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: And we didn't want to say our names so was --</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Did you ever find out who it was</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s548">But, you know, we were very -- you know, pretty scared, but thank God, you know, everything was fine and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And then she and the baby went back to her in-laws living under the false name?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: And so you were living by yourself still in this dormitory?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I was alone, yes.</span> <span id="s553">Yes.</span> <span id="s554">I stayed there all the nine months, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: And you -- during -- you were working for the partisans during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Because there was a curfew at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: And what did you -- What else did you do, or was that full time?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: At night we would get together because there were many, you know, other people hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: In this dormitory?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes, also children, yes.</span> <span id="s563">And we used to get together --</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: These were Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s566">And meet and sew and, you know, do things because we could not buy clothes.</span> <span id="s567">So we used to buy yarn and knit our stockings and sweaters and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: What was the food situation like?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: The food situation was full of worms.</span> <span id="s570">You know, was kept in the -- probably in the basement of the Vatican somewhere and -- but it was enough, you know, it was enough to keep alive.</span> <span id="s571">Of course, I was very young, and I was very hungry.</span> <span id="s572">But I used to go to my mother and my father's hospital and open up the room and if I would find them, take a little piece of cheese or bread or whatever I would

very liberal about -- you know, I didn't believe in Fascism.</span> <span id="s632">That's I was brought up.</span> <span id="s633">So of course it bothered me to wear uniform, you know, and to sing

upsetting?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: It became, it became frightening once, you know, we knew that Mussolini was, you know, getting -- his alliance with the Germans then became dangerous.</span> <span id="s639">But at the beginning Mussolini had many Jewish friends, you know, so we didn't believe that he could ever get into that situation, yes, mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s641">We're back, back to '44 again.</span> <span id="s642">So you recuperated.</span> <span id="s643">Your family doctor helped you recuperate.</span> <span id="s644">And then what happened?</span> <span id="s645">What was the next experience you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Well, the next experience was the expectation, you know; we were hoping that the war would advance, you know.</span> <span id="s647">But meanwhile, the partisans were getting, you know, very organized in Rome.</span> <span id="s648">So that's when it happened, the very bad incident of Viera Thela (ph).</span> <span id="s649">The partisans killed 32 Germans, SS Germans and in the reprisal, the Germans decided to kill 320.</span> <span id="s650">Yes, there were many Jews that had been, you know, taken in the street, from the street, because we also had Jewish spies; you know, that would point out, you know, who was Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: To the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s653">So one of my cousin was in Regina Coeli at that time which is, you know, the jail in Rome.</span> <span id="s654">His name was Giuseppe Del Monte.</span> <span id="s655">And he was taken, you know, to fill --</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: The three?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: And so they were taken, you know, one day and taken to the -- in the place in the Appian Way, that's called Force Diatini.</span> <span id="s658">And they were killed en masse, you know, and buried there, that's it, you know, without any fault, without any -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: This was the reprisal?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s661">And we didn't know what happened to him, you know.</span> <span id="s662">We didn't know, you know.</span> <span id="s663">We got in touch with his brother or the sister, what happened, he has disappeared.</span> <span id="s664">Where is he?</span> <span id="s665">We know that he's in jail; maybe he's in the atasse (ph).</span> <span id="s666">You know, the atasse is where they interrogate the Jews where they did terrible things to them.</span> <span id="s667">We could hear the screams from what they were doing to them.</span> <span id="s668">So we didn't know where he was.</span> <span id="s669">And then, you know, we found out that he had been killed, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: How aware were you of these terrible things that were going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Yeah, there like --</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: You said --</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s674">Somebody would tell "You know what happened?</span> <span id="s675">You know what happened?"</span> <span id="s676">But we never knew if it was really true, and we were afraid to find out because, you know, who could we ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: So there was the reprisal?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: It was just, you know, very scary to see the way, you know, the Germans were all over the city, you know.</span> <span id="s681">And people were very scared.</span> <span id="s682">They were very -- what can I say?</span> <span id="s683">-- frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Now, did your parents leave the hospital ?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: They stayed?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: They stayed, yes.</span> <span id="s688">They didn't know where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: And you were still in this dormitory?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: And then what was the next --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Then finally, you know, they -- the Allies started to advance; after Casino, after Anzio, you know, they started to advance.</span> <span id="s693">So we knew that they would come, but we didn't know what would happen at that point.</span> <span id="s694">So that night, you know, I called my mother and my father, and it was too far away to walk then.</span> <span id="s695">There was no transportation at that point; there were only, you know, Germans going out, you know, like a war in the city, impossible to walk.</span> <span id="s696">So I called my mother and my father, and I say, "What should I do?"</span> <span id="s697">Do you think you should try to go to your sister, maybe you would stay; you know, they live in an apartment, should be safe.</span> <span id="s698">So I went there, and I asked if I could stay, you know, at least overnight because maybe during the night, they would decide what to do, you know, the -- if -- stay in Rome and -- you know, and fight or just go through.</span> <span id="s699">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s700">But I was not wanted there.</span> <span id="s701">They said that they didn't have enough food and it would be very dangerous, you know, I was young and attractive, maybe, you know, some Germans would come in the house and follow me.</span> <span id="s702">So it was near the curfew; it was 6:00, and I had to go out, much regret of my sister, but there was nothing I could do about.</span> <span id="s703">And so I went, and that was a very terrible experience because that was the end of the war; you know, you could see the defeat in the soldiers' face.</span> <span id="s704">They were drunk; they were bleeding all over.</span> <span id="s705">You know, and I run, you know.</span> <span id="s706">I stopped somebody, and I said, "Please take me."</span> <span id="s707">You know, where I say please, please don't bother me, just to reach my house.</span> <span id="s708">I have to do it by myself.</span> <span id="s709">And finally, you know, I reached the convent, and I collapsed on the ground, but the nuns came out, you know, and they took me inside.</span> <span id="s710">And I decide that I didn't want to sleep alone, so I had these two very dear friends; they were two old Jewish lady, and they were so nice to me.</span> <span id="s711">And they say stay in our room, and I stayed and I spent the night there.</span> <span id="s712">And, finally, you know, when I woke up in the morning, I could not believe it that when we look out the window, we saw soldiers that they didn't look like Germans; in fact, they were the Americans.</span> <span id="s713">And then the joy exploded, you know.</span> <span id="s714">We ran out, and I was very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: So that was the day of your liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: And you went out to the American soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: And you could speak English because you had taken English?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s721">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Do you remember any of your meetings, what you said to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Oh, we hugged and kissed and, of course, you know, the usual scenes you can see in the movies, give them chewing gum and chocolate.</span> <span id="s724">But after we moved back to our apartment, we were very fortunate to have the assistance of some soldiers from New Zealand, New Zealand, who brought, you know, us lots of food from one of my father's clients from south Italy.</span> <span id="s725">So we heard, you know, that we had been starving, and they brought cases of food.</span> <span id="s726">They were really very, very nice to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Did you go immediately back to your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: No.</span> <span id="s729">No, I still didn't feel like I wanted to go back, you know; it was like, you know, it didn't belong to me anymore.</span> <span id="s730">I just, you know, had bad feelings, but finally, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: So you stayed in the convent for a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: For a little bit, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Then went back and your parents were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s735">We took care of the apartment, cleaned and everything.</span> <span id="s736">then we finally got back, and my father was able slowly to start his business.</span> <span id="s737">Then we started to find out all the bad news, of course, you know, but also the good news because our friends, you know, the one that had, you know, gone to other country, you know, especially to America, they started to come back, you know.</span> <span id="s738">And that's how I met for the second time my husband.</span> <span id="s739">He had left, you know, Italy in 1939.</span> <span id="s740">So we found each other again, and we were able to get married, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: In 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: What did you do when you got back to your apartment and you got settled, then what did you do?</span> <span id="s744">This is before that.</span> <span id="s745">Did you go to school or did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: No, I didn't.</span> <span id="s747">I was supposed to get married.</span> <span id="s748">You know, I had been, you know, engaged, but my boyfriend decide --</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: To somebody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span

But he became volunteer.</span> <span id="s755">He went; you know, he followed the Allied troops, and he went north.</span> <span id="s756">So when he came back, you know, I left him and --</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: So did you -- were you working --</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Or did you just stay home with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: The Jewish family, girls are not supposed to work which was very terrible for me.</span> <span id="s761">I lost my husband when I was very young, and I didn't learn much.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: So you stayed home with your family, and then the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: And, as you said, you found out sad news of relatives.</span> <span id="s765">And then you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: And you got married in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Yes, a

came in August; in September I got married.</span> <span id="s772">Then we went to live California.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Oh, you went to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A:

<p><span id="s791">Q: Can we talk now a little bit about some of your thoughts about your experience during the war?</span> <span id="s792">What are your feelings today about how the war influenced you?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: It totally changed my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Well, first of all, I told you about the school that, you know, I feel the lack, you know, of education.</span> <span id="s796">I wish I could have continue which I did.</span> <span id="s797">Later on I went to Queens College, and I continue.</span> <span id="s798">My brother-in-law is the head of the Department -- Italian Department, Queens College.</span> <span id="s799">Maybe you have read his book, Sergio Pacifici.</span> <span id="s800">He has written many literature books, so he -- after my husband died, he advised me to continue college to be able to teach Italian.</span> <span id="s801">But unfortunately, I was unable.</span> <span id="s802">I had four children, you know, and lost -- already engaged, you know, and there were in university.</span> <span id="s803">And I had a very little one; after 14 years, I had a little boy, Robert, who is now 30 years old.</span> <span id="s804">So I had to follow him; it was too much for me to continue.</span> <span id="s805">So that influenced a lot because, you know, my education.</span> <span id="s806">Besides that, you know, I had -- I became more religious, I would say, ever.</span> <span id="s807">You know, I don't go much to synagogue or things like that, but my feelings are so deep now, I feel that I've been so honored to talk about what happened to me because I have nightmares, still have nightmares, you know, of what happened to -- especially to my cousin Julia who, you know, died with a husband and two small children, Carla and Needa (ph); they were only five and three years old.</span> <span id="s808">And I constantly pray for them, you know.</span> <span id="s809">And this kept me, you know, in my faith.</span> <span id="s810">All sisters tried to convert me; I would never, never, never, never, never.</span> <span id="s811">And that's very important to me.</span> <span id="s812">My family now, they're all married.</span> <span id="s813">My young one is married to a Korean, but he got married in the Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s814">My other son is married to an Irish, but he has kept his faith.</span> <span id="s815">My other sons, you know, he kept his faith.</span> <span id="s816">And also if we don't show, I hope that I have, you know, taught this to my children that, you know, how important it is.</span> <span id="s817">I don't care what's, you know, they're outside going to synagogue or serving, what the faith will be, and that's very important.</span> <span id="s818">Also, you know, I appreciate the fact that this brought me to live in this country.</span> <span id="s819">I go often to Italy, but I could not live there anymore.</span> <span id="s820">I feel that this country gives the opportunity, you know, to keep your faith, to work.</span> <span id="s821">I didn't have any education, but I was able always to support myself.</span> <span id="s822">My husband didn't leave me rich, but I was able, you know, to have all my children have their degree and their professions.</span> <span id="s823">And I could never have accomplished if I had stayed in Italy.</span> <span id="s824">I myself, you know, I decided office work wasn't for me, and I took care of my catering and my chef work, and I been very successful.</span> <span id="s825">So thank God for America.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Do you receive reparations, war reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: More

communicated to your children about your experiences during the war?</span> <span id="s838">You were open?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s840">This is now lately especially it is like an obsession to me.</span> <span id="s841">I have to publish something about it, and I want to -- you know, my children, my grandchildren to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Because they have not been, you know, so unaware what's going on in this world.</span> <span id="s844">They have to be prepared.</span> <span id="s845">We were not.</span> <span id="s846">They came with gun, and we just went, like sheep.</span> <span id="s847">That wasn't the way to do it.</span> <span id="s848">We should have been active.</span> <span id="s849">And when they say now in Israel, you know, they are too -- you know, too war-minded, things like that, I approve because, you know, we have to defend ourselves.</span> <span id="s850">We were -- You know, we just went; we were too innocent about it, so I want my children to be very aware of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Did you share your feelings with anybody else besides your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: I say to friends I'm never ashamed to say I'm Jew.</span> <span id="s853">Sometimes I'm to lose the friendship, I don't care.</span> <span

would like to share?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Well, one thing, you know, I experience here they think that in Italy when -- everybody says, "You, you're Italian, you're Jewish?</span> <span id="s857">How is this possible?"</span> <span id="s858">Yes, there were Jews in Italy, and we went through exactly what everybody else in Germany and Poland that they -- you know.</span> <span
