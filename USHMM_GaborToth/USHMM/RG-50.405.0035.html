Women's Auxiliary of the Jewish Community Centers of Chicago NAME: YANINA ESTRINA NAYMAN DATE: July 19, 1990.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Interviewer: Elaine Snyderman (You said you were born in Gomel, which is the second largest city in Byelorussia.</span> <span id="s9">What do you remember about what it was like when you were growing up?)</span> <span id="s10">It was good.</span> <span id="s11">I had very good parents, they liked me very much and they always paid attention to me and to my needs.</span> <span id="s12">I have a brother, he is eighteen years old now.</span> <span id="s13">He is still in Gomel with our father.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">My father was a teacher of Physics and Astronomy.</span> <span id="s15">In Russia there is only public school, and all grades, from first to tenth are all in one school.</span> <span id="s16">My father usually taught in the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth grades, the older children.</span> <span id="s17">He was born in Gomel, but I'm not sure where his parents were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">My grandfather, my father's father, died in World War II so I did not know him.</span> <span id="s19">But I know my grandmother, my father's mother.</span> <span id="s20">She also lived in Gomel, in her own house.</span> <span id="s21">When I was born my grandmother was already retired but I know that she was a salesperson in a food store.</span> <span id="s22">Her husband died much younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">(When you were growing up, was your mother working?</span> <span id="s24">What did she do?)</span> <span id="s25">Yes, she worked.</span> <span id="s26">She was an engineer in a candy, sweets, and cookies factory.</span> <span id="s27">She was responsible for keeping the machinery running.</span> <span id="s28">It was a hard job, eight hours a day.</span> <span id="s29">I was in Kindergarten and then in regular school, and my grandmother and grandfather helped too.</span> <span id="s30">My grandparents on my mother's side and my father's mother all helped.</span> <span id="s31">I was the only granddaughter on my father's side.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">My mother's parents... my grandmother didn't work, she had three daughters and she worked at home.</span> <span id="s33">My grandfather could do very little work after the war.</span> <span id="s34">He worked a little in a factory, he worked with wood.</span> <span id="s35">I never knew exactly what he did because he was already retired when I knew him.</span> <span id="s36">He was very ill after the war, he was wounded, he was in the Army during the War.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">And my mother's grandfather, my great-grandfather, was in Bobroysk.</span> <span id="s38">He made the circumcision after the Jewish boys were born.</span> <span id="s39">In my house there were not many Jewish traditions, they knew very little Yiddish or the other traditions.</span> <span id="s40">But my grandmother on my mother's side was born into a religious family and she always kept Kosher.</span> <span id="s41">She had separate dishes and she didn't eat on one holiday, she fasted on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s42">Now she is in Chicago.</span> <span id="s43">(In Chicago, maybe we can interview her too?)</span> <span id="s44">I think maybe she cannot, she does not speak English and she is very old and she is not very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">I remember she told me about, I guess it was after the Revolution, her father three times was arrested because of his religious tradition and because he tried to observe the holidays and he tried to continue his work, but it was against the law at that time.</span> <span id="s46">So, she told me about how one time the police came to the house and were looking everywhere and were trying to find the knife, the circumcision knife, but the knife was in a pocket in the jacket and this jacket was on the chair.</span> <span id="s47">And my grandmother, she was just a girl, she sat down on this chair and the police didn't look there.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">(What kind of a house or building did you live in?)</span> <span id="s49">When I was a year and a half, my parents bought a flat, an apartment, a little two-room one, living room and bedroom with a small kitchen.</span> <span id="s50">And I lived in this apartment until I came here to the United States.</span> <span id="s51">Well, in Russia, getting an apartment is a big problem.</span> <span id="s52">(So, even after you were married and had your child you stayed in the same apartment?)</span> <span id="s53">Well, you know my mother died when I was thirteen, and my father married another woman and went to her apartment to live and left this apartment for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">But many, many of my young friends live with their parents.</span> <span id="s55">This is the usual way in Russia, it is really different there.</span> <span id="s56">(How do families get along under those circumstances?)</span> <span id="s57">What can they do?!</span> <span id="s58">Sometimes it makes many problems for children and parents.</span> <span id="s59">Sometimes children will go and rent their own apartment.</span> <span id="s60">But it is very expensive and young people usually can't do it because they get paid very little and you have to pay a lot of money for rent.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">(What was your neighborhood like?)</span> <span id="s62">I lived in a five floor building - on the fourth floor, and near our house were the same kind of buildings.</span> <span id="s63">Our city was almost destroyed during World War II, by bombs and because the Germans occupied the city.</span> <span id="s64">My grandparents on both sides were evacuated.</span> <span id="s65">My mother's mother was in Kazakhstan and my father's mother was in Siberia.</span> <span id="s66">It was very far and very cold.</span> <span id="s67">My father was young and he froze his fingers.</span> <span id="s68">He didn't loose them but it doesn't look the same as the others.</span> <span id="s69">He was all right but it was definitely not beautiful, because he was lost in the forest until they found him.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">So after the war, in our city there were many one-floor houses but in the later years there were some high buildings but not like in Chicago!</span> <span id="s71">I think maybe the highest was twenty floors.</span> <span id="s72">But the five-story ones are the more usual.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">(Did your family seem different from non-Jewish families to you?</span> <span id="s74">We you aware of being different?)</span> <span id="s75">I knew that I was Jewish when I was very young because I remember one time, when I was maybe seven or eight years old, one boy called me - you know in Russia they call you a bad word, Zhid -I remember this until this time.</span> <span id="s76">So I always knew that I was Jewish, not like others.</span> <span id="s77">There were many other Jewish children around but I knew that Russians, or Byelorussians, did not like me.</span> <span id="s78">I knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">(Were your parents worried about this kind of thing?</span> <span id="s80">Did you hear them talk about it at home?)</span> <span id="s81">Of course.</span> <span id="s82">I don't remember exactly what was said but I remember that my grandmother always did not want her granddaughters to marry Russians or Byelorussians.</span> <span id="s83">And my father did not want it either.</span> <span id="s84">I think in almost every Jewish family they don't want the children to marry a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s85">I heard it from both grandmothers and from my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Of course, I expected to do some things at home.</span> <span id="s87">And when my mother died when I was thirteen, my father and I took over all the house work.</span> <span id="s88">My brother was only three and a half at that time.</span> <span id="s89">He went to Kindergarten then.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">(Did they celebrate any holidays at home, when you were little?)</span> <span id="s91">Jewish holidays, yes.</span> <span id="s92">My parents, no; my grandparents, yes.</span> <span id="s93">We had matzos but the last few years it was very difficult because there was not even one temple or synagogue.</span> <span id="s94">So if you wanted matzos you had to go to Moscow or another big city and buy it.</span> <span id="s95">They were very expensive.</span> <span id="s96">But my grandparents sent it to our home so we had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">(Did you have it with a dinner, a Seder, for Pesach, or did you just have it in the house?)</span> <span id="s98">In our house, we just had them.</span> <span id="s99">But in my grandmother's house she observed.</span> <span id="s100">I don't ever remember being at a Seder or things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">(Did you know anything about what it means to be a Jew apart from being called bad names by Russian kids?)</span> <span id="s102">I think not.</span> <span id="s103">I didn't know any history of the Jewish people or anything like that.</span> <span id="s104">We didn't have any Jewish books or any films about Jewish people, like here.</span> <span id="s105">When we were here and I saw a film about Jewish people with my husband, we were very glad and when we saw the movie, "Holocaust" here, we cried.</span> <span id="s106">We knew about how Jewish people had it very bad during World War II, but early history we didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s107">(How did you learn about the Holocaust, in Russia?)</span> <span id="s108">I don't remember exactly how I learned about this but people knew about this in Russia, about World War II, about the Holocaust, they knew.</span> <span id="s109">There was just a little in the history books but my parents knew about it and I knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">(Did you become a teacher because it was something that you wanted to do?)</span> <span id="s111">Yes.</span> <span id="s112">I don't remember when I decided to do this.</span> <span id="s113">I was in two schools to study, in music school and in regular public school.</span> <span id="s114">Then I went to a music college for four years and then I went to the Institute.</span> <span id="s115">(Did you study musical instruments?)</span> <span id="s116">Yes, the piano - we had one in our house.</span> <span id="s117">When I was six, my parents bought one for me.</span> <span id="s118">It was a small spinet, made in the Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">I started music lessons when I was six.</span> <span id="s120">My aunt, my mother's sister, taught me.</span> <span id="s121">She was a music teacher.</span> <span id="s122">I practiced a lot and liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">(Did the Russian educational system provide what you wanted?</span> <span id="s124">Did you have any trouble getting into school because you were Jewish?)</span> <span id="s125">No.</span> <span id="s126">I always studied very well.</span> <span id="s127">In Russia, the highest grade you can get is a Five.</span> <span id="s128">I always got Fives.</span> <span id="s129">I remember one time the teacher gave me a Four and I thought that it was because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s130">But, I can't say that it made any trouble for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">(How many hours a day did you have to practice your music?)</span> <span id="s132">Sometimes two, sometimes one hour.</span> <span id="s133">Sometimes, none.</span> <span id="s134">Sometimes I was lazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">(Had your mother been ill for a long time when she died and you were thirteen?)</span> <span id="s136">No, she had not been ill.</span> <span id="s137">You cannot imagine, it was after an abortion.</span> <span id="s138">(Oh, did she have an infection?)</span> <span id="s139">No.</span> <span id="s140">It was a bad doctor, he made a hole, I don't know how to say in English.</span> <span id="s141">(He punctured the uterus?)</span> <span id="s142">I don't know exactly, I was not at home, I was at camp and it was summer and they didn't tell me.</span> <span id="s143">But I know that after the operation she was alive but she could not eat and she was very, very ill and then she died.</span> <span id="s144">They came to camp and took me and told me about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">(Was it a common thing for women to get abortions at that time in Russia?)</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Many women did.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">(I ask because we hear of so many one child families.</span> <span id="s148">Or there are two children but there are ten years or so between them, so I wondered if you heard of such tragedies or accidents?)</span> <span id="s149">No, I didn't hear this.</span> <span id="s150">But I knew that many women had more than one abortion during their lives.</span> <span id="s151">Of course, there are no contraceptives in Russia.</span> <span id="s152">I know that for my mother it was the first abortion.</span> <span id="s153">In Russia, all medical procedures are without additional charges.</span> <span id="s154">They pay a pension for the children, very little, but, it depends on her wages that she earned.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">(Do you remember how much of a pension it was?)</span> <span id="s156">I remember, but it was in rubles.</span> <span id="s157">I remember that when we received for me and my brother, it was maybe ninety rubles, maybe less.</span> <span id="s158">When I was eighteen, it stopped for me and they paid only thirty-six rubles a month for my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">(How old were you when you got married?)</span> <span id="s160">I was twenty-one and I knew my husband about five months before we were married.</span> <span id="s161">(Where did you meet?)</span> <span id="s162">My grandmother lived near his mother and they introduced us.</span> <span id="s163">(What was your wedding like?)</span> <span id="s164">Oh, it was big and nice!</span> <span id="s165">We, in Russia, all people get married in a municipal organization that keeps records about all marriages, divorces, birth, deaths, all such things about people.</span> <span id="s166">You come there with relatives and friends and the special woman she said some words and congratulates you and you sign and that is it.</span> <span id="s167">She is really not like a judge, this is just the work she does.</span> <span id="s168">And then, our parents and my husband they rented a big hall and cafe and it was big - because we have many relatives from other cities, so we had 140 people.</span> <span id="s169">It was very expensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">(Did you get nice gifts?)</span> <span id="s171">In Russia, in the last years, people give mainly money because they don't know what we want and also, there is nothing in the shops.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">(When you got married, did you know already that you wanted to leave the country?</span> <span id="s173">What happened to make you decide this?)</span> <span id="s174">No, not then.</span> <span id="s175">Because we saw that life there is not going any better, it was just getting worse and worse.</span> <span id="s176">And then there was Chernobyl.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">(When did you first find out about Chernobyl?)</span> <span id="s178">My father - He was lucky that he heard it.</span> <span id="s179">And at school they had a Geiger counter, and he called me - You know it happened on Saturday and on Monday he called me from work and said, "Yanna, don't let Katya go outside for a long time.</span> <span id="s180">And let her wash her arms and face many times, more often than usual."</span> <span id="s181">But of course, he didn't know how bad it really was.</span> <span id="s182">He just saw the counter that was clicking very quickly instead of very slowly.</span> <span id="s183">Before Chernobyl, it was just a slow click.</span> <span id="s184">But of course, he did not realize how bad it really was and the government didn't tell us nothing.</span> <span id="s185">It happened the 26th of April.</span> <span id="s186">But we didn't know nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">They called people and told them to go a May 1 demonstration, and told children to go to the demonstration and to stand out in the Sun.</span> <span id="s188">I remember it was very hot.</span> <span id="s189">And my father went with children from school to the demonstration too, and they stayed almost two hours under the Sun.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Then, I don't remember exactly, maybe May 3rd, they told us Chernobyl Nuclear Station had an accident, but that it wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s191">And that we could stay in Gomel, and everything would be Okay and that it wasn't dangerous for children.</span> <span id="s192">It was Okay.</span> <span id="s193">But it was terrible and people in the government took their children and grandchildren away from Gomel and people began to talk about this and began to realize that maybe it was very bad.</span> <span id="s194">But, who had relatives in another city?</span> <span id="s195">Who could leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">And this year I finished my Institute and it was time for the government examination and if I did not go for the examination, I would lose the five years I worked in the Institute.</span> <span id="s197">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s198">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s199">And Kim, he couldn't just leave his work, and we had no money to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">So Katya was in my mother-in-law's house for a month, because I was in Minsk.</span> <span id="s201">For a whole month she didn't go outside.</span> <span id="s202">I called her every day and I cried because I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s203">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s204">And the day I took the last exam, the same night I came to Gomel and took Katya and went to Leningrad and was in Leningrad almost two months.</span> <span id="s205">But then my vacation finished and if I didn't want to lose my job I had to go back.</span> <span id="s206">But since this happened, we didn't buy any milk for the whole year.</span> <span id="s207">We just gave her canned milk because they always mark on the can which factory made it.</span> <span id="s208">We also didn't buy any beef, or meat from cows because it had radiation.</span> <span id="s209">We ate chicken.</span> <span id="s210">Because the cows eat the grass and we felt it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s211">It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Now, we know that it was very bad, and that it is getting worse, because we got a letter from our parents and they say the government is paying the people in Gomel extra money.</span> <span id="s213">How they can pay for health?</span> <span id="s214">And there is no food in the shops.</span> <span id="s215">And all fruit and vegetables were radioactive.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">(How long did it take before you found out that they were evacuating people from around the Chernobyl area?)</span> <span id="s217">In the city where the station was, the accident happened in the night from Friday to Saturday, but they evacuated the people on Sunday.</span> <span id="s218">But on Saturday, they knew, and in this city, maybe one-inch from station, the children were playing outside, and eating outside, and were waiting outside.</span> <span id="s219">And people didn't know anything even right near the station.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Gomel was not evacuated at all.</span> <span id="s221">Some little villages near Chernobyl were evacuated, but not Gomel.</span> <span id="s222">How can they evacuate 500,000 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">(So then, you and Kim were talking about the future and what to do?</span> <span id="s224">Had you already decided at that time after Chernobyl that you had to leave?)</span> <span id="s225">Not right away, after Chernobyl.</span> <span id="s226">It was difficult to leave, we had to have an invitation from Israel or America to leave Russia, but we didn't have one.</span> <span id="s227">Then, in 1988, my relatives got an invitation for themselves and then for us.</span> <span id="s228">My aunt, my mother's sister, got an invitation for us from Israel.</span> <span id="s229">We received the invitation from Israel in December and then in May we left Gomel.</span> <span id="s230">My aunt also lives in Chicago now.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">(What was the first thing you did after you got the invitation?)</span> <span id="s232">We went to the Department of Visas and Permision, (OVIR), and we went through paperwork and documents and our parents have to write that they give us permission, and so on.</span> <span id="s233">(Were you treated all right during this period?)</span> <span id="s234">It was Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">(When it was time to leave, what did you choose to take with you?)</span> <span id="s236">We took a little clothes and we sent one box of luggage to Vienna, to HIAS, some books, and they sent it on to New York and then Chicago for us.</span> <span id="s237">We knew we needed pillows and blankets to sleep and some clothes.</span> <span id="s238">When you fly by plane, there is a restriction on the weight you can take.</span> <span id="s239">When you go by train, there is not.</span> <span id="s240">But you know that in Italy there will be restrictions.</span> <span id="s241">Because from Italy to the USA, you know that you can only have two bags per person.</span> <span id="s242">So we knew that we were three persons and could have only six bags.</span> <span id="s243">We knew this in Russia, already.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">(Your brother is still in Russia, do you think he will come here?)</span> <span id="s245">They sent us an application and we sent it to Washington and now they have a case number and they are in the computer and they are already scheduled for an interview at the American Embassy in Moscow the 24th of October.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">You know it is difficult, because now we have to pay for them and it is a lot of money.</span> <span id="s247">We have nine people in Russia, so we probably will have to pay $12,000.</span> <span id="s248">We don't know how we will do it but we have to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">(Is your father going to come too?)</span> <span id="s250">Yes.</span> <span id="s251">All: my father, his wife and my parents-in-law and my husband's sister with her family and my brother, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">(end of side A of tape.)</span> <span id="s253">I learned a little English in school.</span> <span id="s254">From Fifth grade people study a foreign language, in my school it was English.</span> <span id="s255">It is only for one or two hours a week, so it is not very much.</span> <span id="s256">Then, in the Institute, I studied it for two years, but it was only twice a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">(When you got to Vienna, you didn't know at that point, whether you could go to the United States, or Israel.)</span> <span id="s258">We knew that we wanted to go to the United States but we didn't know what would happen.</span> <span id="s259">(Were you given a choice or how did it happen that you came here?)</span> <span id="s260">Everybody had a choice, but then it depends on whether you receive refugee status or not from the American Embassy in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">(Did they give you this status because you came from Chernobyl?)</span> <span id="s262">No, they don't pay any attention to Chernobyl.</span> <span id="s263">I'm not sure why they gave it to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">In Vienna, they met us in the train station and ask "Israel or the United States?"</span> <span id="s265">Then we were two weeks in Vienna and then they sent us to Italy and in Italy we were scheduled for an interview in the American Embassy and then we went to the Embassy and spoke with the Consul.</span> <span id="s266">Then, after a week, we heard that, "Nayman, you will fly on the twenty-fourth of July."</span> <span id="s267">and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">(When you landed in Chicago, did someone meet you here?)</span> <span id="s269">Yes, some people, they had signed for us and we didn't know them.</span> <span id="s270">They had relatives in Gomel and we asked them.</span> <span id="s271">They were here only six months themselves.</span> <span id="s272">So it was difficult for them, but they met us in the airport with a paper sign, "Nayman", because we never saw each other before.</span> <span id="s273">And we lived at their house only six days and then we rented an apartment and we came to live here on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">We were in Italy, one month and three weeks.</span> <span id="s275">Living on your own after six days in America, it was very difficult, because J.C.C. gives you check after you are here a month.</span> <span id="s276">They said, that your sponsor would keep you in the house for a month, but we could not stay with these people that long.</span> <span id="s277">They have three children, in a very small apartment.</span> <span id="s278">We were very grateful to them for keeping us for six days, but then we rented an apartment and it was very difficult and very hard without any money, without relatives and without friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">There were times when I was crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">I didn't work yet, and Kim first worked at a Pizza place and then, in the end of December, he found work at the Kosher-Sinai factory.</span> <span id="s281">So now he works at Kosher-Sinai and one or two evenings he works at Pizza.</span> <span id="s282">So he has one full-time job and a part-time job.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">(We are interested in what kinds of help you got from the different parts of the Jewish Community in Chicago, and if you got any help from the U.S. government.</span> <span id="s284">You had refugee status, what does that mean for you?)</span> <span id="s285">I think we received help only from Jewish Family and Community Service, from the Jewish Fund, not from government.</span> <span id="s286">Because we received checks, from JFCS, and we received no money from the government.</span> <span id="s287">The first few months we received Medicare from Jewish Family and Community Service.</span> <span id="s288">It is a little white medical card and on upper left side it says, Jewish Family and Community Service.</span> <span id="s289">We used Mount Sinai, it is very far.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">(Your home is furnished very beautifully.)</span> <span id="s291">I told you, but maybe you will laugh, because this TV is from garbage.</span> <span id="s292">It works, the color is not very good, but it works.</span> <span id="s293">You know, Jenny Spallone, she helped us get this sofa and lamp and some other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">DATE: September 27, 1990 - Second Interview</span></p>

close.</span> <span id="s300">My mother had two sisters and they were very close to each other.</span> <span id="s301">So holidays we'd spend together and we saw each other quite often.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">(Do you remember stories from after World War II?)</span> <span id="s303">Especially my grandmother would talk about this time.</span> <span id="s304">My grandmother never worked, so they didn't have a lot of money.</span> <span id="s305">Only grandfather worked.</span> <span id="s306">And they had three daughters, and my grandmother always wanted her daughters to have good educations.</span> <span id="s307">So all three daughters had high educations and all three studied music.</span> <span id="s308">My grandmother, she did everything for them.</span> <span id="s309">She kept a cow in her backyard so she had milk for the children.</span> <span id="s310">She had a chicken so she would have eggs.</span> <span id="s311">And she had a garden with vegetables and fruit, and she never worked outside the home, but she was always working in the home.</span> <span id="s312">She was always working in the yard or in the house.</span> <span id="s313">And she always cooked well.</span> <span id="s314">Everyone liked her cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">(Did your mother ever talk about the piano?)</span> <span id="s316">My mother didn't study piano.</span> <span id="s317">She started to study the cello.</span> <span id="s318">When she was young, I don't remember, but I think my grandmother told me it happened when they were in the evacuation that she played with other children and somebody hit her, I don't remember exactly, and something happened with her ear.</span> <span id="s319">And then in one ear she couldn't hear well.</span> <span id="s320">And so she studied for maybe a year, the cello, but then she often was sick, and it was quite heavy, and then she stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">But the other two daughters had musical educations, my Aunt Raisa was teaching conducting, choir and singing at the music college in our city, and the other daughter is now in Israel, she was a music teacher.</span> <span id="s322">She is older now.</span> <span id="s323">She's retired.</span> <span id="s324">My mother finished school with a silver medal.</span> <span id="s325">My grandmother thinks she deserved a gold medal, but that because of her Jewish nationality she received a silver medal.</span> <span id="s326">But it's very good.</span> <span id="s327">It's all As.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">So then she entered the Leningrad Institute.</span> <span id="s329">In a big city there are better universities, better institutes, better education.</span> <span id="s330">So she took the exams of course, and enrolled in the Leningrad Institute of Food Technology, and she studied five years and then she came back and found a job.</span> <span id="s331">She was an assistant supervisor.</span> <span id="s332">And she worked all this time at the factory, at only one job.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">(what about living in one room?)</span> <span id="s334">They all lived in one room.</span> <span id="s335">It was big, but it was one room.</span> <span id="s336">I don't think my mother felt any resentment.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">(What did she tell you about her childhood?)</span> <span id="s338">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s339">I was a kid when she died.</span> <span id="s340">Because of the Nazis, because Gomel was under fascist occupation, Grandmother was in Uzbekistan, somewhere in Middle Asia.</span> <span id="s341">And my father and his mother were somewhere in Siberia.</span> <span id="s342">I told you about his fingers.</span> <span id="s343">Maybe he went by himself to the forest to forage for firewood, and he became lost, and until she found him, his fingers had frozen.</span> <span id="s344">He didn't lose them, they only lost their shape, became swollen.</span> <span id="s345">But he can do everything, they just look ... He still went on to become a mathematician and a physicist.</span> <span id="s346">He can do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">(Did he tell you any stories from his childhood?)</span> <span id="s348">Sometimes about his school, or about people with whom he was in school, but I don't remember anything exactly.</span> <span id="s349">I think maybe they were always working.</span> <span id="s350">I was with grandparents often.</span> <span id="s351">Mother was also working all day, and father.</span> <span id="s352">And maybe because I was little, I don't remember anything much about their childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">(Stories from grandparents...) I remember a story about my great-grandfather.</span> <span id="s354">Sometimes they told me about our relatives, you know, but I don't remember anything interesting.</span> <span id="s355">This story, it was interesting.</span> <span id="s356">I memorized it.</span> <span id="s357">But my grandmother from my father's side.</span> <span id="s358">She often talked about her husband.</span> <span id="s359">Like he loved her and he was a very good husband, and when he died in the war, she never got married again.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">(When you studied piano with Raisa, where was the piano?)</span> <span id="s361">I was six years old.</span> <span id="s362">First Raisa gave me some lessons at her house, and then I went to school and studied music there.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">(problems getting family out of Russia-- meaning of refugee status) Refugee status means a lot.</span> <span id="s364">Without this status I think few people can get here.</span> <span id="s365">Because if you don't have any relatives, you won't receive help if you can't find a job, it's only if you have rich relatives who can support you.</span> <span id="s366">And of course many Russians don't have any relatives at all.</span> <span id="s367">We don't have any relatives at all here.</span> <span id="s368">We are the first from our family.</span> <span id="s369">And so for us it means everything.</span> <span id="s370">We have refugee status, so they bought us tickets.</span> <span id="s371">But now we repay HIAS.</span> <span id="s372">We start to repay them.</span> <span id="s373">But it's a little amount every month.</span> <span id="s374">And of course in Italy we didn't have $1,500 a ticket for each person.</span> <span id="s375">So they bought us tickets.</span> <span id="s376">They met us in New York, and we spent the night in New York, and then we took the plane to Chicago.</span> <span id="s377">For three months we received money only from Jewish people, nothing from the government, only from Jewish people.</span> <span id="s378">For three months we received money for apartment rent, and for food, and it was for three months, and we received $700 for furniture.</span> <span id="s379">Then they gave us Medicare.</span> <span id="s380">We have a counselor in Jewish Family and Vocational Service.</span> <span id="s381">It means a lot for us, refugee status.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">We have the I-94 visa, and that gave us permits to work.</span> <span id="s383">And we have the right for getting green cards,--- only it will take a long time, but we should receive a card because we have refugee status.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">(So your family in Gomel is waiting for an appointment?</span> <span id="s385">with the US Embassy in October...) They have to answer the questions.</span> <span id="s386">I hope they receive refugee status.</span> <span id="s387">I don't know exactly how they determine who gets refugee status and who gets immigrant status.</span> <span id="s388">I read in the newspaper, a daily Russian newspaper, "New Russian Word" from New York, there are now many different laws, and some new rules have been made, but I don't know exactly how they work.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">When we were in Italy, we didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s390">It was like a play.</span> <span id="s391">You can receive refugee status or not, it was like a lottery.</span> <span id="s392">Nobody really knew, because almost every Jew was in the same situation.</span> <span id="s393">Many were refused in Italy by the American Embassy.</span> <span id="s394">So nobody really understood how they determined if you were a refugee or not.</span> <span id="s395">We filled out many applications, and had interviews, too.</span> <span id="s396">People who were refused refugee status by the United States, some went on to Israel, others stayed to wait.</span> <span id="s397">And sometimes they would re-apply and sometimes a second time they'd be refused refugee status, and some people would wait until they were the last immigrants in Italy.</span> <span id="s398">It was finishing in Italy because of many rules, and because Italy had the soccer championship, and some people who waited long enough, they didn't go to Israel, they went to the United States.</span> <span id="s399">I know one woman in the United States who stayed in Italy 10 months.</span> <span id="s400">She was refused for 10 months and then she came.</span> <span id="s401">The [Joint] was willing to pay for her to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">(Your grandmother has a very deep religious background.</span> <span id="s403">Because of the repression in the USSR she had to raise her daughters without the traditions.</span> <span id="s404">So the next generation knows even less.)</span> <span id="s405">Nothing.</span> <span id="s406">(Now that you're here, how do you think you're going to raise Katya?)</span> <span id="s407">I think I want her to know that she's Jewish and to be happy about it.</span> <span id="s408">Dignity.</span> <span id="s409">We felt this way in Russia.</span> <span id="s410">We know that many famous people are Jewish, so we know there's a pride about it.</span> <span id="s411">We really didn't know anything about Jewish traditions and customs, and then we came here and now we have two Jewish families who are our friends, they are very good friends, and they help us to learn Jewish traditions.</span> <span id="s412">On Rosh Hashona, we were together in the temple, and Katya was here with us and she asked many questions and it was interesting for her.</span> <span id="s413">And Katya was in camp all summer, and they had shabbat.</span> <span id="s414">And she sings some songs in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s415">A little.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Our friends belong to a reformed synagogue.</span> <span id="s417">Temple Ch'ai.</span> <span id="s418">I like the reformed Judaism because we grew up like atheists, and we're not so young like Katya, so I think we will not accept orthodoxy - we accept, we understand, we like it, we like the people who absorb all this, but it's difficult for us, because we were atheists and knew nothing about all this.</span> <span id="s419">So for this [in the reformed] it's more open and there's more freedom of choice.</span> <span id="s420">But it is very interesting.</span> <span id="s421">We went many times with Jennie Spallone to this temple and the rabbi is a good speaker and it is very interesting to listen to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">(Would it matter to you if Katya's playmates are Jewish or not Jewish?)</span> <span id="s423">I think not.</span> <span id="s424">Of course I would like it if she played with Jewish children, but I only want her to play with good children, because I had in Russia many Russian friends.</span> <span id="s425">It doesn't depend on nationality - it depends on people, whether you're a good person or not.</span> <span id="s426">And I like Jewish, but some Russians are good, and some Americans, and some Jews.</span> <span id="s427">Especially here in America with lots of nationalities and immigrants, it's a country of immigrants, so she has to learn to play with everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">(How would you feel about her marrying a non-Jew?)</span> <span id="s429">Of course I want her to marry Jewish.</span> <span id="s430">Of course.</span> <span id="s431">[We plan to be Jewish here.]</span> <span id="s432">If I was a Jew in Russia, where it was unpleasant and even sometimes dangerous, no, but here when somebody asks me, yes, it's pride.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">(Would you tell people you were Jewish?)</span> <span id="s434">At work everybody knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s435">And I would say it with dignity so that they wouldn't see that I was afraid that I'm Jewish, so they wouldn't say bad things about Jews behind our backs.</span> <span id="s436">Sometimes people would say bad things about another Jew.</span> <span id="s437">So I'd say, "I'm Jewish", then they'd feel respect, and fall silent, and say "no, no, no, you're a good Jew."</span> <span id="s438">And then they wouldn't say things like that in front of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">My daughter is in first grade, in public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">(Observations you would like to make?)</span> <span id="s441">I have only one hope, to find a job.</span> <span id="s442">Because if you are working here, then everything's okay.</span> <span id="s443">Of course there are some problems.</span> <span id="s444">You can live very well if you work.</span> <span id="s445">I have only one hope and dream, to find a job.</span> <span id="s446">My husband is so-so with his job.</span> <span id="s447">It is a very hard job.</span> <span id="s448">He's not afraid because it's hard, but there's no future.</span> <span id="s449">He's young, and all the way until retirement to wash meat.</span> <span id="s450">And only he works.</span> <span id="s451">And so he hopes I can find a job so he can go study.</span> <span id="s452">He wants to study English.</span> <span id="s453">He worked in a shoe factory in Gomel.</span> <span id="s454">But there's no shoe factory in Chicago.</span> <span id="s455">Only a little one, where they make ballet shoes, but it's not enough money even for an apartment.</span> <span id="s456">Now he even has two jobs because it's very difficult.</span> <span id="s457">He delivers pizza.</span> <span id="s458">It is very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">(What was the worst time for you in Russia?)</span> <span id="s460">I think when my mother died.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">(...and since you've been here) When we came here it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s462">We got an apartment, and there was nothing here.</span> <span id="s463">We slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s464">And nobody called.</span> <span id="s465">The phone was silent.</span> <span id="s466">We had nobody to speak with.</span> <span id="s467">I cried because I missed my family there.</span> <span id="s468">I felt so lonely.</span> <span id="s469">It was so hard.</span> <span id="s470">My grandmother came ten days after we got here.</span> <span id="s471">And the second hard time is now I've finished my course and am looking for a job.</span> <span id="s472">I worry about finding a job, that I've spent $4,000 for tuition and won't find a job.</span> <span id="s473">I've sent out 80 resumes.</span> <span id="s474">Sometimes I call and they say to send a resume.</span></p></body></html>
