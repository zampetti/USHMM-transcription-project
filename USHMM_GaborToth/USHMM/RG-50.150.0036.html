trouble in school because once we had a celebration and reports and I was chosen for that and there was an argument that I was a Jew and I shouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s20">That was one of the

mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: After they lost the war, Kaiser Wilhelm was thrown out and there was fighting in the streets and</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Why did your father throw his uniform out of the window?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Because he didn’t want to be anymore in the Army.</span> <span id="s43">It was more or less communist inspired.</span></p> <p><span

inflation?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Let’s say in 1922 they stabilized the money and I remember I was working in Magdeburg before I went to Berlin, I had to go to the Reichsbank and I got bags with money and it was worthless so a few years later I got the first dollar and a dollar was from four million marks so you couldn’t buy anything at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: What were you working at in Magdeburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Commercial but then I stopped that because I always was singing and I had lessons in Magdeburg already and then I went to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: How long did you study in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: I went there in 1927 and my father had a friend who was a connoisseur of voice and he was the agent for Sol Hurok and Hurok came over and he formed an German Grand Opera and Madame Gottsky she was a member of the Metropolitan Opera here, she was a prima donna and I got a contract and I went over to America in 1929 for four months with the German Grand Opera and performed all over the country.</span> <span id="s52">For instance, I was singing in the City Opera building, then we went to California, all over the country.</span> <span id="s53">We had our own train and our own orchestra and all that.</span> <span id="s54">That was 1929.</span> <span id="s55">I came back home after four months and came back to America again the next year.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Again on tour?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s58">After I came back in 1930, I got a contract in Germany as an opera singer in one of the smaller theaters – I was very young at that time.</span> <span id="s59">Then I was a member of a few other productions until 1933 – then it was over because I was thrown out of the Theater Kammern – that was the equity and then I became a member of a very famous Jewish Choir.</span> <span id="s60">It was the Wienerwehr Choir – 30 Jewish men.</span> <span id="s61">Actually the name was the Thirty Jewish Singers from Germany and we toured all over the East.</span> <span id="s62">We started in Czechoslovakia and then we went to Vienna, Budapest, Yugoslavia and we ended in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: You mentioned that you were thrown out in 1933 immediately when Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s65">But then that time we were in Palestine and we had an agent and he let us down so we were working I remember in a Kibbutz, a German Kibbutz.</span> <span id="s66">I fell sick and I had to leave Palestine, I wanted to stay there but it was impossible.</span> <span id="s67">I had to go back to Italy and emigrate immediately after that and I went back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: You mentioned you wanted to stay in Palestine, did you mean permanently?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s70">And then after that, I was working for the Zionist organization in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Were you still a member of this choir?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No, that disbanded.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: After you came back from Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yes, but Mr. Wienerwehr was here in New York and I think he had a choir here but he passed away.</span> <span id="s75">He was a very famous choir master.</span> <span id="s76">And now we came to 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: You were working in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s79">I studied for Hazzanut in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Why did you decide to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Because I always wanted to stay a singer and I studied and I was ordained as a cantor in Germany and I did some High Holiday services with the Cantor Golanin and then in 1939, I emigrated to England.</span> <span id="s82">I met my wife, my late wife already 1927, it would be 50 years this month, and in England I became a cantor.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Let me just retrace a moment.</span> <span id="s84">You said that you were in Berlin for Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s85">What happened on Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Well, all the synagogues were burned.</span> <span id="s87">Then ransacked the stores.</span> <span id="s88">They marked them “Jew”.</span> <span id="s89">They smashed the windows and then started that they took the Jewish men to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s90">I was lucky because I was that time still working part-time for the Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: You think you weren’t taken because you were working for the Zionist organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s93">But I was sleeping one night there and one night there.</span> <span id="s94">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s95">You walked through glass and each time – I remember when we were in England and the Germans came over and bombed and the glass was in the street and it was the same thing – we walked through glass.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: During all this time, since you were dismissed from your position in 1933 already, had you ever thought of emigrating before?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s98">Actually I wanted to go back to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Was that possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: No.</span> <span id="s101">I would have been trained for a hallutz and I don’t think I could have done it.</span> <span id="s102">But nevertheless, I worked during my stay in Palestine because we were let down by the agent.</span> <span id="s103">I worked for the city of Tel Aviv manually – in the street between Tel Aviv and Jaffa – we did some work.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: What happened to you personally immediately after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Nothing to me personally.</span> <span id="s106">As I said, I didn’t sleep at home and then through my work in the Hehalutz in the Meineckestrasse in the Zionist organization, I got a permit to go to England for my wife, I got a domestic permit so we emigrated to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: When did you apply to go to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Oh, that was very fast.</span> <span id="s109">In 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Did you need any guarantee of support?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: No.</span> <span id="s112">I had a permit.</span> <span id="s113">I had to say that I work whatever I get, from the Begrubsberger House, that was the refugee committee.</span> <span id="s114">So, I got it very fast and I went over August, 1939 and I worked a few months there and I became a singer for – in a liberal synagogue in a choir and the organist heard me and she recommended me to one of the famous singers, German singers, Madame Gerhard and from then on, I became an opera singer again in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Did you join a company?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes, I got a contract for the Tales of Hoffman and I worked there 15 months, only Tales of Hoffman.</span> <span id="s117">I was singing Speranzani.</span> <span id="s118">And then from there on, I did some musical comedies and then I became a member of the Royal Carosa Opera Company until I came here to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Was it your intention to re-emigrate from England to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Yes, I had already, I was already on the waiting list already in Berlin.</span> <span id="s121">I had a number but that didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s122">But I want to tell you something what happened to me in London.</span> <span id="s123">When we went to the American consulate to get our visa, the American consul asked me how come that you didn’t had to go to the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s124">So I was flabbergasted at that question and I reported it and I heard that the consul was recalled to America because of this anti-Semitic attitude.</span> <span id="s125">So we came to America and I worked here for commercial companies and then I became a cantor here on 182nd Street and Audubon Avenue.</span> <span id="s126">There was a small reform synagogue and I became cantor there.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Just let me retrace a little.</span> <span id="s128">How did you feel on the day you left Germany?</span> <span id="s129">Were you married already?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: No, we were married in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Well, how did you feel on the day that you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Well, with on dry and one laughing eye.</span> <span id="s133">I went a few days before the war broke out and my wife came with the last boat from Holland to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: When you said one dry eye and one laughing eye, could you explain this a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Well, I was very happy to leave and that I could escape the Nazis but I left all my family there – my mother and my parents-in-law and my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s136">Still we were friends, we were not yet married, yes, we were engaged.</span> <span id="s137">But what could I do – I had to save my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: What happened to these relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: My mother-in-law, my father-in-law, my mother, they all were in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s140">We tried to find out through the Red Cross and we got the reply and we heard they don’t live anymore.</span> <span id="s141">They died in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: How early were they taken to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: 1940, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: At that time, you were still in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s146">We heard through the Red Cross in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: When did you come to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: In 1947.</span> <span id="s149">I was a member of the Royal Carosa Opera Company until the day we left for America.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: When you came to America, was it difficult for you to get this job as a cantor?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s152">First I tried through Hurok to become a singer here again.</span> <span id="s153">I auditioned and there was a very strong competition because good looking men and young men – I wasn’t so young anymore so I didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s154">One of the agents said listen, they are looking for a base-baritone, would you like to do it?</span> <span id="s155">So I said yes and it was a small synagogue and I was in the choir and they had one of the – for one of the holidays they had a cantor and I guessed he is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s156">So I knew all the – they had the same music as we had in Germany so I went to the President and said “Here I am, I know everything and I have a voice.</span> <span id="s157">Why do you engage a non-Jew?</span> <span id="s158">So I got that job and I was there for about ten years, until they couldn’t do it anymore because you know the neighborhood was Spanish that time already.</span> <span id="s159">They smashed the windows of the synagogue so they discontinued that service.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: When you got off the boat in 1947, where did you go then?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: I took the first papers out.</span> <span id="s162">Really, I knew New York and I said to my wife, now we go and become Americans and that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s163">Then we started to find jobs.</span> <span id="s164">My wife got a job easier than I did.</span> <span id="s165">She was working in an office.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Had she been trained to do this in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s168">She was a girl Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Did you come immediately to Washington Heights?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: No.</span> <span id="s171">We had first one small room on 116th Street opposite the campus and then we moved up to 140th Street and then we were living here on Cummins Street and then in 1975 we moved to this apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Why were you attracted to the 116th Street area?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Because my brother and sister-in-law lived there.</span> <span id="s174">It was a rooming house and we were very lucky to get a small room there first and then we moved to other rooms in the same building.</span> <span id="s175">And then we got an apartment on 140th Street.</span> <span id="s176">It was still good that time, 1948, 49 and then we moved up to Washington Heights.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Did you have any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: I would like to go back to when you were younger in Germany for a moment.</span> <span id="s180">When you lived in Magdeburg and you were working before you went to Berlin, did you know anyone who belonged to the Hitler Youth or the Party?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Yes, in the same office as I was working there were a few people who belonged to the Hitler Youth and I always had trouble with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: When Hitler came to power, you were already in Berlin, was there a marked difference between the gentile attitude towards the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s184">Especially not in Berlin but in the little city I was working in as a singer, we had people there who were very anti-Semitic but they couldn’t do anything but the first moment when Hitler came to power, they became S.A. men and S.S. men and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: When you say you had trouble, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Well, they ignored me.</span> <span id="s187">They couldn’t do anything else.</span> <span id="s188">They did no bodily harm but otherwise it was very, very uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Did you think of emigrating at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yes, as soon as I came back from America, I applied for the family for an affidavit.</span> <span id="s191">I had relatives here in New York but that time I didn’t like to go there, I liked to enjoy myself so I didn’t get the affidavit.</span> <span id="s192">This was when I traveled in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: When you went to Palestine, you had to go back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s195">I went up to the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem and applied for a permanent home in Palestine – I as already a member of a kibbutz and he said there are too many illegal people here in Palestine – we can’t do it.</span> <span id="s196">You have to go out and you have to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: You mean you have to come back legally.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s199">You go to Italy and you go back later.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: When you left Germany, did you think there was any possibility that Hitler could be short lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: That time, no.</span> <span id="s202">That time he was very much in power already.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Did you think this in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: All the Jews said that doesn’t matter, he won’t last long but they were mistaken.</span> <span id="s205">And it is the same here.</span> <span id="s206">I mean anti-Semitism is rising here terrifically.</span> <span id="s207">The Jews should be aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Do you remember the election of 1932?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Did most people know that a vote for Hindenburg was a vote for Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Hindenburg was an old man.</span> <span id="s212">He was senile already that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Did the Jews align themselves with the Social Democrats?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Well, with the Democrats.</span> <span id="s215">They even were members of the right parties.</span> <span id="s216">My late brother-in-law was a member of the right parties.</span> <span id="s217">I couldn’t understand it because I was a democrat.</span> <span id="s218">I voted democrat and my father voted democrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: When you say right, do you mean conservative party?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s221">Conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: When you left Germany, were you only able to take the 10RM?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yes, and it happened that I had more than 10 RM on me and I nearly missed the train to Holland because they made trouble.</span> <span id="s224">I sent it back to my fiancée.</span> <span id="s225">I went with 10 RM.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: How did they make trouble?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Well, it was at the frontier, you know.</span> <span id="s228">They examined my luggage and they said well, you know, you shouldn’t have more than 10 RM and it took such a long time until they gave me the okay that I can go back to the train – it was already moving.</span> <span id="s229">But as I went on a permit to England, I had no trouble.</span> <span id="s230">They picked me up at the harbor and I was living in a hostel in London for quite a while and then I got my own room and during the Blitz, the committee moved out to the country.</span> <span id="s231">My wife was in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: How do you feel today about the Wiedergutmachung?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Well, I get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: How do you feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Well, I say the people – because I’m very anti-German, very.</span> <span id="s236">I wouldn’t buy anything from Germany, no food, nothing.</span> <span id="s237">So they say but you get Wiedergutmachung.</span> <span id="s238">I say that it what they had stolen.</span> <span id="s239">That is only repayment of money which they had taken from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Have you ever been back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: No.</span> <span id="s242">I wouldn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I hate them.</span> <span id="s245">I wouldn’t go to Germany and I don’t understand that people are going there.</span> <span id="s246">I always ask them when they say how wonderful it was, I ask them do you know America?</span> <span id="s247">Have you traveled in America?</span> <span id="s248">If you don’t, stay here and don’t go to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: What about people who feel that it is really their home country or want to see their home town?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: That I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s251">Some are going to their home town – they want to see the cemeteries.</span> <span id="s252">But I know a few of my friends who would never go back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s253">My sister-in-law for instance she once was in Germany to visit relatives but she wouldn’t go to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Why specifically not Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Because she comes from Berlin and she went through all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: When did she come over here?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: In 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Do you feel yourself today more a part of the American mainstream or more a part of the German Jewish community in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: American.</span> <span id="s260">As I told you I’m very active in the organizations here.</span> <span id="s261">I’m a member of the Free Sons of Israel, the oldest national Jewish organization here and I’m a member of the B’nai B’rith and I’m very active.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Are most of your friends Americans or German- Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: In comparing your early career as a singer and your singing here in the U.S., how would you compare the opportunities?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Well, the opportunities here for singers is they have to be young.</span> <span id="s266">If you hear the auditions, they are all young people.</span> <span id="s267">I don’t think there’s much of an opportunity for well – I retired, I’m not singing anymore, for men over 45.</span> <span id="s268">Let’s say there’s not much of an opportunity for a singer here while we had in Germany and in England in every little city an opera house, we do not have it here.</span> <span id="s269">You know, they are touring here too.</span> <span id="s270">So there is not much of an opportunity and they get here from all countries the best singers and when you hear the Rigoletto opening night, it is wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Do you go to the cultural activities in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Did you in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s275">I did and I did in England.</span> <span id="s276">When we were touring, the English people were queuing up days and days for tickets.</span> <span id="s277">They were very enthusiastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Why don’t you go as much here?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: I’m too busy
