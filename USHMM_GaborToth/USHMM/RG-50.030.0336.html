KATZKI: Yes, my name is Herbert Katzki.</span> <span id="s12">I used to be with the JDC.</span> <span id="s13">I retired.</span> <span id="s14">At the time I retired I was associate executive vice‑president of the agency.</span> <span id="s15">During the time of the holocaust when I was stationed over in Europe I was secretary of the European council of the JDC.</span> <span id="s16">The European council was made up or theoretically made up of the leadership of the various committees and the various countries in which we operated but that never came to be because of the war with germany which came on too soon after one had the inspiration of establishing the European council.</span> <span id="s17">So I had the title but there wasn't any council, really, to be with.</span> <span id="s18">The experience that I had with thewith the holocaust was not a very long one.</span> <span id="s19">I'd been in Paris.</span> <span id="s20">I'd come over to Paris.</span> <span id="s21">I got there in November 1939.</span> <span id="s22">They had been there inin Paris untiluntil we were chased out by the Germans.</span> <span id="s23">We had our headquarters, our office, inin Paris and there was a series of transmutations.</span> <span id="s24">We had to evacuate theParis when theywhen the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s25">We closed the office down on Tuesday.</span> <span id="s26">The Germans came into Paris on Thursday.</span> <span id="s27">And I went then to Marca (ph.) and worked in the unoccupied ____________ of France for the Jewish refugees who had come down into the unoccupied ____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">INTERVIEWER: Let me just stop you a second because I want to hear about all of that in your single interview, but let's just talk about the period right after the war</span></p> <p><span id="s29">MR. KATZKI: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">INTERVIEWER:when you and Ted were involved in the same operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">MR. KATZKI: I see.</span> <span id="s32">Well, rightrightright afterright after the war I'd been up ininbackback inin Paris and we were making a change in the member was in charge of our operations in Germany.</span> <span id="s33">That was a man by the name of Jacob Grobe.</span> <span id="s34">He was coming out.</span> <span id="s35">Somebody had to go in to hold down the fort.</span> <span id="s36">So I was sent in from Paris to take over the German operation.</span> <span id="s37">The headquarters of the JDC at that time were in Hurst (ph.).</span> <span id="s38">Hurst is a suburb of Frankfurt and a couple weeks after I got there Unrah (ph.), which had his headquarters inin Hurst had to move their office up to Arelson (ph.) which is not far from the border between the American, the British occupied, so and so, ofof aGermany.</span> <span id="s39">And so I ended up in Arelson.</span> <span id="s40">I guess I got up there in January 1946.</span> <span id="s41">And that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s42">And it was while I was up in Arelson that I met Mr. Feder who was at that time associated with Unrah in their headquarters operation which also was up in Arelson.</span> <span id="s43">And so that's our first.</span> <span id="s44">Our first association would be locate in the same metropolis of Arelson which I think had a population of 2500 people.</span> <span id="s45">TheINTERVIEWER: Okay.</span> <span id="s46">Let'slet me just have Ted introduce himself as well and then we can find out more.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">MR. FEDER: My name is Ted Feder.</span> <span id="s48">Presently retired.</span> <span id="s49">Still working in a number of programs in the headquarters of the JDC and this pertains to both of us that if they can't find it in the archives ask Katzki or Feder and they'll tell you.</span> <span id="s50">And it's true because I think our combined knowledge is extraordinary.</span> <span id="s51">When we moved to Alician (ph.) there was some thing unreal about being in a small town and being involved in an organization supposedly helping so many people andand communication was terrible.</span> <span id="s52">There was not a main line.</span> <span id="s53">The roads were very difficult and no one was happy being in Alician and it could very well have been that when Unrah phased out, which was '47, were the ____________ commission of the international refugee organization or PCIRO took over from Unrah, the staff and then a year later IRO took over.</span> <span id="s54">Then eventually it was taken over by the UN commissioner.</span> <span id="s55">____________ commissioner refugees.</span> <span id="s56">You could imagine being in a small town like that there wasn't a great anddeal to do.</span> <span id="s57">____________ a movie.</span> <span id="s58">The Unrah really could have cared less about those people and giving them any kind of cultural services.</span> <span id="s59">So there's a real difficult place to be in.</span> <span id="s60">I had mentioned that my ____________ with the JDC because I was dissatisfied withbeing with Unrah for many reasons.</span> <span id="s61">Political for one and the fact that therethere were so many people who looked to make ____________ working with Unrah and hundreds of employees were sentsent back for getting into things they shouldn't have gotten in.</span> <span id="s62">And it was then that either Herb or Harry Beal (ph.) who is an associate, listened to my plea to take me on staff with the JDC and ____________ ____________ to September '46.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">INTERVIEWER: Now did youyou both were in the headquarters office or you had, I assume, very different responsibilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">MR. FEDER: Different responsibilities.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">MR. KATZKI: Different responsibilities.</span> <span id="s66">Well, upup in Alician I was with one agency and Ted was with another agency.</span> <span id="s67">My agency was a joint distribution committee and Ted's agency was Unrah up in Arelson, so that each of us for our own agency had our own jobs to do and contacts which we might have had were incidental toincidental to our work or a cooperative effort or something likelike that.</span> <span id="s68">But our agencies were so independent of each other.</span> <span id="s69">Thehow did the JDC get up to Arelson?</span> <span id="s70">TedTed might have explained the circumstances under which JDC got intototo Germany.</span> <span id="s71">There was a very difficult time for JDC to get into Germany.</span> <span id="s72">Armyarmy had responsibility as an occupier.</span> <span id="s73">They farmed out the welfare work to Unrah because they said "We're soldiers.</span> <span id="s74">We're not social workers," and they turned it over.</span> <span id="s75">Ted explained all of that earlier on andandand then with thewith that kind of a situation JDC had to come and then ____________ Unrah's offices and that's why when they moved up to Arelson, the JDC had to move up to Arelson too.</span> <span id="s76">The</span></p> <p><span id="s77">MR. FEDER: Herb, would you say that the problem we had in getting called forward to Germany was different than the other ____________ agencies</span></p> <p><span id="s78">MR. KATZKI: No</span></p> <p><span id="s79">MR. FEDER:____________ the same trouble?</span> <span id="s80">Didn't the</span></p> <p><span id="s81">MR. KATZKI: Wewewe all had the same trouble because the army was not enamored of having civilians overover running the territory over which they had responsibility.</span> <span id="s82">So they weren't anxious to let thelet the civilians come in.</span> <span id="s83">So theytheythe Unrah, of course, theythey had sent the official status because they were invited in by the army to do the welfare work, but that didn't mean they had to let the voluntary agencies in at the same time.</span> <span id="s84">And so the voluntary agency had a very difficult time to get permissions to have their people come into thecome into the country.</span> <span id="s85">I think the first fellow who went was, I think, Eli Rock (ph.).</span> <span id="s86">Eli Rock went in with thewith the first ____________ or it must have been around in July or August of 191945 that he went in with a small team intointo Munich.</span> <span id="s87">But then after that had been done and then the drill was worked out we were able to get our people then all right, but they had to be called forward.</span> <span id="s88">Each person individually had to be called forward into Germany with their set of travel ____________ from the army and everything else in order of them to be able to get into the country.</span> <span id="s89">It wasn'tit wasn'tit wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s90">And the other agencies had the same difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">INTERVIEWER: What other obstacles were there in terms of your getting entrenched there?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">MR. KATZKI: Theytheytheythe difficulty with this as Ias I explained, the army didn't want civilians running around.</span> <span id="s93">Once you got into the place and that was part of this business being called forward and so on after that it was all right, but the job was to get in there and theninin the first place.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">MR. FEDER: ____________ fortunate that before us, before we came in there was a caddy of people including rabbis, chaplains</span></p> <p><span id="s95">MR. KATZKI: That wasthat was military.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">MR. FEDER: Please, please.</span> <span id="s97">I'm saying they did our job.</span> <span id="s98">Kwasnick (ph.), not Kwasnick, Trousner (ph.)</span></p> <p><span id="s99">MR. KATZKI: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">MR. FEDER:was responsible for having an organization that started a central committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">MR. KATZKI: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">MR. FEDER: He was there.</span> <span id="s103">Many others were there seeing what the needs were.</span> <span id="s104">They were very unhappy that they could only do a limited amount of help.</span> <span id="s105">In organization they had no supplies and sobut they did.</span> <span id="s106">Wewe came in to a well organized committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">MR. KATZKI: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">MR. FEDER: Of course what was sad was once they got organized they forgot those they didn't have to to organize.</span> <span id="s109">But that's politics in any kind of organization.</span> <span id="s110">But</span></p> <p><span id="s111">MR. KATZKI: Withwithwith the rabbis theythey could easily get in because they went in with the army, so they came in that way.</span> <span id="s112">But I think that the work that they did forfor the Jewish people in the country werewerecame under the heading of extra curricular activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">MR. FEDER: Well, obviously.</span> <span id="s114">They ____________.</span> <span id="s115">____________ was kicked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">MR. KATZKI: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">MR. FEDER: Max ____________ was given the reprimand.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">MR. KATZKI: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">MR. FEDER: So if they</span></p> <p><span id="s120">MR. KATZKI: ____________ extra curricular.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">MR. FEDER: Sobut theytheythey did a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">MR. KATZKI: Theytheytheythey did a good job.</span> <span id="s123">For example, the JDC had a great deal of difficulty in getting its supplies into Germany.</span> <span id="s124">A couple of reasons.</span> <span id="s125">Firstfirst of all, ourour supplies were piling up in thein the ports in the United States because we couldn't get any ships.</span> <span id="s126">The ships were all taken up by theby the army for moving their troops around and so on.</span> <span id="s127">And it was wellwell into 1945 or '46 even, when we were able to movemove any supplymove any supplies at all.</span> <span id="s128">In the meantime though, what thewhat the chaplains did through the APO they would write letters home to their families and say "Will you please start sending parcels."</span> <span id="s129">And so they sent them all kinds of parcels intoto the various chaplains and that was aa ____________ supply program, but</span></p> <p><span id="s130">MR. FEDER: Well, but it was really</span></p> <p><span id="s131">MR. KATZKI:it wasn't really much of a supply program because you can't</span></p> <p><span id="s132">MR. FEDER: Not very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">MR. KATZKI:you can't</span></p> <p><span id="s134">MR. FEDER: First of all, APO was limited the size of package</span></p> <p><span id="s135">MR. KATZKI: That's right.</span> <span id="s136">And how many chaplains</span></p> <p><span id="s137">MR. FEDER: How much did you put in a square foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">MR. KATZKI: That's right.</span> <span id="s139">____________ chaplains</span></p> <p><span id="s140">MR. FEDER: Andand themany of theof the chaplains had trouble once they got it.</span> <span id="s141">How to distribute it?</span> <span id="s142">Who should get it?</span> <span id="s143">Do you give it to leadership?</span> <span id="s144">Do you give it to a home?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">MR. KATZKI: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">MR. FEDER: And so they had real problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">MR. KATZKI: That's right.</span> <span id="s148">Soso that was the beginning of theof theof the supply problem.</span> <span id="s149">So the JDC was rather handicapped in the beginning.</span> <span id="s150">We could get some staff in despite the problems which I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s151">We could some staff in but we couldn't get any supplies in and consequently when we went around to talk to the refugees the refugees said "Where is the joint in all of this?</span> <span id="s152">We see their people.</span> <span id="s153">We want supplies and we don'twe don't get it.</span> <span id="s154">Where is the joint and what is the joint doing?"</span> <span id="s155">Well, that wore out ofafterwhen supplies started coming in they had other complaints ____________ ____________.</span> <span id="s156">But afterafter that, but those were the principle handicaps which the JDC had in getting their operation going in Germany.</span> <span id="s157">First, getting their staff in and secondly, getting the supplies in.</span> <span id="s158">But after awhile thatthatthatthat workedworked out all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">MR. FEDER: Was it interesting that there was a different approach by Unrah and the army for the displaced persons in Austria.</span> <span id="s160">Remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">MR. KATZKI: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">MR. FEDER: We were given the responsibility of running the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">MR. KATZKI: Well</span></p> <p><span id="s164">MR. FEDER: Yes.</span> <span id="s165">Yes.</span> <span id="s166">They were our camps.</span> <span id="s167">There wasn't a large</span></p> <p><span id="s168">MR. KATZKI: Oh, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s169">They were our camps because they were opened up to the benefit of theof theumthe Hungarians who came over the boarder.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">MR. FEDER: No.</span> <span id="s171">No, that wasthat was later, Herb.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">MR. KATZKI: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">MR. FEDER: Thisthis was a method of operating.</span> <span id="s174">____________ was the director of half a dozen camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">MR. KATZKI: Was he?</span> <span id="s176">I didn't know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">MR. FEDER: Yes, and we had the responsibility.</span> <span id="s178">Unrah supplied the food and so on</span></p> <p><span id="s179">MR. KATZKI: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">MR. FEDER:but wewe were the key here all of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">MR. KATZKI: I see.</span> <span id="s182">Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s183">MR. FEDER: Of course, when I think of some of the beautiful places they were put up in former PB sanitarium on the top of mountains andno wonder they didn't want to move when they had to be moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">MR. KATZKI: They lived a life of Reilly.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">MR. FEDER: But thethe army, whowho was Clark (ph.), General Clark was an officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">MR. KATZKI: Clark.</span> <span id="s187">Clark was in Viennan, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">MR. FEDER: Hehe was much more tolerant than what we had in Germany.</span> <span id="s189">Maybe it's because some of our JDC people were good poker players</span></p> <p><span id="s190">MR. KATZKI: Joe</span></p> <p><span id="s191">MR. FEDER: and played poker</span></p> <p><span id="s192">MR. KATZKI: Joe</span></p> <p><span id="s193">MR. FEDER:played poker with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">MR. KATZKI: Joe Silva (ph.).</span></p> <p><span id="s195">MR. FEDER: You never know how you got a head in dealing withwith people.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">MR. KATZKI: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">MR. FEDER: But your responsibilities inin Germany, Herb, we didn't use a heavy hands on the people in the camps or rather</span></p> <p><span id="s198">MR. KATZKI: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">MR. FEDER:our people in the camps</span></p> <p><span id="s200">MR. KATZKI: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">MR. FEDER:or in Munich because ____________ they would do what they could.</span> <span id="s202">It wasn't easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">MR. KATZKI: They were doing their work.</span> <span id="s204">No.</span> <span id="s205">No.</span> <span id="s206">No, my responsibility in Germany was an overall responsibility andbeing the overall director.</span> <span id="s207">In myI spent my time traveling around one toone moment I went down to Munich and the next moment to Frankfurt and the next moment up to Bergen-Belsen and the next time up to Berlin in order to keep in touch with our offices to see what they're doing and if there's any way in which I can be helpful toto be helpful and try to keep things going as well asasas well as I could.</span> <span id="s208">Butbu the JDCat this princeprinciple, the principle of the JDC was "to trust the man in the field."</span> <span id="s209">We ran a desimplized operation under those circumstances.</span> <span id="s210">If the men in the filed did a good job he got the ____________ for it.</span> <span id="s211">If the job wasn't being done very well not necessarily by him but even by his staff member he's the man whowhowhowhowhowhowho took the lumps because as I said wewewe trusted the men in the field, but he had to bury his responsibility then andINTERVIEWER: So did youdid you feel you had a lot of leverage to do your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">MR. FEDER: Well, there's no question that we were given full latitude to carry on the programs.</span> <span id="s213">There might have been questions that were raised about policy which than we would relate if we could get through on the phone to have somebody ____________ in the wilderness, but we had to make the decisions ourselves and I think to sort of prove of that a number of people we sent home were, I don't we sent one guy home</span></p> <p><span id="s214">MR. KATZKI: In fact, I can think of oneone women we sent home.</span> <span id="s215">She was a social worker who had been soso attuned to the American ways of doing things that if she could not find an agency to which she might refer a difficult case she went to pieces, but we couldn't use people who went to pieces because there weren't many agencies to which they could refer people.</span> <span id="s216">They had to do the work themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">MR. FEDER: No.</span> <span id="s218">No.</span> <span id="s219">No</span></p> <p><span id="s220">MR. KATZKI: Soso she was sent home.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">MR. FEDER: The question</span></p> <p><span id="s222">MR. KATZKI: One.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">MR. FEDER:whenwhen you think of all the black marketing that was going on</span></p> <p><span id="s224">MR. KATZKI: Well</span></p> <p><span id="s225">MR. FEDER:how easy one could fall into it.</span> <span id="s226">Our people were</span></p> <p><span id="s227">MR. KATZKI: We didn't have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">MR. FEDER:werewere just great.</span> <span id="s229">They</span></p> <p><span id="s230">MR. KATZKI: We didn't have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">MR. FEDER:no one madeno one that I know of mademade money to be there to make money.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">INTERVIEWER: Did it take a special kind of person to do the kind of work both of you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">MR. KATZKI: I think so.</span> <span id="s234">IIII think the kind of person who wentwent into work overseas with us was the kind of a person who was not so much interested in himself and his own advancement and that sort of thing, but felt an inner urge to do something for somebody else and got his satisfactions out of doing something for somebody else rather than just concern himself aboutaboutaboutabout himself.</span> <span id="s235">And</span></p> <p><span id="s236">MR. FEDER: I think JDC was just "dog on lucky" because the interview, for example, you gave me.</span> <span id="s237">I recall one question you asked me.</span> <span id="s238">You said do I have anything against German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">MR. KATZKI: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">MR. FEDER: I got that ____________, no, but other than that you knew me.</span> <span id="s241">You knew my reputation, the work I was doing and I know that what we were looking for wasn't only capacity to minister programs, but also the tact necessary to deal with the army, with Unrah, with committees and in those days there weren't many people who were commonly organizers.</span> <span id="s242">As a mater of fact, school social work hadn't begun in this aspect of the importance of commonly organization and II think we were just fortunate.</span> <span id="s243">We didn't fall.</span> <span id="s244">The committees as much as they would give us a hard time knew how far to go and when to stop because theythey saw in us people with good will.</span> <span id="s245">We weren't after them or after saving money orof changing things.</span> <span id="s246">We were there to be part of them and that was an important issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">INTERVIEWER: What do you think your greatest challenges were inin ____________?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">MR. KATZKI: In Germany the greatest challenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">INTERVIEWER: Once you were in.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">MR. KATZKI: I think the greatest challenge was to reinstall in people who had been abused for so long, a general feeling of worthiness and self‑respect.</span> <span id="s251">I think that was the first job.</span> <span id="s252">You had to give them that before you could start in with giving them medical aid oror food or things of that kind, but you had to make them feel worthy of themselves.</span> <span id="s253">And I think that was the big challenge that the JDC had in the early days.</span> <span id="s254">Wouldn't you say so, Ted?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">MR. FEDER: Well, it was a challenge, but, you know, we had no formula.</span> <span id="s256">We had no formula.</span> <span id="s257">When you think of the ___ of people we had in difference from ____________ to ____________</span></p> <p><span id="s258">MR. KATZKI: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">MR. FEDER:Lactel (ph.) came out of the army as a supply officer, very crude, always cursing yet he was beloved by the people he was working with because they saw in him something very original and what they really wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">MR. KATZKI: And he wanted to help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">MR. FEDER: That'sthat's also true, butbut at the same time talking about that there was something else that was going on in the camps and that's a very queasy subject to get into, but it was there.</span> <span id="s262">Mainly when they recognized, in the camps, a caple (ph.) that they had known in the concentration camp what to do.</span> <span id="s263">Rumor had it that there had been people hurt in many camps.</span> <span id="s264">We never found out anything on that.</span> <span id="s265">The army wanted no part of it, but what did happen was that the central committee set up a code of honor in which those people who were accused of capless could face the person who was accusing them.</span> <span id="s266">Well, this was pretty rough andand they felt theythey had to do it.</span> <span id="s267">They felt that they would have ability to med out some kind of, in quotations, "punishment" and when I get to that you'll see how insane that was.</span> <span id="s268">Andand they would havethere were thousands of pages of testimony by those who had been hurt and by the caple and then they would give up a decision.</span> <span id="s269">What kind of a decision could they make?</span> <span id="s270">Any decision they made against the person involved us.</span> <span id="s271">Involved us.</span> <span id="s272">Like, the JDC will no longer give rations to this caple.</span> <span id="s273">The JDC will not help this man to immigrate.</span> <span id="s274">Boom.</span> <span id="s275">JDC will have this man evicted from the camp.</span> <span id="s276">And that committee, the JDC.</span> <span id="s277">None of them, none of them and we told the committee that we were going to accept their decisions.</span> <span id="s278">No one lost food.</span> <span id="s279">After all, if a man is going to immigrate and he tells the story of what it was that he did in a camp and the security officers except what it is they say why stop them fromfrom going?</span> <span id="s280">But it is a very sore subject.</span> <span id="s281">It was something that bothered us a great deal, but they had ____________.</span> <span id="s282">They had to get it out of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">INTERVIEWER: How come you kept your distance from the division?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">MR. FEDER: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">INTERVIEWER: How come you didn't accept those decisions, those judgements?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">MR. FEDER: Even though we saw that the people were the judges, the lawyers, we felt that there really not honestly constituted.</span> <span id="s287">If the military government were very concerned about this kind of activity in so on especially the rumors that some had been murdered, we felt we couldn't abide by it.</span> <span id="s288">The JDC couldn't accept aa kangaroo courts decision.</span> <span id="s289">And you know what?</span> <span id="s290">They never said a word.</span> <span id="s291">When it was ____________ it was ____________.</span> <span id="s292">They had had it and ____________.</span> <span id="s293">And there was no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">INTERVIEWER: Herb, when you talk about one of the first challenges was making people feel human again, making them feel a sense of worth, how did you accomplish that?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">MR. KATZKI: One way to do it was to showshow them the respect which we'dwewewhich ____________ do.</span> <span id="s296">By helping them to set up to self organization work.</span> <span id="s297">The ____________ was a ____________ as Ted indicated he ____________ legal responsibilities.</span> <span id="s298">A man who is a teacher did some teaching and somebody else is doctor.</span> <span id="s299">He did something else.</span> <span id="s300">And so you did what ever you could to boost his self esteem.</span> <span id="s301">It depended on theon the individual in the approach that you took, but you found some kind of a handle and youyou gavegave him aaaaboost up theif you ask me in an individual case how it was done, I'm not sure that I could answer that for you.</span> <span id="s302">I could only tell you what the general approach was and that'sthat'sthat's the way it was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">INTERVIEWER: Let me ask you, did you have any kind of training for your field workers so that they knew to be sensitive to the ____________ or to other things?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">MR. KATZKI: Well, we didwe tried to give them a certain amount of trainingtrainingyou traintraining you couldn't give them because we had no experience.</span> <span id="s305">I felt this was the first time in history that one was confronted with a situation that oneone found over there and we didn't know whatdidn't know what to expect.</span> <span id="s306">When people came in on the job they would come into our headquarters office inininNew York and maybe they would read files and read reports, so at least they would have a familiarity what the kinds of problems with which they would be confronted.</span> <span id="s307">So on.</span> <span id="s308">But the rest of it we just took our chances on the individual as to thethethe way his value to the JDC waswaswas characterized and we sent them out.</span> <span id="s309">Look, we would have people who would come out into the field who maybe came from Kenosha, Wisconsin or some other place like that who'd never been out of the United States.</span> <span id="s310">They would come overseas.</span> <span id="s311">They would come into headquarters to get an assignment and they would say to the head of the operation "Tell me what I'm supposed to do," and the instruction would be "Go on out there and you will see, and you will do it."</span> <span id="s312">That was all the explaining we got.</span> <span id="s313">That's all he had to work with and that what he had to do and that's the way he did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">MR. FEDER: But it's also true that those people that we gave the responsibility to were highly professional people.</span> <span id="s315">Social workersthey've been through the mail.</span> <span id="s316">They have their leadership ability.</span> <span id="s317">They move what it was to be expected and they also gave them good guidelines, good guidelines.</span> <span id="s318">We couldn't tell them that if the police come down and arrest one of them, that you go down to the police station and bail them out and use a good argument, but these were people who learned on the jobalthough coming with ____________ I had a two and a half month course at the University of Maryland and everything from cooking to social work, to warehousingI remember one of the questions that they gave in the test was, "If you are in ____________ and you get a cable that in four days there will be landing in ____________ thirty‑seven tons of such, such, such procure warehousing and setup procedures for distribution.</span> <span id="s319">That's all.</span> <span id="s320">So you had to come up with something and most people were very innovative and that's exactlylet's see, who was it that was in North Africanot</span></p> <p><span id="s321">MR. KATZKI: ____________?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">MR. FEDER: No, no.</span> <span id="s323">Way in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">MR. KATZKI: ____________?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">MR. FEDER: No.</span> <span id="s326">But anyways, he was with the joint and he had been with them and I remember his getting up and saying, "I'm very pleased to be here to talk about my experiences, but I want to tell you that anything you have learned here isn't really going to help you a great deal.</span> <span id="s327">If you think that the book that you have or the books that you will get will answer the questions for logistics or procedures in handling large groups or contact with the military, forget it.</span> <span id="s328">You are either going to have to have it coming out of the military or being innovative in order to rise to the occasion."</span> <span id="s329">And the famous saying "play it by ear."</span></p> <p><span id="s330">MR. KATZKI: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">MR. FEDER: That's certainly right pertaining to that point, but we didn't really send them out by themselves.</span> <span id="s332">When you think of all the people we employedremember the class toothey were refugees who were given a military status, where they could wear a uniform, they could have dollars, they could have ____________ and they were our employees or employees of other agencies.</span> <span id="s333">Never ____________, they've been around, they knew well what was necessary and our new people most did listen to them.</span> <span id="s334">That was an important piece.</span> <span id="s335">I don't want to say we had a trained staff, but we had a lot of bright guys around who were able to be helpful when our people came in with the money and the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">INTERVIEWER: Did the people who worked for you who were of the camps, teach you a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">MR. FEDER: Sure we learned a lot, always.</span> <span id="s338">Always, you asked a question and you'd get an answer.</span> <span id="s339">They knew, being in the camp, they knew everything about it.</span> <span id="s340">They knew where the black spots were.</span> <span id="s341">They knew whom you could trust.</span> <span id="s342">They knew the people.</span> <span id="s343">They lived with them.</span> <span id="s344">They were a part of them and their information and their knowledge of ____________ was invaluable to us.</span> <span id="s345">Without them we would have never been able to function.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">MR. KATZKI: For sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">INTERVIEWER: Were there sticky politics you had to wade through?</span> <span id="s348">With the army, with any other aid organizations?</span> <span id="s349">Difference between European and American sensibilities terms of approaching this problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">MR. KATZKI: I personally never had any problems like that in Germany in politics and so on.</span> <span id="s351">We were not a political organization.</span> <span id="s352">We prided ourselves in being not political and whatever.</span> <span id="s353">So we didn't know from politics.</span> <span id="s354">So interagency politics really didn't enter into our work.</span> <span id="s355">Certainly not in my experience.</span> <span id="s356">Did you have anything like that ____________?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">MR. FEDER: Oh, we had a few little tussles in ____________, but that didn't have much effect.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">MR. KATZKI: That didn't count.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">MR. FEDER: No, that didn't count.</span> <span id="s360">If you view the groups that we had to associate with in order to get our jobs done, number one ____________.</span> <span id="s361">At first rate people in the ____________ department ____________, would you want a greater person than him?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">MR. KATZKI: He's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">MR. FEDER: This Norwegian was six foot eight and he had also been in a concentration camp, ____________.</span> <span id="s364">So his knowledge was so vast as to how people reacted to whatever may have come up, and whenever we had a problem in the military or with their own headquarters, he would help us fight our battles.</span> <span id="s365">But it's not a question of politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">INTERVIEWER: One thing I'm thinking of is that clearly the British had different feelings about this immigration to ____________ than you did.</span> <span id="s367">Did that pose any problems for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">MR. KATZKI: The British had some curious ideas.</span> <span id="s369">The British knew the only thing about nationalities, they didn't know anything about religious differences.</span> <span id="s370">For example, a displaced person who came from Poland and was Jewish, so far as the British was concerned, he was Polish and that he had to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s371">Never mind that the Jewish person wouldn't go back to Poland at all.</span> <span id="s372">So that was a big job which we had with the British when they wanted to ____________ to the countries of their origin.</span> <span id="s373">Regardless of what their own attitudes were to the places from once they came and it took a great deal of doing to get them to change their attitude and their point of view to take it in to account that there were differences between people who were Jewish, who were the subjects of all of this oppressive measures and everybody else.</span> <span id="s374">So that was one difficulty that we had which was ultimately over come.</span> <span id="s375">That was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">MR. FEDER: Well, ____________ was a hell of a stem and we used that at every turn.</span> <span id="s377">And they couldn't stand up to it.</span> <span id="s378">Although, they used methods that might almost come up to ____________.</span> <span id="s379">Not among the Jews, but among the Polish for example.</span> <span id="s380">Here it was in 1945 and the Poles still didn't know what was the divisions, Russia, Poland and Germany because depending on where they would land they would go and it wasn't until the beginning of 1946 that they finally got a bloody map and there weren't enough maps for everybody, see, but by and large those who saw themselves in the German zone were ready to go.</span> <span id="s381">But then there was something seemingly to hold them back and Unrah decided with the army that every person, man, women and child who was returning to Poland would get x‑kilos of flour and sugar and powdered meatpowdered milk.</span> <span id="s382">And you know what?</span> <span id="s383">Many went simply because of thatthat package.</span> <span id="s384">Now, I remember the day that theythey left because it was heart breaking.</span> <span id="s385">Going back on a package.</span> <span id="s386">The Russians came in for camp and took their own Russians.</span> <span id="s387">Nobody said "no" to them.</span> <span id="s388">And that was one of the reasons I decided I was going to get out of Unrah.</span> <span id="s389">That forcible repatriation.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">MR. KATZKI: So that was oneoneone of the problems we had.</span> <span id="s391">The other problem you touched upon briefly was the British attitude about admittance of people tototo Palestine with the white paper with their limitation of ____________ for five years, whatever, and nobody else could get in there and that was a problem that had to be dealt with, but I think that Ted touched upon that this morning whenwhen he spoke about the immigration which took place from Europe tototo Palestine the way that problem waswaswas dealt with.</span> <span id="s392">The Britishthe British I would say were veryvery, very militaristic, veryas though they had blinders on ininin dealing with the problems that of the refugees.</span> <span id="s393">They only knew one thing.</span> <span id="s394">Refugees were a burden to them and let's get rid of them and so theythey moved them out the best way they could, the quickest way they could and so on and theytheythey tried to oppose any opposition to that attitude.</span> <span id="s395">Obviously, opposed that attitude and we did what we could to just change</span></p> <p><span id="s396">MR. FEDER: But it's also true that of the large number of refugees at the end of the war, maybe 10,000, the vast majority, the vast majority were repatriated.</span> <span id="s397">That included the French and the Belgians and the Dutch, innocent Spaniards, but repatriation did mean the majority out.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">MR. KATZKI: They were going to western Europe ____________ country.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">MR. KATZKI: Okay.</span> <span id="s400">But even though some of theseyou know, I suddenly remembered, a meeting where the Ukraine got up out of a ____________ agency meeting and was said "We will remain here until the Soviet Union falls."</span> <span id="s401">You know, we laughed.</span> <span id="s402">We said the man's mad, but I doubt if he went back after the communism is filled out.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">INTERVIEWER: Any other realobstacles to what you were trying to accomplish that you can think of?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">MR. FEDER: Well, we were lucky that we never had to worry about finances.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">MR. KATZKI: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">MR. FEDER: There was</span></p> <p><span id="s407">MR. KATZKI: That was no obstacle.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">MR. FEDER: There was no obstacle.</span> <span id="s409">Whatever it would cost, cost what may and so if things weren't working it was our fault.</span> <span id="s410">Not the fact that we didn'tdidn't have fun or somewhere thethe line going out was bottled up, but wewewe mentioned political.</span> <span id="s411">We never, we never had to face it.</span> <span id="s412">I never saw it.</span> <span id="s413">I argued with the military, Unrah, but not on an ____________, political basis.</span> <span id="s414">It just wasn't there.</span> <span id="s415">Everybody went along with our basic modism, basic program: Get the people out.</span> <span id="s416">Let them go.</span> <span id="s417">Whatever.</span> <span id="s418">Whatever it cost.</span> <span id="s419">And so from that point of view we were really fortunate and also we weren't being given flack by a lot of Jewish organizations in the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">MR. KATZKI: You're sheltered from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">MR. FEDER: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">MR. KATZKI: You're sheltered from that.</span> <span id="s423">You're</span></p> <p><span id="s424">MR. FEDER: Yeah, more letters</span></p> <p><span id="s425">MR. KATZKI:overseas</span></p> <p><span id="s426">MR. FEDER:we wrote plenty of letters, but we weren't touched.</span> <span id="s427">Notnot even with all the political parties and their ____________.</span> <span id="s428">The ____________ and the ____________.</span> <span id="s429">You know,</span></p> <p><span id="s430">MR. KATZKI: They complained, but it didn't help.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">MR. FEDER: Complain.</span> <span id="s432">They had to complain.</span> <span id="s433">Who else could they complain to but us?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">MR. KATZKI: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">INTERVIEWER: If you had to think about one area that like a week of a ____________.</span> <span id="s436">Something that youyou just couldn't achieve.</span> <span id="s437">Is there anything?</span> <span id="s438">I know you talked about ____________ you were, but having regrets ____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">MR. KATZKI: I think the only thing that we regret that we couldn't do was that we had problems getting countries to agree to issue visas to let people in.</span> <span id="s440">I thinkI think that was thethe biggest regret that we had.</span> <span id="s441">Peoplepeople just wouldn'twouldn'twouldn't accept the immigrants.</span> <span id="s442">Thatthatthat's the one thing that I cant think of.</span> <span id="s443">Can you think of anything, Ted?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">MR. FEDER: No.</span> <span id="s445">Although, eventually that was overcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">MR. KATZKI: Yeah, II know, but</span></p> <p><span id="s447">MR. FEDER: Initially, it was a problem and then when our people in the States went to work in the Jewish community in Brazil, talked to the government ____________, it was worked out.</span> <span id="s448">Thethe total picture of the needs ofof those who had been left behind in Germany was very ____________.</span> <span id="s449">People reacted to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">MR. KATZKI: You had toyouyou have in general thethethe reaction of governments with the aveant (ph.) conference.</span> <span id="s451">With the conference in Bermuda was suppose to be organized to find needs for helping people and instead of that they went in with the preconceived idea that they can't do anything and that's what came out from aveant came out from Bermuda.</span> <span id="s452">Can't do anything to let people in.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">INTERVIEWER: There must have been a really good ____________, if I can use that word, to your whole organization because it seemed that functioned very successfully.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">MR. FEDER: I</span></p> <p><span id="s455">MR. KATZKI: We</span></p> <p><span id="s456">MR. FEDER:don't think we've ever met someone who worked in Germany or in Europe for that matter who doesn't look back at that period in his life withwith certain feelings.</span> <span id="s457">Thewe werethe linesman (ph.) shop, the commatery (ph.) of people who've been even How Trobe (ph.) the other day, you know, hehe got excited.</span> <span id="s458">They were exciting days.</span> <span id="s459">They were productive days.</span> <span id="s460">It could've been just the opposite, but they were productive because when you look at the bottom line someone would've said "Why'd it take so long?"</span> <span id="s461">Butand there people who thought it could never be solved.</span> <span id="s462">When we had visitors meeting with some of the committees there they came and said "How are we going to solve this?"</span> <span id="s463">So patience, understanding and ability to communicate.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">MR. KATZKI: Now, when youwhen you look at it from the point of view of the ____________.</span> <span id="s465">I've ____________ a great many of theof theof the staff members and it makes a small difference whether the man's assignment was whether he was overseas for one year or for longer periods of time invariably and without exception that tell you that the most interesting and productive experience of their life was the time when they were overseas with the JDC doing what they did.</span> <span id="s466">It makes no difference what they did after they came back home.</span> <span id="s467">Whatwhat level they achieved in their life.</span> <span id="s468">The JDC experienced doing this work with a most satisfying and productive career their____________ careers that lifes ____________.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">INTERVIEWER: Let's stop on that note.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">MR.
