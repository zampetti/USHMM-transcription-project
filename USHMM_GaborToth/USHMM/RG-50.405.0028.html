childhood like in Tashkent?</span> <span id="s17">What do you remember of your household?)</span> <span id="s18">I remember everything.</span> <span id="s19">Maybe I took this from my grandfather.</span> <span id="s20">When I was little he was a very old man.</span> <span id="s21">After the second World War, he was maybe seventy years old.</span> <span id="s22">He raised me, because he lived with his youngest daughter, my mother.</span> <span id="s23">He died when I was five years old and I remember this night like I see you today.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">He was an old Jewish man.</span> <span id="s25">He knew the Russian language very badly and to me he spoke only Russian because after second War, in Russia, most Jewish parents decided to raise their children only as Russians.</span> <span id="s26">In 1946 or 1947, Stalin and his government made politics about the Jewish people, and all the cultural leaders of the Jewish people were killed.</span> <span id="s27">And the Jewish theater was destroyed.</span> <span id="s28">(Not only in Tashkent, but all over Russia.)</span> <span id="s29">In 1953, in the far eastern part of Russia, they were going to take all the Jews in Russia and send them there.</span> <span id="s30">It was a huge camp but I don't know how large.</span> <span id="s31">My father was an army officer and he served in the Far East and he knew the place.</span> <span id="s32">He was a doctor in the Army at the time.</span> <span id="s33">My father was a doctor and he was placed under house arrest at this time.</span> <span id="s34">I don't know how long he was under house arrest because then Stalin died and this gave freedom to the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Until 1970 my father was an officer in the Soviet Army.</span> <span id="s36">He was the chief of a large hospital in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s37">All the while he was an officer, he did not discuss this with me.</span> <span id="s38">I guess I was about twenty-five before he told me of this.</span> <span id="s39">It was after 1970.</span> <span id="s40">My brother, David, left the U.S.S.R. in 1974.</span> <span id="s41">I think my father told me about this in 1974 because he wanted to leave Russia and he wanted us to go with him.</span> <span id="s42">That's when he explained to me about the old politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">I guess I didn't believe him too much because he became a Communist during the Second World War, in 1943.</span> <span id="s44">He changed his opinions about this after the war.</span> <span id="s45">Maybe I believed him, but I thought maybe this was just one event in seventy years in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s46">And I didn't want to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">I think that when he was a high level officer, he believed everything because he had good money from the army, and he had a personal car from the army, and a personal driver and everything.</span> <span id="s48">Before, maybe twenty years, he went to this level from Second War and he was raised up in his occupation.</span> <span id="s49">In 1970, he had everything - a big apartment (for Russia), a good city for living.</span> <span id="s50">Before 1965, all his life he lived in Far East, Khamchatka, and this was a bad place for living.</span> <span id="s51">And Saholin, was not too good, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">He spent more than twenty years in that area.</span> <span id="s53">He made a good promotion and when he had it he believed everything he wanted.</span> <span id="s54">But, I listened earlier, before 1970, when he was talking between with another officer and several times I had a vacation with my father in a big rest camp for officers.</span> <span id="s55">It was a very good place, near the sea, in the Crimea, and several times I was there with him.</span> <span id="s56">I listened to the talk between the officers and the Jewish nationalists, all officers.</span> <span id="s57">Maybe his friends were doctors, I think so, because many doctors were in the army after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">They talked about the fact that for Jewish officers it was not possible to go abroad.</span> <span id="s59">Now, one year ago this place was not good for living, but twenty years ago all the Russian people felt that the big bosses lived well in Poland and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s60">It was an opportunity for the Russians to see other places, buy new things.</span> <span id="s61">This travel was closed for the Jews before, and the high ranking positions were impossible.</span> <span id="s62">But my father became a big officer, between a Major and a Colonel.</span> <span id="s63">He was chief in a big hospital and for doctors this was a good position.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">For many years he waited for this promotion and they took it away after two weeks.</span> <span id="s65">In the Russian army many officers, if they live many years in Kamchatka, Saholin, they can change their assignment to Europe.</span> <span id="s66">From Europe, many officers change to Kamchatka.</span> <span id="s67">But there was a General who needed this place for another person so my father had to retire from the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">His pension was great for the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s69">He got two hundred rubles a month for pension which was much bigger than what everybody gets.</span> <span id="s70">Only officers could get such a pension.</span> <span id="s71">It was 1979, now the same level of pension is now three hundred rubles.</span> <span id="s72">This is still a very good pension.</span> <span id="s73">Not comparable to the United States but a very good pension for Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s74">It is a high pension for the Soviet Union for a civilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">(So in 1970 they told him, you've got to retire now and you leave this place?)</span> <span id="s76">I remember the date because I was a Soviet soldier.</span> <span id="s77">I went in after my vacation.</span> <span id="s78">I became a soldier and my father became a civilian.</span> <span id="s79">My father now works about twelve hours a week, as a doctor, because he cannot earn more than that.</span> <span id="s80">The most he can earn with salary and pension is three hundred rubles.</span> <span id="s81">He lived and worked in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s82">In 1979 he left Vilnius for Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">My brother, David, went to Israel in 1974 or 1975 to live with the family of his wife.</span> <span id="s84">He was at our wedding party and then he left Russia.</span> <span id="s85">So my father went to be with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">(To go back to your childhood, you said something about your roots, your grandfather and your father.)</span> <span id="s87">My grandfather's name was Abraham and his last name was Gorchov but before the Revolution he changed it to Gorohov, Russian pronunciation, because he needed to work in this big city but it was not possible for Jewish people to work there.</span> <span id="s88">There was a line within which they had to live.</span> <span id="s89">For his job he needed to go to Kiev and another big city and he changed his name from Gorchov to Gorohov.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">There was no Yiddish spoken to me at home.</span> <span id="s91">Maybe as a little boy I understood some of it.</span> <span id="s92">Because my cousin who lived with us, because it was a big home and the whole family lived together.</span> <span id="s93">My grandfather had many children but when I was born only four daughters and one son were left.</span> <span id="s94">The son lived separately but the four daughters all lived with my grandfather.</span> <span id="s95">There were about eight or ten big rooms but it was a big house with no conveniences.</span> <span id="s96">No running water, not in the yard, only on the street.</span> <span id="s97">If we needed water we had to go about one mile to a big river and we took water from the faucet.</span> <span id="s98">It was like a spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">We used to carry two pails at a time on our shoulders, We had a big family but this water was only for drinking without boiling.</span> <span id="s100">For other water, we had a channel in our street, not for drinking without boiling.</span> <span id="s101">It was like rainwater and it had to be boiled.</span> <span id="s102">Before 1960 we had no problem with pollution.</span> <span id="s103">In Uzbekistan, all people used this water.</span> <span id="s104">But, there were a lot of infectious diseases like dysentery and typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Now there is a lot of sickness too.</span> <span id="s106">When I was small we sometimes had this big illness, dysentery and typhus, sometimes yellow fever.</span> <span id="s107">There were none of these in my family.</span> <span id="s108">You cannot imagine what Uzbekistan was like.</span> <span id="s109">It was much different than where my wife grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">My grandparents were very religious and kept a Kosher home especially for my grandfather.</span> <span id="s111">He had all special dishes, utensils, and even another special set for Passover.</span> <span id="s112">He was like a salesman and his brothers - he had four brothers - all his family dealt with wood.</span> <span id="s113">He was a big specialist about wood.</span> <span id="s114">He could tell about a tree how many board feet, what size, could come from it.</span> <span id="s115">He had several people and they cut the wood and the wood was floated down on the river to a different town where they cut the wood.</span> <span id="s116">Maybe one big owner had this business and this helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Before the Revolution he was not poor, but not really wealthy.</span> <span id="s118">He had twelve children and only he worked.</span> <span id="s119">After the Revolution he was very poor.</span> <span id="s120">His business was cut, the state took over all the business.</span> <span id="s121">They lived in a small village and my grandmother opened a little store.</span> <span id="s122">Many Jews did the same.</span> <span id="s123">I know my grandmother and my aunt, her daughter, were selling in this store.</span> <span id="s124">My aunt is now eighty three years old.</span> <span id="s125">So this store gave my grandparents support in their older years.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">My grandfather, I don't know how he decided, but he became colhosmi, a farmer, he dyed fabrics.</span> <span id="s127">For several years after the Revolution he was on this public farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">But, when my mother finished fourth grade, she could not continue her education, she and her sister, because my grandfather was the owner of a business.</span> <span id="s129">In Russia, he was 'without rights' because he kept the business.</span> <span id="s130">I know my mother, when she was ten or so, moved to another village to study and she never told about this before we left the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">(Who did she live with?)</span> <span id="s132">She lived with relatives but her mother or father would sometimes come about once a week and bring her food or other things she might need.</span> <span id="s133">But she was much on her own.</span> <span id="s134">Her oldest sisters were without education.</span> <span id="s135">She finished three or five grades of gymnasium and after the Revolution, she made a smart decision.</span> <span id="s136">After 1929, maybe, my grandfather became part of a collective farm.</span> <span id="s137">I know about it because in 1933 there was hunger in Russia.</span> <span id="s138">My mother told me about it.</span> <span id="s139">He asked for a piece of bread and he could take from the public storage because he worked on a state collective farm.</span> <span id="s140">A lot of people, not only in Russia but in Ukraine, died because of the lack of bread.</span> <span id="s141">No one on the collective farm died.</span> <span id="s142">There was enough bread to keep the people alive but none extra.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">In 1933, my mother moved at age fifteen to Ivanovo- Vosnesensk, a city near Moscow.</span> <span id="s144">Because one of her sisters lived there as a student and my mother worked some time in the farm and took a certificate paper to Ivanovo to be permitted to study there.</span> <span id="s145">My mother was the youngest in the family.</span> <span id="s146">She studied five years in a technical college and after that time, she went to Tashkent to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">She was in the field of textiles and she was a technician for winding, for spools of thread and fabric.</span> <span id="s148">But, before the Second War, she moved back to Byelorussia because her parents became old.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">After education, all the time, when I finished my education too, all people were sent to a place to work.</span> <span id="s150">When my mother finished her education, she was sent to another place to work as an engineer with the city for three years.</span> <span id="s151">Everybody has to work for two or three years after finishing their education, wherever they are sent.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">About my mother, she moved back to Byelorussia because her parents lived alone, and they were very old.</span> <span id="s153">So, she lived together with her parents until the Second World War.</span> <span id="s154">When the war started they ran from this village, it was not good for them and they had relatives in Tashkent so they moved there and stayed there.</span> <span id="s155">So my grandparents stayed in Tashkent and all the children in the family lived in Central Asia and they all sent them some money.</span> <span id="s156">My grandfather bought a little home for all the children and himself, built it and made it bigger.</span> <span id="s157">This is the house from my youth.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">My parents met after the Second World War and my father, from the war, came to Tashkent for vacation because he had friends from this village, Bershad, who lived close to my grandfather.</span> <span id="s159">I don't know how they met but they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">(During the War, what happened to your mother and father, from what you know?)</span> <span id="s161">My mother was twenty-nine, born in 1917, when the war finished.</span> <span id="s162">I was born when she was thirty.</span> <span id="s163">In 1940, the Germans invaded Russia.</span> <span id="s164">My mother came back to Tashkent where, before she moved back to Byelorussia, she worked and studied.</span> <span id="s165">After they came back my grandfather decided he couldn't support my mother like before and she finished her education in 1943.</span> <span id="s166">She was sent to Aemolinsk, this is Khazakastan's port, and now is Tselinograd.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">The collective farm was a place to work but not a place to live.</span> <span id="s168">The commune was different.</span> <span id="s169">In the Russian Ukraine, people moved to Asia.</span> <span id="s170">Maybe Stalin artificially made things that way to begin.</span> <span id="s171">Maybe he made movement for people with the purpose of having them take the new place for Russia.</span> <span id="s172">He moved Jews and other people all around to make it all be mixed up and not just Russian.</span> <span id="s173">Because Russian people now live in Uzbekistan, in Lithuania, Kazaskhan, Moldavia, in different republics.</span> <span id="s174">Mainly the Russian people live in different places, not just Russia.</span> <span id="s175">And Gorbachev can say, "I cannot divide the U.S.S.R., because the Russian people live in every republic."</span> <span id="s176">This is the result of Stalin's policy.</span> <span id="s177">This is my thinking only.</span> <span id="s178">People were moved around by his plans.</span> <span id="s179">He made a plan and implemented this situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">My grandmother died after the Second World War, she died before I was born in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">My mother worked as a railroad engineer from 1943.</span> <span id="s182">She was a captain, because the railroad people were considered like an army.</span> <span id="s183">She had a uniform with epaulets.</span> <span id="s184">This was during Stalin's life.</span> <span id="s185">She moved to Tashkent in 1946, after the war.</span> <span id="s186">Her father wrote then to the officials to say that he was old and alone and she was permitted to go home to take care of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">My father finished his education, too, in 1943, in Tashkent.</span> <span id="s188">He finished medical school.</span> <span id="s189">For one year he practiced as a doctor in Central Asia, a family practice.</span> <span id="s190">He was an urologist really.</span> <span id="s191">He worked in a little village, he told me about this.</span> <span id="s192">It was in the Syr-Darja area.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">This is what he did in the army too, urology.</span> <span id="s194">Then after about ten years, in 1960, he was made the assistant to the chief doctor.</span> <span id="s195">Then he did not have time for patients.</span> <span id="s196">After 1970 he studied one year in a special program and then he became a dermatologist.</span> <span id="s197">When he left the army he worked as both a dermatologist and urologist.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">(So your parents met in Tashkent in 1946?)</span> <span id="s199">They married and then they went to the Far East where my father had to live as an officer.</span> <span id="s200">First, in 1946, he was in Pogronichna, on the border.</span> <span id="s201">There were several camps of Japanese soldiers and officers.</span> <span id="s202">He was a doctor in the camp.</span> <span id="s203">It was a bad place and in 1947 there was not just one but several camps for Japanese prisoners.</span> <span id="s204">These were internment camps.</span> <span id="s205">We don't know what the final disposition of these camps were.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">I know about this because my father sent us a picture that was drawn by a Japanese from a photograph of me.</span> <span id="s207">It was a pencil drawing, a very fine drawing.</span> <span id="s208">I have remembered this all my life, I don't know where it is now.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">My parents went to the Far East but the officials did not allow my mother to go.</span> <span id="s210">She was missing some documents she would have needed.</span> <span id="s211">She was an officer in the railway corps and she could not get the release from the railroad to go join him.</span> <span id="s212">So for several years my parents were married but they lived separately.</span> <span id="s213">They only spent time together during their several vacations.</span> <span id="s214">My mother lived with her father and my father lived alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">They lived together for a short time but they separated in 1950.</span> <span id="s216">They were divorced.</span> <span id="s217">Because the place where my father lived was near to border, she could not go there.</span> <span id="s218">They were married for about four years.</span> <span id="s219">When I was born, my mother did not want to live in the Far East.</span> <span id="s220">When I was small, and asked about what happened, she worried about me.</span> <span id="s221">My father would explain things one way, my mother another way, so I had to decide for myself.</span> <span id="s222">But they never got back together.</span> <span id="s223">My mother remained a single person and my father re-married after my half-brother was born.</span> <span id="s224">My mother is still angry at my father.</span> <span id="s225">She is upset if I suggest going to see my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">My father sent some money to my mother, maybe just the judging.</span> <span id="s227">In Russia, if someone divorces, they must send 25% of their salary to help care for any children.</span> <span id="s228">If they do not do it they could be convicted.</span> <span id="s229">They will be forced to pay.</span> <span id="s230">But my father sent gifts for me and when I could write, he sent me letters, and when I was seventeen, every year he would take me for vacation.</span> <span id="s231">Several times he came to Tashkent to see me.</span> <span id="s232">When I was seventeen, I met with my half-brothers.</span> <span id="s233">One was just born, the other was twelve years old.</span> <span id="s234">I also met my future wife that year.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Then too, my mom was used to living with her large family and maybe her sisters persuaded her not to leave.</span> <span id="s236">She had two sisters who were married, and one older sister who was never married.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">(Do you think the political attitude of your country influenced your parents divorce?)</span> <span id="s238">After the War, you can understand only if you could see the horror in Russia after the War.</span> <span id="s239">Many women without husbands.</span> <span id="s240">Many young women who could find no husbands.</span> <span id="s241">A few men were around because of the War.</span> <span id="s242">It seems to me that at that time, each woman seemed to feel she would be happy if she found a husband.</span> <span id="s243">I think my parents knew each other only about seven days when they got married.</span> <span id="s244">After this first happened in their life, then my mother could not go to the Far East.</span> <span id="s245">It was not political, just circumstances all around them.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">After my grandfather died, we lost everything about Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s247">No holidays.</span> <span id="s248">I had a baby-sitter, she was born as a Russian, but her father changed his religion to Jewish.</span> <span id="s249">This woman was a good friend of my grandfather and when he died, she helped my mother to raise me.</span> <span id="s250">She was a lot older than my mother.</span> <span id="s251">When I went to school, she took me from school and kept me until my mother finished work and then took me home.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">She had in her home, all the Jewish traditions.</span> <span id="s253">And if my mother brought food from store she would ask if it was Kosher or not.</span> <span id="s254">She used only chicken from special man, the schochet.</span> <span id="s255">If we had fish she looked closely, is this good fish or not?</span> <span id="s256">does it have skin or not?</span> <span id="s257">She taught me everything.</span> <span id="s258">I lived here only several years.</span> <span id="s259">After that we had only one schochet in Tashkent.</span> <span id="s260">One time a week, my mother would go to the schochet.</span> <span id="s261">For just ourselves she could not do it, it was too difficult.</span> <span id="s262">I don't know any more about this.</span> <span id="s263">It was just very difficult.</span> <span id="s264">If people lived in villages it might be easier because my grandmother, from my father's side, lived in a little village.</span> <span id="s265">They had a schochet and it was easier for everyone to use him.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">But in big cities the Jewish practices were harder to keep.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">In Tashkent, there were about two million people, many of them Russian, maybe 40% were Uzbeki, and maybe 2% or 3% were Jews.</span> <span id="s268">Now it may be less.</span> <span id="s269">But right after the Second War there were a lot of Jews there.</span> <span id="s270">There were Sephardic Jews who came from Bukara and Andijian and many of them moved to Tashkent.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">I was happy in my childhood.</span> <span id="s272">I had a good nature, cheerful, for many years I had the same mood, but only now I have changed!</span> <span id="s273">In Tashkent, it was easier to be a Jew than in other places but in my childhood, several times, I had big fighting.</span> <span id="s274">Because these other boys called me, several times, this bad name for Jews -"Zhid".</span> <span id="s275">The last time this happened I was fifteen years old.</span> <span id="s276">I think I was beaten in these fights.</span> <span id="s277">It wasn't a bad fight but people in the Soviet Union, maybe this attitude started after I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">There was a company, an organization, that made a study from 1947-53, this company was against Jews.</span> <span id="s279">Nazis told people what a Jew was and that they were bad.</span> <span id="s280">They told people that Hitler wanted to kill the Jews and the Jews are responsible for everything that went bad in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s281">That is how I remember it myself, that the Jews were guilty of everything.</span> <span id="s282">The Jews were different.</span> <span id="s283">When I was twenty years and I would meet with a young girl I would not say about my nationality, that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s284">With other Asian peoples I did not mention it.</span> <span id="s285">If she asked, I might answer but maybe not.</span> <span id="s286">Because we studied in the same school, and from studying with these people, I don't know how, but I knew that Jews were bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Like my mother said, it started after the beginning of the Second War, from the Nazis, and it continued in 1947, what Hitler didn't finish.</span> <span id="s288">Many papers wrote about the Jews being like cosmopolitans and this started in 1947 when the cosmopolitans were blamed for everything.</span> <span id="s289">"We don't have bread because the cosmopolitans sell it."</span> <span id="s290">And all cosmopolitans harm Russian culture because many Jews became Russian writers.</span> <span id="s291">They are changing the culture.</span> <span id="s292">This is maybe a little true, because all the good writers, the children's writers, are Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Samuel Marshak was a great children's writers of poems, songs and tales.</span> <span id="s294">He was my wife's favorite writer when she was a child, and the favorite of a lot of other children too.</span> <span id="s295">And a favorite of our children too.</span> <span id="s296">My wife knows most of the book by heart!</span></p> <p><span id="s297">He was just one, but a lot of other composers, actors, artists, playwrights, and so on, were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">In 1947 there existed an Anti-Fascist Committee which helped the Jews in Europe.</span> <span id="s299">Mayerhold, a Russian Jew, a Soviet actor and producer of the theater in Moscow, was on this committee.</span> <span id="s300">He was known all over.</span> <span id="s301">America helped this committee with food for Jews in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s302">This Committee worked together with the Joint Distribution Committee and the Joint helped them.</span> <span id="s303">Mayerhold was killed and this was a signal for the killing of all Jews.</span> <span id="s304">Then a lot of Jews were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">The Doctors Plot was like the finish of this time.</span> <span id="s306">Between 1947 and 1953 all the newspapers were full of these stories.</span></p></body></html>
