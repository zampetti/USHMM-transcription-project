apologize for mispronouncing your name.</span> <span id="s17">Thank you for being interviewed – agreeing to be interviewed.</span> <span id="s18">Can you tell me where you were born, and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was born November 5th, 1942 in Berlin, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And what did your parents do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: My father was a buyer.</span> <span id="s22">Not sure what that means, I’ve heard different versions.</span> <span id="s23">I’ve heard that, you know, it could be a bookkeeper, it could be, you know, a buyer [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s24">My mother was a seamstress, as her mother was, my grandmother.</span> <span id="s25">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: No, you were an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: I’m an only child, yes.</span> <span id="s30">My mo – I’m told I’m a lot like my mother, and – which means I’m stubborn.</span> <span id="s31">But she decided she was going to have a baby at a particular age, and no matter what the world situation was, she was gonna have that baby.</span> <span id="s32">And she thought, well, if something happens, they get taken away, her mother, my grandmother, would take care of me.</span> <span id="s33">And then they’ll come back and take over.</span> <span id="s34">It never occurred to her that they may not come back.</span> <span id="s35">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: So, did your – did your family all live together, did your parents and your grandparents live together in a – did they live in the same neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: No, my parents did forced labor, so my grandparents took care of me.</span> <span id="s38">My grandfather was Catholic, so my grandmother was protected while he was alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Anyway, so every evening my parents would come to visit me, and one day my former landlady came running up and said, Frau Cheever(ph), they’re taking them.</span> <span id="s41">And she stood on the balcony and watched my parents being taken away by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s42">And I was three months old, they were taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s43">I have – I finally found a permanent – let’s say a definite death date for my father, and that was March 28th, 1943.</span> <span id="s44">And for my paren – my mother, it just says the end of March.</span> <span id="s45">And just within this last month I got a lot of documents about myself and my grandmother, and my parents.</span> <span id="s46">And is – it da – so I say, now I have absolute proof that I’m a survivor –</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: – because I – it shows, you know, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: So you had a birth certificate, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: – or some sort of documentation, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Well, that’s not what I just got.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Right, but you had – you had had it –</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: But this is [indecipherable] the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: So Auschwitz, Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s58">But you had a birth certificate when you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: That – that –</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: I – I got a copy years ago I needed [indecipherable] to prove my age, so yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s63">And so your – your grandparents were taking care of you at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: When a – you wound up in Theresienstadt, how – how did you get from Berlin to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well, evidently my grandmother knew she was going to go to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s67">She had a family friend that worked for the underground.</span> <span id="s68">And the lady said, well, I think – well, they called me Gitta, which was my German name.</span> <span id="s69">The Hitler regime didn’t allow me to keep a German name, so it was changed to Gittel.</span> <span id="s70">So she says, oh, I think it is best chance for survival was to go into camp with her, so I went to Theresienstadt with her.</span> <span id="s71">And I was in the nursery, and I was, you know, a toddler at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: And my grandmother would scrub the sidewalks and the steps with cold water, and every winter her hands would turn blue, because of that experience, the rest of her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: It – that affected her that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Do you have any memor – any recollection of Theresienstadt at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: No.</span> <span id="s78">My husband thinks I’m blocking it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: So what do you thi – what do you think your first memory is, that the –</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: After – in Berlin –</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: In Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: – going to services every Friday night, and no matter who my grandmother met, she would tell my story, or our story.</span> <span id="s83">And I guess she didn’t realize little pictures have big ears, and that I knew everything.</span> <span id="s84">And by the time we came to the U.S. when I was 13, she finally told me about my story, which I had known all along, but didn't say.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: And she used to say, if I’d asked about my mother, you know, where’s my mother, oh she’s in America.</span> <span id="s87">And I have – I’m in two books now.</span> <span id="s88">In the first book, that’s entitled, “My Dear Mother is in America,” and – my grandmother did an interview before we left Berlin, and that was the title of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: And she just didn’t want me to know.</span> <span id="s91">And I – I’m thinking logically, when I came here I would say where she was, and I must have blocked it out because I don’t know the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: You know, how did she, at that point, cover up that my mother was not here.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: And what happened to your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: He had tuberculosis and cancer and died.</span> <span id="s96">And that’s when –</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Mm-hm, in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: – yeah, and that’s when she lost her protection and we went –</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: – to Theresienstadt at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Now, was – was your grandmother practicing her faith while – or – or – before the war, was she practicing her faith, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: I think so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Just from what my uncle said, because his attitude was, religion’s not important, least of all judi –</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: – least of all, Judaism.</span> <span id="s107">And we would go to services every Friday night, and high holy day service and everything.</span> <span id="s108">And then she’d say to me, well, there can’t be a God if He let your mother die.</span> <span id="s109">So I grew up with mixed messages, in my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Being taken to services.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I don’t how much to elaborate, so I’m going to let you just lead the story.</span> <span id="s114">I – I could say more –</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: No, I mean, feel free to con – I mean, it’s – it’s – it’s a question that we ask a lot of our survivors because there is such – almost a struggle between their reality of what they experienced, and their faith.</span> <span id="s116">And so it’s why we ask the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: No, we – I mean, we went to services very – you know, every week.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: And so, when you – when you came out of Theresienstadt, you were three?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Almost three.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Almost three.</span> <span id="s121">And you – you went back to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: We went back to the Berlin, to the same apartment we lived in before, and waited for my parents to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: And she – you know, she just expected they’d be back.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: And just before we left Germany, she got copies of their death certificates.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: When did you leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: In ’51.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: ’51?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I landed the day after my ninth birthday in New York.</span> <span id="s131">So it’s a very easy day to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s133">What – while you were still in Germany, I assume you started going to school again – or started school.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yes, I did – I did start school.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: And you were speaking –</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I went there for like two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: I learned some English, so I knew, table, door and chair.</span> <span id="s139">Lot of English to get started in a new country.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Well, it’s better than nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: So you were – you were starting school, you were learning a little bit of English.</span> <span id="s143">Di – was – was it always your grandmothers intention to take you to the United States, or – did she want to stay in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: There was a compensation for having been in the camp.</span> <span id="s145">And my uncle didn’t talk to my grandmother for three years.</span> <span id="s146">She would bake every week in case he would come, he didn't come.</span> <span id="s147">I – I think I suspect why he didn't come.</span> <span id="s148">I have no other –</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Why is that?</span> <span id="s150">No –</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: She befriended a – a gentleman, for lack of a better word, and he abused me, and I think that’s why he stopped visiting his mother, because he was so against this man.</span> <span id="s152">This lady that worked for the underground, boo – we went back, after my grandmother died, I went back to Germany with my whole family, my husband and my three sons.</span> <span id="s153">And this lady that worked for the underground, I met her, and she said something to me, and I said, how did you know, I never told anybody, you know, that I was sexually abused.</span> <span id="s154">And she said, I suspected by the way he held you on his lap.</span> <span id="s155">And so, I would think, you know, my uncle probably did, too.</span> <span id="s156">And, you know, now I think, well, why didn't somebody do something to protect me from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So this is while you were still in Berlin, or this is when you go to –</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: While I was in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Do you think that influenced your grandmother’s decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: I think that’s why my uncle didn’t come around –</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: – and since he didn’t come around, she thought my best chance for survival was to come to America.</span> <span id="s165">And like I said in my documentary, I love my children, I don’t know if I could give up my country for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: You know?</span> <span id="s168">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s170">And d – you – you never talked to your grandmother about the abuse?</span> <span id="s171">Did she – do you think she knew about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: There’s always, you know, like you hear, don’t tell –</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: – don’t tell, okay, I won’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: So you leave – you leave Berlin, and you come –</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: That part really shouldn’t be in [indecipherable] this is – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: You leave Berlin and you come to the United States, and you’re nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And you come to –</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Well, I was eight on the ship [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: On the sh – when you landed you were nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Turned nine the day before we landed, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: And you come to new – did you stay in New York, or where did you go after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: My grandmother had a dot – somebody had to sponsor you.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: So she had a document saying she’s gonna be a housekeeper for someone in Hackensack, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: And on the ship someone said to her, you might as well use that for toilet paper, because nobody is going to wait that long for domestic help.</span> <span id="s191">So we come to New York, and they said, you can’t stay in New York because the population is too great, so choose someplace to go.</span> <span id="s192">And she had relatives in California, she didn’t want them to feel obligated to take care of us, so she decided against California.</span> <span id="s193">She had old family friends that lived in Chicago, so we came to Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s195">And so you spent your – your youth in Chicago, your American youth in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: And did you go to public school, did you go to private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Public school.</span> <span id="s200">And what was your grandmother doing for a living at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: She was, you know, she was a seamstress, so she – but I mean, it was like a word of mouth type thing –</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: – it’s not like she worked for somebody.</span> <span id="s204">Didn’t earn Social Security like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: I mean, she didn’t earn like a regular paycheck, but that’s – you know, and there was compensation money, she got [indecipherable] and some money for me until I was 18, so that’s what we lived off of.</span> <span id="s207">And we qualified for public aid, or whatever you called it at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: And being strong, or – I’m – I’m – can’t think of the word right now, but they would come every month and ask the same questions, like how many rooms do you have, and how many bathrooms do you have?</span> <span id="s210">And she’d, that doesn’t change, you know, from month to month.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: You’re living in the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: She didn't – so she decided, no more, and she stopped the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s214">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: I know, just –</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: So you graduated from high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: And did you go on to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I went into nurses’ training.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Met my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: And we were being transferred, so I never finished nurses’ training.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s225">And where were you transferred to?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: He went to Texas to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: And you wound up – did you wind up staying in Texas, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: And we came back to Chicago –</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: – and we went to Minnesota.</span> <span id="s233">You know the military, you ge –</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Ye – oh, okay, he was in military.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: He was in the army at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: And how many children – you have three sons?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Three sons and five granddaughters, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Oh wow, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: I would say the best part of being a parent is being a grandparent.</span> <span id="s242">You can hug ‘em, kiss ‘em, I love you, goodbye.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s244">I’m – I want to – you say you don’t remember a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: I don’t have any memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: You don’t have any memories.</span> <span id="s247">Do y – do you think you have – well, I mean, you were so young.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: But you – what’s interesting, and my husband has found this too, when I’m among survivors – first of all, I don’t have to explain myself, and I think just like they do, I fall right in with them, in spite of it.</span> <span id="s251">So I don’t know if it was like raised into me, or what.</span> <span id="s252">But I am, you know, very comfortable i-in this type of situation, or with a group that we had, you know.</span> <span id="s253">And so, we think the same way, you know you – I have a stack of food, let’s say, you know, so I never – even though we were both unemployed for a long time, I never worried about food, because I have that stock.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: That’s my security blanket.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: So we – we all fall into that.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And when you – when you were – well, you were too young to remember what it was like in Theresienstadt, but when you were in Berlin, did you – do you remember being hungry?</span> <span id="s259">Were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: No?</span> <span id="s262">It’s just an innate quality that you have now, that you have to stockpile food?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Can’t pass up a good deal [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: When you were in – when you were back in Berlin, do you remember, after the war is over, do you remember anti-Semitism at all?</span> <span id="s267">Were you experiencing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: I – you know, I think I was too young to know that, and as I grew up in Chicago, I knew people didn't like me, but I didn't know why.</span> <span id="s269">When I started working is when I really experienced anti-Semitism, I had to quit a job because of it.</span> <span id="s270">I was threatened, and I was harassed.</span> <span id="s271">One of my kids in particular says the Holocaust has really affected him.</span> <span id="s272">For instance, when the series “Holocaust” was on TV, he came home with – somebody told him a joke that I don’t remember, but it ended up with, all you need is an ashtray for six million Jews.</span> <span id="s273">And so, what I say to the audience, how do you respond to that as a human being, as a Jew, let alone as a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: And so now, I talk about the different things that have happened in my life that has affected me because of the Holocaust, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: So that’s really where my story is coming in, because everyone says oh, well, you’re lucky you don’t have memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: And I said, well – and now what I’m emphasizing, doesn’t mean it didn’t affect me.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: And how it’s affected me, my children and my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s282">And fir – I mean, first of all, you don’t have, you know, family get-togethers, be it for holiday, or my graduation or whatever, you know?</span> <span id="s283">And even my grandchildren are missing out on all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Because the family is not there.</span> <span id="s286">So last Rosh Hashanah weeke – we’ve got one congregation we belong to that I absolutely love.</span> <span id="s287">We never used to go to services, I belong to two congregations over 13 years, and people didn't even say hello to me.</span> <span id="s288">And now, if I’m not going to be here, like this last Friday, don’t worry about me, I’m fine, I’m going to be out of town, you know.</span> <span id="s289">So, the second congregation, Holocaust survivors are free.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: It’s a congregation that broke off from another congregation.</span> <span id="s292">So they have what they – are called a pitch-in dinner for Rosh Hashanah eve, eve Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s293">And, you know, I never had a family holiday dinner.</span> <span id="s294">I’d like to see what that’s like.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Let’s skip Rosh Hashanah services, you know, we’re there all day long, we – you know, we’ll miss that.</span> <span id="s297">And I got woken up the next morning, I didn't see you at services last night, are you okay, is Vern okay?</span> <span id="s298">Missed you, and – you know, because my husband had two lung collapses and lung surgery this year.</span> <span id="s299">So, you know, people, of course, are – are very aware of what’s going on in our lives.</span> <span id="s300">So, it’s a totally different – so I’ve had – even like this year, some very new experiences.</span> <span id="s301">I n – I had – I’ve had so many people say, oh, forget about the Holocaust, put it behind you.</span> <span id="s302">Lot of – from different people –</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: – comments like that.</span> <span id="s305">Or there’s no more prejudism in the world, you know, and we all know better than that.</span> <span id="s306">So yeah, there’s more and more – obviously my – I don’t feel my life is normal –</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: – because of it has been affected in spite of my age, an-and no memories, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Do you – I mean, do you have – I don’t know, did you ever find an organization, especially when you were younger, did you ever think that maybe there would be something out there for other Holocaust survivors?</span> <span id="s310">Did people talk to you about it, did they ask you questions about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Okay, I – I used to say, my parents didn’t survive the Holocaust, and my grandmother did.</span> <span id="s312">And I never put myself in that picture.</span> <span id="s313">And in 1981 was the world gathering of Holocaust survivors in Israel, was the first event I attended.</span> <span id="s314">And my son was on a work study program in Israel at the time.</span> <span id="s315">He’s now, of course, you know, almost Hassidic, I mean, he’s ultra-Orthodox.</span> <span id="s316">He was on a work study program, quit the program in order to join me for the gathering.</span> <span id="s317">We went to kibbutz comprised of survivors from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s318">And the man, among the racks and racks of documents found my name, and my grandmother’s name, wrote down for me what transport I was on, how many were on the transport, and how many survived.</span> <span id="s319">And at that point it hit me, that this happened to me, and I’m a survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: And my life changed a lot after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: How did it change?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Well, because now I’m talking about it all the time, and I’m realizing it did affect me, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Was – was – did you make a connection between things that you – behaviors that you had, that once you found out all of this, and found paperwork and saw proof, did you make the connection between that behavior, and oh, it’s because I’m a Holocaust survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yeah, now I – I’ve – certainly I see that, because as I talk to other people – like one of the guys from my group said, look it, I have all this fruit, because I didn't have that as a child, and I know I have so much it’s gonna spoil, but that’s just because of the war.</span> <span id="s326">And like, you know, we talked about I have a stack of food –</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: – that I’m not gonna worry.</span> <span id="s329">But when we join our present congregation, the rabbi was hemming and hawing and he says, this is very awkward, and I don’t know how to say this, I just have to come up with it, we have a food pantry, and, you know, I can get food every week.</span> <span id="s330">And I said, just ask my kids, I’ve got too much – and I said, I have too much food.</span> <span id="s331">Nobody has – has too much food, he said.</span> <span id="s332">I says, just ask my children, I have too much food, you know.</span> <span id="s333">And we just had like flooding in the basement, we had terrible rain, we had to throw out a bunch of food.</span> <span id="s334">I’m not worried about it.</span> <span id="s335">I’ve got food that’s way outdated, I’m sure, you know.</span> <span id="s336">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: It’s just –</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: – you know, so I’m not worried about it, it’s – it’s there, it’s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Did he – when you – when you discovered all this information, I mean you said your – your grandmother told you a lot of this when you came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: No, just about my –</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Just about your parents, but not about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: – my mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Did you – what did it feel like to learn about all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: See, I’ve known all along.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Right, but di – did you have –</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Cause I ha – her – just – I don’t remember it really affecting me.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Cause it didn’t have like a –</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Sh – well, because she kept telling everybody, and I’m standing right next to her, you know?</span> <span id="s349">Hello?</span> <span id="s350">Little pictures have big ears, you know.</span> <span id="s351">So – no, I mean, it was just something that I always grew up with, you know.</span> <span id="s352">But I did – I had to do like an autobiography in eighth grade, and so then she had to tell me some things, to do my homework.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: So then she elaborate a little bit more, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: And you didn’t feel –</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I always knew I –</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Did you feel awkward in school because of that?</span> <span id="s358">Because of the autobiography –</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: I always knew I was different, but I didn’t know why, you know?</span> <span id="s360">And everybody had parents, and it just – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s361">I hi – why – I mean, I made different friends and this one girlfriend, I spent weekends with them, and I called her parents mom and dad, and so I had a little sense of family there.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s363">Do you think that ri – you – it sounds like you’re close with your si – with your children and your grandchildren, do you think you’ve created that to – to find a family that you didn’t have –</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Well, family is important to me –</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: – you know, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Cause I – you know, grew up without family, so it’s – you know, when I hear about family problems, I – I dislike it.</span> <span id="s369">And I have it within my own family.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: I have a daughter-in-law who constantly cuts us off at her – her whim, and my son goes along with it.</span> <span id="s372">She t – he told his mother-in-law, I don’t – I don’t want to make waves, cause I have to live with her.</span> <span id="s373">And she cut her own mother off for over three years, and her mother was also a survivor.</span> <span id="s374">And so now she’s starting to get involved a little bit with the Second Generation.</span> <span id="s375">It’s very difficult, you know, we just had ano – I mean, that cookbook –</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: – the Holocaust cookbook, okay?</span> <span id="s378">And – so I ge – all I ever hear about is I can’t deal with the subject, okay?</span> <span id="s379">So, I did not give my son or my granddaughters a choice.</span> <span id="s380">So I gave them each a book and I wrote something in it.</span> <span id="s381">I didn't give her one, it didn’t occur to me.</span> <span id="s382">Like I se – you know, and she’s never let me explain what my thinking was.</span> <span id="s383">They don’t have a choice but deal with it, they have to deal with it, because I’m here.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: But she doesn’t, okay?</span> <span id="s386">So then, that caused another rift.</span> <span id="s387">And my other daughter-in-law, ‘why would you improve me’ attitude.</span> <span id="s388">In fact, they don’t even have a copy of the book yet.</span> <span id="s389">So, it’s were – they changed the book now for s – both – twice, and both times was because of me.</span> <span id="s390">Well, the first time my Orthodox family that cuts me off all the time, their pictures weren’t in – in the book, so they had to add the pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: And then th – then ca – Rosh Hashanah, at Yom HaShoah time, Joanna came in to talk about the book, and she told my story, and she introduced me.</span> <span id="s393">And so she re-read my story, and she was looking for a special connection.</span> <span id="s394">And she s – she found it, because in our congregation we have a Holocaust tour that survived the same country I did.</span> <span id="s395">She says, that’s the connection I was looking for.</span> <span id="s396">So one of our members took a picture of me with the Holocaust tour, and that’s going to be in the new book.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: So, I just tol – I was telling my neighbor about it, says, I’m just a troublemaker, you know.</span> <span id="s399">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: So what’s the recipe in the book?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Sweet noodle kugel, carrot mold, and economy matzo balls.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Economy matzo balls?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: It’s only one egg, instead of like a dozen, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: That’s fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: I don’t like the fluffy ones.</span> <span id="s406">Just want it to be – bite in something, you know you’re biting into something.</span> <span id="s407">I don’t like those other ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: An-And it’s just a few you’ve learned from your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: No, it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: – ma – it was mine.</span> <span id="s412">I didn’t, I guess, quite understand what this is all about, and I don’t have any recipes from her, so this is just stuff that I make every year.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: So you’ve made your own traditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: That’s fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: And nobody makes matzo balls like mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Nobodys – nobody ever does.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: My kids like my matzo balls.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: That’s great.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: That’s great.</span> <span id="s422">So is there anything that we didn’t cover, that you were interested –</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Well, I don’t know, you know, I’ve never go – I haven’t done this.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Other than the documentary, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Yeah, yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s427">So I – I wa – I want to make sure I’ve – I’ve got everything from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: You know, I’ll probably think of something afterwards, I’m just –</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Oh, I’m sure we will, we’re never going to get everything, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s431">Well, you’re more experienced at this than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Yeah, well, for now I think we’re good, and I’m going to stop the interview, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s434">Okay.</span></p>
