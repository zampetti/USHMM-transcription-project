1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Okay, and where?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Patavia, in Jaffa, Indonesia.</span> <span id="s21">In those days was Dutch East Indies.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Can you tell us the names of your mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: My father’s name is bar -- Baron Ruurd Von Cammingha, my mother’s name was Jacqueline Von Sweetin.</span> <span id="s24">Now, she is from a general’s family, and they had plantations in Indonesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Can you please spell your father’s name, Ruurd?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: R-u-u-r-d, and then Carl, so my son is the same name.</span> <span id="s27">And his sister had a son, was also Ruurd Carl, and he got smashed by a Nazi truck when he was 16, on the way from high school to his house.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Can you tell us a little bit more about what your mother and father were doing in Indonesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: We owned plantations, we lived there.</span> <span id="s30">My mother was born in Malung, and my father was sent by the needelaunser handlesbunk, to have a office in Jaffa.</span> <span id="s31">So, they met there, and got married, and I was born -- my brother was born in Polungbung, and we went back to Holland when I was four, because he was assigned to another job in the Netherlands, and 15 years later was my sister born.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Can you tell us the names of your brother and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: My brother’s name is Feetus Valerius Von Cammingha, and my sister is Kristina Maria.</span> <span id="s34">I’m laughing, because we don’t call each other that way.</span> <span id="s35">Totally different names.</span> <span id="s36">But Kristina Maria Von Cammingha.</span> <span id="s37">We call her Snane.</span> <span id="s38">And my brother is Peterbas.</span> <span id="s39">Crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: These are nicknames?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Yeah, because as a child, it was too difficult to figure out the real names, so that was what we gave them, and that held on for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s43">Did you yourself have a nickname when you were young?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yeah, my name is Lukie.</span> <span id="s45">And now I have a business on the website, I’m -- I -- I’m now Bonzo, because that was the name during the war as an underground person.</span> <span id="s46">You never said your own name, but you had a fake name, just in case, to be on the safe side.</span> <span id="s47">So Bonzo is that little dog, look like a bulldog, you know?</span> <span id="s48">Feisty, and very determined, and you don’t get rid of that dog very easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Can you tell us a bit about daily life when you were four, or five, or six, you’re beginning to become aware of things, back -- back in the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yeah, we had -- we had servants.</span> <span id="s51">Of course, all Indonesian, and they were watching us, and they -- they cleaned the house, they were cooking, and doing the laundry, and the laundry was done in the river, and that was slammed on the -- on the rocks.</span> <span id="s52">And then a little bit further was someone brushing the teeth.</span> <span id="s53">That was life in Indonesia.</span> <span id="s54">We always had protection, we always had people with a gun, just in case, because it was always kind of difficult times.</span> <span id="s55">And well, for the rest, it was -- it was very protective.</span> <span id="s56">You could not go out, for instance, to the pussar by yourself.</span> <span id="s57">The pussar is like a department place, where you buy st-stuff from outside, because you could get on the back a knife.</span> <span id="s58">So why would you provoke that?</span> <span id="s59">There’s off -- obviously we have a -- an -- an -- a white skin, while the population is brown skinned, so -- but mostly they had respect.</span> <span id="s60">After all, we -- we were a colony, and if we had to complain, it was not very, very difficult to put a person in -- in jail.</span> <span id="s61">And in those days no lawyers to defend.</span> <span id="s62">If -- if you got a complain, no questions asked, there you go.</span> <span id="s63">That was the way it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: And what was it like when you went back to -- where your parent -- well, where your family originally was from -- from the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yeah, yeah, to the Netherlands -- see, my father was born in Amsterdam, so his parents were in Holland, and my mother’s parents were still in Indonesia.</span> <span id="s66">And well, we just lived in -- in the street, I can remember that, was a -- a -- a house over -- over the entrance of a garage, so I remember it was always cold, because the wind always goes through that -- that entrance.</span> <span id="s67">Why they picked that house, I never could understand that.</span> <span id="s68">And the school was close by, we could walk.</span> <span id="s69">In the Netherlands, you don’t have that system as here, that the school buses, you just go on the bike, or you pick a school close to your house, that’s how it was there.</span> <span id="s70">And it was always raining.</span> <span id="s71">Holland is always damp-y, and -- you get used to that, too, th-the raincoat was way until the ankles.</span> <span id="s72">And you had beautiful skin, because always wet, you know, always pinky.</span> <span id="s73">And you just take things the way it happens, no complain.</span> <span id="s74">You don’t know anything better.</span> <span id="s75">But I do realize that my mother was relieved because my mother was not accustomed to the Indonesian climate.</span> <span id="s76">See, over there, you have six -- six months that it is pouring rain, and six months is it so dry that we had red earth in the ears, and in the nose, and on -- because of the dust.</span> <span id="s77">So that was what we called the dry season.</span> <span id="s78">And then the wet season was -- if it was always pouring rain, no, if it was raining, if you would stand in -- on the street, and the rain would fall, on this side you were wet, on this side you was dry.</span> <span id="s79">I never forget that, and it was always six o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: So you actually have a lot memories of Indonesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s82">I had my own monkey.</span> <span id="s83">I had my own parrot, white with a little tuft.</span> <span id="s84">And that parrot was talking, and the monkey was always hugging me, loving me to pieces.</span> <span id="s85">I miss that, because here you’re not allowed to have a monkey.</span> <span id="s86">But it is companionship, and you feel kind of -- you know, you have something that belongs, and that you protect.</span> <span id="s87">Cause the natives, of course, they protected you, but they had no interest in you as a person.</span> <span id="s88">They only had interest in themselves, to stay safe.</span> <span id="s89">We played tennis, and we -- we swam a lot.</span> <span id="s90">I remember you -- you went in your pajamas to the movies, that that’s the custom, you know?</span> <span id="s91">Nobody’s looking around like she’s crazy, it is just the way that -- that you lived, that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: And when you went back, did -- to the house, you s -- can -- you say you remember the street.</span> <span id="s93">Can you describe the neighborhood a little bit more?</span> <span id="s94">This is in the Netherlands.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: In the Netherlands?</span> <span id="s96">Oh yeah, but see that was not changed that much.</span> <span id="s97">I was the last time in ’84, and everything was changed.</span> <span id="s98">And that’s why after that, I f -- I told my sister, I have no inclinations to go back, because it is so changed, I don’t re-remember that is my country.</span> <span id="s99">It’s all highway, modern buildings, the roads are ap -- you know here the -- the Beltway?</span> <span id="s100">In Holland is it much worse.</span> <span id="s101">Because you have not been prepared.</span> <span id="s102">Holland is as -- as small as New Jersey.</span> <span id="s103">Everything has to be one way, because the streets are so narrow.</span> <span id="s104">In those days -- the houses were built in 12 -- 1200, and then in 16-1700, was mo-more built.</span> <span id="s105">So if you go to Amsterdam, or The Hague, the streets you can only walk in.</span> <span id="s106">A car would not even move, because it is so shuclocked, you couldn’t make a turn, it was blocked.</span> <span id="s107">Y-You don’t even need a traffic sign, because it’s not necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: So where do people leave their cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, you have parking space, if you can find one, but it could be two blocks away -- as long as you have your car parked.</span> <span id="s110">And that is why we didn’t have a car, we had bikes.</span> <span id="s111">I was always on the bike, cause that’s the easy.</span> <span id="s112">And you -- you kept your bike in the house, because they were stealing like heck.</span> <span id="s113">Now we had the Germans, for instance, we -- we were, for instance, on one end of the street, blocked by trucks, two or three, full of soldiers, and on the other side of the street the same way, so you could not get out, period.</span> <span id="s114">And then they were doing rusias.</span> <span id="s115">A rusia means that this house to house search, for either a radio, a fur coat, a bike, anything that they could use.</span> <span id="s116">And if you would listen to the BBC for news, then you would get down on your knees in front of your front door, ping, out.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Killed.</span> <span id="s119">Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Oh, you mean if -- if you were discovered listening to the news?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s122">Now, my father -- my whole family is like r-rebels, you know, we -- we do things that you’re not supposed to, but we do it, because we are not told by any big mouth shot, what we can and cannot do.</span> <span id="s123">So, my father was always listening.</span> <span id="s124">So when we had that search, when the -- I -- I stretch my hand this way on the -- at the door, so they could not pass, and I always had my uniform on, because you have to learn a weakness of a person -- I studied that.</span> <span id="s125">So I found out the Germans were always scared for illness, for anything that is contagious.</span> <span id="s126">So I told them point blank -- I’m a big liar -- with straight poker face, sorry, but I have a diphtheria patient in the back.</span> <span id="s127">Of course not true.</span> <span id="s128">So what?</span> <span id="s129">And then my father would yell from upstairs, “Who is there?”</span> <span id="s130">I said, “Dad, this is rotmoff.”</span> <span id="s131">That’s Dutch for rotten Jerry.</span> <span id="s132">Oh, my father dashed to the -- the radio, turn it off, house quiet.</span> <span id="s133">So, the Germans didn’t know what I was saying, but they had enough, and get out, they didn’t want to get sick.</span> <span id="s134">So that was the way it happened in my house.</span> <span id="s135">Now, I don’t know, next door neighbors, because you was very cautious that you didn’t say too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Can you talk a little bit more about -- you said no one in my fam -- your family is full of rebels.</span> <span id="s137">Talk a little bit more about other things your father did, even before the Germans came, that sort of taught you that, how to -- to really be your own person.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Oh yeah, well we are very military.</span> <span id="s139">My father graduated in Breedah, say as similar as here, West Point.</span> <span id="s140">My younger son graduated from West Point.</span> <span id="s141">My older son is from VMI.</span> <span id="s142">So we always teased each other.</span> <span id="s143">The West Point son said, “You -- you got to tell sir to me.”</span> <span id="s144">Now he’s nine years younger than my older son, so my older son, “You can go to you know where.”</span> <span id="s145">They always were joking, but we were brought up very strict, and my father was a banker, so I learned finances quick.</span> <span id="s146">In -- in 1929, with the depression, I got a -- an income of a dime on Sundays, and I had to write everything down on a little book, the expenses, and the income, and if it was not balanced, I would not get my salary.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: And then on my mother’s side, my mother’s father was a general, who fought in the archie war, and he earned a golden urn, and that was put in a home for retired soldiers, that is called Brombake.</span> <span id="s149">And if you visit them, they know, “Oh yeah, General Von Sweetin.”</span> <span id="s150">My mother had a brother who was a captain in the Dutch army.</span> <span id="s151">My father was in Hoosar, and that means you have your own horse, and you are in the cavalry.</span> <span id="s152">And another brother, who was shot by the Germans in the airport, was a captain in the army, and he was not in the underground, he was in the regular army, but he tried to stop a German airplane, and when he was shooting, while the airplane was landing, they shot him instead, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Who -- what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Edward.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Edward.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: So my younger son is also Edward.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So would have been Edward -- last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Same.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Von --</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: My uncle was Edward Von Sweetin, because he was a -- a -- a brother of my mother.</span> <span id="s163">Now, we have a museum in Brombake, and we have -- that is the Von Sweetin museum, and we have a museum in Leeuwarden, that is the Von Cammingha museum.</span> <span id="s164">And we had a castle on the island of Leeuwarden, but that was burned down, and then we had some other castle.</span> <span id="s165">You just flow away with castles -- close to Leeuwarden, and I have a booklet there, that is now the place of a well known Dutch soccer club -- soccer team.</span> <span id="s166">So I got that -- my son went to Holland, and he was very impressed with that, and he was visiting them, and telling them that my mother was here, but I never contacted them, because I was so busy.</span> <span id="s167">I still have to do that, though.</span> <span id="s168">So they have a team there, on the ground of the -- the castle.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s171">Yeah, it is fantastic, and amazing how -- how that, you know, develops, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: I’m wondering if you could think back to when your -- you’re still pretty young, and eating dinner perhaps, together, and the -- the discussions at the family meal, or just family discussions about politics, in general --</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yeah, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: What kinds of things were your mother and father saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Well, to be honest, we were not always together.</span> <span id="s176">My brother was in -- in what do you call it, college.</span> <span id="s177">And I was, of course, in another city, in Haarlem, as a nurse.</span> <span id="s178">A student nurse.</span> <span id="s179">And my sister was born in ’35, so she was like five to 10 years old during that period, so she was at school.</span> <span id="s180">But we were eating in the -- in the living room, I remember that, no central heat in those days, because it was just not existing.</span> <span id="s181">The Germans stole anything, everything what was stolable.</span> <span id="s182">So we had an -- a stove that was heated by coal, and it smelled horrible, so we had always the window open.</span> <span id="s183">And we cooked like tulip bulbs, and -- I have a list of -- of items that we -- we had in those days, because th-th-the stores were just empty.</span> <span id="s184">There was no food.</span> <span id="s185">And that was on purpose, to let us die out.</span> <span id="s186">Simple, you know.</span> <span id="s187">You just don’t feed the person, so they have to -- to die.</span> <span id="s188">So you saw people walking around as a skeleton, because if you have no family that takes care, and you are by yourself, the only way to get stuff is go to the farm, and exchange like linens, or clothing, and then you got your food, so that’s what we did on the bicycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s190">A-And, I’m going back now to before the Germans came.</span> <span id="s191">What w -- did Jews live mixed into your neighborhood --</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: -- or -- tell -- tell us a little bit about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Okay, we -- we lived in -- like in the von -- von alka madalan, and there were family that was all Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s195">Six girls, all very intelligent, and -- and all playing a musical instrument.</span> <span id="s196">I was drawn to that family so -- so much, because they had such a nice attitude, and they were so full of faith, like nothing could happen.</span> <span id="s197">They were -- they were not afraid at all.</span> <span id="s198">But I warned them, since I was already in that time, informed.</span> <span id="s199">I started in 1933 to smell something.</span> <span id="s200">I mean, you -- you didn’t have a TV in those days, but if you went to the movies, there was news before the movie started, and I saw the -- the inclination of lots of legs, and lots of parading, big mouth speeches, you know, so I was already in -- in my heart feeling that’s no good.</span> <span id="s201">Now, Holland was always neutral, in World War One was -- we were neutral still.</span> <span id="s202">We didn’t expect them to get in -- against our rule that we were neutral, and we stayed that way.</span> <span id="s203">We made that very clear.</span> <span id="s204">The heck with us, that’s their attitude.</span> <span id="s205">So our queen was warned on time, Queen Julianna and her kids went to Canada.</span> <span id="s206">I have pictures of those, too.</span> <span id="s207">My next door neighbor, Rost Von Tunningham, you will not believe that.</span> <span id="s208">One brother was with the queen, was always picked up with a horse and buggy, had his uniform with that big type of hat, like an admiral wears in those days.</span> <span id="s209">And the other brother was an NSB member.</span> <span id="s210">National Sas -- Socialist Bund.</span> <span id="s211">So that were two brothers in one family clashing.</span> <span id="s212">So was very important that you could trust each other.</span> <span id="s213">So I had his name on the list of people that would have been cckk.</span> <span id="s214">See, everything in Holland was --</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: That would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Killed.</span> <span id="s217">Shot.</span> <span id="s218">We went to the dunes, we were in Schevening, so that is all dunes, and sand and stuff like that, so in the dunes we had -- the Germans made those shelters.</span> <span id="s219">And then you would hear, dat da da dat da da da, someone was killed.</span> <span id="s220">You didn’t know who, because you never get information, but if you wanted information, you knew people to get it from.</span> <span id="s221">I kept mouth shut.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: You said that you started seeing some of the news before the movies.</span> <span id="s223">What -- can you tell us more about why it worried you?</span> <span id="s224">You said you just had a bad feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Too -- yeah, too much propaganda, too much big mouth, and provocation.</span> <span id="s226">Why would she do that to a -- a -- a person that is your friend?</span> <span id="s227">See, if you start to do that, then I start to think you are not my friend.</span> <span id="s228">I’m very sensitive person.</span> <span id="s229">If -- if I have a person in front of me that talks negative, I have an intuition, watch out.</span> <span id="s230">That is just me.</span> <span id="s231">I was born with that.</span> <span id="s232">And I could have been even psychiatr -- what do you call it, someone that looks in the future, because I get always in the mail, people in that field.</span> <span id="s233">Now, I’m not stupid, if they say I do a free reading, and then at the end you get a form to fill out, 20 dollars, I send that form nicely back without the 20 dollars, because in the beginning they said it was free.</span> <span id="s234">I’m not that -- you -- so that was in those days, too.</span> <span id="s235">I -- I have a very sensitive feeling about things.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Was it something that you expressed to your parents in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: No.</span> <span id="s238">They didn’t even know I was in the underground.</span> <span id="s239">We had even a soldier in the house, in my brother’s room, yeah.</span> <span id="s240">But the soldier was nice.</span> <span id="s241">He was my age, so he almost fell in love with me.</span> <span id="s242">He asked me for a date.</span> <span id="s243">I said, “Listen buddy, you have that rotten uniform on.</span> <span id="s244">Do you think I’m stupid?”</span> <span id="s245">But he ale -- always came back from his farm in Hamburg with eggs, with butter, with that -- my father said, “Don’t accept it.”</span> <span id="s246">My mother said, “Uh-uh.</span> <span id="s247">I cook with it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: So I’m trying to get a sense of how you became politically aware.</span> <span id="s249">Some of it is instinct, but you mentioned that your family is -- is a family full of very strong characters also.</span> <span id="s250">So, let’s go back still to the time before the Germans have come.</span> <span id="s251">When you start seeing some news about the Germans, what are people saying?</span> <span id="s252">Whe-When are you starting to get very worried, or -- or how is that if you could just sort of explain that progression.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s254">In the first place, I was a Girl Scout, in -- in -- in that time was girl -- Girl’s Guide.</span> <span id="s255">Course that’s in Holland different.</span> <span id="s256">In 1937, I visited the boy’s jamboree.</span> <span id="s257">That was in -- in Hilversum.</span> <span id="s258">I noticed there were no Germans, so I talked with the American.</span> <span id="s259">She w -- in those days, in Holland, you get English, you get German, you get French, if you’re 11 years old.</span> <span id="s260">So I had contact with the American soldiers -- Boy Scouts, because I was impressed about their camps, their -- their tents, very efficient.</span> <span id="s261">Their equipment, like they had the water thing hanging, and that’s what they got fresh water from.</span> <span id="s262">Their whole attitude appealed to me.</span> <span id="s263">And then, I was a member of a hockey club.</span> <span id="s264">That is field hockey.</span> <span id="s265">That is British inclined.</span> <span id="s266">Then, of course, I was told you cannot do anything in the uniform, because that is -- that’s poor British.</span> <span id="s267">So I alr -- already felt there is something fishy going on.</span> <span id="s268">Why is this forbidden, why is that forbidden?</span> <span id="s269">And it was not even war yet.</span> <span id="s270">And if you talk to a Dutch, forbidden means resent.</span> <span id="s271">You already start to.</span> <span id="s272">In Holland you don’t need a lawyer.</span> <span id="s273">If you have a handshake because you agree, that is the promise that you make, and you stick to that.</span> <span id="s274">You can trust a Dutch word.</span> <span id="s275">You cannot trust a German word.</span> <span id="s276">It’s full of lies, it’s full of promises because they want to mellow you.</span> <span id="s277">And we are not that way.</span> <span id="s278">We are very cautious.</span> <span id="s279">So when I saw that shelters were built, when I was told you cannot have lights -- bulbs, like this bright light, forget it.</span> <span id="s280">It had to be covered with blue, so the light would go straight down, it would never go outside your window.</span> <span id="s281">Now, everybody was taped -- had taped their windows, because ev -- we were bombed.</span> <span id="s282">See, if -- then the windows would not break, or it would just hang on the tape.</span> <span id="s283">So there were all kind of insinuations.</span> <span id="s284">Try to get tires for your bike, because rubber would not be available.</span> <span id="s285">It happened.</span> <span id="s286">Our bikes were having wooden wheels instead.</span> <span id="s287">The word hoarding, here in America, that’s a bad word.</span> <span id="s288">I hoard.</span> <span id="s289">I hoard strange things, because you never know if you need it to use next time.</span> <span id="s290">And that’s one part that they say, you know, in here.</span> <span id="s291">But that was happening in those days.</span> <span id="s292">You take things in the house, in case.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Louise Segaar.</span> <span id="s295">Interview’s being done on November 10th, in the year 2000, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s296">This is tape one, side B.</span> <span id="s297">So you -- y-you were accumulating really, evidence that something was going wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: We not only got very good information with the BBC, because of course, they had spies all over, already, in that time.</span> <span id="s299">But a -- as certain attitudes, like the next door neighbor with the NSB organization, who were against our government, and if you are very much for the queen, and you are in the military, and you take the oath of defending your country, you just don’t take that, you fight back.</span> <span id="s300">Not necessarily with a weapon, but you can fight back with sabotage.</span> <span id="s301">We sabotaged plenty.</span> <span id="s302">So when it was the time for the Germans to go in Holland, they pretended that it was necessary, because they had to in-invade Great Britain.</span> <span id="s303">And we just broke the dikes, so the water was -- was all over the bolus.</span> <span id="s304">You know, the Netherlands is much lower on the sea level than this country is, so we were used that the water would flow down, and you just cope with the fact that you cannot grow anything any more, and everything run -- drowns.</span> <span id="s305">But the point was that the German heavy equipment could not go through, see?</span> <span id="s306">So the Germans were forced to go over in the air.</span> <span id="s307">It was wall to wall airplanes.</span> <span id="s308">And they came with -- what do you call that in -- in English.</span> <span id="s309">In -- in German is -- it’s falsesharem.</span> <span id="s310">Parachutes, parachutes.</span> <span id="s311">So, it was a nice target to -- to -- from the ground up, to kill those parachutes when they were coming down.</span> <span id="s312">I always felt sorry, because those people were their own age, like me.</span> <span id="s313">And why would you kill an -- a young boy that is forced to do something he doesn’t want to do?</span> <span id="s314">Because, I talked with them.</span> <span id="s315">We -- we had the -- you know, that we were on the beach, and I would sneak up on -- on the one guy, he had lots of hair, all black hair.</span> <span id="s316">And we -- we made a bet -- the girls around me, you don’t dare.</span> <span id="s317">So I sneak behind, and I did like this over his hair.</span> <span id="s318">And then he would go, “Oh, what are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s319">In German, huh.</span> <span id="s320">I said, “Don’t worry, I’m just -- you know, I’m having a bet, and I won.”</span> <span id="s321">Now you can see what a crazy kid I was.</span> <span id="s322">So we had talks, and then they -- he said, well, don’t fear us, because we are just in the army, and if we don’t do it, what we are supposed to do, we get killed in our -- our own country.</span> <span id="s323">So I found out a lot from them.</span> <span id="s324">Besides, I had a girlfriend -- that was after the war, who had a castle in Germany, and she said, “When I was on my own grounds, going a certain direction, there was an -- a guard telling me to go back in my castle, because there was something fa -- fishy in that area.”</span> <span id="s325">Where the smell came from?</span> <span id="s326">Concentration camp.</span> <span id="s327">So they had concentration camps all over, and the German population was not supposed to know about it.</span> <span id="s328">So, in -- in a way, I -- I always said, I feel like I hate the Germans.</span> <span id="s329">I cannot say that, because in every country -- now here, with the politics, you have Republicans, and you have Democrats, also divided.</span> <span id="s330">It’s incredible.</span> <span id="s331">So it is in every country that way.</span> <span id="s332">But you had to be careful, because how did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Did -- did your father ever consider, as war drew near, getting you out of the country, perhaps going to the United States, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: No.</span> <span id="s335">At that time you had no chance.</span> <span id="s336">You was -- see, you need a permit.</span> <span id="s337">Everything is done by the government.</span> <span id="s338">The government could not be trusted either, was very divided.</span> <span id="s339">The queen had to leave.</span> <span id="s340">Many people of the government had to escape.</span> <span id="s341">So, the government that ti -- that time, was already corrupt.</span> <span id="s342">You need a passport, you need a visa, you need permission, you need a sponsor.</span> <span id="s343">That all hinders you.</span> <span id="s344">So we sp -- we were sponsored after the war, because we could prove that he could come.</span> <span id="s345">But if I would dow -- put down on my application, Nazi, or member of that, do you think United States was crazy enough to -- to let me in?</span> <span id="s346">See?</span> <span id="s347">So -- and we had no intentions.</span> <span id="s348">We -- we were ready to fight for what we had to fight.</span> <span id="s349">You mean -- I -- I would have been a -- a coward if I would have tried to get out.</span> <span id="s350">My job was to protect the people, like the Jews, like the gays, like -- what do you call those people?</span> <span id="s351">Gypsies.</span> <span id="s352">The Germans had the particular type of person that they did not like, and they were persecuted.</span> <span id="s353">So our job was to -- to get coupons so that we could buy food.</span> <span id="s354">To get the -- the word Jew off their chest.</span> <span id="s355">The -- the word Jew was printed on a star, and that was -- was sewed on -- on any -- any clothing.</span> <span id="s356">So if you went on the street, you have to wear that.</span> <span id="s357">What we did was take it off, give them another piece of cloth, hide them.</span> <span id="s358">They were not allowed in the street any more.</span> <span id="s359">Now, yesterday was Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s360">I never forget that either, because any store that belonged to a Jew was smashed in with rocks, with stone that they picked up from the street, because in Holland, every street is done with stones, you don’t see concrete that much.</span> <span id="s361">And because my family is pretty religious, my -- my father’s sister belonged to the Haranhurtus.</span> <span id="s362">Haranhurtus is a sect that is very religious, and -- and has a strong faith, and is very optimistic, and helps you.</span> <span id="s363">A person with a mental problem, for instance, would feel a lot better if you was in connection with the Haranhurta, because that’s -- that was the way they were living.</span> <span id="s364">And so we knew a -- a watchmaker, I never forget that either.</span> <span id="s365">Now, my aunt lived in Utrecht, a separate city, and that poor family was stoned, and -- and the window was all busted, and people were helping themselves.</span> <span id="s366">All those watches were -- were in -- in the store, or clocks, whatever, they just dragged it out.</span> <span id="s367">The man was just robbed death.</span> <span id="s368">Just because he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s369">So I was very res-resentful, and I tell you, when the war was finished, we let them pay.</span> <span id="s370">We let the Germans pay before they went back to -- to the German, to their own country.</span> <span id="s371">We let them walk, we didn’t provide any transportation.</span> <span id="s372">Now, that is about a three hour walk.</span> <span id="s373">And we had the girls who had been dating, put on the table, on the street.</span> <span id="s374">We threw them with rotten eggs, rotten tomatoes, and we shaved their hair off completely, to show everybody that girl is a trait -- betrayed -- for a threat.</span> <span id="s375">No, we were very mean.</span> <span id="s376">But see, you are made that way.</span> <span id="s377">You cannot swallow all that crap.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Tell us a little bit more about Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s379">At -- you mentioned what happened in Utrecht, d-do --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: All over.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: B-But --</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: In Hague.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: [indecipherable] you describe what happened -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: -- around where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s387">Th-They threw rocks in -- in people’s windows of stores, in private windows.</span> <span id="s388">I don’t know what else to say, I mean that -- that was on the ninth of -- of November, so if you say you try to forget, I cannot forget it, it’s like it happened yesterday.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Did you yourself stay in that night, or did you go out and watch?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: I wanted to see it.</span> <span id="s391">I had no fear.</span> <span id="s392">I still have no fear.</span> <span id="s393">In those days my brother was like Ann Frank in my father’s office.</span> <span id="s394">My father belonged to the RNVB, that is here, triple A, similar.</span> <span id="s395">So he helped motorists in trouble, and stuff like that, and my father was a secretary.</span> <span id="s396">Now, I’m 80 now, but I don’t look 80.</span> <span id="s397">My father at that time, if you were 16 until 50 I think it was, you was not allowed on the street, you would be picked up and transported to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s398">Westerbork was a city close to the German border.</span> <span id="s399">You would get stripped from your clothing, and they would give you another ID, and you was then transported to a factory in Germany.</span> <span id="s400">To heck with that.</span> <span id="s401">So, we -- we got food every day to my brother.</span> <span id="s402">My father went once to his office, and it was very foggy that day, and a German shouted in his ear, “Toomshta shoengain.”</span> <span id="s403">So my father woke up like, “Are you crazy, I’m not going to do that.”</span> <span id="s404">So he ran -- we all good runners by the way -- around the shelter in -- in that fog, and he was shot at.</span> <span id="s405">He heard, you know, the soldier shooting at him.</span> <span id="s406">My father made it at home, and he said, “Get me under the -- under the floor.”</span> <span id="s407">So we did that.</span> <span id="s408">Of course, no-nobody came at the door, because they didn’t know, in that fog, where he was anyway.</span> <span id="s409">But that was the last.</span> <span id="s410">We learned our lesson.</span> <span id="s411">So I found that out later -- course I was in -- in the hospital that -- that time, and in those days you didn’t tell each other those things, because you would not worry, or make a person worry, because I would not have stayed in the hospital, I would have stayed home to protect.</span> <span id="s412">So I found that out after the war was finished.</span> <span id="s413">So we -- we had lots of things to tell to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Tell us about when your brother -- y-you basically described your brother being in hiding, but when did your parents put him in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: That is what I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: They -- see they don’t -- or maybe they said it, but is one ear in, one ear out.</span> <span id="s418">But I do know that when I was on vacation, or I had reason to leave the hospital, that I and my mother went with a pot with food.</span> <span id="s419">Now, you cannot keep that warm, huh, but anyway he got his food, and then we exchanged news with him.</span> <span id="s420">I think he had a radio.</span> <span id="s421">I think my father provided that.</span> <span id="s422">And of course, you had to do it in a way that the other people on -- in that office were not aware, because you never knew of -- if there was a traitor in that office.</span> <span id="s423">But since my father had an high position, they had respect for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: So where exactly was your brother hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: In -- in that office --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: In the li -- in the office?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: -- in -- in the center of The Hague, Barkstrout.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Just in the office, or was he under --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: In no --</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: -- was he behind a closet, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s432">The office -- just like in Ann Frank, Buchen had a -- an -- a fake door, with the book thing, and then you would swivel that around, and then he was hiding.</span> <span id="s433">But see, that was normal.</span> <span id="s434">In those days, your -- you had to think about something, you know, to -- to protect.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: How old was he at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Well, he is two years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s437">So if in 1940, I was 20, he was 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: So at one point you went away, you were doing your work, or your education, and you came back, and your brother was in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: And you didn’t ask a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s441">You eventually saw him, but -- but that’s just how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s443">Because he had, of course, only the news what he -- we gave him.</span> <span id="s444">But since my father was listening to the BBC, and I was involved with scouting, and other things, I mean, you just -- you just had to learn what was going around you, otherwise you could not function.</span> <span id="s445">I mean, I was a student nurse, in a way, but in that hospital were plenty people also in the underground.</span> <span id="s446">Now, for instance, one day I had the TBC patients.</span> <span id="s447">They need fresh air, so they were in the yard.</span> <span id="s448">So that ward was -- was empty, and I got this guy running to me, “Hide me, hide me.”</span> <span id="s449">A Dutch person.</span> <span id="s450">I says, “Go on, go on in the bed, don’t move.”</span> <span id="s451">Then the German comes right behind him.</span> <span id="s452">“Did you see anyone?”</span> <span id="s453">Again, I stood like this.</span> <span id="s454">I said, “Do you want to get TBC?</span> <span id="s455">I didn’t see anyone.”</span> <span id="s456">Go eyeball to eyeball.</span> <span id="s457">In German.</span> <span id="s458">So he understood what he had to deal with.</span> <span id="s459">So he -- he looked with respect all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s460">First he looked like ch, another woman, like most men do anyway.</span> <span id="s461">But I had no intention to let him in.</span> <span id="s462">My intention was put my foot out, and then he would stumble over it, and I would jumped on his back, and he would not be alive out that door.</span> <span id="s463">That was my intention.</span> <span id="s464">So we were pretare -- prepared.</span> <span id="s465">So then he -- he ran to the other end of the hall, because he couldn’t get any -- and this guy said, “Is it okay?”</span> <span id="s466">I said, “Keep mouth shut, I will tell you.”</span> <span id="s467">So I had to find out first if everything was okay, and then we had the cellar, and we put him in that cellar.</span> <span id="s468">But the point was, in that time, we did not know the director of that hospital, if he could be trusted.</span> <span id="s469">So everything was very risky, and you had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s470">But I thought, well, if he goes in that -- in that basement with other people, then th-the -- the principal should be okay.</span> <span id="s471">Because he could find that out, if he was the -- the good type of principal.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Why do you think your parents put your brother in hiding, and -- a-and not you?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: I was not in danger.</span> <span id="s474">I was a girl.</span> <span id="s475">I was a tomboy girl, and people say, “Oh boy, you have to be careful with her.”</span> <span id="s476">Because I could climb on -- on the -- on the rainpipe to reach the roof of your house, and I beat the -- the boys of my age to pulp.</span> <span id="s477">They had to respect.</span> <span id="s478">I was a real nasty, because you get that way.</span> <span id="s479">If a boy is telling you you cannot do this, you cannot do that, I proved to them I could do it.</span> <span id="s480">That was the funny thing.</span> <span id="s481">And still, my next door neighbors are what you call skinheads.</span> <span id="s482">Th-the -- the boys in the 20’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Now?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Oh yeah, they live right behind -- beside me.</span> <span id="s485">So they were using my yard like so what, you know, it’s j-just an old woman.</span> <span id="s486">So they play baseball, and -- and whatever, and I picked up the balls and didn’t return it to them.</span> <span id="s487">And then they would yell bloody murder, like saying words I better not repeat -- repeat in there.</span> <span id="s488">And one day I had enough of it, and I know karate, I did all -- all kinds of things in my life, all kinds of courses.</span> <span id="s489">So, I wrapped my legs around the guys hip, very tight, couldn’t shake me off, and mur -- you see my nails?</span> <span id="s490">That is really like a cat.</span> <span id="s491">So five nails on this side of his back, five nails on this side of his back.</span> <span id="s492">He had no shirt on.</span> <span id="s493">The blood was coming out.</span> <span id="s494">“Ow.”</span> <span id="s495">You should have heard him.</span> <span id="s496">He could not sleep for five days on his back.</span> <span id="s497">And that was the time they didn’t play ball either.</span> <span id="s498">Was finished.</span> <span id="s499">They still are not looking at me.</span> <span id="s500">They are not looking at me, they are scared to death.</span> <span id="s501">Now they are now 25, in the meantime, and whatever age, but no, y-you got to show respect.</span> <span id="s502">In -- in -- in Holland, also, I was followed by a guy in the dunes once, and I knew there was something in his eyes that I did not like.</span> <span id="s503">So, I went around that shelter, and I ran, ran, ran, and I outran him.</span> <span id="s504">I have third -- third class medal in racing with eight other high schools from The Hague.</span> <span id="s505">And I have that someplace, too.</span> <span id="s506">So I -- I was good in -- in -- in track and field.</span> <span id="s507">I was team leader in my hockey team, and they were also all in the underground.</span> <span id="s508">But see, you don’t talk about that.</span> <span id="s509">In those days, you played hockey.</span> <span id="s510">And if a guy would ask you for a date, I would not accept, just to be on the safe side.</span> <span id="s511">I did date, though.</span> <span id="s512">I mean, I was not that -- you know.</span> <span id="s513">But it was amazing that the guys I liked were all killed.</span> <span id="s514">They -- they went over to Belgium, and France, over the mountains, the Pyrenee to France -- to -- to Spain, and they never reached England.</span> <span id="s515">And I found that out, too.</span> <span id="s516">But, you know, that -- that is the way things happen.</span> <span id="s517">I mean, I was careful, I could have been killed sev-several times.</span> <span id="s518">Th-There was a V -- V2 for instance, that is a kind of a small type of missile, two streets from my house.</span> <span id="s519">Now, you can imagine that you have that here.</span> <span id="s520">Some failed, went back where they came from.</span> <span id="s521">One shell landed in the roof of my house, right through my bedroom, and I was hiding under the bed, because I was told the mattress will put -- be your protection.</span> <span id="s522">So I crawl out, and there it is, big shell, right through the roof.</span> <span id="s523">So we could not repair that at the time, because there was nobody to do it.</span> <span id="s524">We had to move.</span> <span id="s525">The rain was just pouring through.</span> <span id="s526">Oh, and then the day that -- that we had the invasion, I was on vacation, and five o’clock in the morning -- I never forget that either -- a huge plane goes really diving in the street, between the trees, not even the tops of the trees, but half of the trees, over the street, and -- and -- and -- and bombing the -- the barracks that were on the end of that street.</span> <span id="s527">Now, they had horses.</span> <span id="s528">We all came out in pajamas and stuff.</span> <span id="s529">I saw horses heads, legs, tail.</span> <span id="s530">Soldiers without a head were still walking, in a daze, of course, and then they dropped.</span> <span id="s531">I-It was so terrible to look at it, I can never forget that.</span> <span id="s532">So that was five o’clock in the morning, and that was a holiday, like we have here.</span> <span id="s533">In -- in -- in -- in Europe, you called it Poppy day.</span> <span id="s534">We all walk with -- what is that, there is a red --</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Carnation?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No, it’s a red, big flower.</span> <span id="s537">Poppies.</span> <span id="s538">You had poppy fields in Great Britain, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Poppy?</span> <span id="s540">It’s a poppy?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: A poppy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: But there is another word for it, too.</span> <span id="s544">To remember the veterans.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s546">So, after the bombing that day, wh-what are some other memories that you have from the invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: That was the -- the actually visual experience, because in that time, I had my vacation for maybe four days.</span> <span id="s548">And you are not that stupid to go on the street and go back again, because the Germans took -- took care of that immediately.</span> <span id="s549">There was no chance.</span> <span id="s550">But you listened.</span> <span id="s551">You listened to neighbors, you listened to -- to the people that you are -- excuse me -- that you are playing hockey with.</span> <span id="s552">We had to stop that for awhile, because we were too sad.</span> <span id="s553">I mean, you are just not in the mood.</span> <span id="s554">I-It -- it is too -- it’s too -- too -- too emotional.</span> <span id="s555">Yeah.</span> <span id="s556">And of course, we had that -- what do you call that here?</span> <span id="s557">It’s funny, sometimes I -- I forget the word.</span> <span id="s558">I know exactly it is -- it is like this.</span> <span id="s559">A funinis.</span> <span id="s560">What is that in English?</span> <span id="s561">Isn’t that stupid?</span> <span id="s562">A cell, where you -- you -- you keep prisoners in.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: A cell.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: A cell, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s565">So that was close by also.</span> <span id="s566">And you [indecipherable] is at that, because that was still in good hands, so called.</span> <span id="s567">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Well, when -- after the bombing, di -- we -- did Germans appear on the street?</span> <span id="s569">Sort of taking charge on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Not -- not -- no, not yet, but it was the NSB, that was the -- the party that was what you call collaborating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s571">So they send signals, or they called, or whatever.</span> <span id="s572">This happened, that happened, and the Germans were very pleased, you know, that everything went the way that they hoped it would go.</span> <span id="s573">But the NSB was not, of course, believing that there was another party to watch them, and so they lost -- they lost casually, their people, too.</span> <span id="s574">And that was because we were very active.</span> <span id="s575">We didn’t get no for an answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: When you say you were on vacation, vacation from?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: That was a religious holiday, like --</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: -- Easter.</span> <span id="s580">In that time was Pingstrund.</span> <span id="s581">You don’t have that here.</span> <span id="s582">I never found out what it is here.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Okay, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: And then, on the bike, went back to the hospital.</span> <span id="s585">There was no bus.</span> <span id="s586">There was no train.</span> <span id="s587">Everything was on halt.</span> <span id="s588">So you used the bike.</span> <span id="s589">And that’s why I could not have the Germans to take my bike, that was it.</span> <span id="s590">And I told him that.</span> <span id="s591">That’s -- that’s my -- and of course, you think, well, can’t she just go for two hours without hindrance?</span> <span id="s592">Of course I was hindered, but in those days, a nurse was respected.</span> <span id="s593">You needed a nurse.</span> <span id="s594">I had an old aunt, and she was in -- in ho-house for old people.</span> <span id="s595">We went to visit her, to bring food.</span> <span id="s596">That is just the way you do it.</span> <span id="s597">You don’t let your friends die.</span> <span id="s598">You work the hell out of you.</span> <span id="s599">I worked day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: What was your mom doing at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: My mom was not strong.</span> <span id="s602">Physically, when she came from Indonesia, she was what you call -- she di -- didn’t have a particular illness, but I think that she was close to diabetes.</span> <span id="s603">She died at 83, and my father died when he was 94, but I have my father’s system.</span> <span id="s604">And so I don’t fear -- I mean, I don’t fear if I die, period, because that is a normal way, to accept the way things go, but I always wanted to be sure I don’t die in an accident, or that I don’t die because someone else wants my life.</span> <span id="s605">I j-just fight, you know?</span> <span id="s606">I’m -- I’m just that way.</span> <span id="s607">So maybe that is -- that is a kind of a vitamin.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: This is an interview with Louise Segaar, conducted by Katie Davis, on November, 10th, the year 2000, at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s610">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s611">When the invasion happened, you described the -- the bombing, and the dead animals, and the dead soldiers.</span> <span id="s612">How -- what happened next?</span> <span id="s613">When -- when was the next time you felt a presence of German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Gosh, you -- you meet them --</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: O-Or -- of the, as you said --</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yeah, you meet them.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Mm-hm, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: And as I said, I have no fear.</span> <span id="s619">They had the big mouth, but if you show that you have respect for them, then they are decent.</span> <span id="s620">I rather would meet German, than I would meet a Jap.</span> <span id="s621">A Jap is ne -- ne -- nasty.</span> <span id="s622">And a Jap is what you call you could not trust.</span> <span id="s623">They were more sadistic.</span> <span id="s624">A German is not sadistic.</span> <span id="s625">They do certain things because they feel that’s necessary to do.</span> <span id="s626">But they would not -- of course, in -- in -- in -- in a cell, they would torture.</span> <span id="s627">There’s several ways to do that, but they got that back.</span> <span id="s628">So they found that out.</span> <span id="s629">If you do that to me, you get the same thing back.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: How did you understand at that point what the Germans were trying to do in your country?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: They were trying to get the country, and get at -- to Germany, an annex, okay.</span> <span id="s632">Because of the fact that we were so obnoxious, and stubborn and far, far back, it was more difficult for them to apprehend -- they didn’t expect our resistance.</span> <span id="s633">So instead, they stole.</span> <span id="s634">That was their big thing.</span> <span id="s635">So, we did anything to get their -- not to steal.</span> <span id="s636">So we hide it.</span> <span id="s637">In the stores, no food.</span> <span id="s638">We had food, but they didn’t see it.</span> <span id="s639">We had restaurants.</span> <span id="s640">On the window, in German, “Deutsch nicht schwahan.”</span> <span id="s641">That means, German not spoken.</span> <span id="s642">So they could go the restaurant, they would not get coffee, they would ge -- not get a lunch.</span> <span id="s643">They would drop dead with us looking at them with pleasure.</span> <span id="s644">I saw once, one of those Germans on the floor, kicked down by a bunch of men.</span> <span id="s645">Now, he was literally pummeled against his head, on top of his chest.</span> <span id="s646">He could not survive.</span> <span id="s647">But that is the Dutch way.</span> <span id="s648">If you do that to me, you get 10 times worse.</span> <span id="s649">So that spreads around.</span> <span id="s650">The Germans did not do too much, what you call killing, because they got it back 10 times worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: You’re describing individual, sort of, acts of resistance --</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: -- that people.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s656">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Cause you see it.</span> <span id="s658">You have to see it if you -- if you want to eat, you have to go out of your house and shop.</span> <span id="s659">Oh, I tell you.</span> <span id="s660">I saw in -- in -- I was once that -- that -- that was another place that I was in the staff of a -- a house for older people, that was close to Arnhem, and of course, you -- you could not use the bike, you had to go with -- with the train.</span> <span id="s661">But I was always tempted, but of course, you had to be careful.</span> <span id="s662">They were kicking, on the station, little kids, big, big German guy, six foot, with boots, rifle.</span> <span id="s663">They would use their -- the butt of the rifle to kick it’s -- in -- in those cattle wagons, for the Jews.</span> <span id="s664">And oh, I tell you, my hands were itching to get on the back of that German, and scratch his eyes out.</span> <span id="s665">But, there were too many.</span> <span id="s666">So you got to be not stupid.</span> <span id="s667">Go back in the -- in the -- in the -- in the train, and go the way you have to go.</span> <span id="s668">But that is what I, after the war, told the Germans, “You are bastards.</span> <span id="s669">I have no respect for you for what you did.</span> <span id="s670">And don’t tell me it didn’t happen, either.”</span> <span id="s671">I was here a tour guide.</span> <span id="s672">I did a course, I was in the bus with the Germans in the front of the bus, and the Dutch in the back of the bus.</span> <span id="s673">So in Dutch, I told the Dutch, I said, “Hi, I speak Dutch.”</span> <span id="s674">The German said to me, “You speak German?”</span> <span id="s675">I ignored him.</span> <span id="s676">I looked over them.</span> <span id="s677">And that’s what I said in Dutch, to the people on the back, and they were clapping.</span> <span id="s678">Good luck, Louise, we listen to you.</span> <span id="s679">Don’t pay attention.</span> <span id="s680">Now that was in the American bus.</span> <span id="s681">I shorted them.</span> <span id="s682">That is my revenge, in a nice way.</span> <span id="s683">But I couldn’t help myself, I had to do it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Be-Because, before any of this happened, how did you feel about Germans?</span> <span id="s685">Way before Kristallnacht, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: As friends.</span> <span id="s687">As friends.</span> <span id="s688">I feel you have to be friends in -- in every way.</span> <span id="s689">As a Girl Scout, it is international, so you meet Swedish, you meet -- in those days, were no Russian, either, but I met from all countries, and I corresponded with every country.</span> <span id="s690">I had to correspond it in Korea, in -- in Thailand, cause I’m interested in how their culture is.</span> <span id="s691">I -- I -- I talked with Muslim, in the airport where I was working, I met a Muslim on his little carpet, in front of my door, I had to step over him.</span> <span id="s692">And I told him, how come that you have to pray five times a day, and how can you work?</span> <span id="s693">It doesn’t make sense to me, but that’s their religion.</span> <span id="s694">So I’m curious, and I’m joking.</span> <span id="s695">I always see something funny behind something that is not supposed to be funny.</span> <span id="s696">But that is the way it happened.</span> <span id="s697">I met Lord and Lady Bayton Powell.</span> <span id="s698">They were the founders of the girl boy -- th-the Boy Scouts, and they are British.</span> <span id="s699">So that was in Addelboaden, in Switzerland, when I was finished with high school, and my father treated me, he -- he paid for the trip.</span> <span id="s700">And I went with A-Ake Larous, that is Swiss and French Girl S -- Girl Scout, Girl Guides.</span> <span id="s701">Little kids 12 years old.</span> <span id="s702">Di di di di, di di di di, di di di di, in French, you know.</span> <span id="s703">And then you was put in little pup tents, like the military, but you could not put your finger against th-the -- the cloth, because the rain -- and it was always raining, would make drips, you know, it would drip.</span> <span id="s704">So, of course, they did that, to find out it if that was true.</span> <span id="s705">And then I was -- I always had a fear for heights, so I went always like a dog, over the mountain -- the Mont Blan, for instance.</span> <span id="s706">I went on my fours, and they were always laughing at me.</span> <span id="s707">There goes doggie Lukie.</span> <span id="s708">But you learn.</span> <span id="s709">And the Alps were beautiful.</span> <span id="s710">It was nothing -- and it was always fog, because it is high.</span> <span id="s711">So you had always clouds around, and I al-al-al-always wanted to grab in the cloud, to see if my -- my hand would be wet.</span> <span id="s712">So you can tell I had crazy ideas.</span> <span id="s713">But we -- we had lots of fun.</span> <span id="s714">Oh boy, did we have fun, and the food was delicious.</span> <span id="s715">It was Swiss food.</span> <span id="s716">But there was no German.</span> <span id="s717">They were not allowed.</span> <span id="s718">So, in those days, ‘33 - ‘34 - ‘35 - ‘36 - ’37, you could feel the whole atmosphere, wherever you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s720">A-And situate us in 1940, when the invasion happens.</span> <span id="s721">How old were you, and what are you doing?</span> <span id="s722">You have said a couple times that you are already working in a hospital, but what is your status?</span> <span id="s723">Are you still being educated?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Okay, just -- if you could situate us.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: I was a student.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: See, I’m born in 1920, so in 1940, I happen to be 20, and then gradually -- it never happens at once, it goes gradually, so you hardly notice it until you wake up and think, uh-uh, there is something bad.</span> <span id="s729">And you get curious in a way, because that’s what I s -- also told those Germans, I -- I always like to know what is the reason you think a certain way?</span> <span id="s730">Now, I always wanted to be a student in psychiatrist, or whatever, but I’m -- I’m always intrigued to find out what makes you do the things what you do?</span> <span id="s731">And don’t you have any regret?</span> <span id="s732">Do you have a conscience?</span> <span id="s733">What do you expect after this, from what you do?</span> <span id="s734">I had free talks with them.</span> <span id="s735">So I never had been arrested, or told you go with me.</span> <span id="s736">They left me like I had some strange aurea, or angel like thing around me, because I was too strong for them.</span> <span id="s737">And all -- I always had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: You said you’d have free conversations.</span> <span id="s739">How would those come about, usually?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: I cannot remember really.</span> <span id="s741">The main thing was that they were my age.</span> <span id="s742">They were just also students, in whatever field.</span> <span id="s743">Very pleasant, very decent, very polite.</span> <span id="s744">I spoke Berlinner German, that is what they told me, I don’t know, but I mean that’s, you know, like perfect.</span> <span id="s745">Like Oxford English.</span> <span id="s746">That’s what I learned, Oxford English, because the teacher came from Oxford.</span> <span id="s747">So he talked like that, too.</span> <span id="s748">And the French was like Parisian French.</span> <span id="s749">So you go to Paris, I have been in Paris, and they don’t understand you.</span> <span id="s750">That’s the funny part.</span> <span id="s751">Par-Pardon moi?</span> <span id="s752">Pardon moi?</span> <span id="s753">They say in French.</span> <span id="s754">What do I say funny, is that Russian?</span> <span id="s755">So then they turned around like I’m an idiot.</span> <span id="s756">But that was the way it goes, and then we talked mostly about things that happen in that time.</span> <span id="s757">So about what you eat.</span> <span id="s758">In those days, the word sex never came up.</span> <span id="s759">That is what I thought later, that is funny.</span> <span id="s760">In this country it’s nothing but sex.</span> <span id="s761">Every day you hear about that, or you see it on TV.</span> <span id="s762">Over there you had no time to think about that, because there was no way, if the boys are hiding, the men are in offices, where do you get that stuff?</span> <span id="s763">And obviously, the Dutch are not lesbian.</span> <span id="s764">No way.</span> <span id="s765">So, I mean, that is how you talked about, mostly.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: So, do you remember any of the names of these young men?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s768">We didn’t exchange names.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: And where might -- what’s the one example of where you might meet them?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Was no sense to do it.</span> <span id="s771">No, no, it was not what you call -- what is that word?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: An appointment?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s774">It was spontaneous.</span> <span id="s775">You meet a person, as a group, group girls, group boys, and that can be on -- on the beach, or it can be in a museum, it can be, I mean, wherever you -- you -- you meet, and wherever a person wants to talk.</span> <span id="s776">Because this is not always that you get luck.</span> <span id="s777">They -- they sometimes just walk away from you, because a German in Holland, after all, was very weird.</span> <span id="s778">What does a German do in the war time -- that is an enemy.</span> <span id="s779">So you don’t speak with enemies.</span> <span id="s780">But I mean, and you -- you had the -- l-like I said before, you had Germans, and they -- they were shot at themselves.</span> <span id="s781">So they were eager to talk with us, so that we could feel that they were not enemies, but wi -- they were forced to be an enemy.</span> <span id="s782">That -- that was the fascination that I always felt.</span> <span id="s783">So I always said, “Well, after the war, you’re still my friend.”</span> <span id="s784">But see then, an NSB-er would not approve that.</span> <span id="s785">So you had to be careful in that group, that you was not with an NSB-er.</span> <span id="s786">As a matter of fact, when -- when we were as Girl Scouts in the woods, and we -- we listened letzer ramaphone in Dutch is it -- where you play --</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: A record player.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: A record player, okay.</span> <span id="s789">We had the record player, with Irish dances, Scottish dances, and we -- we were just doing that as a pleasure, as -- as a meeting on the -- that you -- that you learn something.</span> <span id="s790">But then, one day, there was a group of those NSB girls.</span> <span id="s791">Of course, they were aggressive, and said to us, “You are not supposed to listen to that.”</span> <span id="s792">So we said to them, “Who tells you to say that we are not listening?</span> <span id="s793">We are if we want to.”</span> <span id="s794">So then they started to fight.</span> <span id="s795">And I still remember I had a girl with a hand on her hair, I twisted her hair -- I still have a whole bunch of that -- and -- and poked her on the floor, and hit her, and kicked her, and they found out that we were not sissies.</span> <span id="s796">So they -- they disappeared in the woods, hollering, yelling.</span> <span id="s797">And we still listened to the music, and we still were dancing.</span> <span id="s798">Can you believe that you have that here?</span> <span id="s799">Oh yeah, w-we -- I learned a lot, and I had not even studied karate yet.</span> <span id="s800">I did that here, just for the heck of it.</span> <span id="s801">But our fists -- I learned if you have a lot of rings, you can do more damage than there -- no rings, so we had always rings on.</span> <span id="s802">Well that’s -- that’s a certain weapon that the Germans used, to club you down.</span> <span id="s803">They had the -- the metal thing, you know?</span> <span id="s804">Cruel, but so what.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: When you were speaking with them, do you ever remember -- h-how do you -- how did you feel?</span> <span id="s806">Do you ever remember feeling afraid, when -- you know, this guy has a lot of power, he could arrest me if he felt like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Well, that’s what I say, I had no fear.</span> <span id="s808">And they were not that type.</span> <span id="s809">They were s -- just regular soldier boys from farms, or nice families.</span> <span id="s810">They were decent.</span> <span id="s811">So you -- you -- you -- you could say anything you want, because they would not do it.</span> <span id="s812">And that’s what I felt with them.</span> <span id="s813">They have no intention, because they rather talk with us, than their own creeps who were so fanatic.</span> <span id="s814">Kill, kill, kill.</span> <span id="s815">They were not that way.</span> <span id="s816">Otherwise, they would not be on the beach, period.</span> <span id="s817">But they had to be away from all the nasty stuff that they got back in their barracks.</span> <span id="s818">See?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: S-So did meeting some of these boys change your mind at all about the Germans?</span> <span id="s820">Make them in a way more human?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: No.</span> <span id="s822">No, no.</span> <span id="s823">I told them from the beginning, if they ask me for a date -- now, you have to understand, you have that uniform.</span> <span id="s824">If I get caught in that uniform, I know what to expect.</span> <span id="s825">So please, don’t pretend I’m stupid.</span> <span id="s826">And then they left.</span> <span id="s827">They say, “You are right.”</span> <span id="s828">But if I was forced, they would not have had me alive, because I am not being forced to do what I don’t want to do.</span> <span id="s829">See, that boy that we had in the house was forced.</span> <span id="s830">We had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Tell us aboo -- a bit about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: He -- he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: How -- when did he come?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: -- blonde, he was young.</span> <span id="s835">I think he was 22.</span> <span id="s836">He had a farm close to Hambush, and if he was only -- if he alwa -- always came back with something.</span> <span id="s837">Butter, eggs, whatever.</span> <span id="s838">And my father was, of course, mad.</span> <span id="s839">He didn’t want to accept it.</span> <span id="s840">I says to my father, “Don’t be a stupid, that is eating stuff.</span> <span id="s841">Who cares where it comes from?”</span> <span id="s842">But, he had always girlfriends -- of course, in that age, it’s understandable, who wanted to talk with him.</span> <span id="s843">So my father would say either he was not home, or my father would not understand the person that called.</span> <span id="s844">He ha -- said it is the wrong number.</span> <span id="s845">I had once a girl in front of the house, and I stood opposite her, I said, “Do you like to fight with me?”</span> <span id="s846">So she understood that I was not a doozie, either.</span> <span id="s847">So he didn’t have girls coming to the house, we warned him.</span> <span id="s848">Don’t even attempt.</span> <span id="s849">You are just tolerated.</span> <span id="s850">And you will be happy that you still living, because we could have cut your head off, put it under the house.</span> <span id="s851">Who was to find that out?</span> <span id="s852">You could have been hit on the way to the barracks.</span> <span id="s853">There is no proof.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: No.</span> <span id="s856">Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: S-So how did he show up one day?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Well, the army sent him.</span> <span id="s859">See, everybody had to have a soldier, because there were not enough barracks.</span> <span id="s860">And maybe it was to spy.</span> <span id="s861">To see what kind of family he would live with.</span> <span id="s862">So, you know, you’re not stupid.</span> <span id="s863">If you have an enemy in your house, you are very careful.</span> <span id="s864">So I don't know if my father was listening to the BBC.</span> <span id="s865">In the meantime he left, because of course, they have to work, they o -- they don’t sit in -- in a small room, six by six like a prison, and do nothing.</span> <span id="s866">It’s a 22 year old, full of pep, and -- and -- and likes to do all kind of physical stuff.</span> <span id="s867">But, I mean, you just had to tolerate.</span> <span id="s868">And he -- he would come any time of the day, what pleased him, and you had to tolerate that.</span> <span id="s869">Now, our house w -- most houses in -- in Holland, has a stairway.</span> <span id="s870">So you -- you -- you have the living room, and then you go upstairs to the -- to -- to the bedrooms, that’s the way it -- it -- it is all built there.</span> <span id="s871">So, we didn’t have to meet him, if he stayed in his room, and we stayed downstairs, there was no way, you know, unless he wanted to talk.</span> <span id="s872">But he -- he was, of course told by his superiors, don’t ming -- don’t mix.</span> <span id="s873">Strictly observe.</span> <span id="s874">That -- that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Did he ever eat with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: No.</span> <span id="s877">No, he ate in the barracks.</span> <span id="s878">The only way that he was with us, was to sleep, yeah.</span> <span id="s879">He -- he was showed souvenirs of stuff.</span> <span id="s880">I said, I’m sorry, don’t want it.</span> <span id="s881">He asked me out, I said no.</span> <span id="s882">Just like that.</span> <span id="s883">But he understood that.</span> <span id="s884">He was a very nice boy.</span> <span id="s885">I wish I could have dated him then.</span> <span id="s886">Oh.</span> <span id="s887">But you got to resist it.</span> <span id="s888">I had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: So he was an attractive young man?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: Oh, very.</span> <span id="s893">Germans are a very attractive -- no, really.</span> <span id="s894">They have the -- the type of jaw.</span> <span id="s895">They ha -- blonde hair.</span> <span id="s896">They have that smile full with white teeth.</span> <span id="s897">I mean, I’m -- I’m not, you know, what do you call it -- maybe I’m a -- a witch, but I have my emotions, I have my feelings, and I’m always in love.</span> <span id="s898">I’m in love with everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: That’s really interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: But don’t -- don’t tell me you cannot do this, because then I say, “Aha, you watch.</span> <span id="s901">I do it.”</span> <span id="s902">And I make it that I do it.</span> <span id="s903">And that’s the only reason that I’m still living, probably, because they thought she -- she has something about her, you better not fool around with her.</span> <span id="s904">I had an -- in my karate school, a guy -- now, at the time I was 65, I was the oldest of that -- in -- in Foster’s High School.</span> <span id="s905">I made a side back kick.</span> <span id="s906">He could not come back in two weeks.</span> <span id="s907">My teacher told me that.</span> <span id="s908">I said, “But I didn’t know that,” because you’re not supposed to look, you just kick whatever you can kick.</span> <span id="s909">And if he was in my way, tough with him.</span> <span id="s910">But I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s911">So, you know, you use your elbow.</span> <span id="s912">How?</span> <span id="s913">You use your hands for taking this thing, so that you have no -- no breath.</span> <span id="s914">You learn those things.</span> <span id="s915">We had a -- a survival course in the Netherlands, with -- with the Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s916">And boy, did I work that out beautiful.</span> <span id="s917">Because you practiced on each other.</span> <span id="s918">Now, if you -- if you went too far, you would hear something.</span> <span id="s919">The teacher would then say, “Oh, you good.</span> <span id="s920">Y-You -- you -- you graduate.”</span> <span id="s921">If that’s the word.</span> <span id="s922">So, I mean, that’s why my grip is still so firm.</span> <span id="s923">If I have a hand, they say, “Gosh, are you 80?”</span> <span id="s924">They didn’t believe that.</span> <span id="s925">Because that is still in you.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Did you ever feel that any of your talks, or relationships, which sounded pretty specific, but did they ever -- did any of them kind of get out of hand, and you b -- start to like someone too much?</span> <span id="s927">Whether it was a -- a -- a young man, or even someone older, but -- but somebody who was supposed to be the enemy --</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: -- but that you perhaps started really liking them too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s931">You didn’t go that far.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s934">No, no.</span> <span id="s935">You did not make yourself emotional.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: If that person was nice, that was it, the end of the story.</span> <span id="s938">It was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s939">Can you believe he was involved?</span> <span id="s940">Then -- then your -- your mind is different.</span> <span id="s941">That’s -- that’s the whole thing.</span> <span id="s942">You -- you can be very strong, in a certain way, but you got to keep that path.</span> <span id="s943">Because, if you go another way, you are lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: But how did you know that?</span> <span id="s945">I mean, how did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Instinct.</span> <span id="s947">Survival instinct, I think.</span> <span id="s948">Because I have been very sexy looking.</span> <span id="s949">And I have been approached many, many, many times.</span> <span id="s950">In -- in that -- oh, I forgot the train, that was another moment, di -- da -- I was looking in, a-and -- out of the window, and this soldier comes with his hands beside my cheek, against the window, and tried to kiss me.</span> <span id="s951">In those days you had those shoes with high heels, like a pin.</span> <span id="s952">So I go very slowly down, while he was still trying to get my cheek, and I took my shoe, and I whacked him against his you know what, banana.</span> <span id="s953">So he went backwards on his back, and was yelling, “Ow, ow, ow,” because I hit the right spot.</span> <span id="s954">And in the meantime, I went da da da da, dat da, dat da, to the other section of the train where were passengers.</span> <span id="s955">So he was finished yelling bloody murder, and then he went also in that, to find me.</span> <span id="s956">But he has never seen my face.</span> <span id="s957">So I sat there between people, looking around like what?</span> <span id="s958">Who?</span> <span id="s959">Me?</span> <span id="s960">Don’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s961">So he -- he looked at me, but he didn’t know that was me.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: And you kept a straight face?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s964">You cannot give yourself away.</span> <span id="s965">But I -- when he left, I laughed my head off.</span> <span id="s966">I laughed that the next two passenger looked at me like I was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s967">Then I told that person.</span> <span id="s968">He said, “You dared to do that?”</span> <span id="s969">That’s all I heard, “You dared to do that?”</span> <span id="s970">I said, “I dare, if I have to.”</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Well, a question I have for you is why -- why do you think you dared, or some -- many people dared, but many people did not -- didn’t -- why do you thi --</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Well, not everybody’s strong.</span> <span id="s973">See, if you have a strong mind, it is -- it has to do with la -- religion, and my family has a strong -- we have P-Presbyterian, and -- and you cannot tell me you want to become a Jew, or you want to be -- that is just not the way.</span> <span id="s974">You have to believe first.</span> <span id="s975">And if right is right, and wrong is wrong, that’s just it.</span> <span id="s976">You don’t ask questions, you live with that.</span> <span id="s977">And that’s why my f -- my father’s family was also very strong, and were with this religion, or whatev -- but we stuck to that, and it gives you inner strength.</span> <span id="s978">And I have never had fear.</span> <span id="s979">I tell you, I have no fear for biting dogs.</span> <span id="s980">I had once -- I was nine years old, and my father visited a friend, and he had a dog in a -- in a -- in a cage, and in Dutch, beware of dog.</span> <span id="s981">So, my father was there, and I looked around, right inside.</span> <span id="s982">And the dog was not doing anything.</span> <span id="s983">So I was there, my arms around the dog’s head, and I kissed the dog.</span> <span id="s984">I was so -- so happy with that dog.</span> <span id="s985">So my father was finished, he look for me, and the owner of the dog got a fit.</span> <span id="s986">He said to me, “Don’t you read that sign?”</span> <span id="s987">I said, “Yeah, I read it.</span> <span id="s988">So what?”</span> <span id="s989">Your -- I was nine years old, already so -- and the dog did nothing, absolute nothing.</span> <span id="s990">So my father said to that man -- maybe it was my father’s friend, he said, “Don’t make such a fuss about it.</span> <span id="s991">She is good with him.</span> <span id="s992">She is -- she is always good with animals.”</span> <span id="s993">And I had once a dog that attacked me, and I had my fist -- now, you always have your thumb inside, not outside, but inside, and I put my fist in his mouth.</span> <span id="s994">Not, then the teeth cannot reach each other, so he was stuck.</span> <span id="s995">And then I grabbed him with the back, and I lifted him up, I said, “Don’t try it again, buddy.”</span> <span id="s996">So I took my hand out.</span> <span id="s997">Boy, did he go fast.</span> <span id="s998">He was scared.</span> <span id="s999">Because I did that, nobody else had done it.</span> <span id="s1000">So that -- that is the way I am.</span> <span id="s1001">If -- if you -- if you make me scared, I’ll let you know I am not scared, for whatever reason you tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Louise Segaar, it’s November 10th, in the year 2000.</span> <span id="s1004">We’re at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s1005">I -- I’m -- maybe I’m backtracking a little bit, but I wonder if you can tell me a little bit more about the role faith did play in your family, h -- when you were growing up, when you were younger, how did you learn about it from your mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Attitude.</span> <span id="s1007">If they -- if they tell us not to do certain bad things, you listen.</span> <span id="s1008">And their example is a fact.</span> <span id="s1009">If -- if you beat a person, you know it’s bad, but there must be a reason for doing that.</span> <span id="s1010">So why would you do it in the first place, unless you are provoked, or attacked, or whatever reason.</span> <span id="s1011">But that’s the only way you are allowed to do that, because the Bible says, love thy neighbor.</span> <span id="s1012">It’s so simple.</span> <span id="s1013">But people don’t follow that up.</span> <span id="s1014">And that’s why you get all that mess in the world.</span> <span id="s1015">Why -- why would I be mad at the Chinese person, because the Chinese government is doing this and that and that?</span> <span id="s1016">That poor Chinese person doesn’t know a thing about the government, and the government tells that person, you shall only have one child, you shall only have two childs -- children.</span> <span id="s1017">For what?</span> <span id="s1018">Because the government is influencing.</span> <span id="s1019">And I had the -- the Indonesian government, I had the Dutch government, I had the German government.</span> <span id="s1020">Nobody tells me what I can or cannot do, if they don’t set their own sample.</span> <span id="s1021">I never go to church, either.</span> <span id="s1022">I have been to church.</span> <span id="s1023">One time I had a lady, her dress was way here so that you could see her things.</span> <span id="s1024">Big hat with animal skin type of thing.</span> <span id="s1025">Then my minister, he went around his wife’s back fooling around.</span> <span id="s1026">So when I was working in National airport, he comes one day to my desk.</span> <span id="s1027">“Louise, do you remember me?”</span> <span id="s1028">I says, “Yeah, I do.”</span> <span id="s1029">He says, “You know what happened?”</span> <span id="s1030">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1031">He said, “My -- my oldest boy got a car accident and died.”</span> <span id="s1032">So I grabbed his hand, I said, “Is that punishment what you did to your wife is now back to your son?”</span> <span id="s1033">And he looked at me like, “Did you know what I did then?”</span> <span id="s1034">I said, “Yeah, I know everything,” I said, “but keep mouth shut.”</span> <span id="s1035">He was very impressed.</span> <span id="s1036">Ha-Ha-Had a gorgeous wife, Barbara.</span> <span id="s1037">So, no -- nobody is perfect, but you cannot feel superior either, because you don’t have the right to be.</span> <span id="s1038">But if a person is suppressed, I fight for that person.</span> <span id="s1039">And I don’t have to ask anybody permission.</span> <span id="s1040">If -- if you get hit on the -- on the street, I help.</span> <span id="s1041">I go out, and -- and get myself the dirty, with blood, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1042">You feel that it’s necessary, unless someone else is stabbing you back, and say, “She killed him.”</span> <span id="s1043">Then I fight.</span> <span id="s1044">Because that happens a lot in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: You said if s -- if someone’s sup-suppressed, what was your sense of what was happening to Jews at that point, once the Germans moved in?</span> <span id="s1046">I mean, where -- what did you think was happening to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: They were warned.</span> <span id="s1048">They were already told by the BBC that that would happen.</span> <span id="s1049">Now, you can believe it, or you can say baloney.</span> <span id="s1050">But if things happen, then you don’t think any more that is baloney.</span> <span id="s1051">It happened.</span> <span id="s1052">And then you start to be careful, and you take measurements.</span> <span id="s1053">You don’t sit back and wait, you act.</span> <span id="s1054">And that is why, as a Girl Scout, the motto is, be prepared.</span> <span id="s1055">That helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s1056">As a nurse, you always -- you always protect the lesser -- sick minds, or sick body, or whatever, because you are the one is nursing that person.</span> <span id="s1057">And you cannot turn your back to that.</span> <span id="s1058">It’s your duty to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Can you remember back to your first contact with the organized Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: The organized Resistance was already, the Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s1061">Because the leader of my troop was connected with the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1062">Now that’s international.</span> <span id="s1063">So they get information.</span> <span id="s1064">In those days you had no facts, you had no -- there’s no -- [indecipherable] goes with codes, by telephone.</span> <span id="s1065">We -- we had, for instance, the alphabet in codes.</span> <span id="s1066">If -- if -- if you sign, I -- you can sign with lights, blink, blink, blink.</span> <span id="s1067">You can sign by sound, dit, dit dit dit, dit dit dit dit dit.</span> <span id="s1068">We learned that, see?</span> <span id="s1069">With arm signals.</span> <span id="s1070">I -- I used to be on a tree, I had the flag, I waved the flag, I would make signals to another part of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: As a girl -- as a Girl Scout?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: As a Girl Scout.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: But then later as a Resistance person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: As a Resistance -- you didn’t need to use that -- tha -- this -- this was playing, you know?</span> <span id="s1075">To learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: But there you used other ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Oh, I understand, okay.</span> <span id="s1079">So it introduced you to the idea --</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: -- of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1083">But that was all with the Girl Scouts, and I started that when I was 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: I started the hockey team when I was 11.</span> <span id="s1086">It is a part of an educational program.</span> <span id="s1087">You can play soccer, what I did, too.</span> <span id="s1088">I s -- I told you I was wild.</span> <span id="s1089">I did everything what a normal girl would not do.</span> <span id="s1090">But I had that energy.</span> <span id="s1091">I -- I had to get away with that, because I was bursting from energy.</span> <span id="s1092">And if I didn’t beat my brother up, th -- I beat up something else.</span> <span id="s1093">But th-that was to make -- just -- just to relieve yourself, perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: So you’re saying that -- that -- tell -- tell me a little bit more about how the structure of the Girls Scouts, and the sports teams was sort of used.</span> <span id="s1095">Not -- not necessarily exactly the way it was, but how was it used by the people who eventually ended up helping so many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Well, it -- it was a kind of conscience that you had.</span> <span id="s1097">A -- a -- an -- a Boy Scout, and a Girl Scout is prepared.</span> <span id="s1098">Your conscience says, if something goes wrong, you -- you -- you find a way to correct it.</span> <span id="s1099">So, it is bettering yourself.</span> <span id="s1100">We -- we had all those mottoes, we -- we were like a few minutes in -- in prayer.</span> <span id="s1101">That is up to you, to the person to do that.</span> <span id="s1102">You was not forced to do that, but that was just a way of -- of -- of what happened with the -- with the scouting movement.</span> <span id="s1103">So, I mean, it -- it was normal, it was not particular odd thing, it was just the way it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: I’m -- I’m just trying to imagine it though, so you’re organized in the Girl Scouts, or y-you kind of inclined to be organized this way.</span> <span id="s1105">When is the first time where -- or a first time that someone says to you, I want you to do this, this, and this, and you will be helping because of that -- like, how is it explained to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Okay, it was in a way that you had a choice.</span> <span id="s1107">It was not like the Nazis did, you had to.</span> <span id="s1108">You could do it.</span> <span id="s1109">Lots of things we did to get a badge, for instance.</span> <span id="s1110">You get a swimming badge, you get this badge, you get that badge, oh, my arm was full of badges.</span> <span id="s1111">So that is a kind of giving a bone to a dog that does a trick.</span> <span id="s1112">That’s the way I feel it.</span> <span id="s1113">But the leader was very good in that, because she was, as a Red Cross person, aware that not everybody was capable.</span> <span id="s1114">You -- you have people, they are not strong, you have people they are playing a coward, doesn’t admit it.</span> <span id="s1115">But that’s the way they are.</span> <span id="s1116">It’s just their family structure is, or whatever experience they had in life.</span> <span id="s1117">And you feel well, don’t worry about that person, that is just weak, you go on with a stronger person.</span> <span id="s1118">And that’s what I think happened.</span> <span id="s1119">I didn’t have to do it.</span> <span id="s1120">I could turn my back, and not even talk about it, go home and -- and read a book.</span> <span id="s1121">But then I would sit there with a book like they are doing things that I don’t ha -- do, and I will do it.</span> <span id="s1122">So, you put your book away, and go and say, “I’m here, I’m ready.”</span> <span id="s1123">Whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: So, it was this woman, who was the leader --</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: -- with the re-Red Cross connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: I still have her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Oh you do?</span> <span id="s1129">What is her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1131">We called her Rita.</span> <span id="s1132">Now the first is -- the title is haupfrau, that is for you a strange, but that’s leaders name, and Rita Burgenberra-Fonde -- Fondeyong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Say it one more time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Burgenberra-Fondeyong.</span> <span id="s1135">That is typical Dutch.</span> <span id="s1136">You would not be -- understand.</span> <span id="s1137">I think I have here pictures with Girl Scouts that I still have her on it.</span> <span id="s1138">Let me see.</span> <span id="s1139">This is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1140">Why don’t you look at it?</span> <span id="s1141">[indecipherable] are trying to open it, so all -- all with the escape to Canada.</span> <span id="s1142">And this is Prince Banhurt, how he looks now.</span> <span id="s1143">Let me see.</span> <span id="s1144">Oh, here it is.</span> <span id="s1145">This is her, and this is a Jewish girl, that’s Hedda.</span> <span id="s1146">And that’s the family that lived opposite us, our -- our house, Hedda Ricardo.</span> <span id="s1147">And I asked the Red Cross if she still was living.</span> <span id="s1148">I have other people that I wanted to know, but they have never answered me.</span> <span id="s1149">I have here all the names of this bunch, this -- this the nurses.</span> <span id="s1150">See, I was here, and that was the children’s -- there was no Jewish person in there, but I wan -- and this -- this is me in Indonesia.</span> <span id="s1151">Isn’t that cute?</span> <span id="s1152">And this is my mother with me.</span> <span id="s1153">This is my mother, my grandmother, and my mother-in-law, at the day that I got married.</span> <span id="s1154">See, I got married by proxy, because my husband was already in Indonesia with the KLM.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: And this -- this is then the oldest son with my parents.</span> <span id="s1157">And he is from a Jewish -- a Palestinian soldier.</span> <span id="s1158">So he looks Jewish.</span> <span id="s1159">But I have never heard from him, he just denied the fact that we had ever a relationship, so what can you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: The son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: No, the father of my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: The father, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: The father of my son.</span> <span id="s1164">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1165">And this was my father-in-law.</span> <span id="s1166">Now, he was in a Jap camp, and he had [indecipherable] with his wrists wrapped with bamboo wrapping, and then the branch of a tree, and his legs just above the ground.</span> <span id="s1167">So he couldn’t touch the ground, and that was done for hours.</span> <span id="s1168">And when he came back to the Netherlands, he was a wreck.</span> <span id="s1169">He had no -- no nerves any more, everything was like this, and we were constantly told, you are too noisy, too noisy, too noisy.</span> <span id="s1170">He -- he was absolute ruined.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Did he ever recover more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: No, no, he died the same way.</span> <span id="s1173">You -- th-there is nothing you can do about it.</span> <span id="s1174">This is my daughter-in-law when -- when she married my son.</span> <span id="s1175">And we click like sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: She’s beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1178">And this is the KLM.</span> <span id="s1179">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1180">And there’s my hockey team.</span> <span id="s1181">And here the Brownies.</span> <span id="s1182">And this is where you get your wooden shoes made.</span> <span id="s1183">And you see, all nurse’s stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: S -- do you remember what the first thing she asked you, or you decided to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: No.</span> <span id="s1186">I have not the slightest idea, because so many things happened, and -- and that time is better not to write things down, because you never now who would find it.</span> <span id="s1187">And my uncle, as I told you, was betrayed because he had said too much, so he was picked up at five in the morning, and go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1188">What -- I didn’t know at that time, I found it out when I was on vacation.</span> <span id="s1189">And the Red Cross, after the war, gave my mother the possessions, like a pocketbook, or something, notebook, that was with his name on it.</span> <span id="s1190">So everybody was crying, and I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1191">It was just such a shock, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: If y -- if y -- if you don’t remember a specific one, if you could just remember generally what it would be like, h-how would you -- how -- how would you communicate with your leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: On the meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1195">So when did you go to the meetings, what did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Well, any time that you could do it.</span> <span id="s1197">Officially, see, in -- in the Netherlands, your school is also on Saturday, until about one o’clock, and then you go to -- to this -- to the meeting.</span> <span id="s1198">And we had off on Wednesday afternoons, so whatever time you had -- of course, as a nurse, I was in another city anyway, but then you would contact people connected with the same scouting organization, in that’s -- particular spot.</span> <span id="s1199">But as a nurse, as I told you, I had two -- two shi-shifts, in those days the bombs were ru-running around like crazy, so I had no time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: I-I-In -- if you could just give me some examples of kinds of things that you did.</span> <span id="s1201">I mean, you’ve been doing that all along --</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: -- but -- through the interview, but if -- if you could --</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Well, I remember that I had a bunch of Jewish kids, and we -- we spent time to get their star off of their costume, and then we told the kids what would happen to them.</span> <span id="s1205">And we would contact the parents of those kids, and they would approve.</span> <span id="s1206">And we -- we gave them food, as I said, we -- we saved the coupons, and we would feed them.</span> <span id="s1207">We would find homes where they could stay without that someone would be betrayed.</span> <span id="s1208">So, it is a matter of making connections, and stick to those connections that you could trust.</span> <span id="s1209">And if -- if one -- one child was then already under way to Great Britain, you would get another child instead.</span> <span id="s1210">So it -- it was a matter of -- of planning, and timing, because one had to do this first, in order to do that.</span> <span id="s1211">And it -- it was communication, and if you would hear something that was different, you would say that.</span> <span id="s1212">I mean, if would be something being fouled up, because something happened unpredictable that -- that you didn’t count on that would happen.</span> <span id="s1213">That was your duty too, that you would say that, immediately, so that that person could change quick things around, but that -- that child would be still safe, see?</span> <span id="s1214">So, i-it was, in a way, working together, absolute like sisters, that you could trust any person, without any hesitation.</span> <span id="s1215">And if I would have found a person -- this -- this is for instance, my -- my uncle’s death notice, then you would report that, and that person would get some -- I don’t know what treatment, but they were kicked out.</span> <span id="s1216">Because that person would be dangerous.</span> <span id="s1217">But see, you had to watch everything.</span> <span id="s1218">Any -- any suspicious action, word -- action, or thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: So you might be taking a child from where to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: To England.</span> <span id="s1221">That was the only way.</span> <span id="s1222">England was the place where they would be, and then the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Where was the child, though, when you got it -- at -- at a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: In a house in Great Britain.</span> <span id="s1225">And underway with a person that would lead them underground.</span> <span id="s1226">They were usually men, young men.</span> <span id="s1227">And they spoke French and Spanish, that was a must.</span> <span id="s1228">So, I have never found out how that happened, because I was not told, see?</span> <span id="s1229">But I knew that they would reach their goal, because then from the BBC, you would hear that certain families had arrived safely.</span> <span id="s1230">And then you would say ahhhhh, like that, you know?</span> <span id="s1231">You would be so happy, because you -- you did something, that was accomplished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: S-So you’ve actually been listen -- you were listening to the radio, and you heard the name, a family name, of someone that you helped?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1234">And then that -- that particular family was still in Holland.</span> <span id="s1235">So they got their turn to go, and meet their kids there.</span> <span id="s1236">It was very, very -- how shall I put that?</span> <span id="s1237">It -- it was something that you didn’t hesitate to do it.</span> <span id="s1238">It -- it was something like sleeping, and eating, and drinking.</span> <span id="s1239">And if you had to work, okay, that was the first thing.</span> <span id="s1240">I mean, as a nurse, I had to do that, what -- what the hospital told me to do.</span> <span id="s1241">But in your spare time, you did things like that.</span> <span id="s1242">You had no time to -- to play Monopoly, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1243">It -- it was just to save as many lives as you could do that.</span> <span id="s1244">And you didn’t ask any thanks in w -- in -- in return.</span> <span id="s1245">I cannot remember faces, I cannot remember names.</span> <span id="s1246">I got this little round thing to -- to thank, so what, you know?</span> <span id="s1247">You have the inner satisfaction, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1248">I can live with it for the rest of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: How long did this go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Until the war was finished.</span> <span id="s1251">When we were liberated, they were still shooting.</span> <span id="s1252">I remember I was meeting a tank, I planned to get on it, what I never could do, because it’s o-overloaded with people.</span> <span id="s1253">But left or right, th-the Germans were still shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: How -- how -- describe if you can how you used your job as a nurse, sometimes, apparently --</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: You just did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: How did you do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Well, you -- you get assigned certain ward, a certain patient.</span> <span id="s1258">That -- that was just that the hospital works with.</span> <span id="s1259">And I have my memory with a guy that tried to get his hand under my skirt.</span> <span id="s1260">And I had a water pitcher to fill out his -- his glass, instead of the glass, he got it.</span> <span id="s1261">So he was soaked wet, and I said to him, “You’d ha -- keep your mouth shut, cause that’s what you deserve.”</span> <span id="s1262">So he was drenched, and then the -- the -- if I was a night nurse, the morning nurse would have find out naughty, naughty, naughty, but he didn’t have the nerve to tell her that I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: But you might get assigned a -- someone at the hospital, and would you eventually maybe help that person hide, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: This -- this -- this is the ward, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: So you was assigned to a ward for children, or you was assigned to a ward with men.</span> <span id="s1267">No, to be honest with you, I was 18, I think I was -- 19.</span> <span id="s1268">I had never had a man nude.</span> <span id="s1269">So you are put in a ward with nothing but nude, embarrassed guys.</span> <span id="s1270">One had the banana like this, one had like a peanut, one had nothing.</span> <span id="s1271">You know, and they feel bad about me, because I was a 19 year old, fresh kid that is supposed to touch the guy, and wash it.</span> <span id="s1272">So, I mean, I learned with a big shock, like oh my God, what did I do now, you know?</span> <span id="s1273">But you -- you -- you learn to just accept it, and -- and that’s -- that’s your job, you know?</span> <span id="s1274">But is so [indecipherable], but you have to learn fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: So, bu -- would the children in the hospital ever be Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: We had, in 1945, I was assigned to a ward with 50 babies.</span> <span id="s1277">Those babies were underfed.</span> <span id="s1278">You don’t ask how, you know it happens.</span> <span id="s1279">So, if they had no tattoo, it could be a Dutch baby.</span> <span id="s1280">If they had a tattoo, you was aware that was a baby that was taken from a Jewish home, or from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1281">In those days, everything was chaos, unpredictable, you didn’t know if the stories what went around was rumor or truth.</span> <span id="s1282">But you had to do what the nurse is supposed to do.</span> <span id="s1283">We had no coffins any more, for instance.</span> <span id="s1284">Coffins were out of the question, because there was no wood.</span> <span id="s1285">So we wrapped dead body in a cloth or paper, and -- and then it was -- if you know.</span> <span id="s1286">Yeah, in my ward were many, many who -- who died, and was very emotional, but what can you do, you know, you’re not God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: But when you say yo-yo-you don’t ask, but you know, I mean there’s a good chance that a lot of those babies that were being undernourished, were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: That was not the rule, cause everybody in Holland was undernourished.</span> <span id="s1289">If you was fat, I was supposed to be fat, okay?</span> <span id="s1290">That has to do with the type of food, you only had soup.</span> <span id="s1291">Anything what you ate was soup.</span> <span id="s1292">And if you know medical structure of a person’s body, it -- it sets in your -- in your skin, it sets in your nerves, it sets in your -- in your fat -- you call it edemish.</span> <span id="s1293">You put a -- a thumb on someone’s skin, and it would stay.</span> <span id="s1294">So that means that is an impression of a person that has too much fluid in the body.</span> <span id="s1295">And that was the only food you had anyway, so what can you do?</span> <span id="s1296">I had pea soup, I had this soup, I had that soup, I -- but at least you had soup.</span> <span id="s1297">You -- you -- you went out to the street, and get the leaves from the trees, cook them, that was soup.</span> <span id="s1298">People don’t understand that here, because you have so -- everything, you know?</span> <span id="s1299">You have so much choice.</span> <span id="s1300">When I went in the store after the -- the -- that we came from Holland, I couldn’t believe my eyes.</span> <span id="s1301">I said to my husband, “God, we should have had all that stuff during the war.”</span> <span id="s1302">Because the shelves were with all of those different brands of -- of food, and cans, and oh, what a choice you had.</span> <span id="s1303">It was amazing.</span> <span id="s1304">But so what?</span> <span id="s1305">It was all vitamins, perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: How -- how did you feel, physically during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Fantastic.</span> <span id="s1308">Very s -- very strong.</span> <span id="s1309">If you were sick, you had no chance.</span> <span id="s1310">So that again, is in your mind, don’t get sick, because then you’re not effective.</span> <span id="s1311">And, as a nurse, I chose that profession.</span> <span id="s1312">It sounds -- it sounds -- what is that word?</span> <span id="s1313">Egoistisha --</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: E-Egoist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Egoistic.</span> <span id="s1316">Self preservent.</span> <span id="s1317">But that’s the only place you got food.</span> <span id="s1318">And really, I had farmers, they visited their -- their family when they were sick, and they were prepared to give us pancakes, so I had -- you know, your uniform is with white, huh?</span> <span id="s1319">I had five pancakes here, and that’s greasy stuff.</span> <span id="s1320">So the -- just the -- the -- on uniforms, nothing but grease dripping, but nobody said anything, everybody was laughing, because you did it.</span> <span id="s1321">And if someone said, “I hope I’m out of this.”</span> <span id="s1322">Oh, here.</span> <span id="s1323">No a -- no questions asked.</span> <span id="s1324">I was once in a place where you have the latrines, had the -- the bedpans.</span> <span id="s1325">So I come in running, you always ran to, and then s-stapled up three, and -- and -- on each other, that’s always the way you have to be strong.</span> <span id="s1326">And th-the ward’s head nurse, I hated her, but it was so funny.</span> <span id="s1327">I tell you, I was laughing, and I dropped all those bedpans on the floor, because I got a fit from laughing, and that’s me, you know, then -- and she stood there, a huge woman, six foot something, and really big.</span> <span id="s1328">And she had both cheeks like this, and I asked her something.</span> <span id="s1329">I’m -- I’m a nasty person, I asked her because I knew she couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s1330">So, she opened her mouth with that yellow stuff coming out of her teeth from the egg, and she said, “Get back.”</span> <span id="s1331">I said, “I want to ask you something.”</span> <span id="s1332">I stood there, I didn’t go out.</span> <span id="s1333">I just put her on the spot.</span> <span id="s1334">Oh, did she hated me.</span> <span id="s1335">So I asked her the question, she could not answer, unless all that egg was first out.</span> <span id="s1336">So I went back to the ward, I’m washing out the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1337">And I had curfew, you could not go out certain time, and you had to bay -- b -- be back in a certain time, too.</span> <span id="s1338">Yeah, you stopping?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: This is an interview with Louise Segaar, conducted by Katie Davis, on November 10th, in the year 2000, at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s1341">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1342">You were talking some about the different kinds of things that you might do -- that you might get asked to do.</span> <span id="s1343">Was there any pattern to it, or -- or how would y -- how would you -- what did you expect in a given week?</span> <span id="s1344">That you would have something that you’d have to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: We didn’t expect nothing, because things happened which you didn’t expect.</span> <span id="s1346">Simple.</span> <span id="s1347">Everything was unpredictable.</span> <span id="s1348">In -- in a war, you cannot plan anything.</span> <span id="s1349">If you plan something, then something around you happens, and then you have to change, so you just live what you call day by day, minute by minute.</span> <span id="s1350">And if nothing happens, fine, you was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: W-Would you ever be at the hospital, and -- and have someone come up and sort of get a message to you that someone needed to talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1353">Because they knew that the hospital was my future.</span> <span id="s1354">I mean, I was a student, you have to learn lots of things.</span> <span id="s1355">You -- you are a involved with lifes, and medication.</span> <span id="s1356">I mean, you could not be distracted from what actually the goal of your life was.</span> <span id="s1357">And I felt that, as a nurse, you could use it for later, if the war was finished, for whatever purpose.</span> <span id="s1358">I still have use for it, because it’s the experience you get.</span> <span id="s1359">I know how to treat it, I know how to treat that.</span> <span id="s1360">I never walk to a doctor.</span> <span id="s1361">So, it -- it is very -- you know, it -- it is -- it is a nice occupation, that you can use.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: That’s actually interesting to me that you didn’t get bothered when you were at work.</span> <span id="s1363">So, there were some clear boundaries about what was safe, or okay, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: No, no, because I -- I saw like a girlfriend went on her bike, from one point -- from -- of the city to another, and she got hit by -- by a -- an -- a shell, and what can you do?</span> <span id="s1365">I mean, I didn’t even know she was there, but you hear that later on, you know, sometimes months later.</span> <span id="s1366">But you -- you -- you can cry, but you cannot change it.</span> <span id="s1367">So, it -- it was shocking.</span> <span id="s1368">S-Saw some things that you didn’t expect.</span> <span id="s1369">So I -- I -- I hoped to -- to see her back again, but you never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Wh-Who in your life knew about what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: I would say the leader of this Girl Scout troop, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1373">And what was her name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Rita Burgenberra-Fondeyong.</span> <span id="s1375">Let me see, I have something here, cause I didn't know if I needed this.</span> <span id="s1376">I write everything down.</span> <span id="s1377">Let me see where you are.</span> <span id="s1378">There she is.</span> <span id="s1379">Haupfrau Rita -- actually name is Maria Katarina Burgenberra-deyong.</span> <span id="s1380">You can keep this, or -- or copy it.</span> <span id="s1381">She was born the first of August, and she died 22nd -- on the 12th of August, in ’95.</span> <span id="s1382">Now this is her sister, who wrote it to me.</span> <span id="s1383">Her sister lives on that address, because in ’95, of course, I was here.</span> <span id="s1384">But she might have names, and -- and -- and addresses from people fr-from that time.</span> <span id="s1385">Now this is my uncle, that’s the sit -- the brother of my mother.</span> <span id="s1386">He died at Auschwitz concentration camp, in 1941.</span> <span id="s1387">See, I -- I hope to write a book, if I find a person that can help me out, because I have not the slightest idea how to start, but that’s why I made all those notations, yeah.</span> <span id="s1388">I was in that -- that is -- that is a school of -- home economics is that in English.</span> <span id="s1389">So I did that before I went as a nurse.</span> <span id="s1390">You -- you made cakes from tulip bulbs, spinach from tree leaves.</span> <span id="s1391">You had no butter, you had no sugar, no chocolate.</span> <span id="s1392">There were no coffins, bodies were wrapped in paper.</span> <span id="s1393">Now, that was in ’42, so it’s -- it started to become nasty.</span> <span id="s1394">In the beginning you didn’t notice much, but it -- it builded up, because we were resisting.</span> <span id="s1395">If we didn’t resist, everything would have been more pleasant.</span> <span id="s1396">No heat in the house, which in the bedroom was frozen this thick.</span> <span id="s1397">Oh yeah, then here I was in the staff of the kitchen, in moylon that is that house for old people.</span> <span id="s1398">And then I was in the train to The Hague, when German tried to kiss me while I stood at window.</span> <span id="s1399">Smashed with high heeled shoe in his banana.</span> <span id="s1400">And then I saw a blitzed plane that was shot down, and the pilot was still in his seat, but he was black, ashed, you know?</span> <span id="s1401">And then you would put your finger against that, and your finger would have the ash, like on Ash Wednesday.</span> <span id="s1402">That’s -- the Catholics do.</span> <span id="s1403">But he was still intact, was amazing.</span> <span id="s1404">Yeah, and -- and the German said, “Okay, you can see it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Let me ask you a bit more about her.</span> <span id="s1406">Where did your Girl Guide leader live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: In The Hague.</span> <span id="s1408">This is -- this is all -- see, in The Hague.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Okay, so she lived in The Hague.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: How old was she?</span> <span id="s1412">You were 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Well, she was born in 1904, and she died 1995.</span> <span id="s1414">So she was pretty old.</span> <span id="s1415">Can that be?</span> <span id="s1416">Yeah, that can be, can be. ’</span> <span id="s1417">95, subtract that from there.</span> <span id="s1418">So in the 90’s, roughly.</span> <span id="s1419">Thi-This is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: So she was about 10 years older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1424">Now this is the harch sistikting forhoup and roterdumpser escapees, or -- what -- what is that here?</span> <span id="s1425">If -- if you flee.</span> <span id="s1426">Refugees.</span> <span id="s1427">And this was the leader who gave me that -- that little gadget, that -- Eugene, see, he was French.</span> <span id="s1428">Sorting out worn clothing to size, at refugees home, and s-stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: So when you still went to a Girl Guide meeting, would you leave the hospital, and put your Girl Guide outfit on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1431">See, this Girl Guide stuff was before I went as a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Because then I did not live in The Hague.</span> <span id="s1434">Now, on vacations, if I had time to visit them, I would do that, but Haarlem, that is where -- where the hospital was, is entirely different area.</span> <span id="s1435">But of course, she went on with her Girl Scouts, so we -- we -- we kept in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Did she ever talk about -- without being really explicit, but did she ever talk about what she was doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: No, no, no, no, no, never.</span> <span id="s1438">I only, because I’m so inquisitive, I find out things.</span> <span id="s1439">But I did not want to let her feel that I was investigating, it was just that I was curious, I wanted to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: What did you find out about her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: In -- in -- in those days, you didn’t do things, if a person didn’t want you to do it, because she had a highly sensitive position.</span> <span id="s1442">If -- if -- with the Red Cross, that that is international, you have to be very careful.</span> <span id="s1443">So she -- she -- I think she never told anybody that she was a Girl Scout leader to begin with, that would have been so stupid.</span> <span id="s1444">But if you deal with -- with -- with kids, so what, who cares what you do?</span> <span id="s1445">You know, you play with them, and you keep them happy, and -- and -- and -- and don’t ask for political things.</span> <span id="s1446">So, no, I -- I was not that close with her.</span> <span id="s1447">She was what you call a very strict disciplinarian, what was good, and that’s maybe why she made me the way I am, but I had the greatest respect, and you did not backtalk with her.</span> <span id="s1448">She was that type of person, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: What did you call her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Haupfrau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: Haupfrau.</span> <span id="s1452">Haupfrau --</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: Perhaps you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: -- what does that mean, Haupfrau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: Haupfrau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Leader?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: I think that it’s a nickname, and -- and you don’t use that here, because I was here a Girl Scout, too.</span> <span id="s1458">It is typical, and how should I say that?</span> <span id="s1459">If -- if you like a person a lot, that you nickname in -- in a nice way, sweet, you know, lovable.</span> <span id="s1460">So, I think we invented that name.</span> <span id="s1461">Maybe she didn’t like it, but she never said that she didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: So you said that you investigated, even though she was pretty private.</span> <span id="s1463">H-Ho --</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: International. ’</span> <span id="s1467">31.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: How -- how did you sn -- how did you find out what you did find out about why she did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Just for asking.</span> <span id="s1470">I’m not sneaky, I just ask, and if they don’t want to say anything, fine.</span> <span id="s1471">And if they say, “Why would you know?”</span> <span id="s1472">I say, “Because I’m curious.”</span> <span id="s1473">Or -- or I’m interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Did you ever see her after the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: -- so you could talk to her about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: No, because see, then I moved.</span> <span id="s1480">I never finished my -- my nursing exam, because it was chaos, and as I told you, I was in love, the heck with the exam, so I -- I never got my degree.</span> <span id="s1481">But I feel, if you have experience, that should do it.</span> <span id="s1482">And the hockey stuff also, they -- they kept writing, and sending pictures with.</span> <span id="s1483">It is impossible, because here, not only you immigrate, but you are all of a sudden bang, in everything, you know.</span> <span id="s1484">Because you are new, and you meet people, they want to know everything about you.</span> <span id="s1485">So I -- I was a celebrity, and as I told you, I did all those courses.</span> <span id="s1486">You -- you’re just having a job, taking care of your boys, your husband needs to be fed, he doesn’t do a darn thing, he didn’t -- didn’t do the -- the yard, or anything, so I kicked him out.</span> <span id="s1487">Can you believe that, he said, “If we come to the States, you are not allowed to learn how to drive a car.”</span> <span id="s1488">So, I waited until he went to his job in Washington National Airport, with United Airlines, and I looked in the Yellow pages, and I called someone that is offering driving lessons.</span> <span id="s1489">So there’s a guy, gives me seven lessons for five dollars per hour.</span> <span id="s1490">I went solo to D.C., came out alive, back home.</span> <span id="s1491">And I said to my husband, “I did it.”</span> <span id="s1492">Boy, he was exploding.</span> <span id="s1493">Then, I was not allowed to get a job.</span> <span id="s1494">So, when he went to work, I went with my car, where my new license, parked in the parking lot, went inside, with my little ad I found.</span> <span id="s1495">They needed a person for Mutual of Omaha.</span> <span id="s1496">So I knocked at the door, the guy opens the door, he said, “Oh, you want a job, you are hired.”</span> <span id="s1497">And I stayed for 31 years.</span> <span id="s1498">I still see him, and write Christmas cards, and talk with his wife.</span> <span id="s1499">She is Scottish, he’s -- he is American, they live in Alexandria.</span> <span id="s1500">But I always asked him, I said, “What did you see in me?</span> <span id="s1501">Why did you hire me so fast?”</span> <span id="s1502">He said, “Because you acted cute.”</span> <span id="s1503">And his wife was laughing.</span> <span id="s1504">She said, “Yeah, I think same way.”</span> <span id="s1505">And I saw the romance in the airport, because he always went to her counter.</span> <span id="s1506">I said to him, “Uh-uh, that’s not the way to go, that’s the way to go, that’s your office.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: So basically, if someone tells you not to do something, you -- you’re going to go ahead and do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: That seems to be the way it happens.</span> <span id="s1509">Because I never thought why I would not work to help my kids to go to college, or to get something for the house, or -- I mean, I’m not a slave, but I showed him that I was not a doormat, either, even I was married to him.</span> <span id="s1510">So he was upset.</span> <span id="s1511">He said, “You don’t obey me.”</span> <span id="s1512">I said, “For what?</span> <span id="s1513">I’m not in Indonesia.”</span> <span id="s1514">Yeah, that’s the way I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Well, tha -- this kind of links us, in a way, to orders, you know, when you get orders, when you’re in what -- volved with what you were in, if you got an order, you did have to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Yeah, but that’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Okay, how?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: That is an order that makes sense, that has a purpose.</span> <span id="s1519">But to say you cannot drive, just for the fact that I’m your wife, the hell with you.</span> <span id="s1520">E-Everybody drives.</span> <span id="s1521">How can you -- how can you walk from one point to the other?</span> <span id="s1522">And I hate buses.</span> <span id="s1523">I hate to be dependent on something.</span> <span id="s1524">I’m a very in-independent person.</span> <span id="s1525">And if you say you cannot do this, I say, I do it.</span> <span id="s1526">That -- that has been my whole life.</span> <span id="s1527">And my father can tell you that too, if he was still living, because that is just the way I am.</span> <span id="s1528">And maybe it’s because of all the stuff that I have experienced, that it -- that it made me that -- that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: How would you get orders from your higher ups, to do certain things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: I only listen if you are nice, if you say it in a way, can you please do this, then I do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: But I mean in -- dur -- during the war, like, ho-ho-how would you even hear that you were supposed to do something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: I felt is an honor.</span> <span id="s1533">An honor that I was asked to do that, and I would do a good job about it.</span> <span id="s1534">Of course, you don’t have the schooling, you have no experience.</span> <span id="s1535">You do the -- the way -- the best that you can do it, but if it comes out right, then you get a medal.</span> <span id="s1536">And you win -- you win TV’s and stuff like that, I think.</span> <span id="s1537">That is it, an -- an accomplishment.</span> <span id="s1538">But I don’t do anything just because they ask.</span> <span id="s1539">It has to have common sense first.</span> <span id="s1540">Because otherwise, you do something against your will, and that’s not me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Can you tell us about any close calls you had?</span> <span id="s1542">Get into some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: Well, if you call that a close call, that -- that -- that soldier in the train, but I never felt it that way.</span> <span id="s1544">No, I -- I feel very religious about it, I feel I have been protected.</span> <span id="s1545">I never really had a close call.</span> <span id="s1546">I could have been killed many times, but because of -- of the intuition, or the insight feeling that you get about a certain happening, or a certain person, I think that’s the warning, and then you just be careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: So do you feel some -- in some way, you were warned sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Maybe -- maybe -- yeah, maybe that twofee, too, that got a shell in the house.</span> <span id="s1549">You could say that is a close call.</span> <span id="s1550">But see, I don’t see it that way, because the mattress was between the shell, and the shell stuck in -- in the roof, and didn’t go down, didn’t fall all the way, see, so -- and then -- and then we -- and that was funny, too.</span> <span id="s1551">We were -- we were moved -- that -- that’s also government ordered, because the house was impossible to fix.</span> <span id="s1552">So we moved to a family, and they had the pear tree, full of pears, in -- in their yard.</span> <span id="s1553">Now, in those days, if you had that guy’s pear, you got shot at.</span> <span id="s1554">So, his son -- I never forget that, but his son was about my age, too, he was always in the kitchen door with the rifle.</span> <span id="s1555">I said to him, “Hey, you have nothing better to do?”</span> <span id="s1556">But -- but -- but -- but what I do go get you a pear.</span> <span id="s1557">I wouldn’t even touch it, but I can look at it.</span> <span id="s1558">Yeah, you have crazy people.</span> <span id="s1559">Hot, he was so crazy about his pears, I said, “When do you finally start to eat the darn things?”</span> <span id="s1560">Because the pear has to be ripe and fall out anyway.</span> <span id="s1561">Oh, oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Can you talk a little bit about friendships you made with people who were doing similar things to what you were doing in the Resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: The only friendships that you could have was in the hospital as a student nurse, and I was with friends in that -- in that hospital for older people, and of course, the sports.</span> <span id="s1564">Had lots of friends.</span> <span id="s1565">Girl Scouts, you kept friends for years.</span> <span id="s1566">But see, you -- you -- you -- either they move, or they get married, so then the -- their name changes.</span> <span id="s1567">And when I moved, I tried to keep up with all those people, but it’s -- you -- you ha -- [indecipherable] work to write.</span> <span id="s1568">And if they have no time to write back, you just have to give up, or you write a Christmas card with love, your name, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1569">No, I’m not a person that -- that stays up for 24 hours to keep friends.</span> <span id="s1570">If the friends wa-want to be a friend, I am loyal to that person, and if that person is not loyal, fine, that’s their business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Were you ever trained in any way, to do anything that you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: I think the experience is the training.</span> <span id="s1573">You do something, and then see what will happen.</span> <span id="s1574">And otherwise, the student stuff was experience, and -- and you learn how to be prepared during scouting, and you smash someone’s knees when you -- you -- you play hockey.</span> <span id="s1575">I wound always u-up in -- in -- in the back of the goal, because I was so fast, I couldn’t make myself stop.</span> <span id="s1576">So they couldn’t find me, and I heard them yelling, “Lukie, Lukie, where are you?”</span> <span id="s1577">And then the -- was behind the -- the goal, and I was entangled in -- in -- in the goal net, because I couldn’t get out of it.</span> <span id="s1578">But that was the only way, you know.</span> <span id="s1579">You -- you kept friends with people that you are working with, or laughing with, or experiencing with.</span> <span id="s1580">Oh boy, I know I had always fun.</span> <span id="s1581">I always -- and that -- that makes you weak, because I get weak from laughing.</span> <span id="s1582">My grandmother was that way, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: We always laughed.</span> <span id="s1585">We had gossip about aunt this, about uncle that, and then all of a sudden, you -- you would have silence, and then you would hear something, like this -- this bottle went upside down on the seat, and that was -- I don’t explain it.</span> <span id="s1586">But I mean, that -- that was our family.</span> <span id="s1587">Oh boy, and my mother also, she would have her hands over the stove to keep warm, and then we would gossip again about this, because that’s all that you could do in those days, is gossip, because you -- you couldn’t do nothing, nothing else.</span> <span id="s1588">My mother had no job, and my father would come home with a -- a face like, is the food ready?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Tell us -- you haven’t really -- we’ve mentioned him a couple times, but I wonder if we should tell us the story of your uncle.</span> <span id="s1590">You know, let’s give his name, and describe a little bit about what he did, and how he ended up --</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Two -- two uncles.</span> <span id="s1592">Two uncles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: -- in Auschwitz, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: Yeah, because I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: But let’s tell both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: I only know that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Just say what you do know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: -- he -- he was picked up at five in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Which one is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: That was the older.</span> <span id="s1603">That was Alder Young.</span> <span id="s1604">My mother’s oldest.</span> <span id="s1605">And I found that out after I came home from -- I think that was the nursing time, and my mother had those items in her hands, and she was -- she -- in -- you -- sometimes it was so emotional you couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s1606">So I had it -- to find out from my father, who finally talks way after that, but we have never found out if he was ill, or that he died in -- in the real gas chambers, what we didn’t know at that time, either.</span> <span id="s1607">Everything was after the war, that you heard about that.</span> <span id="s1608">And I always thought, how a human being can invent that.</span> <span id="s1609">I was absolute perplexed, because a nurse is a nurse.</span> <span id="s1610">Is healing.</span> <span id="s1611">You don’t invent all that cruel stuff.</span> <span id="s1612">You don’t -- you don’t expect that to happen.</span> <span id="s1613">So, we never got his body.</span> <span id="s1614">The other uncle, of course, was killed on -- on -- on the tarmac of the airport, so that was a body, but that cousin that was 15 years in a Jap camp, we were told -- again, I don’t know the truth, that he was just killed by -- by not being fed, not getting food, so he was malnutrition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Th-The one who was killed on the tarmac?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: That was my youngest uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Edward.</span> <span id="s1619">That is from this advertisement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: And where was he killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: In Eepenberg, that is close to a place in the ha -- The Hague, a suburb of The Hague.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: So they’re both Dutch citizens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: Yes, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1624">My family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: But no, I know, but I’m --</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: -- just -- the Dutch cit --</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: So what would have necessitated them being picked up in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: He was -- they were betrayed.</span> <span id="s1631">They had -- the uncle that went to Auschwitz was like me, underground, but at that time, I didn’t know that, because we didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s1632">And the office where he worked -- I -- I don’t even know what office that was, was a guy who was member of the n -- NSB.</span> <span id="s1633">So, when my uncle talked, he might have been not careful.</span> <span id="s1634">He was betrayed.</span> <span id="s1635">Now, at that time, I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1636">I didn’t know about the under -- other uncle, until later, I was told that he was shot.</span> <span id="s1637">And then in -- years later, my father mailed that to me, that little thing, and I kept it at -- all the time, because it is part of history.</span> <span id="s1638">Now, he was a captain, he was in -- in the -- in the Dutch army, and he was very brave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Was your father in the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: He was -- no, but he was -- he was secretary of -- of that organization like here the Triple A is.</span> <span id="s1641">But, because of his looks -- he looked younger than the age of a person that was sent to work in a German factory.</span> <span id="s1642">He just -- I think he grew his ber -- beard, or whatever he did, in order to go to work without the second experience of being picked up.</span> <span id="s1643">Because he -- he kept going to the office, to do his job, but he was not done being picked up again.</span> <span id="s1644">Or maybe he got such a shock that he grow older, I don’t know, but that -- that was happening in those days, so you didn’t see man between 16, and I think it was either 45, or 55.</span> <span id="s1645">So you saw only real old men, and men of my age, you -- you saw after the -- the dark fell in, and then you dared to go out, because I still dated somehow.</span> <span id="s1646">And -- and of course, those boys on the hockey field, they dared to go out and play hockey, even they had the chance to go out to the factory in Germany.</span> <span id="s1647">But, see y-you got bolder by the day.</span> <span id="s1648">Do you think that you -- you -- you -- you thought that the -- the Germans could do all those things, yo-you just thought they were -- they were mentally sick and said those things, but you didn’t obey them, you laughed in their face.</span> <span id="s1649">Yeah, you can laugh now, but that’s how I lost a lot of boyfriends.</span> <span id="s1650">I remember I was in love with a -- with a guy, and he always tried to bring me home.</span> <span id="s1651">And then all of a sudden, I went back to play hockey, and he was not there.</span> <span id="s1652">So someone said yeah -- what was his name again?</span> <span id="s1653">I forgot.</span> <span id="s1654">But he was the guy that went via Belgium, and France, and the Pyrenee, and -- and Spain, to England, and then he got caught in -- in that time, but I have never found out how he got caught.</span> <span id="s1655">That was just one of those news that you picked up, and you knew that was the guy that you liked so much.</span> <span id="s1656">So it was -- it was very tragic.</span> <span id="s1657">That’s why it was difficult to have your emotions pointed at something, because it never lasted.</span> <span id="s1658">And -- and you had no control about anything.</span> <span id="s1659">If you tried to, you -- you had to change with a grudge, but so what, it changes, and there is nothing you can do about it.</span> <span id="s1660">That is just the end of that period.</span> <span id="s1661">So I think I grew faster for my age than any person here in the United States ever will, because of all the pain there, that you endured, and I was too strong to admit it.</span> <span id="s1662">But I got stronger, I could feel that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: What was it like right when you were doing something, when you -- you had a kid who really was Jewish, and should have had a star, and you were getting the kid to somebody’s house --</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: Oh, that was a challenge, no doubt about that.</span> <span id="s1665">Yeah, you still have a star?</span> <span id="s1666">Forget it, off.</span> <span id="s1667">I just ripped it.</span> <span id="s1668">But you see, th-the -- the seam’s still on -- on the thing, so they -- he had to have the new jacket.</span> <span id="s1669">And we -- we -- we hided all that stuff, we just hided it.</span> <span id="s1670">Oh no, you had to act fast.</span> <span id="s1671">Maybe you could say I was impulsive, but to me, to -- to wear that, that -- that -- that was plain suicide, and you don’t let that happen, no way.</span> <span id="s1672">Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1673">But see, if you get -- the guy is six feet tall, with -- with boots, that even a snake don’t -- doesn’t bite through, and you have a -- a -- a -- a rifle that weighs maybe a hundred pounds, or 80 pounds, I think it is, y-you cannot just, you know, do certain things, and -- and get yourself in trouble, because then you out of -- of -- of -- of a useful life, because you’ve -- you have to feel useful.</span> <span id="s1674">It -- it is -- it is a -- a -- I would almost say, even, I’m not a church goer, that you have from the Lord, a test in your life, and it depends on how -- how you beat that test, that you’re a failure, or that you’re a accomplisher.</span> <span id="s1675">That’s the way I feel.</span> <span id="s1676">Everything in life is a test.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: Were there times that when you were doing things, that you were sort of filled with a -- a feeling that you were under God’s care, or that you were on a mission, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: Yeah, yeah, I ca -- I could feel it.</span> <span id="s1679">I still feel it.</span> <span id="s1680">I still feel it.</span> <span id="s1681">And -- and just little things.</span> <span id="s1682">For instance, I’m -- I’m not rich.</span> <span id="s1683">I have no job, so I depend on Social Security, and a small pension, what I had to fight for -- was a lawsuit, you know.</span> <span id="s1684">And a small investment.</span> <span id="s1685">But I can make it.</span> <span id="s1686">I have no -- no -- what you call big debts, and some rich people that, boy they -- they -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: This is a continuation of tape three, side B, interview with Louise Segaar, November 10th, in the year 2000, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: I could use some, but I have a credit that is excellent.</span> <span id="s1689">My bank has me on a senior citizen -- what you call that?</span> <span id="s1690">Status.</span> <span id="s1691">So I have, of course, to have a certain amount, so that overdraft is not tolerated, but I never have an overdraft, because I calculate my expenses before I even put it in the mailbox.</span> <span id="s1692">I mean, you have to think.</span> <span id="s1693">And if there is an expense that is before a certain time limit, I call that person, can you extend it a little bit longer?</span> <span id="s1694">No problem, as long as I keep in touch that I will pay.</span> <span id="s1695">It’s -- it’s -- everything is so simple, really.</span> <span id="s1696">I don’t me -- money is like a game.</span> <span id="s1697">You get money, and you spend money.</span> <span id="s1698">But it’s just the -- the -- what is that word now?</span> <span id="s1699">That it’s balanced properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: Have you ever come across any people who you helped rescue, that have identified themselves to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s1702">It’s because life goes so fast, and your life changes, your physical changes, your -- what is that -- your interests changes, too.</span> <span id="s1703">And I found out that lots of people are very absorbed in their own family.</span> <span id="s1704">And if you say something, oh that’s nice, but so what?</span> <span id="s1705">That’s your business.</span> <span id="s1706">So, that -- that is with everybody.</span> <span id="s1707">I -- I noticed that with my next door neighbors.</span> <span id="s1708">I have a -- a bunch of Bolivians, and they speak only Spanish, but there’s one guy that I speak English with.</span> <span id="s1709">They are very nice, and they’re totally different from the other neighbors.</span> <span id="s1710">But they have their own problems.</span> <span id="s1711">I noticed that, they have problems, but I keep my big mouths shut.</span> <span id="s1712">And if they -- if -- if they know how to solve it.</span> <span id="s1713">For instance, they -- they’re -- they’re not -- new in this country, so they don’t know laws.</span> <span id="s1714">So the other day, their dog goes out without the leash.</span> <span id="s1715">I said to the guy, “You better watch out that the policeman is not passing, because you get hundred dollars fine, and you might have that the dog will be impounded.”</span> <span id="s1716">And he asked me what is -- what is impounded?</span> <span id="s1717">So he didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1718">But now, the -- the dog is with a leash, and he is in the yard, and he is grateful, but he doesn’t show that.</span> <span id="s1719">It’s just that I felt obligated to protect that poor dog, because I love animals, and if that poor -- that Bolivian is not familiar with laws, I have the duty to tell him, to protect that he get in trouble.</span> <span id="s1720">So they are nice people, very polite.</span> <span id="s1721">But we -- we don’t do anything voluntarily t-to -- to get more friendly.</span> <span id="s1722">Let me put it that way.</span> <span id="s1723">They are on that side of the fence, and I am on this side.</span> <span id="s1724">Plenty to do.</span> <span id="s1725">I never sit still.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: How about -- did you ever come across someone that you -- that you worked with in the Resistance, who was someone like you?</span> <span id="s1727">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: No.</span> <span id="s1729">Totally out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: So when the war ended, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1732">I immigrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Pretty much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Pretty much, that’s what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Well, that was our goal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: Yeah [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: See, if -- if you have no job -- after the war, my husband got an assignment in Indonesia.</span> <span id="s1739">So we went there for a year, and that was because that airline, Kahouda Indonesian Airline, was supposed to be independent from the KLM, that’s the Dutch company airline.</span> <span id="s1740">But the government did not like the idea that we were living, so we had a notice of 14 days to scram, get out.</span> <span id="s1741">And I was just married, so all my wedding presents I could not pack, was too many.</span> <span id="s1742">You -- you only had the opportunity to pack what you could carry, so that was all behind, so they had a ball, perhaps with that stuff.</span> <span id="s1743">The house was empty.</span> <span id="s1744">We were just literally refugees.</span> <span id="s1745">So then you come to the -- to the Netherlands, and you have no home, so you are supposed to live with your in-laws, and that -- I just explained my father-in-law was, with the Japs hanging -- oh, that was hell.</span> <span id="s1746">So we tried as soon as we could manage, to immigrate.</span> <span id="s1747">But, you stay on -- on -- on a list.</span> <span id="s1748">You need to find your own sponsor, no help with that.</span> <span id="s1749">So we kept looking in newspapers for immigration, and we found a sponsor.</span> <span id="s1750">Then you need money in order to pay for the trip.</span> <span id="s1751">We had that.</span> <span id="s1752">I -- I -- I worked underground, too.</span> <span id="s1753">I was not allowed to work, but I did.</span> <span id="s1754">And then finally, in 1953, we got permission, and we left at April the sixth, after we had that big flood, on January the 31st, that all the dikes were flooded over.</span> <span id="s1755">I don’t know if you member -- remember that -- I have also a book about that.</span> <span id="s1756">So, the south part of Holland was absolute water.</span> <span id="s1757">Water, water, all over, and 2,000 people had drowned.</span> <span id="s1758">Cows, horses, everything was floating, because they had drowned.</span> <span id="s1759">It was mess.</span> <span id="s1760">So, we came here in April, and my son was six.</span> <span id="s1761">Had not learned a word of English, because he is just like me.</span> <span id="s1762">That stupid language, I don’t want to learn that.</span> <span id="s1763">Now, that was in Holland, so we come here, and we have a family from the state department, and they have Black people, real southern Virginian type.</span> <span id="s1764">And I was supposed to sit with that Black woman.</span> <span id="s1765">So what?</span> <span id="s1766">I said to the lady, “What big fuss about it?</span> <span id="s1767">Who cares?</span> <span id="s1768">She is nice.”</span> <span id="s1769">And then the Black woman says, “You are more educated than my own boss.”</span> <span id="s1770">I told her that, I said, “I dress better, I have better manners, I’m polite, and I -- I have more respect for Black people than you do.”</span> <span id="s1771">That woman was flabbergasted.</span> <span id="s1772">She said, “Where did you learn that?”</span> <span id="s1773">I said, “Well, I just, you know, have my ears open.”</span> <span id="s1774">But when you was at work, I -- I -- I got someone at the door, and I opened the door, “Are you Mrs. Gardner?”</span> <span id="s1775">I said, “No, I’m the housekeeper.”</span> <span id="s1776">“Oh, you look much better than she does.”</span> <span id="s1777">Now, I didn’t know that guy, he just knocked at the door, so I mean, a -- a -- a -- a -- I already found a lot of things out.</span> <span id="s1778">And then I found out they were Democrats, so I’m an -- I’m a Republican.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: But you needed a roof over your head.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: But my son -- April, May, June, July, August, September, learned perfect Virginian slang.</span> <span id="s1781">So he came in the first grade.</span> <span id="s1782">Then we had a PTA meeting, and that teacher of that class comes to me.</span> <span id="s1783">“I heard that you was from Holland.</span> <span id="s1784">How come your son speaks perfect English?”</span> <span id="s1785">I said, “So do I.” She was so impressed, she said, “Oh, that is so cute, he speaks so good Virginian.”</span> <span id="s1786">I said, “Well, it’s because he was forced to.</span> <span id="s1787">In Holland, he refused to learn that.”</span> <span id="s1788">She said, “I cannot believe that.”</span> <span id="s1789">I said, “Well, that’s what he said.”</span> <span id="s1790">Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.</span> <span id="s1791">So then -- then he was at school here, and the -- both sons, I said, “If you are in the door, in the house, it’s only Dutch spoken.</span> <span id="s1792">You leave the house, then you can speak all the English you want.”</span> <span id="s1793">So my youngest became a pilot, he goes to Amsterdam for three days.</span> <span id="s1794">“Are you American?”</span> <span id="s1795">“Yeah,” said my son.</span> <span id="s1796">“But you speak Dutch.”</span> <span id="s1797">“So what?</span> <span id="s1798">My mother taught -- told me.</span> <span id="s1799">She is a [inaudible].”</span> <span id="s1800">Of course, he didn’t dare to say that, but I mean, that -- that was what they thought in the -- in Holland, because he spoke fluently Dutch.</span> <span id="s1801">And it didn’t cost him a penny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q: That’s really important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: And that’s with my oldest son also, if we have a secret language, we speak Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: If I get a -- a -- a salesperson over the telephone, I speak Dutch.</span> <span id="s1806">I had once a guy who spoke Japanese, so I spoke Dutch, and I heard him saying something bad in Japanese, but he hang up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: I should -- I shouldn’t have jumped ahead, I want to go back to the last few months of the war, d -- were you beginning to expect a liberation?</span> <span id="s1808">Were you beginning to hear that it was happening in other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: We had a map with pins, and listening to the BBC, we changed the pins where they lost.</span> <span id="s1810">So we knew, looking at the pins, that they lost this part, they lost that part, they lost Poland, they -- they lost Danzig.</span> <span id="s1811">The Russians were killing them in the east of -- of Germany.</span> <span id="s1812">In Belgium were certain battles lost.</span> <span id="s1813">The battle of Arnhem, you see the -- you saw maybe in the movies about that.</span> <span id="s1814">So we -- we didn’t have to notice it, you just looked, or listened, and that is how you got the nerve to do some certain things that you didn’t dare to do.</span> <span id="s1815">And that is why we knew that wi -- they were, you know, sent to th-the west coast, that is [indecipherable], and that was the -- the area where the underground had the -- settled, and there they had to leave all their fur coats that they were snatching, and -- and radios, and whatever.</span> <span id="s1816">All -- all the luxury stuff that was stolen, they had to leave it there.</span> <span id="s1817">And they are -- they were -- I think, but I -- I cannot be sure about it, stripped from all their whatever, paraphernalia, on their arms, because of ranks, and stuff.</span> <span id="s1818">So they walked for two or three hours, to their country, as a private.</span> <span id="s1819">You didn’t notice if a colonel, whatever.</span> <span id="s1820">We just got them s -- so far down that they were not looking us in the face any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: And that is why we also snapped those girls that we knew had dated.</span> <span id="s1823">And we put them on a table, and that’s all facts, it’s not that I invent that -- on the table, with a razor here, and razed off, fell on the floor.</span> <span id="s1824">Other young people of my age threw tomatoes in their faces, rotten eggs.</span> <span id="s1825">We saved it all up for that purpose.</span> <span id="s1826">And then, of course, they were also -- I don’t know, I was not there to -- to witness that.</span> <span id="s1827">Cause what happened after that, I don’t know, if they were molested, or -- or raped, or -- I -- I just don’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">Q: Oh, you weren’t there when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1830">Because, as I told you, I was still a nurse.</span> <span id="s1831">I was still in the hospital, and what I know is either from newspaper news, or in -- in -- in the radio at the time, then you had the nerve to listen to your own radio.</span> <span id="s1832">But see, the radio was still German minded, so it was not the way that you could believe it.</span> <span id="s1833">But when the radio became Dutch again, that was where you listened to, and that was honest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: A couple days later, after that happened to those girls, did you ever see any girls with their heads shaven?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1836">Oh, I saw that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Heads shaved --</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: Oh, I saw that on pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: As I told you, you went to the movies to watch the news, and that is why I thought Hodsen looks funny, but she had no hair, yeah.</span> <span id="s1841">Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: What -- what other kinds of things like that happened to people who had collaborated in a sense, with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1844">Well, you got punished.</span> <span id="s1845">But see, I was co -- not connected with those, so they -- they to me were like rotten apples.</span> <span id="s1846">You don’t talk to them, you don’t want to see them.</span> <span id="s1847">You have no interest in what -- what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1848">But you find it out from either news, but you don’t -- you know, that -- that you just happen to see, and then you are surprised.</span> <span id="s1849">[indecipherable] is that -- is that the Dutch way to do things, with the -- officially it was.</span> <span id="s1850">Dutch people are not angels, either.</span> <span id="s1851">They are nasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: And so, within the period of how many days w-w-was the city empty of Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: That is hard to tell, because also, that was gradually.</span> <span id="s1854">See, a Dutch person does not want to make a big deal about some event.</span> <span id="s1855">It’s all hush-hush, and underground.</span> <span id="s1856">So, if they were picked up, I think their uniforms were stripped off first, and they looked like a normal person again.</span> <span id="s1857">That is what happened.</span> <span id="s1858">So, if you meet a person, then you have no suspicion that -- that is not a Dutch person, but he might be a German.</span> <span id="s1859">Because he doesn’t talk, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s1860">Because Germans and -- and -- and -- and Dutch people look very much the same.</span> <span id="s1861">You look Dutch too.</span> <span id="s1862">No, really.</span> <span id="s1863">I mean, that’s the way it is.</span> <span id="s1864">They’re all blonde, and they have the same expressions, rosy cheeks, and even the way they walk is the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: I -- I know the difference between someone -- someone from Asia, or someone from the midst of Europe, and I -- I always ser -- say here, if someone complains, “Why don’t you visit Kosovo?”</span> <span id="s1867">Then you get a better opinion.</span> <span id="s1868">I hate that, you know, people complaining because the weather is lousy, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1869">Don’t complain.</span> <span id="s1870">Go as a volunteer, and help there.</span> <span id="s1871">That’s my answer.</span> <span id="s1872">And w -- that -- that is what I hope that the government finally will change, and do that, too, because there is a -- a need so badly, and -- and there is a need for -- for peace between those Arabs.</span> <span id="s1873">I said to an Arab once, because I still talk with all -- all kinds of religions, “Why is it that -- that women are treated so lousy in your country?</span> <span id="s1874">They -- they have a veil, they cannot be seen.”</span> <span id="s1875">I said, “If I was in your country, the heck with you.</span> <span id="s1876">I come the way I am, and if you want to arrest me, I don’t even go to your country.</span> <span id="s1877">So if you want to make friends, be normal, be -- be the time of what we live, 2000.</span> <span id="s1878">You don’t live in the Bible years.</span> <span id="s1879">It makes sense.”</span> <span id="s1880">I said, “What -- what rights do you have with your beard, and your funny little thing over here to say those things?</span> <span id="s1881">Because you happen to be an Arab?</span> <span id="s1882">I have no respect for that.</span> <span id="s1883">I have respect if you treat your wife in the way she should be treated, and otherwise, bye.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: Tell us how you were actually liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: I was having my shift finished, and I hear a lot of commotion, and I hear tanks coming in, and I run outside, because I have been told that you could sit on one of those.</span> <span id="s1886">No dice, they were already full.</span> <span id="s1887">Oh, it was hysterical funny.</span> <span id="s1888">But you walked beside them, and you threw whatever you could threw at them, and -- and say in English -- I was an interpreter then, too, “Oh, we are so happy to see you.</span> <span id="s1889">You have not the slightest idea.”</span> <span id="s1890">“Oh yeah,” said one soldier, very casual, “what do you think we’re doing here now?”</span> <span id="s1891">I said, “Oh, I think you call that liberation.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: What kind of soldiers were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: They were Palestinian.</span> <span id="s1894">But see, in those days, they were on the British thing, so -- yeah, and Canadians, that’s why I have that book.</span> <span id="s1895">Because they ask me to become a member, that was also one of those big honor things.</span> <span id="s1896">And I was -- oh, I had every week a different boyfriend.</span> <span id="s1897">I had a -- a sergeant, I had a lieutenant colonel.</span> <span id="s1898">But the funny thing is, they all were very much in -- like the -- the sergeant, I could not go to a party, if that party was nothing but lieutenants, because of his rank.</span> <span id="s1899">So I had once that I made a blunder, and I -- I took him to one of those parties, and he was hiding under the table, because he couldn’t show himself.</span> <span id="s1900">And then he was so -- so feeling bad, he drank, drank, drank, so he was loaded, he -- he -- he couldn’t talk any more, so I remember I took him under the armpit, and like a sled, I got him outside the door, in the street, and then he woke up because of the cold.</span> <span id="s1901">And the other boyfriend, the lieutenant, yelled at me, what are you doing with that bum?</span> <span id="s1902">I said, “Well, he needs fresh air.”</span> <span id="s1903">See, I -- I was the type, I didn’t care less if he was a sergeant, or a private, or a lieutenant, because I’m a baroness, I have a title.</span> <span id="s1904">So I don’t have to feel like, you know, act like a snob, because I was a snob by birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: And that’s the first time you’ve mentioned it all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: Yeah, but can you help it?</span> <span id="s1907">When I came here, I had to renounce it in the court.</span> <span id="s1908">I said to the judge, “What a waste of time.”</span> <span id="s1909">And he looked at me like, “What did you say?”</span> <span id="s1910">I said, “If you are born a baroness, you can tell me to renounce it, and I say you’re a nice judge, but I cannot renounce myself, I am born that way.”</span> <span id="s1911">So then he w -- he -- he thought, “Yeah, she makes a lot of sense.”</span> <span id="s1912">So he laughed.</span> <span id="s1913">He said, “You’re funny.”</span> <span id="s1914">I said, “Yeah, I know I’m funny.”</span> <span id="s1915">But the other person, she was a baroness from -- I think it was Denmark.</span> <span id="s1916">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1917">She i -- she is from a famous Danish -- of course, we know all -- all -- like in England, who is duke, and who is lord, and whatever.</span> <span id="s1918">My uncle was with the House of Lords, so y-you know you brought up in that, and you don't know any better.</span> <span id="s1919">So, she was a baroness -- what’s that again, and -- and she poked me.</span> <span id="s1920">She said, “Do you talk like that all the time?”</span> <span id="s1921">I said, “Yeah, that’s the way I am.”</span> <span id="s1922">Because she was brought up very stiff, you know, don’t talk, don’t talk.</span> <span id="s1923">But her husband was American.</span> <span id="s1924">And so he said, “Yeah, I can understand.”</span> <span id="s1925">What -- whatever happens in the court is not always, you know.</span> <span id="s1926">Well, they think it is, but it doesn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s1927">What’s the point, you go to court, and renounce your own title?</span> <span id="s1928">It’s so stupid, because you cannot do anything with it.</span> <span id="s1929">It doesn’t cost any money.</span> <span id="s1930">It doesn’t hurt anybody.</span> <span id="s1931">It’s just a name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: How -- how much of this story do your children know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: I don’t even start.</span> <span id="s1936">They don’t want to hear it.</span> <span id="s1937">No, they don’t want to hear it.</span> <span id="s1938">They -- it’s -- it is just a generation that feels it is not concerning them.</span> <span id="s1939">They are not interested, they have their -- their own soccer team, and whatever.</span> <span id="s1940">They’re very occupied.</span> <span id="s1941">My -- my son is now a coach for -- for a soccer team, and they played with a Dutch soccer team from the embassy.</span> <span id="s1942">Oh boy, he is so -- so that -- that is big deal, and I feel if you are together, it should be happy, and because of that oc-occasion, and if they want to know, they can ask.</span> <span id="s1943">But they never do.</span> <span id="s1944">And I feel well, that’s their tough luck, they don’t know what they are missing.</span> <span id="s1945">But maybe it’s good, cause it’s nothing but sad, sad, sad.</span> <span id="s1946">And they don’t like me to be very -- how shall I put it, with -- with a -- with a face like suffering and stuff, because that’s not the way we are.</span> <span id="s1947">We are all happy.</span> <span id="s1948">And I keep it that way.</span> <span id="s1949">And what was happened in the past, it happened in the past.</span> <span id="s1950">I live with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: Is there something else you wanted to mention before we [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: Oh boy, I have not the slightest idea.</span> <span id="s1953">I might later, but at this time, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">End of Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0461 PAGE 68</span></p></body></html>
