not in by train and sometimes not in by trucks, to labor, hard labor.</span> <span id="s137">That's also were in bombing, where they bombed and we tried to clean up.</span> <span id="s138">On railroads I have seen mine colleagues, mine friends...that twenty people enter one one of the lines when the railroads and God forbid when somebody falls, they all fall and and there were not allowed...were not allowed to to the others to go help them pick me up.</span> <span id="s139">I have seen there dead people, dying and very touching human...in between us, and I falled in in a category...we we was digging...digging other other...making ...you how they say...uh trenches.</span> <span id="s140">And uh between us were a a German.</span> <span id="s141">He had a very bad habit.</span> <span id="s142">He were a..</span> <span id="s143">.</span> <span id="s144">had a habit...he used to go and pick up somebody and take him out and beat him for no reasons.</span> <span id="s145">And till one time I fall...I fall in his category and working so in the he he start screaming, hey...you there, , come here, uh you know.</span> <span id="s146">When I approached him, you know, and he took me on the side... , you know, on on the side of the house...we worked in the back, you know, where the bombs had falled, and we we worked...and he he put me near the near the wall, my...myself.</span> <span id="s147">And he come to me and he asked me, you know, in a nice way, nice talking...and then he come and he lift up chin.</span> <span id="s148">When he lift up my chin, he said to me in uh his voice in German because I speak Yiddish I understood the German...he says where's your God, and I raised my right hand...I remember it exactly...I raised my right hand and trace it to the sky.</span> <span id="s149">As soon as I lift my hand to the sky, he punched me in to my stomach.</span> <span id="s150">He give me such a punch because I was near the wall, I was thinking I'll faint, and and down here he lift again my chin, you know, and he asked me again, and uh again I raised my hand and I telled that's my God.</span> <span id="s151">I believe in Him.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">And he knocked me...he knocked me again...he knocked me in the front in my nose.</span> <span id="s153">I have a broken nose and he knocked those...my first three teeth what I have up to today false teeth.</span> <span id="s154">He broke them...I took out my teeth and threw them away in the front of him, and I was bleeding very much.</span> <span id="s155">And the same minute, when I took out my teeth, he asked me again, .</span> <span id="s156">It's like a in God and I say when he asked me who's your God, I say you my God.</span> <span id="s157">I pointed with finger and with the same hand, the right hand what I pointed to God, I pointed to him and I say you my God, and he asked me how come I'm your God.</span> <span id="s158">I said when you don't beat me, you're my God.</span> <span id="s159">So uh he stopped working and he sent me back.</span> <span id="s160">What what he don't...because I was bleeding and I was very in pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Somebody asked , you know, I'm and he called the other guy and say, hey, come here.</span> <span id="s162">And he say you take his shovel (cough), and go in there...he showed him.</span> <span id="s163">.</span> <span id="s164">he said to me go show him where you were with the shovel and come back and the guy left a of water in in the side and I come back and he made me carry the water, with a little cup, tin cup, and to give to each one, you know, some because it was drinking...give them a little water, them a little water, so what he end of the day.</span> <span id="s165">He let me carry it down in order to make myself easier.</span> <span id="s166">The next day I falled in his category, again within the hundred people.</span> <span id="s167">When I got again and I say, because he...I mentioned as he's my God and he can help me, because before the word spread around between the Jewish people, as they, you know, a street, street, strict you know...the strict come, you know, between us we give each other the word, the pass word was strict, strict, because he had a habit to beat up lots and lots of people.</span> <span id="s168">I start spreading the word...when somebody between the Jewish people...he he choose...again when he asked you who's god, immediately tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">You'll not be beaten like I was beaten, because all all the people are to go there in mine in mine in mine neighborhood, they saw when he beat me up, and they saw I was bleeding...they saw I could cry because you cannot cry because they they made you not to cry, so and then it was easier.</span> <span id="s170">I had a friend what we worked together for years.</span> <span id="s171">It happened to him the same thing...the same...he took him out.</span> <span id="s172">They want to take him in in in the crematory and work and and I told them when that happened, he should he should say the same words and he went, you know, and it just happened a day or two later, he were in a different group, but this guy used to go around groups to group, just to do this thing to beat up people.</span> <span id="s173">He beat them to death.</span> <span id="s174">And he he told me when we got back in the camp to the dorm where we used to sleep, he said Saul, you know something, .</span> <span id="s175">I fall into today the same thing what you got.</span> <span id="s176">I say what happened.</span> <span id="s177">He said to me, that guy, that German, what he done to you and you told me...he he took me and I immediately told him you can't hurt me because you're my God, and I was not beaten.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">You saved me.</span> <span id="s179">Then, when we were in the in the camp in Ebensee, we went in another place to work.</span> <span id="s180">In Ebensee, you know, they had built something, you know, and uh we ca...I fall in the category to carry cement.</span> <span id="s181">Bags of cement.</span> <span id="s182">I could not remember this...forty pounds, thirty-five pounds, fifty pounds...that I could not tell the the weight of the...but one thing I remember is what like and it had iron bands, you know, inside the chain and it's had the back what the straps in the back and and you chained up somebody behind what put up in in the...we carried what you can in the back like a baggage in the back...the cement...and what another two people and one was put on the back and the other was staying in the back not to fall up, and you carried, and I was carrying that that that that...it was ...it were steps.</span> <span id="s183">You go five steps and there were a little platform, and then you had to turn to the other five steps and another five steps, and I I don't...can't look in the back who come behind me.</span> <span id="s184">I think when I go in the in the tenth platform, I'm going to twist around and, you know, when you twist around on the platform into the second or third steps, I'll be able to lift my my bands because I was just and bones...lift up my bands, you know, to make it easier, and I don't realize as behind me is an SS man.</span> <span id="s185">And the SS man took his rifle and and he hit me in the left hand what my left hand up to today is broken.</span> <span id="s186">I have a broken hand.</span> <span id="s187">He broke...he broke mine bone.</span> <span id="s188">Mine bone is broken, and here the stitches, and here the stitches in my hand.</span> <span id="s189">I had a wrap.</span> <span id="s190">I were in the hospital that were two or three days, two days before we got freed, in in in Dachau.</span> <span id="s191">The dead happened.</span> <span id="s192">And I were laying into the block when the black brigade freed us, and uh then I was taken all Americans...the American black brigade freed us in in the camp.</span> <span id="s193">I was thanking then all the blacks, so when we coming in, they took in in in and they (cough)...what I remembered they took in a in the the American trucks what they had showers, and they...it's...and they they took my clothes and they bathed me and they washed me, and from there and from there they took us in a in a van with a little uh you know, in to...they made a hospital and from there they carry me in the hospital and they had doctors come in and looking and they had brought in I think German nurses, German doctors, and once and over the American black doctor, Dr. Brown (ph)...I don't know where where he is or whether he's still alive or not...he saved my hand and he

and I see how they lived, and I was before before their God over there to the time that I were in the hospital, I went in in camps.</span> <span id="s238">I went in camp.</span> <span id="s239">I went in Feldefing (ph) camp, you know.</span> <span id="s240">Just...I had...I had time with the broken hand (coughing)...</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Saul, I don't understand.</span> <span id="s242">You you went to these different camps looking...</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Looking, you know.</span> <span id="s244">You know, that's where (cough) when I still been in hospital, so when, you know, you don't need to pay and from Dachau to to Feldefing and to is not so far, and here was Jewish uh, you know, in the camps, and there were the people lived in private homes already because the and uh and I could not go home because I was there.</span> <span id="s245">I had the, you know...because I were in casts, therefore, you know, bended the arm.</span> <span id="s246">So when I went from one camp and another and the Feldafing camp and I went to and I went to .</span> <span id="s247">It's not not far so when I find a different living after the three months, what were left in the three weeks, people got established already in their different ways.</span> <span id="s248">The start making kibbutz and they uh , kibbutz in in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s249">YOu know, the the lagers was become a DP camp, so when I say the living is here different, we...I have seen in Masiv they feed people what they survived the war about eight girls my sister, and about five men, so when the the five...these people what they the war they lived in the same house in a Jewish home what I used to know the owners of the house, but the owners died in in a concentration camp and uh I see how they're doing because they made a party for me the second night or the third night and I have seen the they were uh they were accustomed to making a dance, a dance with bending the knees, and they had a napkin and and they they was dancing and singing and going around one to another and kiss each other.</span> <span id="s250">I say that's not a nice living what...I don't want to live this way.</span> <span id="s251">I say I better go back, back to Austria, to Germany, and I should be able to see a different living, because there I have seen people starting to get back in in of their own, you know, living in in in Germany before I left to go back to Romania to find my sister...I see people, uh they they they had already made a shule (ph) and the American people brought with and you know, they start again and they start making again a Jewish, a Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s252">And I got over there.</span> <span id="s253">I got so shocked what happened...I say that's not good.</span> <span id="s254">I took my sister and I asked some other guys who wants to come with me.</span> <span id="s255">I say it's a way because now it's free.</span> <span id="s256">We don't have to pay, and we had to go...I don't want to stay here and because according to the Russian- Romanian regime or because it were so early in the in the in the year what we everybody...I say we had to go to and from , from there we will go back to Austria, because the the living in in Germany and Austria is...the people starting living a different...without the the the dancing what I have seen going on, the living so with nobody in the horrible what the homes, what what they are took over from us and we...I I went in the day time.</span> <span id="s257">I went through the street.</span> <span id="s258">I have seen where they had freedom, you know, where the the people before they took them to ghetto, they put them all in one house.</span> <span id="s259">It's in the street you can find places in the cities and .</span> <span id="s260">Matter of fact in many towns, there used to be a mill where they they they grind...they making flour and I went over there.</span> <span id="s261">I say in the house I will tell you...you know, in the mill...I cried like a baby.</span> <span id="s262">I say to my sister where she lives today in Israel...I said listen, , tomorrow we don't have nothing.</span> <span id="s263">Our parents don't leave nothing.</span> <span id="s264">We have to go away.</span> <span id="s265">So she took my word.</span> <span id="s266">I took her and we went to and when we got in were already Jewish people living there what they transport us little by little to, back to Austria, you know, and uh I went...I don't know what what we paid them

could not stay on my feet by myself.</span> <span id="s329">They had to hold me.</span> <span id="s330">So, well, the rabbi said to me, get married.</span> <span id="s331">Find somebody, some...some...you know, and the next Saturday...next Saturday night I was...I think I were invited to eat by this rabbi.</span> <span id="s332">This Saturday...and this Saturday night I went out.</span> <span id="s333">It was, you know, like the young people still want to live and they had a band.</span> <span id="s334">I don't know...a German band or a Jewish band...this I could not tell, and I went uh there too.</span> <span id="s335">And seeing in this place people dancing and dancing and dancing...suddenly I saw a young girl that uh, you know, dressed young, scared, poor like me.</span> <span id="s336">I was not rich either.</span> <span id="s337">(Laughter) And I approached her.</span> <span id="s338">Can I dance?</span> <span id="s339">And you know what she say.</span> <span id="s340">You know, I have to dance who she has.</span> <span id="s341">She says she don't have nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">She lives in a block so-and-so and I asked her can I uh...you want to dance with me?</span> <span id="s343">I don't remember I danced or not with her.</span> <span id="s344">But what happened...I asked her can I take you home.</span> <span id="s345">She start...wondered yes or no, yes or no, so we start walking till I got to her home and when we got to her home, you know, and she don't invite me.</span> <span id="s346">I invite myself in, because when I got invited uh coming in I say she had a father but he survived the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s347">They live for a while in Czechoslovakia and then he come back to Germany and he lived in the same camp, and she had a step-mother.</span> <span id="s348">When I walked in and I see Jewish people...they were, you know, personally and he survived.</span> <span id="s349">I give the honor...I say to him, right away, you know, I I like you should trust your daughter to me and now I can say that in English.</span> <span id="s350">And the old man he say if she want, why not.</span> <span id="s351">So the next day I got hooked up.</span> <span id="s352">I could not sleep the whole night.</span> <span id="s353">And the true magistrate was coming Sunday morning but Monday morning I approached her.</span> <span id="s354">I say, you know, you want to marry me.</span> <span id="s355">She looked at me.</span> <span id="s356">I say I'm honest and you're honest and your father...she say I'll go ask my father.</span> <span id="s357">And before she asked her father and mother get rid of her, she say yes, yes...he is a good boy.</span> <span id="s358">He's a good and got so I approached again the rabbi.</span> <span id="s359">The same rabbi was give me that and he say yes.</span> <span id="s360">He say you have to the Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s361">So when they had already then a in in lager.</span> <span id="s362">They had already, you know, .</span> <span id="s363">They was fighting.</span> <span id="s364">He wanted young people.</span> <span id="s365">They wanted young people to come and join them, so the rabbi invite me I should go and marry first and be in Germany where I should , to be married legally, because he didn't know I will reach America or wherever I go it's is good, because we know in the home we had so much trouble...the the our parents and our grandparents had so much trouble because they were not married legal, and when Hitler come to the power, he killed the mother because she had one name and then he killed the people the the children because they had another name, so the rabbi opened my mind and I say I think you're right.</span> <span id="s366">We went.</span> <span id="s367">I took my, you know, my wife while she's ...and I say when you and you're serious, let's go.</span> <span id="s368">So when we went

id="s392">After I put down the package of cigarettes on the table, he coming out.</span> <span id="s393">When he coming out, you know, and his office had a wooden...what I remember to this day...had a wooden bottle with some wooden glasses on the table, and he come out with the the German flag around his arm, you know, with a with a with a book and he...I think his wife and with somebody I think we had...I could not recall...to be witnesses, and he say something in in in German, you know, and the only thing we don't have to either a ring, so the the the the mayor himself took off a ring from his finger or from his wife's finger...I could not remember...and he say hold the ring and they put it on.</span> <span id="s394">I took her hand and put on her finger and I say yes, yes, you know.</span> <span id="s395">I say yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s396">And we got married and he give us the blessing, and he give it uh marriage license, a paper.</span> <span id="s397">When we had the paper, the
