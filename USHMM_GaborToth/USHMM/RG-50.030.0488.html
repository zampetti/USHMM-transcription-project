id="s20">Q: And that was not your name at birth, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: No, my maiden name was Lenneberg, L-e-n-n-e-b-e-r-g.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And when -- when were you born?</span> <span id="s23">Your birth --</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Four 24 - 26.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Four 20 --</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: April 24th, 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span> <span id="s28">And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: In Dortmund, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: And let’s talk a -- a little bit about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Do you have any recollections of your family before 1933 when the Nazis take over, or was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Oh yes, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Well, I remember the place we lived in, which was a suburb of Dortmund, called Aplerbeck.</span> <span id="s38">And my father was the manager of a department store, a chain of department stores owned by a Jewish concern called Karstadt.</span> <span id="s39">And I remember that department store, and I remember the -- some of the outbuildings that housed all kinds of boxes that we would play in, and play house in.</span> <span id="s40">And I also remember learning how to ride a bike.</span> <span id="s41">I was about seven years old, and one of the janitors taught me how to ride a bike.</span> <span id="s42">And I also remember when my father lost his job, and there was a change.</span> <span id="s43">We had to move out of our apartment, which was above the department store in a -- it was a huge building, because in 1933, that concern was, in quote, Aryanized.</span> <span id="s44">So my father really lost his job in 1933.</span> <span id="s45">And instead of leaving Germany, he bought a store just a few -- maybe a block up the road, and the owners of that store were a bit smarter.</span> <span id="s46">They went to South Africa.</span> <span id="s47">And I don’t remember this, but it was repeated in my family ca -- so many times, that Mr. Rosenstein told my father that they’re going to have signs on buses that Jews can’t ride a bus.</span> <span id="s48">And everybody who was Jewish in that town thought this was hilarious.</span> <span id="s49">This wasn’t going to -- I mean, what is he talking about, this guy is crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Not so crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Not so crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: What was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Otto.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: And your father -- am I correct to say that he had one leg, that he had a leg amputated when he was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: It’s not true?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: It was my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Oh it was your grandfather, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Yeah, was my grandfather, he had a leg amputated, and why, nobody really knows.</span> <span id="s62">They said -- there was some rumors that he had diabetes and they apparently weren’t substantiated, and there were also rumors in the family that the wrong leg was amputated.</span> <span id="s63">So I really have no clue, all I know, that my grandparents who lived in Düsseldorf, there was -- there were no closets in homes in Germany.</span> <span id="s64">There was a corner that had a curtain, and it was used like a -- like a closet, and there was a wooden leg in that corner.</span> <span id="s65">And I was very nosey as a young child, I opened every drawer and every -- every, you know, I looked into every crevice.</span> <span id="s66">And I saw that wooden leg for the first time and it was kind of upsetting to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Yeah, I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Did you -- did you ask people about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: I’m not sure, I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s73">I know I wasn’t supposed to look in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: So whether I had the guts to ask --</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: -- I ma -- I really don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: And your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: My mother’s name was Schneider.</span> <span id="s80">My mother was -- came from a Christian family.</span> <span id="s81">Her name was Lina Caroline, after she came to this country, but Lina Schneider.</span> <span id="s82">And it was a Protestant family, supposedly, but later on we found out that my grandfather was really from a Catholic background, which he never admitted while he was alive.</span> <span id="s83">And my mother had been a buyer for a department store where she met my father, who was also a buyer.</span> <span id="s84">It was not a s -- it was not Karstadt, it was another department store.</span> <span id="s85">She had been in training as a fairly young woman.</span> <span id="s86">In those days people didn’t go to college.</span> <span id="s87">In Nassau’s department store in Dortmund, my grandmother went to Mr. Nassau and said that her -- he -- her daughter was very interested in clothing and in -- in -- in mode.</span> <span id="s88">And Mr. Nassau -- my -- my grandmother was a good customer, said, “Well, why don’t you bring her along?”</span> <span id="s89">And -- and this is where she started, and she was a very, very gifted woman, it turned out later on, and this is how she made her career, as a -- first as a salesperson, and then she became a buyer, and then she became buyer like -- Karstadt is like Macy’s.</span> <span id="s90">She became a buyer at Karstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: And -- but your parents met before she started working at Karstadt, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: They had met before.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yeah, they -- they met, I don’t know exactly when.</span> <span id="s95">They married in 1925, and my mother converted to Judaism.</span> <span id="s96">And I was raised as a Jew, and then my brother was born in 1930, and he was -- we were both raised as Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: I didn’t realize that your mother had converted.</span> <span id="s98">Was that unusual at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Wa -- maybe it was for some people, but not for my mother.</span> <span id="s100">Don’t forget, she really was in a Jewish environment fr-from -- as a fairly young woman.</span> <span id="s101">She was more Jewish than my father was, I mean as far as Jewish expressions, and as far as the Jewish food.</span> <span id="s102">My father was really an agnostic, and my mother -- people actually, during the persecution, always thought my mother was Jewish, and not my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: And not your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s105">And -- yeah, she was -- sh-she -- and actually her family was wonderful.</span> <span id="s106">My grandparents loved my father, and this -- especially her two sisters, to the point during the Nazi time where my mother’s youngest sister, as they always accused her that she couldn’t keep her mouth shut, she ended up in a work camp.</span> <span id="s107">So, it just gives you just an -- and actually, my -- my mother’s parents were much more tolerant of that marriage than my father’s parents.</span> <span id="s108">My Jewish grandmother did not like the idea of a goyte coming into her house, and even though she converted.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: She still wasn’t Jewish to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: She wa -- she still wasn’t Jewish, and -- and -- and the ridiculous part is that my grandmother Lenneberg, she was a total agnostic, she didn’t keep any of the Jewish holidays, and they were totally assimilated.</span> <span id="s111">But the idea that her son, her favorite son would marry a goyte, didn’t quite go down well.</span> <span id="s112">Then her oldest son, Erich, who was really like a black sheep in the family, not a very good person, and who she didn’t like, but he married later.</span> <span id="s113">He met a Catholic woman who was a very good person, Erich was not.</span> <span id="s114">And she was a very strict Catholic, and she became pregnant before they got married.</span> <span id="s115">And don’t you know that my mother -- my grandmother Lenneberg opened her arms to this Catholic woman, even though she got pregnant before they got married.</span> <span id="s116">And totally ignored all what she believed before, when her younger son married Lina Schneider.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: So how do you explain it?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: I have no explanation for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: No explanation.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Neither did my aunts, my Jewish aunts, who loved my mother.</span> <span id="s121">Maybe there was a competition.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I -- I have no idea, I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Tell me about the personality of your parents as you -- as you remember them.</span> <span id="s125">Were you close to both of them, were you more close --</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yes, very close to both of them.</span> <span id="s127">My father was a very intelligent man, and he was a very calm person, he was loved by everybody.</span> <span id="s128">My mother was much aggressive than my father.</span> <span id="s129">They had two different personalities.</span> <span id="s130">My mother always accused my father of being too decent, too good, whether it was to employees, or it’s to who -- whoever, and I think she was right.</span> <span id="s131">And she -- she always felt that people were taking advantage of him.</span> <span id="s132">And my mother was much more aggressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: But he didn’t agree with this, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I don’t really know, he loved her, she could do anything.</span> <span id="s135">My father was totally in love with my mother, as long as I can remember, and nobody could say anything bad about my mother, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: And you were close to your mother as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: I was very close.</span> <span id="s138">I was -- actually, when I was younger, I was closer to my father than to my mother.</span> <span id="s139">That doesn’t take anything away from the relationship to my mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: -- but I was, you know, I was really close to my father.</span> <span id="s142">And some of it stemmed from the fact that my father was quite athletic, and my mother was not, and Jupp Geschind, who was kind of a janitor at Karstadt, he taught me how to ride a bike.</span> <span id="s143">It was an adult bike, and my parents didn’t know about that, and I put my leg kind of through -- you know, how I managed it, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s144">And then I eventually got a wonderful bike, and we went on bike trips, but always with my father, and actually my cousin, my father’s sister’s daughter, who spent a lot of time in our house.</span> <span id="s145">My father tried to teach my mother how to bike, but it was always a disaster.</span> <span id="s146">And she screamed once he was trying to kill her, so she always -- as long as she knew that he was holding onto the back of the bike it was fine.</span> <span id="s147">As soon as he let go, she would fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: So you did many more things with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Many more things as far as hiking and bicycle riding with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Did you eat lunch together, and dinner?</span> <span id="s151">What was -- what was the process in the house?</span> <span id="s152">A: Yes, we -- we did, because lunch at that time in Germany was the main meal, and when we lived in Aplerbeck, children used to go home to eat, and my parents lived above the department store, they had a maid, and they would go up and have their -- their lunch, their dinner, at lunch time.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: And I would join them, both of us, my brother and I would join them.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Were you glad when your brother arrived in 1930?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s157">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s158">I loved him dearly afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: I don’t really remember how I felt, you know.</span> <span id="s161">I know that I was crazy about him when he was a little bit bigger, and not quite a tiny baby, but was toddling around, and I was very protective of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Walter.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Walter.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: And I’ve always vowed I would never name a child after a relative who was killed or died, because my brother was named after the oldest son of my grandmother, who was killed in World War І.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: So you -- you’re a bit superstitious.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: I really am not, there is just something about --</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: About that?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: -- you know, I would not consider naming -- ya -- but Hans feels the same way, when I got pregnant, that we would name either David or Bruce after his father, or -- or my father.</span> <span id="s172">Plus there was something -- I didn’t like German very much after I came out of the camps.</span> <span id="s173">Everything German was an antithesis to me.</span> <span id="s174">And so any -- I mean, names like Adolf, for goodness sakes, no -- which my grandfather was Adolf Lenneberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: And Otto was my father’s name.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: So how -- how was the house religiously, since your mother converted --</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Mm-hm</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: -- because your father was agnostic and very assimilated --</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: -- did you celebrate holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: We did.</span> <span id="s183">At -- at times we celebrated both Christmas -- we always celebrated Hanukah, and my father used to call the Christmas tree the Hanukah bush.</span> <span id="s184">And that was really more done for our Christian relatives, who always came.</span> <span id="s185">Seder we went to Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s186">And I couldn’t go to a Seder after I came out of the camps for years and years and years, because this was a couple, they had no children, and we always had Seder with them, and my brother used to ask the questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: So I just couldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: You couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: -- couldn’t -- Seder -- Passover was a terrible time for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: All the ho -- Jewish holidays were.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Because of the memories associated, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: The memories, and I was much more -- I went through phases of being quite religious, and in 1934, I went to a Jewish school in Dortmund because I could not attend public school in -- in Aplerbeck any more.</span> <span id="s195">It was not a good school, and I wasn’t -- didn’t become a Zionist then, but then eventually my parents decided to move to Düsseldorf, where my father was born.</span> <span id="s196">Also, Aplerbeck was a small town, and very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s197">Many Nazis there.</span> <span id="s198">Boycotts in front of the store, don’t buy from the Jew, etcetera.</span> <span id="s199">And then my father did sell that store, but I can’t remember exactly, I think it was about 1936, and Düsseldorf had a private Jewish school, a very good school, and that was one of the reasons my father wanted to go to Düsseldorf, he was brought up there, it was a much larger, more cosmopolitan city, and it had a good school system.</span> <span id="s200">And that’s when I became an ardent Zionist, and very religious, to the chagrin of my parents.</span> <span id="s201">Very upset when my friends in Jewish school pretended to be fasting for Yom Kippur and were really cheating.</span> <span id="s202">I -- and I -- I went through that stage.</span> <span id="s203">I ran around Jewish ho -- houses and apartments, and collected for KKL for money for Israel to plant trees, etcetera.</span> <span id="s204">So you kind of get the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: What is KKL, can you explain?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: KKL?</span> <span id="s207">I don’t remember what it stood for, but we call it KKL.</span> <span id="s208">There were blue boxes that had a Magen da -- David -- David on it, and they would put coins in it, and that would be eventually sent what was then Palestine to make the desert bloom.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s212">Now, explain something to me.</span> <span id="s213">You were born in Dortmund?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s216">And you lived there.</span> <span id="s217">Do yo -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: No, I li -- I never lived in Dortmund.</span> <span id="s219">I lived in Aplerbeck, which was a suburban town, but Dortmund had much better hospitals, so the --</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: -- obstetrician my mother went to was going -- was in Dortmund, there were better physicians in Dortmund, and I w -- the delivery took place in a hospital in Dortmund.</span> <span id="s222">So my birth certificate says Dortmund, but I never really lived in Dortmund.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: And I did go to school -- to Jewish school in Dortmund, because I couldn’t go to public school in -- to any public school any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: After ’33.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: After -- yeah, I think it was about ’34.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s228">But your first school was in Aplerbeck --</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: That was a grade school, and -- and talking about remembering, somehow I do remember I had two very good friends.</span> <span id="s232">Now, I was about seven years old, and one was the daughter of the principal of a school, and one was a daughter of a local physician.</span> <span id="s233">And after the Nazis took over, and I don’t recall exactly how soon, but within a relatively short time period -- we used to run to each other’s houses and play, and I came to their house one day and they informed me, these two girls, that they couldn’t play with me any more because I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s234">Now that I remember, because it made such an impression on me, and I didn’t make -- I -- I didn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s235">And I think I asked my parents, and I do not remember what their answer was, but somehow it was an experience that I still remember, that all of a sudden I lost my friends.</span> <span id="s236">I couldn’t play with these two girls.</span> <span id="s237">I still have pictures of these two girls with me, and I wouldn’t have had those pictures, but the non-Jewish relatives -- whatever I have, after I came back, was on account of my aunts, or I wouldn’t have a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Do you remember if these kids were angry, did they yell at you, or did they say it quietly --</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: That I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: -- you don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: I think they just said you can’t come here any more, we -- yeah, they said you -- we can’t play with you any more because you are a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: And the friends that you had were a mixture of friends, Jewish and Christian friend, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: In -- in do -- in Aplerbeck?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: A -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: I think there were a k -- there were a couple of Jewish kids, I don’t remember them too well, but a lot of the families I remember either had children who were older, or -- or the Kahns, like, had no children, and they treated me like their own child.</span> <span id="s246">So I really don’t have any deep impression of friendship with a Jewish child in Aplerbeck.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Now, that changed in Düsseldorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: In Düsseldorf, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: But even the children at the Jewish school in Dortmund, they were -- they didn’t make very deep impressions on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s252">Were your parents good humored?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Yes, yes, they were, they were.</span> <span id="s256">I think -- I think what helped me survive was the childhood I had.</span> <span id="s257">I think if there is an ideal childhood, I had it.</span> <span id="s258">And my parents were very loving, and the main thing is they were totally in love with each other, which I did not appreciate when I was a child, but as time went on, and I remember their -- the way they acted with each other, and the way my father suffered when he was separated from my mother, and the same for my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Then what do you think that gave you?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: First of all, my father was an extremely honest person.</span> <span id="s261">Morally caring, whether it was for his family, for the people who worked for him.</span> <span id="s262">And I think that made an impression on me, the way he interacted with his not -- non-Jewish relatives, and his Jewish relatives.</span> <span id="s263">And his helpfulness.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: One doesn’t appreciate it when one is eight, nine or 10 years old.</span> <span id="s266">And -- and the way he cared for us in Terezín.</span> <span id="s267">There was only one theme, when this murderer is gone, and we get back with your mommy, you know.</span> <span id="s268">And there was th -- he talked about my mother every day.</span> <span id="s269">So even though we were separated, that was the f -- the foremost thing on his mind, was my mother.</span> <span id="s270">When we were in Terezín, and my -- my brother was Bar-mitzvah’d in Terezín, and my father was an agnostic.</span> <span id="s271">But there is something about agnostic Jews, and I don’t know what it is.</span> <span id="s272">There is a Jewishness that -- that you -- you might be an agnostic, but there is something more than the religion.</span> <span id="s273">And maybe it was also because we were in Terezín that the Bar-mitzvah of my brother meant so much to us.</span> <span id="s274">It might -- might not have meant as much to us if we would have not had the -- Hitler’s ca -- catastrophe.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Was it unusual for a woman who was a mother -- excuse me -- to be working the way your mother was?</span> <span id="s276">Was that unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yeah, my mother was unusual in every way.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: You know, she was unusual in every way.</span> <span id="s280">Yes, when -- when my father accepted the job that was offered to him by Karstadt to be in charge of this whole department store, and my mother was made the chief buyer for women’s and children’s clothing, there was no question that she would continue doing that.</span> <span id="s281">My father just accepted that, or encouraged her.</span> <span id="s282">She had a maid, and her youngest sister came quite often to help out, and was the recipient of a lot of good deeds from my father.</span> <span id="s283">I think she was really in love with my father, too.</span> <span id="s284">So that’s more or less the atmosphere --</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: -- I grew up in.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: So you did have a maid, it was this --</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: -- gre -- this was Grete?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Grete, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Grete?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Grete yeah, she -- she was -- she worked for us until it became impossible, when the first Nuremberg laws came out that Jewish men were accused after that of having affairs with non-Jewish women, and ended up incarcerated.</span> <span id="s293">We didn’t talk about concentration camps in those days, but that was a great fear many Jewish men had, that they were accused of having sexual relations with non-Jewish women, and especially a maid who was a live-in maid.</span> <span id="s294">So -- and I know Grete, when she left, she cried like a child.</span> <span id="s295">But it was just too dangerous to have her there.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: I mean she -- she did join us in -- a few buildings down when my -- my father and my mother unfortunately bought that store, and -- Steinweg, but they v -- they had to let her go, they just couldn’t keep her.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Did you miss her?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s300">I missed her.</span> <span id="s301">She was -- she was part of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: I mean, I grew up with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: So would you have considered your family fairly wealthy, or well-to-do, how would you have described it?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: I think they were well-to-do.</span> <span id="s308">They were not wealthy that they had enormous wealth inherited from their parents.</span> <span id="s309">I think they lived pretty high.</span> <span id="s310">They went on vacations, they had beautiful furniture.</span> <span id="s311">Th -- I’m sure they made enormous amounts of money, both of them together.</span> <span id="s312">They had wonderful paintings, and especially at Karstadt, I mean, they had an enormous flat up there with uncountable rooms, and Persian rugs, and it was very luxurious, which I didn’t -- I mean, it didn’t strike me as luxurious, I was used to it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Whereas my grandmother in Dortmund, my mother’s mother and father, lived in a very nice house, in an apartment, a house that had maybe three stories.</span> <span id="s315">And it was comfortable, and was nice, but it wasn’t nowhere as luxurious as my parents.</span> <span id="s316">I -- my father had a study with bookcases full of books, and it was -- you know, it was a different world, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s318">We have to change the tape now.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Ursula, I want to go back to the f -- your first year of school --</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: -- or your second year of school, you -- you got some sort of tuberculosis of the lymph node?</span> <span id="s325">Of the lymph glands, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Yeah, which was actually almost like kindergarten, and I don’t recall exactly when it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: My grandmother, my non -- my Christian grandmother came from Hessen, which is an agricultural area not too far from Kassel.</span> <span id="s329">And it was thought at the time that during vacation, summer vacation, that was the healthiest place to send your children.</span> <span id="s330">So this was actually before the Nazis came into power, I was sent to Grabenstein, which is a small village where my grandmother was born, on summer vacation.</span> <span id="s331">And they had wonderful milk, raw milk, came right from the cows.</span> <span id="s332">Unpasteurized milk, they didn’t use pasteurization there.</span> <span id="s333">And what is interesting is that my mother also spent her vacation in Grabenstein as a young girl, and she had a -- a condition in her groin where her lymph gland had to be lanced, and then she had a condition in her -- on her neck, too.</span> <span id="s334">But it was never connected that this came from tuberculous cows.</span> <span id="s335">It’s called scrofula, and I had a neck out like this, and it -- it was here, where I have a scar and it was in the front of my neck that -- these lymph glands were all pus-y, and I went through this for more than a year.</span> <span id="s336">And my -- my mother was treated by a country physician who just lanced this with a knife, and she had a beautiful, straight scar.</span> <span id="s337">And my parents took me to Berlin to a specialist, who extracted the pus with a syringe, and consequently I am left with all this calcifications in there.</span> <span id="s338">But I lost a year of school, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Do you remember being in bed a great deal?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: No, what I remember -- no, I wasn’t in bed, what I remember is some horrible stuff, which I still remember the name, believe it or not, antiflogestine, which was like a gook in a -- a little can, that had to be heated very t -- very hot.</span> <span id="s341">It was -- and then it had to be applied to my glands.</span> <span id="s342">It was like putting hot compresses on something.</span> <span id="s343">I hated that stuff.</span> <span id="s344">I mean, it burned, and it was -- and I screamed even before they could put it on my glands.</span> <span id="s345">So that’s what I remember, but I don’t remember too much, and then one day it just seemed to -- to clear up, and it wa -- the glands were still draining a bit, and there was like a -- a band-aid on it, and then I went to school with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: But you were out of school for almost a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Did that --</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: And I was tutored.</span> <span id="s350">I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Oh, you were tutored at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: -- tutored at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: So you didn’t lose the -- the year of school, you were able to stay at your --</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: No, I was tutored, I was tutored from -- in Jewish school, Frau Buchheim, who was the wife of the principal of the school, and she would tutor me at my grandparents home in Dortmund.</span> <span id="s355">See, I had to commute to Dortmund to the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s356">We lived in Aplerbeck, but I couldn’t go to public school any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: But in ’36, you moved to Düsseldorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: No -- in ’36 we moved to Düsseldorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s360">Now, do you remember as a little kid in 1933, when the Nazis came in, did you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s362">I do remember it, because they were -- had this -- the black uniforms, and also gr -- brown uniforms, the either SS or the SR.</span> <span id="s363">And I remember them standing in front of our -- our door to -- to the -- the door to the -- the entrance to the store, and threatening people.</span> <span id="s364">And I also remember the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s365">My parents were very upset, so was Grete, our maid, and who saids all kinds of dirty words about them.</span> <span id="s366">And I picked all that up.</span> <span id="s367">It didn’t make sense to me, but something changed, something happened.</span> <span id="s368">And I remember my parents talking about that no -- customers weren’t coming into the store because they were being threatened.</span> <span id="s369">They stood right in front of -- of the entrance to the store, and any person who wanted to enter the store was intimidated by them.</span> <span id="s370">And then they used to -- they defaced the store windows with Jude, Jew.</span> <span id="s371">Don’t buy from the Jew.</span> <span id="s372">So I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: And I remember them smashing windows, that I remember.</span> <span id="s375">In fact, I think I was in the store one day when these thugs smashed one of the big st -- windows, and it c -- it just came crashing down.</span> <span id="s376">And they did that to all the Jewish stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: And this was during the boycott of 19 thir -- not that you would have known at the time that there was a boycott in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: No, I didn’t know, I didn’t -- you know, this -- all of a sudden -- there was a wonderful, tranquil life, which was changed somewhat because we moved from Karstadt to the Steinweg place, but that didn’t register to me why we did, or what, but then, this did register.</span> <span id="s379">And also those two girls, I couldn’t play with --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: -- the two girls any more.</span> <span id="s382">And they were at our house a lot.</span> <span id="s383">I mean, I have a lot of photographs with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: So, did life become lonely, or did you have a big enough family so that --</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: I don’t think I -- I really felt very deprived.</span> <span id="s386">My -- my mother’s sisters were all so wonderful, and my grandmother.</span> <span id="s387">I mean, there’s nobody like my mother’s mother.</span> <span id="s388">And I just felt very sheltered with them.</span> <span id="s389">And then when I had to go to school in Dortmund, and I spent an awful lot of time with my mother’s parents, because Frau Buchheim would come to my grandmother’s house, and would tutor me at my grandmother’s house, because it was in the same town.</span> <span id="s390">And I would eat with them, and I would -- she would take me to the markets, and I -- I j -- I just don’t remember feeling deprived at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: And when you moved to Düsseldorf, what di --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: That changed my life completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Because I went to a school, a Jewish school, and somehow I made an awful lot of friends.</span> <span id="s395">I had never been in a -- in a school that I felt so good about.</span> <span id="s396">I -- I made a lot of -- a lot of friends, and I went to their houses, they went to mine, and I was good in athletics, and they had a big athletic program, and I was good in jumping and si -- all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s397">And they had arts programs, they did a lot of things.</span> <span id="s398">And even though the Nazis were persecuting the Jews, but somehow there was still that feeling, well this guy isn’t going to stay in power, and at -- and I felt sheltered.</span> <span id="s399">I was among people who were teaching me, and who were very -- were very wonderful.</span> <span id="s400">And we had one professor who later on I met in Los Angeles, Dr. Bergel, and he was a professor of history, and they really had attracted terrific people in that school.</span> <span id="s401">And he had traveled extensively in Africa, in Asia, and he told us all these wonderful stories, I remember that.</span> <span id="s402">Yeah, that was a -- it was a good time until 1938, when our school was destroyed completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Oh, it was destroyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s405">Completely burned to the ground, our school, our synagogue, everything, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: But when you moved to Düsseldorf, your father, he has a business in Düsseldorf, or he works --</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: No, see, my father used the money which he received from the people who bought that Steinwegs -- that second -- that store he bought.</span> <span id="s408">They were very decent family, a Catholic family, and they really paid him the market price.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: They did.</span> <span id="s411">And I would never -- my mother would never do anything to get any more money out of them, because she felt they were decent, which was very hard to find.</span> <span id="s412">Most of the Germans who bought Jewish stores were cheated, but my parents were not.</span> <span id="s413">And then he -- maybe he -- I would have been better off if -- they would have been better off if they had been cheated, because he took the -- the money from that store, when he came to Düsseldorf, he started a wholesale store not too far from the railroad station.</span> <span id="s414">Not in the best area of town, but that’s where the wholestale businesses were.</span> <span id="s415">And that flourished, everything he touched flourished.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Even in spite of the fact that the Nazis are in power for three years --</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Oh yes, he -- he had a -- and a lot of these people were not really Nazis.</span> <span id="s418">And some of them turned Nazis, but they were -- you know, he had a -- also, he has a -- had a good rapport.</span> <span id="s419">Lot of them were people who sold door to door, and some of them were Gypsies, who bought from him.</span> <span id="s420">And I wish he hadn’t bought that store, but that’s what he did.</span> <span id="s421">In the meantime they tried to emigrate.</span> <span id="s422">You know, they tried to leave Germany, but they had to make a living.</span> <span id="s423">I don’t think my parents had, you know, tremendous money reserves.</span> <span id="s424">They had lived pretty high, and all this moving, and losing his job, and losing his -- his health insurance and stuff, and having to buy all this on his own --</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Cost [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: -- I’m sure that there was a cost.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s428">But your mother went -- after you moved to Düsseldorf, she goes to Berlin and gets a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: She tries to.</span> <span id="s430">She goes to Berlin to visit her old colleagues, who used to be -- who were buyers for other department stores.</span> <span id="s431">And some of them had been working for manufacturers.</span> <span id="s432">But by that time, everything was, in quote, Aryanized, and they weren’t working for Jewish concerns any more.</span> <span id="s433">And they treated her horribly.</span> <span id="s434">They didn’t want to have anything to do with her.</span> <span id="s435">Whether they were just horrible people, or whether they -- it was self-protection, because having connections with Jews -- and my mother generally wasn’t even known that she came from a -- from a -- a non-Jewish family.</span> <span id="s436">Fr -- my mother was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: To everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: To her colleagues.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: To everybody.</span> <span id="s441">And so, my mother coming back and trying to get -- make some connections to earn a living, di -- it was a failure.</span> <span id="s442">And she was very disheartened.</span> <span id="s443">And then she -- and I don’t know how she got to the Schreyecks, that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s444">She might have told me, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s445">She became a forelady in a leather belt factory which was owned by the Schreyeck family.</span> <span id="s446">And they were the most decent, wonderful people on this earth.</span> <span id="s447">And they protected her, and I -- they s -- I-I don’t want to jump ahead, I think I’ll let you ask the questions, but they were very vital later on in -- in protecting my mother when we were deported, and the secret police, Herr Puetz, would not let my mother to go with us.</span> <span id="s448">So, they’re wonder --</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: And you think that had something to do with these people?</span> <span id="s450">The fact that she was not allowed to go?</span> <span id="s451">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s452">I think -- what had to do with him not wanting my mother to go with us was strictly he hated her because he -- she got notification a few times, that I remember, to present herself at the office of Herr Puetz, he was the head of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s453">And he belabored her to leave my father.</span> <span id="s454">And she made it very clear she would never leave my father, she rather die.</span> <span id="s455">And he then would not allow her to go with us -- we -- to the, in quote, labor camp.</span> <span id="s456">And she worked for the Schreyecks.</span> <span id="s457">So as soon as we were gone, this guy Puetz came, I think on a weekly basis, to interview her, and to interview the Schreyecks, and to make it very, very difficult, to make her feel very threatened, to the point where Mr. Schreyeck one day said to my mother, “Caroline, this guy is after you.</span> <span id="s458">He will get to you whether it’s next week or the week after.</span> <span id="s459">You have to leave.</span> <span id="s460">I have a brother, as you know, in Vienna, and he has a leather factory.</span> <span id="s461">I’m going to get in touch with my brother and I think he will agree to shield you, and you work for my brother.”</span> <span id="s462">That wasn’t easy, because when you lee -- left a town, and I think it’s probably still so in Germany, you had to go to the police, you had to fill out papers that you were leaving such and such a residence, and you were going to such and such a town, where you were going to live in such and such a place.</span> <span id="s463">Then when you got, let’s say, to Vienna, you were supposed to go to the Viennese police and start papers that you were a new resident.</span> <span id="s464">Now, what they took upon themselves -- this is why I said to you before, these people did things that I am not sure I would have the guts to do for anybody.</span> <span id="s465">They provided food for my mother, so she wouldn’t have -- because she was not registered, she wouldn’t get food stamps.</span> <span id="s466">They provided a place for her to live with a family where she had a room.</span> <span id="s467">And she was not registered with the police, and the Germans had no idea where she went.</span> <span id="s468">And Puetz came, she found out later, to Schreyeck in Düsseldorf, and said where -- they want to talk to her.</span> <span id="s469">And Mr. Schreyeck said, “I have no idea where she went.</span> <span id="s470">I hope she isn’t going to take her life, because she was talking about killing herself,” and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s471">And she stayed with the Schreyecks in Vienna for quite a long time, and -- you know, there’s so many bad things happened to my mother, but this is almost unreal.</span> <span id="s472">I think she had the flu, or something, but sh -- anyway, my mother wasn’t one to stay home if she just had a little cold, but she was sick.</span> <span id="s473">And she stayed home, and that day when she stayed home, the Gestapo came to the Schreyeck factory in Vienna and asked for Karolina Lenneberg.</span> <span id="s474">So, Mr. Schreyeck number two, the one in Vienna send somebody he trusted, I don’t know who it was, to her -- to her room, and told her to immediately leave, take the next train to Kleve, which is close to the Dutch border, where a third Schreyeck brother had a tannery.</span> <span id="s475">So -- and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: This is like the underground railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s478">And then the -- and the -- he -- she worked for the Schreyecks I -- only for several months I think.</span> <span id="s479">And the bombing attacks were getting horrendously bad in Kleve.</span> <span id="s480">I mean, this is historical, what was -- th -- it was almost flattened, because there was also -- lot of industry in Kleve, and also it was a very short trip for the British fliers, cause it was close to the Dutch border.</span> <span id="s481">And one day the house next to the Schreyeck’s was bombed.</span> <span id="s482">It was one of those bombs that went into the basement and then exploded.</span> <span id="s483">And Mr. Schreyeck said to my mother, “Caroline, you have a sister in Lippborg.</span> <span id="s484">Why -- I think you should leave.</span> <span id="s485">I don’t think any of us are going to survive.”</span> <span id="s486">And my mother left, and the day my mother left, all the Schreyecks were killed in their cellar.</span> <span id="s487">One of the bombs went into their basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: And this is why -- you know, you talk about justice, and -- and belief in God, and all this, which my mother had lost completely -- the Schreyecks in Düsseldorf had a wonderful son, and they were such anti-Nazis.</span> <span id="s490">Their son was killed.</span> <span id="s491">He was drafted, and he was killed.</span> <span id="s492">And, you know, these -- the good people --</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Often get hurt, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Well, that’s quite a story of your mother’s, now let’s get back t-to you.</span> <span id="s496">So until -- until Kristallnacht --</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: -- you seemed to feel pretty good.</span> <span id="s499">You’re not feeling -- although you must an -- you must know that your parents are in some ways nervous about what’s happening --</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Oh, I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: -- and they tried to leave.</span> <span id="s502">You’re very conscious of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: -- I was very conscious of it and also, my parents prepared both my brother and me to -- for immigration.</span> <span id="s504">Our suitcases were practically packed.</span> <span id="s505">We got English lessons, I got fr -- English and Spanish lessons from an uncle of mine who also perished, who was a philologist, he s -- he spoke many languages.</span> <span id="s506">And my brother also got additional e -- when e -- we had English in s -- in school, but he got additional lessons.</span> <span id="s507">My parents had what was called an affidavit, which is a pledge from an American citizen to bring over a person from another country, and that they would take care of that person if that person would not be able to be financially self-sufficient.</span> <span id="s508">The idea is that this person will not become a -- will not use the social services of the United States.</span> <span id="s509">So we had this affidavit of a very distant relative in Chicago, Beifuss.</span> <span id="s510">And my parents had a number.</span> <span id="s511">To -- to get an interview with the American consul in Düsseldorf you had to have a number.</span> <span id="s512">And the waiting time before you could see a consul was between a year and a year and a half.</span> <span id="s513">So they had obtained that affidavit a long time before they saw the consul.</span> <span id="s514">They saw the consul in 1938.</span> <span id="s515">I don’t recall when it was, whether it was the beginning or the middle of ’38.</span> <span id="s516">And the consul, who was known not to be too favorably inclined towards the Jews, like s -- it turned out later some people in the state department were, he decided that the affidavit that Morris Beifuss gave my mother and my father was okay, but they -- he considered it insufficient because Mr. Beifuss had given X number of affidavits to other people.</span> <span id="s517">And they wanted an additional affidavit from somebody other than Mr. de -- Mr. Beifuss.</span> <span id="s518">Now, Mr. Beifuss was an extremely wealthy man, who lived on one of the main, glorious streets near the lake, and that broke our neck.</span> <span id="s519">So my father wrote to a very distant relative nobody liked, who lived in Texas, and who had come to Germany on occasion.</span> <span id="s520">And he was an alcoholic, and he hated everybody who didn’t drink with him.</span> <span id="s521">And my father was sure he was -- gotten into bad situation with this man because he would not drink with him.</span> <span id="s522">Well, he declined to give us an affidavit.</span> <span id="s523">And -- so you get the picture.</span> <span id="s524">My parents then tried to go to Uruguay.</span> <span id="s525">And it wasn’t just my parents, it was a cousin of theirs and another couple.</span> <span id="s526">And they fell into the hands of a smuggler, a very good looking young man who -- who was such a con artist, he persuaded everybody.</span> <span id="s527">Plus, they didn’t have too many options.</span> <span id="s528">They gave him a lot of money, and then he disappeared.</span> <span id="s529">So that -- that was -- what they should have done, I think, they should have just taken what they had on their backs and just tried to go either through France -- or France was already occupied, maybe, when was France -- I -- no, they could have gone through France, maybe to -- to Spain, etcetera.</span> <span id="s530">Some people managed to do that, but they didn’t do that, all right?</span> <span id="s531">So they still hoped for writing and getting on the additional affidavit and nothing panned out, and then it was ’38, and then was Kristallnacht, and -- and after that it only went downhill.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Did you know people who had l-left in that way?</span> <span id="s533">Just taken what was on their backs and crossed -- tried to cross the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: After the war, you had, but you --</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: I didn’t know anybody who did it during the war, I mean not among our friends.</span> <span id="s537">But after the war, actually there was a -- a cousin of my husband, she was married to a Polish Jew, who was a watchmaker, and he couldn’t make a go of anything, it was a wonderful guy.</span> <span id="s538">And they came to this country like that.</span> <span id="s539">And then he, first time in his life he had a wonderful job with Longine, and then he died of a bleeding ulcer.</span> <span id="s540">So you know, life is -- yeah, sometimes you can’t win.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Did -- do you remember having conversations with your parents, were your parents telling you we’re trying to go to --</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: -- United States, to Uruguay?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Oh yes, I -- by that time I was old enough --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Yes, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: -- not only old enough, my mother was working, my father was working by that time in Tiefbau, which means very hard labor, for which he probably didn’t get paid, you know, digging ditches, and construction, which was compulsory work because he had to give up his store in Düsseldorf, his wholesale store, because then an edict came out that Jews couldn’t have -- couldn’t own businesses any more.</span> <span id="s547">And then he was drafted to -- to work in -- in Tiefbau, which was digging basements and etcetera, and I don’t know exactly for what.</span> <span id="s548">And I don’t think he -- he got paid at all for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: So do you feel your circumstances getting worse and worse --</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: -- physically, because of the experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Oh yes, and -- and I was -- and then my -- our school was burned, and -- and there was -- we had very limited education.</span> <span id="s553">And there was only one teacher and his wife left, and there was a laundry, the Elsberg laundry in -- outside of Düsseldorf, and these people allowed us to have school there.</span> <span id="s554">There were only, you know, relatively few people.</span> <span id="s555">There was not an accredited school any more, because some people sent their children to Duisberg, which was -- still had an accredited Jewish school, and my brother went to Duisberg on the train, and got special permission to take the train because Jews weren’t allowed to go in the train any more.</span> <span id="s556">And so this is -- you know, I wi -- I -- then I had no more education, and I kept house for my parents, who were working very hard from morning to night.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Cause there’s no maid any more, there’s no [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: There’s nothing, you know, there was no maid after -- after we went to Düsseldorf.</span> <span id="s559">Things went downhill very, very fast, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Are you frightened at this point?</span> <span id="s561">Do you th -- do you have any recollection whether you’re frightened, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: I was never frightened.</span> <span id="s563">I always had that feeling that my parents go -- they were trying everything.</span> <span id="s564">They were going to get us out of this.</span> <span id="s565">And I was also very busy, I was learning English, I was learning Spanish, I was keeping house, I was taking care of my brother, who was four years younger than I was.</span> <span id="s566">And there was still that hope that this criminal is going to --</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: To stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: -- to stop, is going to be killed or something.</span> <span id="s569">And I remember in the last apartment we had, we -- my father -- this -- there were all non-Jews in that apartment, it was a most primitive apartment, but on the top floor was a couple, and he was a communist.</span> <span id="s570">And he was very anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s571">And when we went into the basements when there was an alarm, an air -- air strike alarm, my father and this man would be listening to the foreign senders.</span> <span id="s572">And it didn’t look good at that time.</span> <span id="s573">Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Okay, we have to stop and tape -- change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Yeah, I thought so.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Ursula, by 1938, have you, as a young person, been hearing about concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Nothing, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And you didn’t hear about people being taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Yes, people were taking aw -- being taken away, but nobody ever mentioned concentration camps.</span> <span id="s584">You know, the -- the Gestapo did incarcerate people, but somehow it did not sink through where these people were going.</span> <span id="s585">It was taken for granted they were going to some prisons, people were imprisoned.</span> <span id="s586">And not only Jews, but political prisoners.</span> <span id="s587">I remember distinctly I was in my grandmother Schenider’s house, who would go to church every Sunday morning, to a big Christian church, Evangelische Kirche in Dortmund.</span> <span id="s588">And my grandfather was suffering from cancer.</span> <span id="s589">And they were very fond of a minister who would visit my grandfather.</span> <span id="s590">And one day I was there on a Sunday, my grandmother comes home, her red -- her eyes are red, she is beyond herself because the -- the minister was taken off by black shirts when he was giving a sermon.</span> <span id="s591">And what he was telling his congregation is that they should be more tolerant, and what’s going on with the Jews was incomprehensible to him.</span> <span id="s592">And two black shirts came up, took him off the podium -- I mean, off the whatever you call it in a -- in a Protestant church, and he was never heard from again.</span> <span id="s593">And my -- my aunts told me that they heard that he was killed in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s594">So that has made a tremendous impression on me at that time, I remember that.</span> <span id="s595">And that was, you know, many, many years before people were routinely put into custody.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: But did they say the word concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: They didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: -- they just said --</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: It wasn’t part of our vocabulary.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: I see, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Were you worried about Walter traveling by himself on the train to go to the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: I wasn’t, maybe my parents were, but I wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: And he came back and forth every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Right, yeah, he came back and forth every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And what was it like for --</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: But he -- but -- but don’t forget, we didn’t wear this Jewish star yet at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: So, you know, it’s not too clear that anybody would have known that he was a Jewish child.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Did -- but there was an a -- an I.D. card?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: -- we had I.D. cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: And didn’t that say Jewish, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: And that said Jewish, I mean, if somebody would stop you, but how many people would have stopped a young boy and asked for the I.D. card?</span> <span id="s620">But that stop in -- that school in Duisberg closed, probably not too long, maybe six months or something after Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: I don’t know exactly, I don’t remember that too well.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Do you remember Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Oh yes, oh yes, I remember it very well.</span> <span id="s625">I remember it because somebody, and I don’t remember who it was, I think it probably was this neighbor of my parents, came down and told my mother to hide my father.</span> <span id="s626">And he was in a closet, and they never came into our house, as it turned out.</span> <span id="s627">And they -- a lot of men were being taken away, my -- my stepfather was taken away in Düsseldorf, my father was not.</span> <span id="s628">I’m not sure that he hid in our house, or somebody else’s house, that I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s629">All I remember distinctly is there was a raid before Kristallnacht, I think just a short time before Kristallnacht, where they went through Jewish homes and looked for, in quote, forbidden books.</span> <span id="s630">Now, forbidden books weren’t necessarily books by Jewish authors.</span> <span id="s631">Anyone who was who in literature was a forbidden book, whether it was Bernard Shaw, or what.</span> <span id="s632">And I will never forget this, my father was -- downstairs in the basement there was a wash cellar, and a big stove where people would boil their wash in those days.</span> <span id="s633">And my father was burning books, and he was practically crying.</span> <span id="s634">And h -- he said to me, “I am getting rid of my old friends.”</span> <span id="s635">And these were his books, because they were going through Jewish homes, and if you had a book that was on the forbidden list, forget it, they would arrest you.</span> <span id="s636">Now that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: So you watched him do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Was this very sad for you too, or was it sad because you saw how unhappy he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: He was very unhappy, and whenever he was unhappy it was very, very sad for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: You know, it -- it -- I mean, you sense when your parents are upset.</span> <span id="s643">I also sensed that my parents were trying so hard to get us out of Germany.</span> <span id="s644">And I remember maps on the floor, and studying South America, and ur -- Uruguay, and places like that, that they were hope there -- hope they were going to go, with their cousins.</span> <span id="s645">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Okay, we have to stop the tap -- is -- okay.</span> <span id="s647">[interruption] Oh, I’m sorry, I was confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: What did you see on Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s650">Did you see anything that night, or did you go out the next day and see the destruction?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Went out the next day and saw the destruction.</span> <span id="s652">My parents wouldn’t let us go out of -- get out of our apartment.</span> <span id="s653">I mean, my mother, I think.</span> <span id="s654">I don’t know, I think my father was -- somebody, probably that couple upstairs, the communists probably had him in their apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Now let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s656">Your fr -- people are wanting to protect your father because he’s known as Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: But your mother’s also known as Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Yeah, but they knew -- these people knew -- the Gestapo knew she was not from th -- racially Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: I see, so that she could be protected.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: And -- and -- yeah, and these people upstairs -- he was only a worker, but he was a very intelligent man, he was a communist and he -- he knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s662">He was constantly listening to what they call the Fremdhörer, which was the foreign sender, which was England, you know.</span> <span id="s663">So they were very well informed.</span> <span id="s664">I went out the next day, and there was nothing left of my school, it was all burned down.</span> <span id="s665">And my parents told me that the Düsseldorf fire department was there in full force, and they were putting hoses on the adjacent buildings, to make sure that the adjacent buildings weren’t burning down, and they let the Jewish buildings burn to the ground.</span> <span id="s666">And these were enormous buildings, I mean, stone buildings, it was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Did you now get frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No.</span> <span id="s671">I re -- when I think of it, it’s just incr -- incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: It’s incredible, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yeah, it’s incre -- I just can’t believe that this ever happened sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Were you known as a Mischling or not?</span> <span id="s675">You were --</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Not among -- not in school, and not -- no.</span> <span id="s677">I was a Mischling -- there were two kinds of Mischlingen.</span> <span id="s678">There were prefer -- preferential Mischlingen, those who were born to a Jewish parent, one Jewish parent, but raised either as a Protestant or a Catholic.</span> <span id="s679">They were the privil -- preferred -- preferential.</span> <span id="s680">And then there were the Judischer Mischlingen, that’s was me.</span> <span id="s681">I mean, was far as the racial politics go, I was still a Mischling.</span> <span id="s682">But I was a Jew, and I was registered with my brother in the Jewish community, and I was given the ri -- Jewish religion at birth, and so was my brother, so there was no question, and the Gestapo had all the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: And the Previligierter Mischlingen, they had a much easier life than the Jewish Mischlingen.</span> <span id="s685">They were able to go to -- to public school.</span> <span id="s686">I we -- we weren’t.</span> <span id="s687">And they were not really terribly persecuted until -- and I don’t know this distinctly, but somewhere at the very beginning of ’45, when they rounded up Christian Mischlingen, you know, the pref -- prefer -- pre -- preferential Mischlingen, and sent them to Terezín.</span> <span id="s688">Now what I only learned not terribly long ago, which I didn’t know, because we were deported from Terezín at the end of ’44 -- I mean, October of ’44, is that they were building gas chambers and ovens in Terezín, that I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s689">And that supposedly, I mean this is what -- and I really want to research this, that the ovens were already finished, the only thing that was missing were the doors.</span> <span id="s690">Now, whether they were going to shoot people, or put them -- o-or how they were going to kill them, but they had ovens.</span> <span id="s691">So, all these people, who felt relatively secure until ’45, wouldn’t have been very secure.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: When does Walter have to stop going to Duisberg t -- for school?</span> <span id="s693">Do you think it’s after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: So it’s the --</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: I think it was after Kristallnacht, but I don’t remember how -- how long afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: I have a pretty darn good memory, and as far as my experiences go -- you know, I have a diary f -- which I should have brought, and I forgot that, from 1945.</span> <span id="s699">So I should have, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: You wrote the diary in 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s704">I wrote it on the road back, on paper.</span> <span id="s705">And then I got to Lippborg and my aunt gave me the diary, and Buschi helped me be -- re -- I put it in my diary.</span> <span id="s706">Yeah, but that I didn’t think about, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So, at some point after Kristallnacht, Walter is home with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Right, and he has no schooling whatsoever --</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: So do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: -- except Uncle Karl, he got private lessons, and the Schnooks, and I don’t know if they perished, I probably should look it up.</span> <span id="s711">They probably perished.</span> <span id="s712">They were the last teachers, and they also gave private lessons to my brother, and to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: And were they paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: My parents paid them, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: So your parents were st --</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: I mean, they didn’t pay my -- my -- my uncle, but they --</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: -- they paid -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: So they’re working enough where there’s -- somehow there’s enough to pay people, a minimal amount, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Yeah, and also they had -- you know, they were constantly selling things.</span> <span id="s721">They still had a few paintings that they were selling, and my mother got rid of all her jewelry, she was selling things, you know, little by little.</span> <span id="s722">So that helped to a degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s724">Did you notice depression in your parents, or did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: They didn’t try to show it ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: When we were with them, and that lasted, believe it or not, all the way to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: My father tried to -- to put -- to hide from us as much as he could.</span> <span id="s730">I didn’t realize it, I only realized it later, because my father was transported out of Terezín about a year before we were all transported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s731">And he was working on the bunker that Hitler was -- they were building for Hitler in Berlin.</span> <span id="s732">And when he came back, he seemed to me like a different person.</span> <span id="s733">He wouldn’t talk about anything that happened to him working on this construction of the bunker in Berlin, but he -- he did tell me he was working with other people from concentration camps.</span> <span id="s734">And I think even though in Terezín most of us -- nobody knew that there was an Auschwitz, or there were extermination camps.</span> <span id="s735">I really -- later on am convinced that he got a full dose of what was going on from some of the people who are working with him in Berlin, and he never -- he never talked about his experience in Berlin, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: But you saw a change.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: I saw a change in him.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: So essentially the -- the good spirits, however you wish to describe it was a question of ignorance of -- in some way, or ignoring evidence --</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: No, he was -- he was trying to -- to be so supportive and to give us so much hope.</span> <span id="s742">He wanted us to live, and he wanted to see my mother again.</span> <span id="s743">And he did this even after he came back from Berlin, but somehow -- he was always a very open person, but whenever I asked about what happened, what was he doing in Berlin, he was like a closed book, he would -- just would not open up.</span> <span id="s744">But no, he never -- I mean he -- he was encouraging us all the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: So that must have been important for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: It was very important for us, very important.</span> <span id="s747">And that he also was able to give us a lot of food.</span> <span id="s748">You know, he -- he -- he was a man who had held an enormous position at Karstadt’s.</span> <span id="s749">He was a terrific mathematician.</span> <span id="s750">But he could do anything.</span> <span id="s751">He could work in construction.</span> <span id="s752">And in Terezín what he did when they asked him what his profession was, he didn’t say merchant or -- or whatever, he said he was a carpenter.</span> <span id="s753">And he ended up with a carpentry job in Terezín in the bauhof, which gave him the chance to steal as much wood as he could, to give it to the cooks, and to get extra food for us.</span> <span id="s754">So you -- do you get a picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Yes, of what kind of a person --</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Do you remember the start of the war in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Is that big news, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Well, it was big news.</span> <span id="s761">I think my parents expected it because Hitler was going into adjacent -- you know, he was taking over at first Austria and etcetera.</span> <span id="s762">But we -- our last apartment was right by the railroad tracks, which used to be an -- was a house -- an apartment house owned by a Jewish family, and this was the last place we were allowed to live in, and it was not in the best area.</span> <span id="s763">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s764">And we could see the railroad tracks from our apartment, and we saw the freight trains passing for hours and hours and hours, loaded with equipment.</span> <span id="s765">Guns, and you know, war equipment.</span> <span id="s766">And my father and my mother were talking about it, and it was clear to us that Hitler was preparing for something, and that he was going to take over another country.</span> <span id="s767">So my parents, yes, I mean, they tried to keep it from us, but I was too old by that time, and I realized that war seemed imminent.</span> <span id="s768">War seemed imminent and still there was hope, but war and extermination of the Jews just -- that’s something that they never put two and two together.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: So even all of these restrictions on the Jews, and the taking away of apartments --</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: -- and good jobs, etcetera --</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: -- did not mean to you that something dire was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: No, this guy eventually was going to -- I -- I thought we were going to be restricted in our apartment, which from where we came from was, you know, pretty going downhill.</span> <span id="s775">My parents had to work very hard.</span> <span id="s776">I was prepared that maybe they would put me into a -- into labor for some war effort or something.</span> <span id="s777">But it never occurred to me -- I mean, da -- can a healthy human mind picture what eventually happened?</span> <span id="s778">You know --</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: No, no and you --</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: -- at -- in 1939 you’re only 13, you may be --</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: -- more adult than you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: I was much more concerned reading books by Karl May, which was an author who was very popular, who had never been to America, and who wrote all these stories about the fights between Indians and cowboys.</span> <span id="s785">And I was reading these books, I mean, I didn’t read the books that little girls should read, I wrote these books, I -- it was -- I was insatiable.</span> <span id="s786">No -- and, you know, I’m -- I’m not sure whether -- what my parents, if they really thought that things were going to -- to get so bad that our life were threatened, they certainly didn’t show it.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: They didn’t say.</span> <span id="s788">Now, do you start dating at this age?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s790">I’m trying to think.</span> <span id="s791">There were only a relatively small number of people my age left in Düsseldorf.</span> <span id="s792">A lot of people had been able to get out of the country, and a lot of my friends had left, some of them legally and some illegally.</span> <span id="s793">But there were a bunch of people, some of them I wasn’t clo -- close with, but at least a half a dozen or so that I became very close to.</span> <span id="s794">They were older than I was by a few years.</span> <span id="s795">They were deported in 1941.</span> <span id="s796">I’m trying to think -- so I think I probably met Kurt in 1939, or ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: This is Kurt Eckstein?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: And he was learning to be an auto mechanic, because he felt, and his father felt -- his mother had died, that that would give him a better opportunity to emigrate into another country.</span> <span id="s801">And we -- we had -- we danced, we had a Victrola, and i -- I didn’t know how to dance, they taught me how to dance.</span> <span id="s802">There were a couple of people, they were half Jewish.</span> <span id="s803">Their father had been Christian and he had died, so they were left with their Jewish mother, and a gra -- and a Jewish grandmother.</span> <span id="s804">And they were the most good looking guys you had ever seen.</span> <span id="s805">Tall and blonde, and just terrific guys.</span> <span id="s806">And then there was a girl, and she was part of the group, and I didn’t care for her that much, I felt she was a loose girl.</span> <span id="s807">She let them touch her up and down and this is something that I just, you know, thought was really not right.</span> <span id="s808">And we had a very good time.</span> <span id="s809">And then in ’41, when the first transports were leaving Düsseldorf, they all went into that transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: The two boys and the girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: And the girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: But not you.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: No, and Kurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: And Kurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: And Kurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: And I gave a pledge to them that I would visit their grandmother.</span> <span id="s818">Their mother was deported too, but their grandmother wasn’t.</span> <span id="s819">So their grandmother was the only one left, and she was very old lady, she was kind of bent, and -- and inconsolable that -- and I went there a lot, and I don’t know what -- where she ended up, I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s820">She probably was deported to Terezín, and then, you know, Terezín was a transit camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: And they went to Minsk, that I know, that they went to Minsk.</span> <span id="s823">And in Minsk we now -- I just read an article about it not too long ago, they were all shot.</span> <span id="s824">So that was Kurt Eckstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: But Kurt was 18 [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Yeah, he was -- he --</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: -- and you were 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: No, I was a bit older than that, I was born in ’26, and Kurt -- how old was I in --</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Well, ’39 you’re 13.</span> <span id="s830">So when do you meet him?</span> <span id="s831">Somewhere ’39 - ’40, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Yeah, I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: So you’re 13 - 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: -- ’40 -- probably ’40, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: ’40, okay, so you’re 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Still not a grown woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: But I was very mature for my age --</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Yeah, I was going to ask --</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: -- and I tell you where I met him.</span> <span id="s841">I met him at my Uncle Karl’s house, who was my Spanish and English teacher, because Kurt was taking lessons from Uncle Karl, too.</span> <span id="s842">And Uncle Karl was vouching for Kurt, and rightly so, and he -- I remember, I mean my parents must -- now in retrospect that you ask me that, they must have had some questions about it.</span> <span id="s843">I remember Uncle Karl told my parents that he was the most wonderful kid, and he trusted him implicitly.</span> <span id="s844">And he had good reason to, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: So your parents were worried that he might try to take advantage of you in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yeah, because my parents knew from me, what was going on with Ruth and the other -- you know, the other two guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: But Ruth was older, and -- and I’m sure they -- they were sexually active.</span> <span id="s849">Well, I’m glad they were, you know, because they --</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Considering what happened, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: -- had -- they had, you know, they had a very short life left.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: And they seemed to -- you know, it’s very easy to stereotype somebody, she was a loose girl and all this kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s854">She was --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Well, especially when you’re that age, it’s very easy, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Right.</span> <span id="s857">And she was a very beautiful girl --</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: -- I remember, I was very jealous, she was very sexy looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Did you get your period?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Yeah, I -- I’m sure, yeah, I think I got it probably by the time I was 13, yeah.</span> <span id="s864">Yeah, I remember, yeah I did, yeah.</span> <span id="s865">But I was very, you know, I was very innocent.</span> <span id="s866">I didn’t -- I wasn’t -- you know, my mo -- my parents told me -- I knew where babies came from and all this, but I don’t think I thought about it very much.</span> <span id="s867">It never -- there were certain things you did and you didn’t do.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: And -- and I think th -- I think my parents were pretty open, but not like they are today, you know, I’m --</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Was it important for you to menstruate?</span> <span id="s871">Was th -- was that a big deal [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: I think I was frightened to death.</span> <span id="s873">I thought I was getting -- you know, I think I menstruated pretty early, but I don’t remember exactly, but I -- I know I went to my mother and there was something terribly wrong with me.</span> <span id="s874">So then I got a talk what this was all about, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Because you hadn’t know this before.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Right.</span> <span id="s879">Well.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Now, were you Bat-mitzvah’d?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: No, that was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: That was never done.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: -- that was never heard of in -- in Europe.</span> <span id="s884">That is a -- that’s an American invention.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: It is.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s888">So do things get even worse, ’39 and ’40, as the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: They -- they’re getting worse because we -- we can’t sit on benches any more because it says Jews can’t sit here.</span> <span id="s890">We can’t swim in the Rhine river any more because it says Jews can’t swim here any more.</span> <span id="s891">And -- and we can’t go to the movies.</span> <span id="s892">I remember when I was in school, and we used to walk -- from school we used to walk home, and we passed by a movie house, and there was a picture of a mouse playing the piano.</span> <span id="s893">We called it the American mouse, and we wanted so badly to see that picture, that Mickey Mouse picture, but there -- you couldn’t get in.</span> <span id="s894">There was a sign, Jews cannot enter.</span> <span id="s895">And Konigs Allee in Düsseldorf was like Fifth Avenue.</span> <span id="s896">And pretty soon there were signs all over, Jews can’t in -- enter, Jews can’t be serviced he -- served here any more, etcetera.</span> <span id="s897">Those were the stores that used to have, we speak English, parler Francais and all this as a -- for an international city.</span> <span id="s898">But on top of that we speak English and -- and parler Francais, no was, Jews can’t enter.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: So these kinds of signs proliferate --</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: All over.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: -- all over th -- the -- is it after the wa -- after 1939, between ’39 and ’41, it -- it gets considerably worse --</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: -- or it’s progressive from ’33, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Not from ’33, but it was -- it was gradual even from ’33, you couldn’t go to school, to a -- you couldn’t -- you -- do many things, but the -- these drastic steps were coming in very short intervals, starting really, I would say, from ’38 on.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s908">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: And then progressively worse and worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: And in ’41 you have to wear the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Yeah, and then we had to also have a new middle initial.</span> <span id="s912">Sarah and Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Israel for boys, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: -- or men.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: And then our stamps, our food stamps had Jude, Jew, stamped all through the food stamps, and if I went to a butcher shop with my food stamps -- I did all the shopping for the family because my mother worked.</span> <span id="s917">And if the butcher didn’t want to wait on us, he had a perfect right to do so, because we had Jewish food stamps.</span> <span id="s918">Or he -- they could turn us back not to come into their establishment when we -- when we had to wear the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s919">And then they -- the Nazi youth would beat us up.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Were you beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s922">I was scared to go out.</span> <span id="s923">And then they took my bicycle away, which was my form of transportation.</span> <span id="s924">You know, it was all gradually.</span> <span id="s925">Then they took all the jewelry away.</span> <span id="s926">And the only reason why I have things is because of my aunts.</span> <span id="s927">Because, don’t forget, I wouldn’t have a si -- I wouldn’t have the -- a -- anything, I wouldn’t even have some of the documents I’m going to give to you if it weren’t for my aunts, because my mother couldn’t keep them either.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Even the police -- the police Aufenthaltsbescheingung, where you have to -- to inform them that you’re leaving, I have that, I’m going to -- End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Ursula, we’re in sort of ’39 - ’40 - ’41, we’re in that period of time --</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Okay, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: -- when things are progressively getting much worse --</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: -- for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: And I think when we ended the last tape, you were talking about even your bicycle was confiscated --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: -- so your mode of transportation is lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: I wanted to know if you had bad dreams that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: I don’t recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: You don’t recall any bad dreams?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Cause I was just wondering if your anxiety was coming out somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: I think -- it depends on the person, I think I’m -- it’s very difficult to analyze yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: But I think when there is tremendous pressure, I get -- become very strong.</span> <span id="s949">And I think that was actually true when I was a young teenager, and I think that I would never be -- have the tendency to kind of self-indulge and feel sorry for myself.</span> <span id="s950">It was always the idea of keep on going and survive.</span> <span id="s951">And I think that -- I’m -- don’t know where it came from, it comes from my parents too, and I think it helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s952">It helped me in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s953">I mean, if you ask me the same question about Auschwitz, I can only tell you that I wrapped myself into a cocoon and I was living inwards.</span> <span id="s954">And somehow, it sounds strange or unbelievable to a lot of people, but it’s the truth.</span> <span id="s955">What happened outside of me, even when that woman was shot in front of me, it somehow didn’t totally touch me inside.</span> <span id="s956">You know, I was able to do that, and I didn’t do it consciously, it came just naturally.</span> <span id="s957">The defenses kind of helped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s959">But up until the deportation, you had your entire family, who was al -- who couldn’t protect you from everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: But there was a kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: -- buffer for you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: There was, and -- certainly, and I think what helps people young and old is when they are very, very busy and focused.</span> <span id="s965">And I was very busy.</span> <span id="s966">I was studying English and Spanish, I was getting some education by hook or by crook, which the Nazis didn’t want us to have, and I was keeping house, and I was cooking.</span> <span id="s967">And my father worked from dawn till dusk in construction, and my mother worked very hard in the factory, in the belt factory.</span> <span id="s968">So I didn’t have that much time, and somehow I was able, the little time when I had some was at night, and I wasn’t supposed to read in bed until 12, one or two o’clock at night, but I did that, and I always had a flashlight, I actually, you know, read by flashlight.</span> <span id="s969">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Did you read under the covers, or over?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Yes, when they -- well, I listened if somebody was coming, because they knew that I was reading, and I was reprim -- reprimanded many, many times, but those were the only times that I really could read.</span> <span id="s972">I was very busy, you know, taking --</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: What were you reading?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Oh, junk.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Was that the only thing that was available?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: No, but it appealed to me, these -- these western stories.</span> <span id="s977">I must have read every one of these Karl May books, which --</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: They were really popular, weren’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: They were really popular, and they were really boys’ books.</span> <span id="s980">And there were some girls’ books that were very popular, but I didn’t go for those.</span> <span id="s981">I went for the Karl May books, and I didn’t go for the nice girl books, and the romance stuff, but for the Indians and the wars, and I don’t know.</span> <span id="s982">A psychologist has to decide what’s in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: And where did you get the books from?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: I got them in school when I was still going to my school, and then my father got some for me because I was so interested in -- in them.</span> <span id="s985">And I don’t really remember, maybe my aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Tell me, did your father burn all of his books, or a selected group?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: No, just the books that he knew were on the forbidden list.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: But don’t forget, my father had a tremendous library when we were in -- in Aplerbeck, in that suburb there of Dortmund.</span> <span id="s990">And then, by the time they moved to Düsseldorf, they had to get into a much smaller apartment, and they had lost a lot, and he had sold a lot of things.</span> <span id="s991">What he did with some of the books that he did not take to Düsseldorf, whether he gave them away, or sold them -- I know they tried to sell a lot of things, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s992">But certainly that whole set of furniture, that was sold, I know that, in -- in his study.</span> <span id="s993">It was beautiful furniture with a bookcase that covered almost the whole wall, and leather chair and -- and a -- and a big desk, because I know that so well, I’m not -- wasn’t supposed to go into my father’s study, but I often did, when I know nobody was around, and I was rummaging around, and I did read some books that were kind of forbidden books for me, which were in his library and had a lot of sex in it.</span> <span id="s994">I don’t think I understood a lot of it, but I read it.</span> <span id="s995">My parents didn’t know that I read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Tell me about your brother during this period.</span> <span id="s997">Now, he’s not going to school, but he’s significantly younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Well, he went to school longer than I did, because when our school was burned down, d -- Duisberg was the only --</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: -- Jewish school that was still in existence, and so he traveled by train with a permit to Duisberg, and that was before we had to wear the star.</span> <span id="s1001">And he -- wa -- he -- he got some additional tutoring from my Uncle Karl, and my father did a lot of tutoring in math, which was his strength, I mean, he was a man who -- who could give you fractions and anything by ha -- in his head.</span> <span id="s1002">He didn’t even have to use a pen and a -- a pencil and paper.</span> <span id="s1003">So he did get s -- instruction.</span> <span id="s1004">He also had a very beautiful voice, and he -- and he loved to sing.</span> <span id="s1005">So wi -- you know, we made the most of what we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Did he help you with the housework, was he in the house a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: No, not particular.</span> <span id="s1008">I mean, I think he was willing probably, if I asked him something, but in Germany that was really a girl’s work and a woman’s work.</span> <span id="s1009">Not -- my father would do anything, but I’m -- I don’t particularly recall that I asked him to do much in the house.</span> <span id="s1010">I probably asked him to go and -- and buy certain things, or go to the store, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: But was that also difficult because there were certain hours only when you could go to the store, or you could be refused easily?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Well, we could be refused, but it was worse after we wore the star.</span> <span id="s1013">See, before we wore the star, people didn’t yi -- know you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1014">In Düsseldorf some of the people did know, who know the Lennebergs, which was a family who had lived in Düsseldorf for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s1015">I mean, they’re a very established family.</span> <span id="s1016">But I recall mostly being beaten up and being refused when we first had these food stamps which had printed Jude all through them.</span> <span id="s1017">And when we -- certainly after we had to wear the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: And who beat you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Well, bunch of kids who came out of school, and many of them in uniform.</span> <span id="s1020">The Hitler youth and the BDM, I mean they were uniformed, and you know some people have made the connection, oh they are like -- they were like the boy scouts, and the girl scouts, well they were not.</span> <span id="s1021">They were indoctrinated.</span> <span id="s1022">They had leaders who actually told their -- the young people under them that it was their duty as good Germans -- and I’m talking now about Germans, not about Jews, to listen to their fathers, and -- to their father and mother and grandparents and family, and if they heard anything in the house, that anybody in their family said something derogatory about the Führer, it was their duty to tell him.</span> <span id="s1023">This was the -- the leader, the boy scout le -- the youth leader.</span> <span id="s1024">And there were many people who found themselves in trouble because their own children denounced them.</span> <span id="s1025">And these were the kids who were made to feel like heroes if they di -- did that.</span> <span id="s1026">And their leaders were usually young guys in their late teens, who were good scouts, very good hikers, you know, like -- like the boy scouts.</span> <span id="s1027">And -- somebody they could look up to.</span> <span id="s1028">They wanted to be as good as climbing mountains and -- and swimming and all this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1029">And they were much more impressionable when these young people talked to them, and told them was to do, than their parents, which is a normal thing even in a normal society.</span> <span id="s1030">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1031">And then if -- especially after we wore the star, there were bunch of kids, they had these meetings almost on a nightly basis, where they were indoctrinated, they sang the Hitler songs.</span> <span id="s1032">And they came out of these meetings, and if they saw a Jew, they would beat him up.</span> <span id="s1033">And it’s mu -- it’s much easier for 10 kids to do it than for one.</span> <span id="s1034">One would start, oh, there’s a Jew, come on.</span> <span id="s1035">And then they would start saying, Jude ist signate spitze augen ecke, arschloch dreckig, which is -- it’s very vulgar, you know, I translated it in my book, but the Jew with the -- with the pointy nose, and a dirty asshole, and you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s1036">And that’s what we were subjected to every day when we were out.</span> <span id="s1037">I hated to go out any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Did you fight back when they beat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Oh, no, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: -- if you fought back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: It was worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: -- and I was -- that’s one thing my parents told me, never to fight with BDM, which were the girls, or the Hitler youth, because if you were one person they would gang up on you, and certainly the police would come, and y -- I would have put my parents into harm’s way, too.</span> <span id="s1044">Who told you to do that?</span> <span id="s1045">Did your parents indoctrinate you to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: So were you hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: No, I was never hurt.</span> <span id="s1048">I was pushed against the wall a coup -- people were hurt, I knew people who were hurt, but I was never hurt.</span> <span id="s1049">And my parents asked me couldn’t I do my shopping and stuff at a certain time, and don’t go out in the late afternoon, and then pretty soon it was resolved, we weren’t allowed to go out at dusk any more anyway.</span> <span id="s1050">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: So in July of 1942, you get a notice to go to Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Yeah, I was the f --</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: And on -- and only you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Only I, I was the first one to get that notice.</span> <span id="s1055">And my parents -- which again, you know, I was a young girl, I didn’t quite a -- quite appreciate what my parents must have gone through.</span> <span id="s1056">And I remember their discussions, what are they going to do.</span> <span id="s1057">They would refer to me as a child, even though, you know, by -- by that time, in f -- in ’42 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: You’re 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: I was 16.</span> <span id="s1060">They can’t let their child go alone.</span> <span id="s1061">And then they also, rightly so felt, well now, she’s going to go now to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s1062">Nobody knew about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1063">Extermination camps, nobody had -- could even imagine.</span> <span id="s1064">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1065">Now then, she’s going to go to one labor camp, and then maybe next month Bübchen, my brother would be sent to another labor camp, and my father -- we would all be separated.</span> <span id="s1066">So I know they went through a terrible time, trying to figure out what to do.</span> <span id="s1067">The conclusion they made was wrong, they should have let me go alone, but they didn’t, and they all volunteered to go with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Including your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Including my mother.</span> <span id="s1070">And I had -- believe I had mentioned before that Puetz, who was the head of the Gestapo, hated my mother.</span> <span id="s1071">And I’m sure it was just to hurt her, certainly no -- he knew where we were going, but certainly not out of compassion that he wasn’t going to let her go with us.</span> <span id="s1072">And he probably felt because I say this since he pursued my mother at the factory where she was working, at the Schreyeck’s, almost on a weekly basis, he probably felt that if he couldn’t have her, if -- he was going to trap her, and she was going to -- to get to what the Germans used to call numero sicher, number secure, which was a camouflage word for sending people to prison.</span> <span id="s1073">So then he said she couldn’t go with us, and she appealed, and no way was he going to allow her to go with us.</span> <span id="s1074">So my brother and my father and I, we were deported.</span> <span id="s1075">And in Düsseldorf they had a wonderful place to deport Jews from, which was a Düsseldorf slaughterhouse, the Schlachthof.</span> <span id="s1076">The reason was probably partially vicious and partially convenience, because the Schlachthof had a lot of train rails, so they could divert trains to the Schlachthof without having a spectacle at the main train station deporting the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Do you think this guy Puetz wanted to have a relationship with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Oh, I’m sure of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: You’re sure of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: I’m sure of it not just from my mother, but I’m sure of it from things my father said, and what the Schreyecks have said.</span> <span id="s1081">Because even under the circumstances my mother was racially not a Jew.</span> <span id="s1082">And this was a racial thing, and after he had made sure she couldn’t go with us to the camp, he still pursued her, you know, which was somewhat unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1084">At the time -- w-were you included in the conversation about what to do, whether they all should go, or you should go alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Not directly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Not directly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: No.</span> <span id="s1088">I was included, of course, when we had to make a similar decision in Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: But at that time it was mostly my parents.</span> <span id="s1091">And I know that they didn’t get any sleep, that they were constantly throwing it back and forth.</span> <span id="s1092">And I would have to make it up, and I don’t do that.</span> <span id="s1093">I try to be as truthful to my memory as I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Whether I said something, I can go alone, which is probably -- it’s most likely I said it, but I can’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: So I don’t want to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Do you have any recollection of feeling relieved that you weren’t going alone?</span> <span id="s1099">Do you have any recollection of what it felt like once the decision was made?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: I don’t think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Cause you may not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: -- I don’t think I remember having that kind of reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: I think it was a terrible trauma for me, for my father, which I sensed.</span> <span id="s1105">I mean, even though he tried to have a stiff upper lip, but that he wasn’t able to do any more.</span> <span id="s1106">I was getting older, and I knew my father.</span> <span id="s1107">And this separation from my mother was very, very difficult for him.</span> <span id="s1108">And times were so uncertain.</span> <span id="s1109">But yeah, I can’t really --</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: So are you folks hearing any rumors in 1942 about what happened when the Nazis go into Russia?</span> <span id="s1111">When World War ІІ fully starts in 1941?</span> <span id="s1112">You don’t hear anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: No, we only hear what the Nazis told us in their propaganda.</span> <span id="s1114">We heard through my father’s communist friend in the same building, and when my father listened to also, which was British news, what was happening in the world, in the war.</span> <span id="s1115">And it didn’t sound very good at that time, as you know.</span> <span id="s1116">But nobody that I know of ever made any -- gave any explanation to what happened in the camps.</span> <span id="s1117">And as you know, that even when people managed to escape some of the camps, and try to bring it to the attention of the American government, which I didn’t know, we -- we only learned that, you know, after the war, nobody wanted to listen, nobody wanted to -- to believe it.</span> <span id="s1118">And what I have to say to you is had I not been in Auschwitz, had I not been a witness, had not -- had I not seen what I have seen, I’m not sure I could believe it.</span> <span id="s1119">A teacher at one of the high schools was very upset with two students.</span> <span id="s1120">It’s a very large high school in a working class area in -- in New Jersey, and in New Jersey it’s compulsory to teach about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1121">And these kids, at least one of them claimed, and maybe the other one agreed then, that this was all made up, this never happened, and when she said, “Well, we’re going to have a speaker who was there,” they made fun of that.</span> <span id="s1122">So when I came to this high school with ha -- which has two and a half thousand students, I was told that these two guys will be put right in the front in the auditorium.</span> <span id="s1123">And their attitude was such I knew this meant trouble.</span> <span id="s1124">So I made eye contact with them, and I said, “I understand that there are some people here who believe and are convinced that this never happened.”</span> <span id="s1125">And they were, you know, they were perking up.</span> <span id="s1126">And then I said, “Well, I can understand it.</span> <span id="s1127">If I hadn’t been there, I wouldn’t believe it either.”</span> <span id="s1128">And from then on, I had no more problem with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: You know, it disarmed them.</span> <span id="s1131">But I didn’t say this t -- just to calm them down, I really mean that.</span> <span id="s1132">This is totally, totally incomprehensible to any normal human being, what I saw.</span> <span id="s1133">Totally.</span> <span id="s1134">And so I -- I -- I really think it’s beyond a civilized person’s comprehension.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Well let me ask you, you must have met people -- this is going beyond where we are in the time, but you must have met people who went through something of what you went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Perhaps were even in the camps longer than you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Who did realize what was happening before they saw it.</span> <span id="s1140">Do you -- do you have an understanding of how some people can imagine this happening?</span> <span id="s1141">There were people who left Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: This -- this guy who said, you know, I forget who it was, who left and said the -- you know, soon you’re not going to be able to ride the buses, and everybody was laughing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: So he seemed to be able to imagine at least some stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Yeah, but he was one in a million.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: I mean, don’t get my statistics --</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Yeah, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: -- I didn’t mean this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: It doesn’t ma --</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: -- you know.</span> <span id="s1153">I think ho -- Mr. Rosenstein was very different from the majority of Jews.</span> <span id="s1154">I can’t talk about the eastern Jews.</span> <span id="s1155">They -- except I have friends, and I made friends in the displaced person camp, and I made friends in the camps, who came from cultured eastern Jewish families.</span> <span id="s1156">I’m not talking about that.</span> <span id="s1157">I mean the shtetl Jews.</span> <span id="s1158">They were different from a lot of us, and they were much more in their own circle, and I don’t know how they reacted.</span> <span id="s1159">I -- I have -- I have no clue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Some of them had been subjected to persecution in Poland and in Russia in the -- in the shtetl, but I just could never have imagined what happened.</span> <span id="s1162">And I think these unconscious decisions, believe me, there were many people who fell to pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: People who ran to the wire to electrocute themselves.</span> <span id="s1165">The only time Buschi and I and Zdena were thinking about that, when we were going to be transported back to Auschwitz, because we knew what was awaiting us.</span> <span id="s1166">But the instincts to live are very, very strong, and are stronger in some people than in others.</span> <span id="s1167">The strength physically of some people, can not be measured in height or weight.</span> <span id="s1168">It is something else.</span> <span id="s1169">I think that supports means a great deal.</span> <span id="s1170">Now maybe if I would have been all alone someplace in an extermination camp, without anybody to support me, but I with all the mizaira, I had the luck to be with these five women, and the way we supported each other really helped us, and helped us to, as I like to put it, put ourselves into a cocoon and not to even be aware of what was happening outside of us.</span> <span id="s1171">So we all need some support, and it can’t --it cannot all come from the inside, but a lot of it does come from the inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: But tell me, do you remember what it was like in the slaughterhouse as you were waiting?</span> <span id="s1173">Had you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: It wasn’t -- it was confusion, and we didn’t know -- we knew we were going to a -- in cold -- in quote, labor camp called Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1175">Well, I had no clue what Theresienstadt was, we knew -- we knew that.</span> <span id="s1176">We were told that the transport would go to Theresienstadt, and we knew it was in what was then Czechoslovakia, and we had our --</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Is that what the notice said to you, or did the notice just order a deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: The notice just ordered us whether the -- the Jewish Judische Gemeinde is a Jewish organization in Düsseldorf, whether they were told that it would go to Theresienstadt, but I, myself didn’t remember that particularly, how we found out, but the -- the piece of paper I’m going to give to you, in my father’s handwriting, at the police station in Düsseldorf, where he had to notify them that he was leaving Düsseldorf, in that it says Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: So -- you see?</span> <span id="s1181">So I know that somehow we knew we were -- I knew we were -- knew we were going to Theresienstadt, but how we were informed of that, I cannot rec -- recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: So even though he was being deported, he has to go to the police station and tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yeah, I gave it -- I have that piece of paper for you.</span> <span id="s1184">I have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Quite amazing, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: It’s an apmeldunk for my brother, and with our names, Ursula Sarah, Otto Israel, and Walter Israel.</span> <span id="s1187">So that -- that piece of paper is in there.</span> <span id="s1188">I don’t think I’ve given you these papers yet.</span> <span id="s1189">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Quite amazing.</span> <span id="s1191">Okay, we’re going to have to stop the tape now and change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: What was it like in that slaughterhouse?</span> <span id="s1196">Were there just hundreds of thousands of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Well, is -- that was like bedlam, and don’t forget, by that time, in ’42, a number of transports had already left Düsseldorf at the end of ’41, and at the very beginning of ’42, and -- which were not going to Terezín, but many of them had gone to Poland.</span> <span id="s1198">And a lot of the people in our transport were quite old, and not in good physical condition.</span> <span id="s1199">And I remember there were tables which were manned by Gestapo secret police, and there was one table which was manned by a representative of -- from the Jewish community, which had the list of names of all the Jews in Düsseldorf, who belonged -- who -- o-of Jewish faith, and the Jewish community had this list.</span> <span id="s1200">And they were checked off, you know the Germans were very good at ch -- at anything that was lists or bureaucracy.</span> <span id="s1201">And so we were checked off by the Jewish -- a representative of the Jewish community, and we were checked off by the SS, to be sure that everybody who had gotten -- gotten the notification to present themselves had appeared.</span> <span id="s1202">And then we had to go to another person, a -- a Nazi at a -- at a table where the name, like Ursula Pawel was twice now -- Jewish community the -- the SS, and then the secret police, a third one, were given a sign, which were put on around our neck, which I don’t recall whether it had a number, that I can’t recall, but it had my name on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: On the front?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1205">Everybody on -- in the transport was given a sign.</span> <span id="s1206">It wasn’t huge, you know, it was a sign that -- with a string around the neck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: And was this -- do you remember if it was handwritten?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: I think it was.</span> <span id="s1209">It might not have been all of it, but certainly the number, I think, was handwritten, and if I recall it correctly, it was written with pretty heavy black ink, or you know, pen or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: And you were supposed to wear this on the train -- wear this [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Oh yes, we had to wear this on the train, and then we were told to put our suitcases at a certain place and not to touch them, they were going to take care of the suitcases.</span> <span id="s1212">Of course, we never saw the suitcases again.</span> <span id="s1213">These were the suitcases that had been packed for -- from 1938 on, to go to this country.</span> <span id="s1214">And if it hadn’t been for the American consul, we would have been in this country.</span> <span id="s1215">And those suitcases, we never saw again.</span> <span id="s1216">N-Nobody on the transport.</span> <span id="s1217">The only thing that we were allowed to keep was some hand luggage, which was made out of like -- like a small rucksack material, which I remember I had, it was one of those, like when you go on a hiking trip, and it was a bag like that.</span> <span id="s1218">Now, that’s all I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: And what -- do you remember what was in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: I can’t recall exactly.</span> <span id="s1221">Probably some food or something, but n-nothing that I remem -- no clothing, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: And this was the summer.</span> <span id="s1223">So what were you we -- were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: -- you had nothing for cold weather, obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: And was it very hot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: It was extremely hot, and we -- we -- when we arrived by train in Baushowiczy, which was Bauschowitz, because there was no train station, no rails to Terezín, they were only built later for the sole purpose of transporting Jews from Terezín to the east.</span> <span id="s1229">But we arrived in Bauschowitz, and there were trucks there with Czechs who had been in Terezín since ’41, and some of them had striped uniforms on, which also was not continued, you know, after more and more transport arrived, they did not give uniforms to inmates any more.</span> <span id="s1230">And they had to -- they worked for the Nazis to -- to take all the luggage out of the luggage cars, and put them on trucks.</span> <span id="s1231">And of course, they were then transported back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1232">We were given some clothing later on in Terezín, which -- what transport they came from I don’t know, but they were pretty bad clothing.</span> <span id="s1233">But as far -- y -- one thing I do remember, that my mother insisted that we wear our coats.</span> <span id="s1234">Now why she insisted that, I don’t know, but it was something we did not put in our luggage.</span> <span id="s1235">We either had it on our arm, and so we did have our coats.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: And these coats, I remember these coats, and my mother reminded me many times, because she had a German tailor who was an anti-Nazi and was very good to -- to her, and he -- she got some material and he made these coats for us.</span> <span id="s1238">So they were supposed to also take us to America.</span> <span id="s1239">So my brother -- and I remember the coat too, because I blamed the coat very much on the fact that my -- my brother was selected immediately to be -- to be killed.</span> <span id="s1240">You know, he was 13 years old, and he was of average height for his age.</span> <span id="s1241">He had a very young face, and he had this coat, which he had outgrown.</span> <span id="s1242">And a boy with a coat, with a gray coat -- and you know with a -- half the arms are -- are showing, it makes a young child even look younger.</span> <span id="s1243">So, you know, you can argue.</span> <span id="s1244">I went through this in my mind, you know, how big was he, because there were some kids they were 14, by some -- somehow they managed to survive, but my brother didn’t.</span> <span id="s1245">He looked like a -- a young kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: When you got on the train to go to Terezín, what sort of a train was it?</span> <span id="s1247">Was it a passenger train, was it a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: They had some passenger cars, and they had some cattle cars, and we were in the passenger car.</span> <span id="s1249">And I am not sure that it -- there was any significance to that, whether this was calculated or not.</span> <span id="s1250">And I remember the two people who were on the train with us, and in the same -- on the same bench, or whatever you want to call it, and one was a nurse, Bella, and one was a woman my father knew, he -- she was a radiologist in Boston.</span> <span id="s1251">And they were in the same compartment.</span> <span id="s1252">There were other people in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: A radiologist in Boston?</span> <span id="s1254">You just said --</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: In -- in Düsseldorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Ah, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Yeah, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: I didn’t mean that.</span> <span id="s1260">Sorry about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: I think my association with saying Boston is because as you know, I went into x-ray, and I was in touch with a lot of radiologists in Boston.</span> <span id="s1263">No, she was from Düsseldorf, and she was on the transport, and I don’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1264">I mean, I know they got to Terezín, but I don’t know what happened to them, and I couldn’t -- I couldn’t remember the physician’s last name, I only remember Bella.</span> <span id="s1265">I was very impressed with them, because there was a lot of medical language going back and forth between Bella, who was a nurse, and this physician.</span> <span id="s1266">And I thought that would be really neat for me to be in medicine.</span> <span id="s1267">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Was that a terrible trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: I don’t recall that it was terrible for me.</span> <span id="s1270">I think it was terrible for older people, and some of them were in cattle cars.</span> <span id="s1271">We were in a passenger car.</span> <span id="s1272">I think that we had some food that my mother had prepared for us in our sidebags, and somehow between the conversation we had, and my father had a -- some -- there was some men he was friendly with, and they had lively conversations.</span> <span id="s1273">We weren’t depressed.</span> <span id="s1274">I think he was more than we were because of the separation from my mother, but I’m not sure that I understood, or that anybody understood what we were facing, because we were going to go to this wonderful labor camp, and then somebody spread the word this was a privileged camp for German Jews.</span> <span id="s1275">And when we came to Terezín, the first thing that was very difficult for me was the language.</span> <span id="s1276">The Czech prisoners descended on the train, and this was a language I’d never heard in my life, and I couldn’t make out what they were saying.</span> <span id="s1277">And most Czechs speak German, especially educated Czechs.</span> <span id="s1278">Of course, we all hated anything German.</span> <span id="s1279">And even though we were Jews in Terezín, do you think the Czechs would have spoken one word -- the ch -- Czech Jews would have spoken one word of German with us?</span> <span id="s1280">I mean, I was completely lost.</span> <span id="s1281">And I tried to -- to get some help from some Czech inmates.</span> <span id="s1282">As soon as they heard German, that was like raising the red flag, you know.</span> <span id="s1283">So we had to -- we had to really battle on more than one front.</span> <span id="s1284">And the Czechs had come to Terezín, they were the first people to come to Terezín.</span> <span id="s1285">So all the good quarters were occupied by Czechs.</span> <span id="s1286">The jobs that were really good, like in the kitchen were by the ch -- the Czechs already held those.</span> <span id="s1287">And I was just very lucky.</span> <span id="s1288">A lot of people weren’t as lucky as I was.</span> <span id="s1289">I immediately volunteered to work.</span> <span id="s1290">And they asked me if I had any experience working with children.</span> <span id="s1291">They first send me to the bauhof, which was my father worked, to carry wood and stuff.</span> <span id="s1292">But then I had told them that I was good with children, and what made me do that, I have no clue.</span> <span id="s1293">And then I got in t -- was told to present myself, that they were going to send me to work in the youth home -- the youth barrack, L410 it was first, and then it was 414.</span> <span id="s1294">And it was -- the youth barrack was just starting, it was at the very beginning.</span> <span id="s1295">We -- we didn’t really have -- there were some pr -- rooms didn’t even have beds, so we got thre -- three tier bunkbeds, and my father did a lot of work to make it more livable for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: So, are you taking care o -- didn’t at some point you also take care of teenage kids, or did you go immediately to the orphans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Yeah, my first job in the youth home was really -- not to have my -- the sole responsibility, but I was working with Hilde Dublon, who was at least four years older than I was, she came from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1298">And she was what was called the head betreuer, you know, the chief betreuer, chief caretaker of the 30 children in our room.</span> <span id="s1299">They were -- some were between 14 and 16 years old in the first room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: So they’re not much younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: No, no, but somehow I -- I got that.</span> <span id="s1302">I was quite mature in my ways.</span> <span id="s1303">And Hilde and I hit it off beautifully.</span> <span id="s1304">There was never any tension, or any rivalry, and I loved her.</span> <span id="s1305">She was a beautiful woman, very intelligent woman.</span> <span id="s1306">And then we had a few terrible situations health-wise in Terezín.</span> <span id="s1307">We had a lot of lice, and particularly Kleider Lause, which are the lice that cause typhoid -- typhus.</span> <span id="s1308">The bad stuff, not the paratyphoid, but the bad stuff.</span> <span id="s1309">And they lay their eggs in the seams of clothing, and they transmit that disease.</span> <span id="s1310">And there was an epidemic that broke out, which nobody realized was typhus, and some of the kids in our room got sick.</span> <span id="s1311">And then there were kids in other rooms that got sick, and they had -- we didn’t know what the symptoms were, and we had some very good Czech doctors, but they had no medicines, and they had no way of combating these illnesses.</span> <span id="s1312">And then we lost a couple of kids, and then Hilde got sick.</span> <span id="s1313">And we didn’t associate it w-with the other deaths, we didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s1314">And she told me she couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1315">Now for anybody not to be hungry in Terezín, you really had to be sick.</span> <span id="s1316">So, she had her rations on the plate, and she couldn’t finish it.</span> <span id="s1317">And I shared the same bunkbed with her, there were three -- they were three story high -- stories high, and we had the top bunkbed.</span> <span id="s1318">And Hilde said, “You know, I can’t eat my food, do you want to finish it?”</span> <span id="s1319">So I finished her food.</span> <span id="s1320">And you know, typhus is very contagious, and I’m not even sure whether I used another spoon, we weren’t very careful.</span> <span id="s1321">And one day Hilde died.</span> <span id="s1322">And we lost a few more kids.</span> <span id="s1323">It was a terrible epidemic.</span> <span id="s1324">And then we were told by Dr. Freund who also perished -- he was a gorgeous guy, a Czech guy, and the most bud -- bud -- body, I tell you, everybody was in love with this guy, but unfortunately he was married.</span> <span id="s1325">And he -- what this man did, he did -- he was a fairly young doctor, he was maybe in his mid to late 30’s, and he -- these doctors di -- did heroic things, they had no medicines, they tried everything they could.</span> <span id="s1326">And he said to me, “The first thing you have to do is clean this place.”</span> <span id="s1327">And we did get some Lysol, and we had a cleaning procedure that we cleaned every bunkbed.</span> <span id="s1328">And we had the floors, and the walls, and everybody helped, and the place stank from Lysol.</span> <span id="s1329">And then the ghetto elders sh -- told everybody they had to -- they had to clean their places, that was the only way to stop the epidemic, and eventually the -- we managed to stop it.</span> <span id="s1330">And my father and my brother got typhus too, but he did not get the real typhus, he got the paratyphus, which gives people a fever, but doesn’t affect their body the way the real typhus does, and he recovered from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: And did you get typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: No, I didn’t get a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Even though you had eaten --</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: I had eaten, I was next to her, I ha -- I got nothing.</span> <span id="s1335">I -- I -- how can you explain it?</span> <span id="s1336">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1337">Then we had another epidemic after -- well, let me go on first.</span> <span id="s1338">These were older ch -- young people, and they needed a -- what they called a betreuer, a person in charge of the young people, which was really 24 hour job.</span> <span id="s1339">And they needed somebody for younger children in another room.</span> <span id="s1340">And the head of our youth home, Sigi Kwasniewski, who also perished, told me that he was going to give me a room by myself, and as there were at least 30 children in there, but that they were younger children, and a lot of them were orphans, and a lot of them had come from Poland.</span> <span id="s1341">And they didn’t know what happened to their parents.</span> <span id="s1342">And some of them were quite traumatized, but wouldn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1343">Th -- I got that room, but then Sigi Kwasniewski decided it was too much for one person.</span> <span id="s1344">There was another woman from Vienna, Trude Blau, who was made the head betreuer in that room, she was quite a bit older than I was.</span> <span id="s1345">She also had an affair with Sigi Kwasniewski, and that wasn’t a happy time for me.</span> <span id="s1346">She was not an easy person to -- to deal with, and she was very ambitious, and eventually I -- she married Sigi Kwasniewski, and she got a job in the -- what do they call it, the office of kanzlei, and I had the sole responsibility for my room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Was that better?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Much better.</span> <span id="s1349">Oh, I was all ready to quit.</span> <span id="s1350">I was ready -- I was going to go -- I hated to do that to -- to -- it’s -- it’s the strange thing.</span> <span id="s1351">You know, my mother and my aunts sent uncountable packages to the Red Cross, with fictitious senders, but I knew where they came from, because it came from -- anything close to my aunts.</span> <span id="s1352">And there were a few packages that came from Vienna, and my father recognized my mother’s handwriting, and he was sure my mother was alive in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1353">But she made up all these -- these people, you know.</span> <span id="s1354">Marie Unterbottom, and you -- you name it, I mean, and she made up addresses.</span> <span id="s1355">And my aunt told me -- my aunts, after the war, that they constantly sent packages.</span> <span id="s1356">And my aunt did a lot of bartering because her husband made furniture, and it was in an area that was totally unaffected by the war, and she would barter with the -- with the farmers, and then she could use some of the stuff to get vitamins and things, and also sausage that was highly smoked so it wouldn’t spoil.</span> <span id="s1357">And even if we only got 10 or 20 percent of the packages -- it didn’t go on all the time we were in Terezín, but for a period of time we got packages.</span> <span id="s1358">And Trude’s brother, came down with TB, and there wasn’t a package that came from my mother and my aunts who I didn’t share the vitamins and the food with Herbert Blau.</span> <span id="s1359">And hi -- and her parents never forgot that.</span> <span id="s1360">So in other words, you know, we separated ways, but she al -- but she -- I don’t think she had bad feelings towards me because I was very generous to Herbert.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Did you notice a lot of sexual activity in Terezín?</span> <span id="s1362">That there were a lot of people coupling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Well, there was a woman, a Czech woman who was as sexy as anybody can imagine.</span> <span id="s1364">And she was supposed to help me in the room.</span> <span id="s1365">She was much older than I was, and I was horrified because we had ladders to go up to th -- to the third bunkbed, and she doesn’t -- didn’t wear underwear, and she was, you know, she was very sexy, very flirty, and I’m sure she had her experiences.</span> <span id="s1366">My kids were too small.</span> <span id="s1367">There was no sexual activity.</span> <span id="s1368">I had none.</span> <span id="s1369">I’m sure that some people did.</span> <span id="s1370">I could have had it with Louis Lowy, but I -- it’s not that I was prude, I mean he just -- I -- I loved him as a friend, but he just didn’t turn me on.</span> <span id="s1371">I’m sure there was a lot going on, especially among the Czechs.</span> <span id="s1372">Some of the Germans were quite old, but that’s all I witnessed.</span> <span id="s1373">And the kids were really too small in my room.</span> <span id="s1374">And then I’m thinking about the -- the people who had the same job that I had -- excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Louis was a good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1377">The idea to have any sexual contact with him, I couldn’t even have fathomed.</span> <span id="s1378">There were Kurt Kohorn, who didn’t do anything for me either, and he probably wasn’t interested in me either.</span> <span id="s1379">Whether they had any sexual activities, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1380">I was younger than they were.</span> <span id="s1381">I mean, they were my friends, but -- because in many ways I was mature, but sexually I’m not sure I was that mature, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1383">Did you go to seminars and lectures and concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Oh yes, oh yes, and don’t forget, in -- when we came to Terezín, we were not supposed to teach or learn.</span> <span id="s1385">That was strictly verboten.</span> <span id="s1386">So all the teaching of our children, all the lectures, were all done clandestinely.</span> <span id="s1387">And I remember distinctly that we were taking turns watching whether the SS was descending into the camp, and giving, you know, sounding the alarm when they did, not knowing what they were up to.</span> <span id="s1388">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Do you remember hearing opera, or hearing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: My brother sang in the children’s choir of Carmen, he had a very good voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Yeah, we saw Brundibar, and Carmen, and -- and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: And did he sing in Brundibar as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Yeah, and the Angabilda ti conquer, and you -- you name it.</span> <span id="s1399">Natung avisor, you know, I mean, the things we did, and the talent we had.</span> <span id="s1400">I was nothing.</span> <span id="s1401">I was a young girl who -- who had very limited experience, but I really matured very much among these people.</span> <span id="s1402">We had professors from Vienna and from -- from Germany, and they would give lic -- lectures, and we had musicologists and I tried to -- to learn how to read music, and I’m not sure that I applied myself, or maybe I’m too stupid for it, but that I didn’t manage too well.</span> <span id="s1403">We had classes in algebra and arithmetic, particularly Louis, who was a lifelong friend of mine, was very bright.</span> <span id="s1404">He eventually became a professor at BU, was a very close friend of my husband’s.</span> <span id="s1405">He -- he tau -- he gave so many lectures.</span> <span id="s1406">And there was a biologist from Vienna, and -- and these people were so eager to -- to teach us, because we er -- weren’t supposed to learn.</span> <span id="s1407">If you are not supposed to do something, there is a tremendous incentive to do it.</span> <span id="s1408">So yes, we tried our best to educate our kids, but then there were transports going all the time.</span> <span id="s1409">We had no clue where they were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: You still had no clue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: We had no clue, especially the orphans.</span> <span id="s1412">I mean, I still see them today, some of them.</span> <span id="s1413">There were a couple of girls, one was very tall Mira Hankriff, and one was very short.</span> <span id="s1414">They had been orphaned.</span> <span id="s1415">Their whole families had been killed.</span> <span id="s1416">And they never talk much about it, and I think now if they had I’m not sure we could have even believed them.</span> <span id="s1417">But they had formed such a bond with each other.</span> <span id="s1418">I have never seen anything like that in young people, wa -- the bond they had.</span> <span id="s1419">And it only reminded me of the bond Hannah and Zdena and Buschi and I formed later on.</span> <span id="s1420">But, you know, this was -- there were -- kids were coming and going.</span> <span id="s1421">And then you heard these rumors that there were s -- one transport came in with kids, they were all full of lice and they were so undernourished, and they were in such bad shape, and this and that was supposed to happen to them, and then there was a name, I don’t know where it comes from, maybe there’s a Yiddish in it, bonkes, which means rumors.</span> <span id="s1422">Anything that anybody said that couldn’t be quantified, or really you didn’t know where it came from was called bonkes.</span> <span id="s1423">So they said, oh, these are just bonkes, you know, you can’t believe everything you hear, they just make all -- and these are kids, you know, they make these things up.</span> <span id="s1424">And then the Nazis send transports with orphans and young people and I remember this horrible thing where they said they were going to Switzerland, there was a transport.</span> <span id="s1425">And then later on we found out, you know, Switzerland was going into the gas.</span> <span id="s1426">I don’t remember whether they went to -- which extermina-ination camp they went to.</span> <span id="s1427">So, it was difficult to get news when you were in Terezín, and I’m afraid that we weren’t any better than the outside world.</span> <span id="s1428">Even when we heard some rumors, we didn’t believe them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: We need to stop the tape now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: -- change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Do you remember the “Verdi’s Requiem” being sung?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Yeah, but I don’t have very, very, you know, distinct memories of it, yeah.</span> <span id="s1436">But I remember it was sung.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Yeah, I don’t remember whether I saw it or not, that -- you know, I -- I -- when I’m positive, I’m positive, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: There -- there were lots of things going on, but I also had my job, and I couldn’t always attend everything that was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Do you remember somebody by the name of Freddi Hirsch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: Oh yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: What do you know -- what do you know about Fred?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Well, Freddi -- I think Freddi perished in -- in the -- in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1447">I get the goose bumps when I think of it.</span> <span id="s1448">Freddi and a lot of families were sent to Auschwitz to the Familienlager.</span> <span id="s1449">And I don’t remember the -- the -- the month when it was.</span> <span id="s1450">I think it was in ’44, but I’m not, you know, I’m -- that was very unusual that they allowed whole families to go, but we didn’t know it was going to Auschwitz, but we -- only after the war did I learn that they had this Familienlager in Auschwitz where they had set aside a whole area where families could live together, because in Auschwitz, as soon as you got there, the children and the women and -- and men were separated.</span> <span id="s1451">And they were in Auschwitz for quite a long time.</span> <span id="s1452">And Freddi had -- did a lot with the children, and he was highly respected.</span> <span id="s1453">But he had also some contacts with people in Auschwitz, who had contacts knowing what was happening.</span> <span id="s1454">And if I recall that -- my recollection after the war, when I came to Deggendorf, which was mostly occupied by survivors of Terezín, I think the Blaus told me, because you know, I -- we were not in -- in Terezín the whole time any more, that Freddi and I forget who else, somebody else who was very prominent, knew when the Familienlager was going to be eliminated.</span> <span id="s1455">And they went through this terrible agony, whether they should inform everybody and fight back in some way, and you know, and cause a tremendous disruption.</span> <span id="s1456">All you could do is cause a disruption, because you had machine guns from all corners, I mean nobody could have any illusion that they could survive.</span> <span id="s1457">And from what I understand, Freddi and some of the other people came to the conclusion that if they will do so, they would cause such bedlam and such fear, and nobody was going to be saved anyway, and the children, instead of going into the gas not knowing where they were going, they were going to be, you know, like hunted animals.</span> <span id="s1458">And they all went into the gas.</span> <span id="s1459">Now, I don’t know if my recollection is correct.</span> <span id="s1460">I’m sure you know Freddi Hirsch’s story.</span> <span id="s1461">I was not in the family camp, so -- so I can only tell you what some of my friends told me happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: Do you remember Freddi from Terezín?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Did you -- did you know him at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: And what was he like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: I we -- I mean, I reme -- I -- I wasn’t a close friend of his, but I remember him as th -- he was very sporty, he did a lot of sports with the kids, he was very encouraging.</span> <span id="s1470">He -- he was, you know, the -- some people you can’t analyze what makes this guy be appreciated and respected by everybody?</span> <span id="s1471">What makes him a leader?</span> <span id="s1472">And that was Freddi Hirsch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Was he much older than you, a few years older, do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: I thought he was quite a few years older, but I -- you see, when I came to Auschwitz, in 1944 -- I was born in ’26, so what -- I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s1475">Freddi might have been in his early 20’s, you know, but I can’t be -- in other words, you know, he -- I was this -- this 18 year old girl, not -- you know, mature as far as m -- my ability to take care of young people, but sexually and every other way, I was not a very mature person.</span> <span id="s1476">And young men that age don’t bother with younger girls like Ursula, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: They called him Uschi, by the way --</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: Uschi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: -- nobody knew me as Ursula, yeah.</span> <span id="s1481">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: But your family didn’t call you Uschi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: No, that came about -- well, some people did, but -- maybe alluded to, but in -- in Terezín everybody called me Uschi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Do you remember food in Terezín?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Was it horrible?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Well, it was horrible, but my father did so many good deeds for the cooks, that we got much better food.</span> <span id="s1488">I mean, was the same type of food, but we got more of it, we got puddings, which nobody could even dream about.</span> <span id="s1489">We got knoedle, you know, the dumplings.</span> <span id="s1490">Yeah, he -- he -- he built -- you know, he could do anything, and he built cabinets for the cooks and chairs for the cooks, and benches and all this for their quarters, and he was rewarded with food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: We got chocolate pudding, and we got -- we got all kinds of stuff that he brought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: Chocolate pudding?</span> <span id="s1494">A: Oh yes, chocolate pudding.</span> <span id="s1495">Don’t forget, some of them also cooked for the SS, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: Some of these cooks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1498">Oh yeah, the cooks were -- they were as fat as -- we hated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: Yeah, we hated them.</span> <span id="s1501">We had -- th-the Czechs make a dish called knodlicki, which is -- it’s a flour dish like a dumpling with some sors -- sort of a buttery, sweet sauce on it.</span> <span id="s1502">We had some of that, and -- and of course coffee, which was not coffee, which was like black -- some black sauce of some -- some sort.</span> <span id="s1503">And spreads which were undefinable what they were, were supposed to be marmalade, and wasn’t a real marmalade, lot of artificial junk in it.</span> <span id="s1504">One thing that might be interesting to you is that I think they put something in our food, or maybe it was just the nourishment itself, but the -- most women didn’t menistrate any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: I was going to ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1507">I lost my -- I lost that, completely, until I came out of the camps, and then I think it took probably a year or more before it came back.</span> <span id="s1508">So -- and there were rumors that they put certain things in the food, I really don’t know, I have no clue what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: But in some sense was that a relief or was that -- did that frighten women that they stopped their periods?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: I don’t know that I thought much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: It’s not something a young girl is too eager about anyway.</span> <span id="s1513">They said they -- they put some additive, and I can’t remember what it -- some soda -- sor -- some -- something which is supposed to prevent menistration, but I don’t know if that’s tr -- was true or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Yeah, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: And they had black bread, you know, horrible looking bread.</span> <span id="s1516">But -- and potatoes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: A lot of potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: -- in the skin, and a lot of them were half rotten potatoes, but again, we had much better food than most, and so did my room, because my father never just brought the food for me or my brother.</span> <span id="s1519">Was our room, and Louis’ room.</span> <span id="s1520">And Louis never forgot that either, and he smuggled things into there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: So you ate in your room with the kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1523">And also what my father did, when we -- when I took the room over, they kept their bread rations, all that stuff, in their beds.</span> <span id="s1524">And then my father felt that that was also breeding a lot of disease, and -- and el -- you know, fl -- we had a lot of fleas and all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s1525">So he made a cupboard which had 30 compartments in it, and each child had their own compartments, and then in my room nobody was allowed to have any food in the compartments.</span> <span id="s1526">These were kids who were starved, and I can tell you, there was so much discipline in my room.</span> <span id="s1527">I was very young, but Papa Lenneberg, Papi they called him, because I called him Papi, he was only known as Papi.</span> <span id="s1528">He told them, and -- and em -- emphasized that you don’t touch anybody else’s compartment.</span> <span id="s1529">And you know, in all that time, I don’t remember once a kid stealing out of another compartment.</span> <span id="s1530">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: And how old are these kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Well, they were between -- they were about t -- 10 - 12 - 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Needing a lot of food, I would suspect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: But you know, like I said before, I didn’t sit there and eat the stuff my father brought.</span> <span id="s1537">We shared everything.</span> <span id="s1538">And all the packages that I got, they were opened on the table.</span> <span id="s1539">There was a table with a long bench on each side, and -- and I would -- we would cut everything.</span> <span id="s1540">We would cut th-the chocolate, and whatever was in it, and everybody got something.</span> <span id="s1541">And we shared.</span> <span id="s1542">And I don’t recall that any other children got packages, because how many children in -- in Terezín had aunts in Germany who could do that kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: You know, so with all my venom against the Red Cross, you know, we did th -- we -- because my venom, you know what they stems from, from -- from the Red Cross visit to Terezín.</span> <span id="s1545">But then I sometimes think you’re not just -- the Red Cross did get a lot of packages in.</span> <span id="s1546">Probably of the -- of a hundred packages, even if you -- if only 15 made it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: That was something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: -- and they were sent to my father, my brother, and to me.</span> <span id="s1549">And then also, to Herbert Blau, because somehow my -- my father was able to thank you for the package, and Herbert Blau really enjoyed it too.</span> <span id="s1550">So then my aunts send another package to Herbert Blau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: And were you teaching these kids?</span> <span id="s1552">What did you do all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: I was learning, and I was teaching.</span> <span id="s1554">I was reading with them, and I was lacking a lot of education, but I was also learning a lot and taking seminars, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1555">I did speak English quite well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Oh yeah, because my parents -- I mean, I had a lot of education, even when -- after our school was burned down, because I learned English and Spanish and some French, which eventually was too much, because I was speaking French with a Spanish -- I mean, was just getting too much.</span> <span id="s1558">But whatever I learned, I taught my kids.</span> <span id="s1559">Then there were some people who were very artistic, and they learned to draw, etcetera, and make poems, they were encouraged to write stories.</span> <span id="s1560">And then some of these professors gave lectures, and gave them homework, and they learned, and then if the SS came, everything was shoved aside, and we had certain places, you know, under the boards, and we would hide things.</span> <span id="s1561">And then later on, I think a lot of those restrictions were not enforced as much any more, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: What was the mood of these kids?</span> <span id="s1563">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: It depended.</span> <span id="s1565">There were some who seemed somewhat depressed, especially the ones who had no family.</span> <span id="s1566">Were some who very busy reading.</span> <span id="s1567">Do you -- have you heard about Ruth Klueger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: She was in my room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: She was one of my kids.</span> <span id="s1572">And she is in a category all by herself.</span> <span id="s1573">She wasn’t the eady -- easiest person.</span> <span id="s1574">She wrote a book, as you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Yeah, I interviewed her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: She had a very bad relationship with her mother.</span> <span id="s1577">And she upsets me because her mother saved her life.</span> <span id="s1578">I talked to her after she wrote the book.</span> <span id="s1579">And she -- in her book she’s -- only has bad things to say about her mother.</span> <span id="s1580">And I can’t help myself, I’m thinking about my family, my aunts, what I would give if they had survived.</span> <span id="s1581">And she’s spewing all this venom, who actually, her mother saved her.</span> <span id="s1582">Without her mother, she would not have survived.</span> <span id="s1583">But she is -- she was way beyond anybody else in intelligence, reading, she was devouring everything.</span> <span id="s1584">And she had a friend, Hannah Ungar, who is now in Australia, which I didn’t know, Ruth Klueger told me.</span> <span id="s1585">And these two, they were like this.</span> <span id="s1586">And Ruth, she hated every -- she hated her father, she hated her mother, she hated her relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: And was that clear then, that she was so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: No, she was -- it was -- was sh -- it was clear that she had a bad relationship with her mother, that was clear.</span> <span id="s1589">But except for ha -- ha -- for Hannah Ungar, they -- they were very close.</span> <span id="s1590">But the rest of the girls completely left her alone.</span> <span id="s1591">She was in a category all by herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Was she difficult for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: She didn’t give me too much trouble, and she -- it’s interesting how she -- she refers to me in her book without name, but as somebody who is not much older than she was -- I mean, she’s a few years older than I am, and who was in charge of the room.</span> <span id="s1594">But it wasn’t anything derogatory, or anything complimentary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: You’re just there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: I was just there, I was just there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: Well, that’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Did you learn Czech?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: A little bit, but not much, you know how you learn a language just to get by a few things.</span> <span id="s1601">I’d hardly know anything any more, but I -- I never really tried very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: So then who did you talk with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Well, they all spoke some English.</span> <span id="s1604">Once you became friends -- English, some German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: German.</span> <span id="s1606">Once you became friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Once you became friends, they accepted you, they spoke German to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: But it couldn’t have been so easy to become friends if there was no language, or am I wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Well, they all speak -- I mean, the educated Czechs all speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: And -- but they hate German, like I hated German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: But that’s all you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Yes, but I can understand them better, because when I came out of the camps, I spoke English very well, and I had to speak German to my mother, and to my family.</span> <span id="s1616">And my mother learned English very fast here.</span> <span id="s1617">But if I could avoid German -- th-the language itself just grated me, you know, it brought back so much, and I hated everything German.</span> <span id="s1618">And I think Hans helped me a lot.</span> <span id="s1619">I mean, I wouldn’t go as far as the Israelis who were trying to shake, you know, to -- to be aggressive to a pianist who is playing German music, but I couldn’t stand anything German, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1621">Do you remember your brother’s Bar-mitzvah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: -- and what that was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Well, he was very good at it.</span> <span id="s1627">I don’t remember that he made any mistakes.</span> <span id="s1628">And he was very bright.</span> <span id="s1629">It was not a very festive thing for me, and I’m sure it was a terrible thing for my father, because it brings -- brought it very much back that where’s a -- where’s my mother, and etcetera.</span> <span id="s1630">But it was just something that he wanted to do, and my father -- I don’t recall whether my father ever said to him, you know, why do you have to do it.</span> <span id="s1631">My father was such an agnostic, it didn’t matter to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: But your brother wanted to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: He wanted to do it, yeah, he wanted to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: And was it done in a synagogue, or a synagogue setting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: No, there was no synagogue, but there was a room that was used for services.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: And there were some rabbis, and there was, you know, I forget what that was Kline, or who -- who coached him, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1638">I have -- would have to make it up, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1639">The reason, excuse me, I think I don’t remember is, don’t forget, this was very close to the time when we were deported to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1640">And somehow there, lots of things became a blur, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Yeah, cause this is September ’43, and you’re deported in October, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: Not ’43.</span> <span id="s1643">We were deported i-in ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: So it’s a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Yeah, but still, you know, there -- so many things happened, it -- it seemed a short time.</span> <span id="s1648">Maybe it was a year, but I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s1649">Maybe I wasn’t totally with it.</span> <span id="s1650">And I don’t remember who the instigator was.</span> <span id="s1651">I can’t believe it was Louis, who was in charge of his room, because Louis was an agnostic too.</span> <span id="s1652">But somebody must have persuaded him he should make his Bar-mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1653">And my father was in a room on a -- in a different street, in a different house, with a couple of guys who were quite Orthodox [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1654">So whether they had an influence, they probably had an influence.</span> <span id="s1655">But I can’t recall that.</span> <span id="s1656">I don’t want to claim anything I can’t be -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1658">Maybe ritual counts in those times, even if you don’t have a belief.</span> <span id="s1659">Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: I think that it -- th-that’s what it was to a large degree.</span> <span id="s1661">I mean, I started to learn [indecipherable] in Israel.</span> <span id="s1662">I mean the -- in -- in Terezín.</span> <span id="s1663">I really wanted to go, if we would get out of this mess, I wanted to eventually go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1664">There was no Israel then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: And I really wonder if I would have ended up in -- in Palestine if my mother hadn’t survived.</span> <span id="s1667">But I found -- I felt that it was just too much to ask my mother to go to th -- what was then Palestine, the conditions, and for her to learn Ivrith would have been a lot harder than to -- you know, she knew a little English.</span> <span id="s1668">I think the idea probably wo -- came to me because when you have been persecuted, you just wonder whether you can exist among non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1669">You feel so vulnerable, the idea that there could be a country where people are of your make-up, and wouldn’t persecute you because you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s1670">There is something attractive to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: In -- a couple of months after your brother’s Bar-mitzvah, there’s a huge, sort of -- everybody is taken out of the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Oh, maybe that’s why I don’t remember the Bar-mitzvah too well.</span> <span id="s1675">Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Cause this is November ’43, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: Mm-hm, yeah, that was the worst day I ever experienced in Terezín.</span> <span id="s1678">One day we were all herded into the Bauschowitz basin.</span> <span id="s1679">And the reason for that was given by the commandant of the SS, that th-the elder had not given the right numbers of inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: This is Edelstein?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1682">And then I think he just had some venom against Edelstein, who was a wonderful man, and he also, if I remember it correctly, I think accused Edelstein of using his bicycle and riding beyond the borders of was permitted in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1683">And they herded us into the Bauschowitz basin.</span> <span id="s1684">And it was a very drizzly day.</span> <span id="s1685">Young and old, and some of these old people were in such decrepit condition, and we were supposed to be counted, because the count didn’t jive, as far as the SS was concerned.</span> <span id="s1686">And we had to stand there at attention for hours and hours and hours with the rain coming down.</span> <span id="s1687">And SS were stationed -- the basin was like a flat area, and it was surrounded by a dirt wall, and they were positioned on the dirt wall with machine guns, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1688">And we were sure we’re all going to be murdered right there on that -- in that basin.</span> <span id="s1689">And you know, they -- they were beating people up, and they were screaming and they had their guns drawn, they were very intimidating, and it was just horrible.</span> <span id="s1690">And everybody thought this is it, we’re going to be executed.</span> <span id="s1691">And then eventually, was already beyond dusk, I don’t remember, was very, very late, we were all herded back into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1692">And I don’t remember how many people were in Terezín at the time, but the ghetto was very full of people.</span> <span id="s1693">What -- I’ve to -- forget what the height of the population was, 40,000 or something like that.</span> <span id="s1694">And that was about it, because after we came back, shortly after, there were lots of transports going east out of Terezín.</span> <span id="s1695">And while we were in the Bauschowitz basin, the SS searched the -- the houses, the youth homes.</span> <span id="s1696">They ripped out mattresses and I don’t know what all, they were looking for valuables.</span> <span id="s1697">Then they had the excuse that somebody had hidden valuables and money, because you were not supposed to keep any of that.</span> <span id="s1698">And actually, I understood -- I was not a witness to that, that in fact in one place in our building, that they found some money somewhere, and that that person was taken into the Kleine Festung, which was a notorious prison.</span> <span id="s1699">But I -- I was not an -- an eyewitness to that, I was an eyewitness to when we came back and everything was torn apart.</span> <span id="s1700">Yeah, that was a very scary time.</span> <span id="s1701">It was -- it was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: Now, you mentioned that Edelstein was a wonderful man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Ho -- do -- is this by reputation that you say this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Yes, and I met him a few times, not that he had any interest in Uschi Pawel -- Uschi Lenneberg, but there were occasions that he came to the youth home and stuff, and I thought he was a very nice, mild mannered man.</span> <span id="s1706">Not everybody in the Judenrat had the same reputation.</span> <span id="s1707">Murmelstein had a terrible reputation.</span> <span id="s1708">And you see, that is the justice of the world.</span> <span id="s1709">Who survived?</span> <span id="s1710">Rabbi Murmelstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: And he had the reputation among us that he was hand in glove with the SS.</span> <span id="s1713">And Edelstein was deported to Auschwitz, and so were many of the others.</span> <span id="s1714">And one of the people on the Judenrat, Zucker, was on our transport, and also sent right into the gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: Okay, we have to stop and change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Uschi.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Uschi, yeah.</span> <span id="s1720">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Do you remember your birthday party?</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: When you were 18?</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1725">I still have -- I still have that’s -- I should -- why didn’t I bring that?</span> <span id="s1726">Buschi -- well, when -- you mean in Terezín the birthday party?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: Yes, I remember that, but I was thinking about another birthday party --</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Oh yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: -- in Merzdorf, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: Oh, well, we’ll talk about that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Was it nice in Terezín?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: Yes, the kids made all kinds of little presents for me, you know, handmade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: The little -- oh, the kids you were taking care of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1737">And they -- they put on a play for me, and it was a complete surprise, and my brother -- and he -- ya -- ma -- wrapped up little tiny things, things that probably my father got for him, and -- and he put on it, Für meine liebe schwester.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Aw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: So this was not an adult party, this was a party for these kids, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: No, this was my chil -- my kids, and my father and my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: And your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: And maybe Louis and a few of the betreuer, but I don’t remember exactly --</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: -- but it’s the kids that made the big impression --</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: -- because they had -- you know, had this play that they made up, somebody had written it, and I don’t even remember the -- to be truthful, the contents of the play, I was so overwhelmed by the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: And since you were with them so much, when could they have rehearsed, and done all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Yeah, I -- they could have because I had a lot of friends there, and they could have done it with the -- all kinds of excuses, you know.</span> <span id="s1750">Apparently there were a few people helping them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1752">That’s very sweet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: And I’m sure you remember the pending Red Cross visit.</span> <span id="s1755">Do you remember all the preparation for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: I remember everything because my kids were part of some of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: Not that they volunteered, I mean, they were just told.</span> <span id="s1759">The Red Cross was going to visit, and we had what was called verschönerung, beautification.</span> <span id="s1760">And first of all, they had a huge transport leaving Terezín, to make the town look less crowded, that was the first thing.</span> <span id="s1761">Then the commandant felt he didn’t want any ugly and old Jews in the streets.</span> <span id="s1762">So when he saw like an old person, or -- some of his deputies went in and rounded up old people, and they came into the next transports.</span> <span id="s1763">And transports were going constantly, to the east.</span> <span id="s1764">Of course we know now they went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1765">And then people were given the job to clean the streets, they actually scrubbed the streets, the sidewalks, with soap and water.</span> <span id="s1766">They got paint, they painted the houses.</span> <span id="s1767">They started to build a -- an area and decorated it with flowers and green to make way for the orchestra.</span> <span id="s1768">And another one for the band shell.</span> <span id="s1769">Then they -- they established a café.</span> <span id="s1770">And they would just go and say you -- I mean, some good looking young women, you, you, you, you’re going to be the waitresses.</span> <span id="s1771">And these waitresses were strutting around with little white doily aprons, and you know, those curlicues, stupid stuff in their hair, and they were going to wait on customers in the café house.</span> <span id="s1772">They -- some of our kids were rounded up, and they had to approach the SS Kommandant, who was an awful guy, and call him uncle.</span> <span id="s1773">I wasn’t involved directly myself, I just visited all this, I just saw all that.</span> <span id="s1774">One thing I did see, that the elder, our elder, was decorated with a gold chain and a new suit and Nazi limousines were chauffeuring him around with the people from the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: This is Marmelstein -- Murmelstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1777">And so it was -- it was a stage and we were the actors.</span> <span id="s1778">And they were planting flowers all over, and the band was playing.</span> <span id="s1779">And then they started -- they established a bank -- I’m trying to remember, a store.</span> <span id="s1780">And -- and they made this fake Theresienstadt money, which on one side had Moses with the 10 commandments, on the other side it had the -- you know, the ghetto in kröne, I think it was, 20 - 50 or what kröne.</span> <span id="s1781">And then the transports, which were always coming and going in Terezín.</span> <span id="s1782">You know that they confiscated all the suitcases.</span> <span id="s1783">Well, they took some stuff out of these suitcases and they put this -- this stuff in the stores to be sold, supposedly.</span> <span id="s1784">So the Red Cross got the impression they have a this store and a that store, and they have a bank, and they have the -- they have a barber and they have a beauty parlor and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s1785">I’m -- it was unreal.</span> <span id="s1786">Houses were scrubbed and painted.</span> <span id="s1787">And then these idiots from the Red Cross, that’s why e -- e -- ev -- ever since I came out of Terezín, I have no good word for the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1788">They would -- they were dined -- wined and dined by the SS, and riding around in the SS limousine through Terezín.</span> <span id="s1789">Do you think they got out once to ask anybody a question?</span> <span id="s1790">Or to try to go into one of the houses?</span> <span id="s1791">I mean, they didn’t even go into the barrack, nevermind these individual houses, where old people were put in the attic, like my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1792">And they had not any more space than that rug in the foyer there, to just spread their blanket, and -- during the heat, or the cold, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1793">And so these -- so many people died in Terezín in -- in those days, it -- before -- even before -- died before they had a chance to transport them to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: So the Red Cross, th -- they didn’t walk around at all, they just -- in the car, the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: N-N-No, they -- they were in the car, and if they walked around -- they might have walked around and strutted around where the band was, and where everything -- the SS wanted them to see.</span> <span id="s1796">They -- I didn’t see it myself, but they might have walked into the bank or stuff and -- and convinced themselves that this was a wonderful Jewish town where, you know, Hitler schenkt den Juden eine stadt.</span> <span id="s1797">Where Hitler was giving the Jews a present of a -- of a -- of a town.</span> <span id="s1798">And they swallowed it all, lock, stock and barrel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Do you remember a film being made, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: Oh yes, and I rem -- I knew Kurt Gerron very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: You did?</span> <span id="s1802">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: Kurt Gerron was a filmmaker from Holland, and he was rounded up by the Nazis, and he was brought to Terezín.</span> <span id="s1804">And Kurt, I don’t know whether he originally came from Holland, but I am quite sure I remember that he was -- he was arrested in Holland.</span> <span id="s1805">At least that’s what I was told.</span> <span id="s1806">I see him with -- this reminds me -- of course, this was 1944, of all his equipment, making this film.</span> <span id="s1807">And, you know, as I said before, we were a stage, we were the actors.</span> <span id="s1808">My kids were -- were in the films.</span> <span id="s1809">And as soon as Kurt Gerron had finished the film, he was put into a transport to Auschwitz, and perished.</span> <span id="s1810">So yes, I will never forget that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: And how did you come to know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: I think he came to the youth home.</span> <span id="s1813">I also came to know him -- not -- you know, we were not friends, but I spoke to him because he wanted s -- he needed some of the kids to be part of what he was filming.</span> <span id="s1814">And some of the kids had been selected, I don’t remember it was the SS or who, they needed so and so many kids.</span> <span id="s1815">And some of my kids were in that.</span> <span id="s1816">And I didn’t even see the -- the elder, that he had this gold chain on.</span> <span id="s1817">My kids told me that.</span> <span id="s1818">You should have seen him, he had -- he had a new suit, and a gold chain, and he was being driven around, you know, as a mayor of the city, with the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: So it made you live him even more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: Oh God.</span> <span id="s1821">No, I -- and we all feel that way, I mean he came from -- from Vienna, and Dita and Louis, and Dita still is my very good friend, she still lives in Boston, and Louis we lost many -- before Hans died, many years ago.</span> <span id="s1822">And di -- Dita came from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1823">She hated this guy.</span> <span id="s1824">I mean, nobody liked him.</span> <span id="s1825">But he survived.</span> <span id="s1826">And he collaborated very much with the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1828">So the Red Cross is there in May of 1944, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: A few months later your father gets a deportation.</span> <span id="s1831">It -- it seems, a -- at least according to your book, that there’s a notice that comes to your father about being deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: Yeah, I happened to be in his room --</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: When he got it?</span> <span id="s1834">A: Yeah, and he got it, it wasn’t sent by mail.</span> <span id="s1835">These notices were given to the elders, they were either the room elders or the house elders.</span> <span id="s1836">My father was in Q 600 dreizehn, I think it was, 613 in a -- it was like a private home originally.</span> <span id="s1837">And the elder -- I was visiting my father in his room, and the elder comes in and hands him the summons from the SS that he has to present himself on such and such a date, and he changed color.</span> <span id="s1838">And I never forget that.</span> <span id="s1839">And then we had a big struggle, and -- and it was my fault, and -- and it haunted me for years and years.</span> <span id="s1840">And I pressed him that we should join him.</span> <span id="s1841">And I should have never done that, and he fought me tooth and nail.</span> <span id="s1842">And I said to him, “Well, what was the purpose of you and Bübchen going with me?</span> <span id="s1843">And then now we’re going to be separated again.</span> <span id="s1844">I mean, the idea was that we were going to stay together.”</span> <span id="s1845">So I decided that Papi is going next week, and I am going the week after, and Bübchen is going to be all by himself.</span> <span id="s1846">So we went with him, supposedly to a labor camp near Dresden.</span> <span id="s1847">See, that was the terrible thing, and they say that Murmelstein knew where we were going, and -- and he helped the Nazis by facilitating, you know, their mirage, we were going to a labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: Now, but you think at this point that your father knows what’s going on, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: I don’t know, he -- all I can tell you is that when he came back from Zossen, which is near Berlin --</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: -- where he worked in Tiefbau supposedly, what was it, for the bunker --</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">A: -- that Hitler’s bunker, and he came in touch with a lot of other workers from different camps, he seemed like a changed person.</span> <span id="s1854">But he also knew that transports were leaving Terezín on a daily -- on a daily is too much, but at -- on a weekly, or sometimes daily basis, to in quote, other labor camps.</span> <span id="s1855">So maybe he also felt that we are all going to be getting out of here sooner or later, and now we at least know where we are going, and I can’t recall at all, I might have it in my book, what the name of the labor camp was that we were supposed to go to.</span> <span id="s1856">It was near Dresden, and my father was familiar with the name, and that sounded pretty good.</span> <span id="s1857">And this -- we were told that by the -- by the elder, by Murmelstein, that our transport was going to that place.</span> <span id="s1858">And I remember when we were on the train, which eventually ended up in Auschwitz, my father and some of his friends were looking through, you know, it’s trying to see where they were, which wasn’t always possible, and they f -- one of them said, “Otto,” to my father, “we’re not going,” -- it’ll come to me, the name of that place, “where we can’t possibly go there, we’re alya -- already east of Dresden.”</span> <span id="s1859">And that’s when he changed color, and when it probably sank in, we’re not going to a labor camp, we’re going east of Dresden, we’re going to go to one of the camps in Poland, and I think that -- this is conjecture, I have no proof of that -- I think that maybe he did meet up with people.</span> <span id="s1860">He told me that there were people from different -- different ghettos, or whatever he said, who were working with him on the bunker.</span> <span id="s1861">And so I think that he got a good idea what was going on in some of the eastern camps.</span> <span id="s1862">But I really feel that he believed that our transport was going to a labor camp near Dresden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: But nevertheless, you had to fight with him about going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Yes, I did, and he didn’t want me to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1866">And you won.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: But -- I won, unfortunately, and believe me, it’s laid on me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: -- for -- it still does to this day.</span> <span id="s1870">Because then I figured if we hadn’t gone, because there were -- we were not the last transport to leave Terezín, as you know, but maybe we would have had enough of a respite that we would have stayed.</span> <span id="s1871">And my father was such a strong, healthy man, that maybe he would have had a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s1872">What I really think happened -- and this again, is conjecture -- when we got to Auschwitz, of course you know women and men had -- were separated, and my father was with my brother, and my brother was in his winter coat, it was Poland, and it was October, and you know, that he had outgrown, and he didn’t look like a -- you know, very big teenager, and I think Mengele, who happened to select us, probably put my brother on one side, and my father on the other, but my father, I’m sure, would not have let his son go alone, and maybe said can’t I go with my son, not knowing where he was going.</span> <span id="s1873">Maybe even if he had known where he was going, he wouldn’t have let my brother go alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: Was this at the begin -- do you remember if it was the beginning of October?</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: Yes, at the very beginning oc --</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: At the very beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: -- of October.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: So it -- it’s before the uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1880">It was at the beginning of October, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Well, you know, you couldn’t have known either.</span> <span id="s1882">You didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: No, I -- believe me, it’s been on -- it’s been -- and you know, I want to tell you something, I never discussed this too much with my mother.</span> <span id="s1884">She asked me questions and I told her the truth.</span> <span id="s1885">And I don’t know, maybe I camouflaged it a little bit, but I couldn’t even talk about it, because I really felt that burden for such -- for the rest of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: And you still feel it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: I have my brother and my father [indecipherable] deaths, and I feel I’m responsible that they aren’t here any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: You didn’t kill them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: But it was the wrong thing to do.</span> <span id="s1892">Was absolutely the wrong thing to do, cause he really didn’t want us to go with him.</span> <span id="s1893">Of course, we didn’t know that we were fairly close towards the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1894">We didn’t get -- you know, that’s been -- so many times there were hopeful news, that oh, the allies are here, and there, and the Russians are very close, and -- and it never materialized.</span> <span id="s1895">So we really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1896">But it’s -- it’s done, you know, it’s a long time.</span> <span id="s1897">Ma -- ma -- as you get older and you have sons like I do, who are now -- my oldest son is the same age that my father was when he was killed.</span> <span id="s1898">You know, I mean, you -- you get from his history, he was a strapping man, he was -- he could do anything, whether it was carpentry or -- or digging ditches, or what.</span> <span id="s1899">Physical work -- not everybody was able to do that.</span> <span id="s1900">People collapsed, people gave up because they couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1901">Well, he could.</span> <span id="s1902">But we came to the point, and I think I had a part in it where you couldn’t -- there’s nothing you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: But you -- you probably need to remember that the family made a decision early on to join you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: I know, I know, I know, this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: So everybody’s making decisions based on what they think is the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: I know, my husband talked to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">Q: But rationality doesn’t count when you have certain kinds of feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: So you are separated from your brother and your father, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: -- do you know that they were killed immediately?</span> <span id="s1912">Is that what you think, or you don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: Well, I’ll tell you how I found out that they were killed.</span> <span id="s1914">You know, we got off the train, and we had to form in fives, and I remember trying to look back to see my father and my brother.</span> <span id="s1915">This was a huge, huge transport, enormous.</span> <span id="s1916">All I could see is a sea of people.</span> <span id="s1917">And then looking down towards the camps, all I could see is high tension wires, and barrack after barrack after barrack.</span> <span id="s1918">And then we were pushed again to walk past this elegant looking SS officer with shiny boots and leather gloves, either pointing to the left, or to -- pointing to the right.</span> <span id="s1919">I didn’t -- I didn’t know what that meant.</span> <span id="s1920">I followed where he pointed to.</span> <span id="s1921">And then we had to form in fives again, and there was an SS man to the left of me, and he pushed us into this muddy road, which was snaking between camps.</span> <span id="s1922">And whenever a transport arrived in Auschwitz, nobody was allowed to get out of the barrack.</span> <span id="s1923">But somehow a woman was outside of the barrack, very close to the electric wire, and recognized somebody in our transport, and screamed out a name, and cried.</span> <span id="s1924">And this SS man, who was next to me, fairly young, maybe 18, something like that, with his rifle drawn, screamed at her, “Get in or I’ll shoot you.”</span> <span id="s1925">And with that he shot her.</span> <span id="s1926">And she screamed, and she was lying there, literally in the mud, pooled in her own blood, and I was convinced then I would never get out of there alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: And that’s the first time you thought that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: I have ne -- had never seen a person being shot.</span> <span id="s1929">There were people being killed in Terezín in the Kleine Festung, but I was not witness to it.</span> <span id="s1930">And apparently there were some people shot in the basin when we had the counting, but I didn’t -- nobody close to me.</span> <span id="s1931">That was the first time I ever saw a person being shot point blank.</span> <span id="s1932">And that is something I will never erase out of my mind.</span> <span id="s1933">And I think this is when I decided, not consciously, to just not even see what was going on around me.</span> <span id="s1934">And then we were, as you know, we’re put into a s -- brought into a sauna and stripped of everything.</span> <span id="s1935">Our hair was shorn, our body hair was shorn and w-we were screamed at.</span> <span id="s1936">I never forget that sauna for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s1937">It was a very large room, it was a brick building, and there were SS lined -- male SS lined on both sides of the walls, making dirty jokes.</span> <span id="s1938">You know, we were all naked while we were being shaved.</span> <span id="s1939">And that is too much for anybody to even think reasonably.</span> <span id="s1940">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: Prisoners shaved you, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: Prisoners shaved us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: Did they talk to you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: No, they were too busy.</span> <span id="s1945">And -- and they couldn’t even tattoo us any more because by that time they -- they couldn’t -- they had so many transports coming in, they weren’t tattooing any more.</span> <span id="s1946">They did these idiotic things.</span> <span id="s1947">They gave us dirty dresses, no underwear, no socks, just wooden clogs and a dirty dress, and this is the -- Poland, the winter, in October.</span> <span id="s1948">And then we had to get past another prisoner who had a -- a can of red paint, and put a stripe of glossy red paint on this black, lousy rags that I had on.</span> <span id="s1949">I mean, really idiotic things.</span> <span id="s1950">And then they pushed that into the muddy road again, it was still raining, and that’s when we ended up in Birkenau in one of the -- the barracks.</span> <span id="s1951">And they couldn’t cope with all the people they had.</span> <span id="s1952">Buschi claims we were eight on a cot, Zdena says we were seven on a cot.</span> <span id="s1953">It doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1954">We could -- nobody could turn without everybody else turning.</span> <span id="s1955">And we never saw utensils.</span> <span id="s1956">We -- there was one dirty blanket to cover all of us, and it was so filthy it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1957">And then the next morning, people came in to -- or the next day some time, they brought in some soup, some -- you know, in -- in a big canister, and they dished it out into metal dishes, and each plank bed got one metal dish, and we had to use our hands to eat, and it was quite liquid, that stuff.</span> <span id="s1958">And whoever could shovel it the faster -- in the fastest got the most.</span> <span id="s1959">But I don’t remember whether it was the same day, I think it was the following day, that there were a few people who threw themselves against the electric wire.</span> <span id="s1960">And men came in to pick up the dead, and -- with pushcarts.</span> <span id="s1961">And one of the men was a friend of mine, and he knew my father, too, he was in our transport.</span> <span id="s1962">And he -- his wife was also in my camp, and he whispered to his wife, “Tell Uschi that Walter and Otto didn’t make it.”</span> <span id="s1963">And she told me that.</span> <span id="s1964">And from that day on, I never had any hope that my father or my brother had survived.</span> <span id="s1965">And then, years later, the Holocaust museum, my brother and my father’s names are right there.</span> <span id="s1966">The wonderful Nazi records --</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Of who they killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Of -- they were killed that same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: That same day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: That same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: Okay, let’s stop the tape and we’ll change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: Do you have any recollection of the uprising at the end of October?</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1977">You didn’t hear anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: You mean in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: In ow -- I’m sorry, in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s1981">I think I was too occupied with myself.</span> <span id="s1982">I was too new in -- in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1983">I didn’t know people well enough.</span> <span id="s1984">The only thing that is really imprinted on my memory is this incident, I don’t know if -- if you read it in my book, when we had selection and the Hungarian girl fled into our barrack.</span> <span id="s1985">I don’t -- and I also learned from other prisoners, and I really didn’t believe it, that they were doing experiments on people, and I didn’t believe that either.</span> <span id="s1986">I just -- I mean, I just could not comprehend some of the things that I heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: So, did you not believe they were gassing people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: No, that I believed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: You believed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: I believed that, and I -- and I know that my friends from Terezín, the Hirschfeld’s wouldn’t have told me that my father and my brother didn’t make it into the camp, that was right after I arrived.</span> <span id="s1991">And I learned from others in the camp that people were being gassed, and that -- that this -- there was a horrible smell in Auschwitz, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: I was going to ask you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: But I think I experienced that more when I was selected for work.</span> <span id="s1994">Well, before I was selected for work, we had this horrendous experience with the Hungarians girls.</span> <span id="s1995">They were fairly young girls, and there was as -- some of these people who had been in Auschwitz for any length of time, they didn’t look like human beings any more.</span> <span id="s1996">They’re called the musselmen, a -- I don’t know where the heck that came from, but they were really walking skeletons.</span> <span id="s1997">And their skin, and the expressions on their faces, and their eyes, th -- cannot be described.</span> <span id="s1998">And next to our barrack was a barrack that housed Hungarian women.</span> <span id="s1999">A lot of young women, who had been there a relatively long time for Auschwitz, you know, a number of months, and they have been through I think what -- two selections before, so there were no older people left in that barrack, they were all younger pl -- people.</span> <span id="s2000">But they were coming closer di -- to the description of these musselmen.</span> <span id="s2001">They were in terrible shape.</span> <span id="s2002">And they had a selektion, and of course, I did -- never heard of a selektion, we had only been in these barracks for a relatively short time, and they were shooting, and we thought this is it, they’re going to just shoot everybody around.</span> <span id="s2003">And then one of the girls managed to get into our barrack.</span> <span id="s2004">And apparently another girl was killed, was shot by the SS, but our elder, our block elder knew this girl, and they had been in Auschwitz for a long time, and apparently she has -- had escaped selektions a number of times.</span> <span id="s2005">And here we were fairly new, and all this was -- we were being told all these horrors that I couldn’t digest.</span> <span id="s2006">And here, I will never forget this girl, she’s standing there at the end of the barrack, and the block elder, who seemed like a pretty brutal woman herself, was shielding her.</span> <span id="s2007">And she told us that she’d been there for such and such a time, she’d been selected a few times, and that people were being selected after they were not physically strong any more, and they were being gassed.</span> <span id="s2008">And she gave such a vivid description and she told us about how many of her friends had been -- had been gassed, that it finally dawned on me, ma -- maybe this is true.</span> <span id="s2009">Maybe this is so.</span> <span id="s2010">It wasn’t just when you come there that they select you like Mengele, but they select you afterwards.</span> <span id="s2011">Now that was -- that wa -- made a terrible impression on me.</span> <span id="s2012">And then shortly after that, we had a selektion for work.</span> <span id="s2013">And it was a fairly large table outside, and it was pretty cold, and we had to all strip naked again, and walk in front of this table.</span> <span id="s2014">And there was a man, a representative from industry at one end, and two SS officers at that table.</span> <span id="s2015">And he selected very few people.</span> <span id="s2016">And we were kind of standing in line, naked.</span> <span id="s2017">And when I got to this man from industry, he asked me to show him my hands, which I did.</span> <span id="s2018">I -- I don’t have a very small, fancy hand.</span> <span id="s2019">And then h-he motioned obviously that he was going to take me for work at the factory he represented.</span> <span id="s2020">And the people selected for work, as I said before, were a relatively small number.</span> <span id="s2021">And we were then pushed into the road again, and you know, we had -- we could put a -- we only had a dress anyway, put our dress on, was pushed into the road.</span> <span id="s2022">And we were put into a s -- we were in front of another sauna, a bath house, and by that time, I believe that people were being gassed, because we could smell the burning flesh, really.</span> <span id="s2023">And when the SS guard told us that we had to strip naked before we even got into the shower house, the sauna, I really thought that was it, because I also had learned that people were gassed in a sauna, that the gas came through the shower heads.</span> <span id="s2024">So it was welcome when we felt the ice cold water dripping on our skin.</span> <span id="s2025">And we again just got a shift, and no underwear, no socks.</span> <span id="s2026">And we were pushed into the road and we ended up in a women’s camp, which had mostly non-Jews in it.</span> <span id="s2027">I believe they were all Polish, at least the ones I saw.</span> <span id="s2028">The elder was a Pole.</span> <span id="s2029">And they had different insignias, which I learned there designated whether they were political prisoners or murderers.</span> <span id="s2030">And I understood from people there that the block elder was a murderer, that this particular triangle or whatever she wore, represented the identification of a murderess.</span> <span id="s2031">And she was very brutal, and horrible, and she beat people very readily.</span> <span id="s2032">And she s -- put -- she gave us different chores to do, and one of the chores that she dished out for me, was to carry the feces to the latrines during the night, with another woman, and accompanied by a Nazi guard.</span> <span id="s2033">You know, the women were not SS, they were Nazi guards in uniform.</span> <span id="s2034">And I shall never forget that night.</span> <span id="s2035">It was a very dark night, and there was a horrible smell, and the whole sky was bright red.</span> <span id="s2036">And these very tall chimneys were spewing particles into the air.</span> <span id="s2037">And the woman who carried the buckets with me, who had been in Auschwitz a lot longer than I had, she said, “Another transport must have arrived.</span> <span id="s2038">These are our people going through the chimney.”</span> <span id="s2039">You know, a normal person would have collapsed right there and there, and I don’t think things really penetrated.</span> <span id="s2040">We had much better bedding and plank beds.</span> <span id="s2041">They were the same size, but instead of, you know, eight people, or whatever, or seven or whatever we were on one, there were three of us.</span> <span id="s2042">One was Zdena from Prague, and one was Buschi from Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s2043">And we became friends for life.</span> <span id="s2044">And one day we were told to get ready for work and we were marched to the railroad trestle, and we were put into a transport.</span> <span id="s2045">And I cannot recall how long we were on transport, but then the trains stopped eventually -- because we were in cattle cars, and there was really no way -- you know, some cattle cars were older, and they were -- you -- you had an idea, looking through some of the little spaces, but there weren’t too many spaces to be found.</span> <span id="s2046">And we ended up in a place called Kudowa-Sackisch.</span> <span id="s2047">In other words, we had been going west, not east.</span> <span id="s2048">This was an airplane factory, and the man who had selected me worked -- was a representative of that airplane factory.</span> <span id="s2049">And I never forget that night.</span> <span id="s2050">We were so happy.</span> <span id="s2051">The beds were better, the blankets were wonderful, the food was better.</span> <span id="s2052">And, for the first time, we had shower, a hot shower, and we got a piece of soap.</span> <span id="s2053">And then the next morning we had to form a circle in the factory yard, and the German foreman stepped into the middle of that circle, and he looked around, and he decided he didn’t like anybody to work for him in the factory who wore eyeglasses.</span> <span id="s2054">I wore glasses and Zdena wore glasses, Buschi did not.</span> <span id="s2055">And he -- we stepped forward.</span> <span id="s2056">At first I didn’t want to step forward.</span> <span id="s2057">And Buschi said to me, “Haven’t we played enough fate?”</span> <span id="s2058">You know, and she was referring to my volunteering to go with my father, and my father and my brother going with me, and I put my glasses back on.</span> <span id="s2059">And of course he selected me to step forward, and Zdena step forward.</span> <span id="s2060">And then for some reason, he told Buschi to step forward.</span> <span id="s2061">And you know, either Zdena or I said to her, “But you don’t wear glasses.”</span> <span id="s2062">So, I never forget Buschi’s words.</span> <span id="s2063">She said, “That’s fate.</span> <span id="s2064">It’s supposed to be that way.”</span> <span id="s2065">“Das ist das Schicksal.</span> <span id="s2066">Es soll so sein.”</span> <span id="s2067">And there were six of us, and he called us garbage, rejects, who were not going to work in his factory, and we were going to be sent back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2068">And we were rounded up by a woman, a Nazi guard, but she was different from any of the guards that we had encountered.</span> <span id="s2069">She didn’t scream at us, she was kind of nice, she ki -- she somehow behaved as if she didn’t belong there.</span> <span id="s2070">Now, I don’t know what her history was, whether she wad -- was drafted into that, who knows?</span> <span id="s2071">But she -- she took us to the railroad trestle, and then I did something I felt terrible about for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s2072">And Buschi and Hannah and Zdena were very upset with me, because they felt very strongly that I had saved their lives.</span> <span id="s2073">It wasn’t just -- there was one other woman.</span> <span id="s2074">There were two other women who felt the same way, but we kind of lost contact after liberation.</span> <span id="s2075">And I pleaded with this guard, and I told you she seemed more accessible, because I would have never dreamt to do this in Auschwitz with any guard.</span> <span id="s2076">And I pleaded for my life, and I told her that I shouldn’t be there.</span> <span id="s2077">I was really not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2078">My mother was a Christian and I -- I shouldn’t be here.</span> <span id="s2079">And she answered in a way like somebody would who really felt badly about it.</span> <span id="s2080">And she said, “But there’s nothing I can do about it.”</span> <span id="s2081">“Kann nicht sta fur mat -- kann nicht daran tun.”</span> <span id="s2082">And then she left us, asked us to -- first she asked us to stay together, there were six, we didn’t know the others.</span> <span id="s2083">And she was flirting with two German soldiers who were accompanying the train.</span> <span id="s2084">In the meantime we realized that there was one other German woman, she had lived in Prague.</span> <span id="s2085">We never got too close with her, she was much older than most of us.</span> <span id="s2086">And there was another Czech woman, Hanka, she was a communist, through and through.</span> <span id="s2087">And I can say that I never felt a relationship with Hanka.</span> <span id="s2088">I mean, we all helped each other, but it wasn’t the same relationship I felt with Buschi and Hannah and Zdena.</span> <span id="s2089">And there was one woman, Hannah, and we three became very close friends.</span> <span id="s2090">And then one of the soldiers came to us.</span> <span id="s2091">In the meantime -- I must say this first, there were hundreds of inmates on the railroad trestle.</span> <span id="s2092">They were Hungarian workers who had worked in the factory, and who -- they had worked these women practically to death.</span> <span id="s2093">They could hardly stand, they had open sores, impetigo, whatever it was, they were in horrible shape.</span> <span id="s2094">And they had been pushed by the SS into cattle cars until the cattle cars were full to the brim, and then they locked the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s2095">And our guard had stayed with us in the meantime, and then had gone over to the soldiers, and the SS had left.</span> <span id="s2096">Because I think that we were the responsibility of that Nazi guard.</span> <span id="s2097">And then one of the soldiers came over and told us to follow him and he put us into the last cattle car.</span> <span id="s2098">And we were the only six in this huge cattle car, and then he locked the cattle car.</span> <span id="s2099">And I have no idea any more, and I’m not sure even would have had an idea when we came -- when we finally ended up in Merzdorf, how long we had been in the cattle car.</span> <span id="s2100">But the soldiers finally opened the door and joined us in the cattle car.</span> <span id="s2101">One was relatively young, and you know, the -- Hannah thinks this guy was this old, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2102">And the younger of the soldiers cried, and he told his buddy that if his people did that to human beings, he didn’t want to live any more.</span> <span id="s2103">And they gave us bread, they gave us cheese, they gave us privacy.</span> <span id="s2104">I mean, we hadn’t seen white bread for years, and cheese.</span> <span id="s2105">And they gave us privacy to use a bucket.</span> <span id="s2106">And we sat in this huge cattle car in one corner, and deciding what are we going to do when we return to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2107">And the only language that Hannah, Zdena, and the -- and the other Czech girl, and I and the -- the -- the German girl we didn’t have too much close relationship with, spoke, was German, because they were all educated people, and this -- most of the Czechs spoke German, and of course the Dutch do.</span> <span id="s2108">And Buschi’s family originally came from Germany anyway, so I don’t remember whether she had some German grandparents or what.</span> <span id="s2109">And Buschi and I decided that we were going to throw each -- ourselves against the electric wire instead of being gassed.</span> <span id="s2110">And the German soldiers heard that, you know, we spoke their language.</span> <span id="s2111">And the train came to a standstill.</span> <span id="s2112">I have no idea what they did while we were in the cattle car before the train left Auschwitz -- left the labor camp that we had been in before.</span> <span id="s2113">They must have spoken to the engineer of the train.</span> <span id="s2114">They must have coordinated it somehow.</span> <span id="s2115">But on the other hand, you have to realize that this was the very beginning of 1945, and things weren’t looking too great for the Germans.</span> <span id="s2116">So they told us to jump out of the cattle car and follow them.</span> <span id="s2117">And when we got onto the platform, we realized it said Merzdorf, it did not say Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2118">And we followed them through the small village of Merzdorf.</span> <span id="s2119">It’s a very mountainous region.</span> <span id="s2120">It’s a beautiful region.</span> <span id="s2121">It was very cold.</span> <span id="s2122">It was probably the very beginning of January, with snow and ice on the road.</span> <span id="s2123">And here are these decrepit looking women, with a thin shift, and wooden clogs, no hair, following uniformed German soldiers through the village of Merzdorf.</span> <span id="s2124">And the villagers were coming out of their doors look -- staring after us.</span> <span id="s2125">And we went through a big gate, into a work camp.</span> <span id="s2126">It said, “Kamsta, Mettner and Frahne,” it was a factory.</span> <span id="s2127">They made linens there, which we later found out, from the original raw material of flax.</span> <span id="s2128">And they told us to wait, and then they went to see the commander of the camp, who was a woman.</span> <span id="s2129">The most vulgar looking woman I’ve ever seen in my life, Anna Rinke.</span> <span id="s2130">She might only have weighed 300 pounds, I remember her weighing 400 pounds.</span> <span id="s2131">She was tall and big.</span> <span id="s2132">She was bursting out of her Nazi uniform.</span> <span id="s2133">And she stood in front of these soldiers, quite a ways from us.</span> <span id="s2134">We were on one side of this very big area, within the factory buildings -- yard, and -- and they had to get into her place on the other side.</span> <span id="s2135">And all I remember her coming out and screaming at them, “I don’t want them here, get them out of here, send them back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2136">That’s it.”</span> <span id="s2137">And they stood in front of her, they gave the Nazi salute, they clicked their heels, they left us there, they never looked back.</span> <span id="s2138">So, with all my hatred for Germans, we owe our lives to these soldiers.</span> <span id="s2139">And not a letter or a telephone call for many years, whether it was from Hannah, or Zdena, or Buschi, without questioning if we only would know the names or where these people are, they saved our lives, I’m sure at a considerable risk to themselves.</span> <span id="s2140">But again, they probably couldn’t have taken that risk if we would have come there much earlier than we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: So she let you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: She had no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: She had no choice because you were standing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: The train was gone, we had no choice, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: I want to ask you two sort of si -- simple questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: Ho -- how did you know it was Mengele in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: I was told that in the camp by some of the people who had been in the camp longer than we were, and especially by the Hungarian girl.</span> <span id="s2149">And they described him to me, and I remember him.</span> <span id="s2150">I certainly wouldn’t have recognized his features.</span> <span id="s2151">I don’t think I would have had the guts to look in his face.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: And I only later learned that there were other physicians or SS who were selecting.</span> <span id="s2154">But I was told, and I took this, that they knew what they were talking about, that these transports were selected by Mengele.</span> <span id="s2155">And I was told then, for the first time, that -- by is -- people, you know, in the camp, who had been in Auschwitz much longer, that they were doing experiments on people, which also didn’t penetrate my he -- my brain.</span> <span id="s2156">I mean, I -- I didn’t know what they were talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: The other question is, how in heaven’s name were you able to keep your glasses?</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: Well, that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2159">You tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: Well, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2162">I had a pair of glasses, they had a pearl matte frame, and I had them when I left Düsseldorf.</span> <span id="s2163">I was very careful with my glasses because my vision was very poor since my birth.</span> <span id="s2164">And I can’t comprehend it, because here I’m in this country with wonderful technology, and it wasn’t too long ago, with a different pair of glasses than these that I was accompanying a friend to the hospital and the lens fell out on the floor.</span> <span id="s2165">And these glasses lasted.</span> <span id="s2166">I think they were thicker glasses in those days, the frames were thicker, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2167">I was very careful with them because they were part of my life.</span> <span id="s2168">I can’t see without glasses.</span> <span id="s2169">When I was in Terezín, I had a special place for them on my bunkbed, and the girls would never go into my bunkbed, that was my bunkbed.</span> <span id="s2170">When I was in Auschwitz, I didn’t take them off at all, ever.</span> <span id="s2171">When I came into the next camp, where I’ve met Buschi and Zdena, I also kept them on the bunkbed, or on my nose.</span> <span id="s2172">And the same in Merzdorf.</span> <span id="s2173">And believe me, I was really frightened that something could happen to them.</span> <span id="s2174">But I wasn’t beaten up ever, which would have caused them to be thrown on the floor, so they somehow survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: I was actually more curious in Auschwitz, even though you weren’t tattooed, you were shaved, and you went through the sauna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: So did you hold them in your hand?</span> <span id="s2178">Did you hide them from people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: That I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: Because they took things away from everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: Yeah, but they --</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: They didn’t touch you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: I -- I kept my glasses.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: It’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: They must have been on my nose, because if I had them -- I don’t recall putting them in my -- but the same thing with Zdena.</span> <span id="s2186">Zdena came from the sa -- it was a ta -- same transport as I, and Zdena wore glasses, and they didn’t take her glasses either.</span> <span id="s2187">They took the glasses, of course, of people who were gassed.</span> <span id="s2188">So, whether they took glasses routinely of people they were sending to work, would it make sense to take glasses away from people you want to work -- for -- who -- who have to work for you?</span> <span id="s2189">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2190">But of our six, Zdena and I were the only ones who wore glasses, I think.</span> <span id="s2191">Hannah doesn’t wear glasses.</span> <span id="s2192">So while the others were -- he probably didn’t like them.</span> <span id="s2193">One of them was pretty short.</span> <span id="s2194">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2195">It’s -- it’s -- it’s, you know -- I have --</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">Q: It’s a mystery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A: It’s a mystery.</span> <span id="s2198">It’s -- it’s -- it’s an absolute mystery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: No, I have no clue.</span> <span id="s2201">And I was very -- I was very much aware of the necessity of guarding my glasses, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Okay, we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">End of Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Beginning Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: Ursula, I’ll go back to Ursula.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: Your friends, Hannah, Buschi, Hanka, Zdena --</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: Zdena.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">Q: Zdena.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Q: Sorry.</span> <span id="s2212">And Hilde.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: Well, Hilde is Buschi.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: Hilde is Buschi.</span> <span id="s2215">Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">A: Right, that was her nickname.</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2218">Did you meet in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: Yes, we met in that women’s camp, which was mostly all -- not all of them, only Buschi and -- and Zdena and I, and then we met the other ones when we were round -- when we were rounded up in Kudowa, and we were rejects.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2221">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: But only -- only Zdena and -- and Buschi and I met in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2223">And Hannah and -- and the others two, we met when we are all rejected.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: And what was it about all of you that you think brought you together and allowed you to be so good for each other?</span> <span id="s2227">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: Well, I think that Hanka, who -- just to differentiate her from Hannah, she was Czech, and sh -- I’m sure she was a communist.</span> <span id="s2229">I mean, we all knew she was a communist.</span> <span id="s2230">I -- I had nothing to do with her -- with her communism, but her whole manner and all this, I’m not sure that if it would just -- just been Hanka, that we would have become very good friends, okay?</span> <span id="s2231">But we were the six who were selected to be sent back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2232">And so we really stuck together.</span> <span id="s2233">My closest friends were Buschi and Zdena and Hannah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: So ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: And the other two, Hanka and I forget the other name, the -- the other German woman, she had lived in Prague for awhile, she was considerably older, and I was the youngest of the whole group.</span> <span id="s2236">They called me das Kind.</span> <span id="s2237">And Hannah, when they used to call home, and Hans would talk to -- they would never talk to each other that how is Uschi, [indecipherable] macht das Kind, you know.</span> <span id="s2238">The Czechs speak some German too, but the -- my husband very seldom spoke German, but it was always when they referred to me as th -- some Kind, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: And -- and Hannah is still kidding about it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: So this was -- this became another family for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: It became a family.</span> <span id="s2243">Zdena and Buschi and I worked outdoors in transport, and the other girls worked in the factory and I don’t think that we three could have survived without the girls in the factory, because they stole flax and -- and yarn, and we made warmers to put in our wooden clogs, on our head, and chest warmers, and I think that was a horrible winter in those mountains, and I don’t think we could have survived.</span> <span id="s2244">We supported each other constantly.</span> <span id="s2245">We more often found something in the garbage at the railroad station because we had to unload coal cars, and flax cars, than they did.</span> <span id="s2246">They had no way to get anything.</span> <span id="s2247">And anything we found we would carry back to the camp and divide it between the six of us, we would never eat it alone.</span> <span id="s2248">If somebody was sick, we supported them.</span> <span id="s2249">We -- it was taking your life into your own hands if you -- if you even went to the so-called doctor, who happened to be a -- a dentist.</span> <span id="s2250">There were no medicines anyway, and I never was sick except for one day when I’m sure I had a fever and I was ready to topple over, and Sunday were wonderful days in Merzdorf for Anna Rinke, she would torture us standing for hours and hours.</span> <span id="s2251">It was very cold, and I was ready to pass out.</span> <span id="s2252">And both Zdena and Buschi were much taller than I was, especially Zdena was very tall.</span> <span id="s2253">And sh -- Zdena stood in front, and Buschi in back and they literally supported me.</span> <span id="s2254">Because to -- to -- in those -- at that time still, if you told them you were sick, I mean, there was always a danger they could transport you back to an extermination camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">Q: Did -- could you notice, or did you notice that other women in the camp were doing something similar, or was -- were -- the working of your group was unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">A: No, it was unique.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: It was unique.</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A: I think we were unique, and then we were the last ones to arrive in Merzdorf, and there was a large cons -- contingent of Hungarian women there, who were constantly fighting which is -- which -- with each other, or cooking together, you know, imaginary cooking.</span> <span id="s2259">And they were -- there was -- there were a few Germans -- German Jews, but the rest of them were all Poles, Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s2260">And they didn’t want to have anything to do with us, especially the Polish Jews, who had been there much longer than any one of us, so any new person who arrived was just -- they probably felt depriving them of food and so -- you know, it’s -- it’s very hard to understand, we were all Jews, but we -- we were not supportive of each other.</span> <span id="s2261">I hate to say this, but that’s -- that’s the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: So you saw a lot of conflict?</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: I saw conflict, and I didn’t -- I did not see a group that stuck together the way we did.</span> <span id="s2264">And some of the Polish Jews who had been there for a much longer time, some of them had better positions, some of them worked in th -- in the kitchens, and they knew each other, and they would give food to -- to others, you know, who came from similar background.</span> <span id="s2265">But relatively speaking, we were not in aush -- i-in Merzdorf that long.</span> <span id="s2266">From January to liberation, which seemed like a lifetime, but without that friendship, you know -- and I was very lucky that I was asked to spread salt, rock salt on the scales.</span> <span id="s2267">The s -- some of the stuff coming in had to be weighed, and the scales were all frozen, they weren’t working, so I was given the job of spreading rock salt.</span> <span id="s2268">So I reasoned, if cattle can eat rock salt, why can’t we?</span> <span id="s2269">And the camp had run out of salt for months.</span> <span id="s2270">And that is very weakening whe -- when you have to work.</span> <span id="s2271">So I stuffed my pockets full of rock salt, and the six of us lived off that rock salt until liberation.</span> <span id="s2272">And we -- we dug up horse -- we f -- I found -- I don’t know if I found, or Buschi, or one of us found a horseradish patch, which we dug up.</span> <span id="s2273">And I think the Nazi guard probably realized we were doing it.</span> <span id="s2274">And it was coming towards the end of the war, and one of the worst guards ever, we called her Pigface -- and I knew there was hope one day when I was coming up the stairs onto our dormitory and the SS were a fl -- a flight above, and she was coming down the stairs, Pigface.</span> <span id="s2275">She looked like a pig.</span> <span id="s2276">She was very brutal and horrible, and she had this porcelain dish, which had sauerkraut and mashed potatoes, that’s all I remember, there might have been something else on it.</span> <span id="s2277">She shoved that onto me, and she said, “Friss.”</span> <span id="s2278">Now friss is -- is a word that is not used for human beings, that shows you what she thought of us.</span> <span id="s2279">You only talk frisson about pigs, about animals.</span> <span id="s2280">There is a big distinction in the German language.</span> <span id="s2281">So I was on the level of an animal, but at least something was in the wind.</span> <span id="s2282">Pigface was giving me her dish with food, and I was delighted, and I carried it up to the dorm, and of course we all shared it.</span> <span id="s2283">And we thought this was a good omen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: What was your physical condition?</span> <span id="s2285">Had you deteriorated a great deal, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: I was very, very thin, but I think I was relatively healthy.</span> <span id="s2287">I -- I th -- I think -- I know that Buschi and Zdena and I were healthier than the other three girls, and -- and I believe that it was the fresh air, and the physical work, even though we got very little to eat, I mean, watery soup.</span> <span id="s2288">But we did find some discarded carrots in the garbage, and we found some turnips in the garbage, and we ate grass.</span> <span id="s2289">So that somehow -- actually, I was stronger, and Buschi too, even though she was quite a bit older than I was, even than Zdena.</span> <span id="s2290">Because after liberation, they all -- w-we got these six bikes from the Russian officer, and we were all going to bike to Prague, and the girls couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s2291">Only Buschi and I. Even Zdena got weak, but Buschi and I were able to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: And that’s pretty far.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: Well, we separated in -- at the border, because Hannah suffered a heart attack, and we had to leave her at the hospital.</span> <span id="s2296">So that we decided, Buschi and I, that our plan was to go with a -- our Czech girls to Prague, and then take t -- public transportation.</span> <span id="s2297">But a Russian officer told us there was no transportation, nothing, and his advice is everybody should go back to the country that they came from, to their home.</span> <span id="s2298">Well we had no home, we told him.</span> <span id="s2299">Well, he said, “Well, you have to go back to the country you came from and then try to get out of Europe.”</span> <span id="s2300">And si -- that’s what we -- we did.</span> <span id="s2301">We separd -- separated at the Czech border, when the girls had to go south to Prague and we went on, destination Lippborg, which was the designation of a little village my aunt lived in, and my parents had said, “If you get separated, we meet at Aunt Minchen’s house.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: Now, let me just go back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: Do you remember the day when you’re free?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: We were fr -- we -- we heard a lot of commotion the night before of valises being dragged a-around and -- and there were trucks outside on the -- on the ground -- the factory grounds.</span> <span id="s2308">And we were, you know, we were not allowed to open windows, everything was closed, the windows were locked, and some of the Hungarians were imagining we were all going to be gassed in there.</span> <span id="s2309">This is why they locked all the doors and everything.</span> <span id="s2310">They were came -- became very hysterical.</span> <span id="s2311">And then it was the next morning, after our -- the SS and the guards, everybody had fled, that the door was opened by a German soldier, who appeared all alone, and said, “Meine Damen, sie sind frei.”</span> <span id="s2312">“My ladies, you are free.”</span> <span id="s2313">We looked at each other, we’re looking for the ladies.</span> <span id="s2314">And we couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2315">And we -- of course, we didn’t believe him.</span> <span id="s2316">And he was a German, how could we believe him?</span> <span id="s2317">And it was Maurice and his -- his Belgian friend, and also prisoner, who we had befriended, especially I had befriended Maurice very much, and he had promised me he would take me through the meadows, who literally had to drag us out of there.</span> <span id="s2318">And to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: Maurice was another prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: He was a French prisoner, a prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s2321">These were two prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s2322">There were more than two, but these were the two that we ha -- occasionally came in contact with, who kept our spirits up, and -- and that wonderful advice.</span> <span id="s2323">If -- everybody was afraid they were going to put us on a forced march, and don’t go on a forced march.</span> <span id="s2324">I never even thought of a forced march till Maurice kept saying this.</span> <span id="s2325">And I said, “Well, how can we refuse it if it’s going to be enforced with machine guns?”</span> <span id="s2326">Well try everything, you know.</span> <span id="s2327">But he said that’s going to be the death of you because it was, you know, pretty horrible weather.</span> <span id="s2328">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: Fortunately you didn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: Yeah, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s2331">Fortunately they decided to -- to flee.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">A: I think the Russians were coming in too fast, because the -- the German soldier opened the door, and the -- I think the Russians were coming in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s2334">And the first Russian soldier was on a bicycle, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s2335">And he -- you know, he was just trying to find out what was going on, and -- and he later identified himself as Jewish.</span> <span id="s2336">But a lot of these Russian Jews, they weren’t very Jewish, you know, they -- but he said he was really born a Jew, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">Q: So you went back to Lippborg to find your mother, and the other relatives, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2339">Yes, Buschi and I -- the bicycle that -- bicycles that were given to us, we -- by the Russian officer, we -- we avoided the main roads, and we found a German s -- a dead German soldier.</span> <span id="s2340">Buschi found him.</span> <span id="s2341">We usually picnic at the side of the road, secondary roads only, because we were warned not to take the main roads.</span> <span id="s2342">And he had a map in his -- in his pocket, and that map got us all the way to -- I mean, got Buschi to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">A: Yeah, yeah, we followed that map.</span> <span id="s2345">Had swastikas on it, but it follow -- it -- it really helped.</span> <span id="s2346">It really helped.</span> <span id="s2347">It was a very, very good map.</span> <span id="s2348">And we -- we sh -- sought shelter, and we stayed with people, and I must say, in the Russian -- what is now the Russian -- what used to be the Russian zone, East Germany, people were much nicer to us.</span> <span id="s2349">I think they were scared to death.</span> <span id="s2350">Most of them had fled, and they were scared to death of the Russians.</span> <span id="s2351">But there was one place over the Mulde River where we had to cross, that was a separation line, the demarcation line of the Russian and the American forces, and the Russians let us go over.</span> <span id="s2352">Half the bridge was Russian, half American, the we -- Americans wouldn’t let us cross.</span> <span id="s2353">And we pleaded, and we came back, and came back, and I think it was two or three days later, Buschi finally persuaded them -- we -- we both spoke English, but Buschi’s English was better than mine at that time.</span> <span id="s2354">And they told us to come back the next morning, and if they are busy on the field telephone, we’d better follow their instructions.</span> <span id="s2355">Well, we got to them exactly when they said we should be there, and they were busy on the field telephone, and they said, “Get the hell out of here.”</span> <span id="s2356">And we sure did get the hell out of there.</span> <span id="s2357">We -- we bicycled like the devil was after us, and we were in the American zone.</span> <span id="s2358">And then we -- I’ll never forget Dresden, never.</span> <span id="s2359">I mean, the lamp posts were like straws, and the -- everything was in -- in horrible condition.</span> <span id="s2360">I mean, the pictures that my husband took of Kassel -- and of Kassel too, we came through Kassel, is exactly what we saw.</span> <span id="s2361">And we just had one goal, I mean, to get to Lippborg, and for Buschi to get to Holland.</span> <span id="s2362">And I won’t go into any detail, you don’t have the time, but you know, in my book I go into all these details, and if you want any other details, you can ask me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: And I remember going over the river in Kassel, the Mulde, and I really thought we wouldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s2365">I mean, the bridge was so bad, it was so bombed out it was just horrendous, but we made it.</span> <span id="s2366">And eventually, I mean after bicycling for almost a month, and one incident was we were almost overtaken by Russian soldiers who -- who thought girls were a nice catch at that time, and the Russian officer saved us there.</span> <span id="s2367">But when we came close to -- to Lippborg, which is from where we started out from, about 500 miles by bicycle, in our condition.</span> <span id="s2368">We -- there is only one street in that village, called Dorfstrasse.</span> <span id="s2369">And it’s -- it’s pretty hilly, and we were pushing our bikes up Dorfstrasse, cobblestones Dorfstrasse.</span> <span id="s2370">And it has a very narrow sidewalk, and I saw a woman who was carrying a big load of wash.</span> <span id="s2371">She had gray hair and I recognized that woman, even though I’d remembered her with jet black hair, it was my mother.</span> <span id="s2372">And she recognized me too.</span> <span id="s2373">But she came over, and she just barely embraced me, she just her hand on me, but she was looking back.</span> <span id="s2374">She was expecting some others to follow me.</span> <span id="s2375">She was looking for my father and my brother.</span> <span id="s2376">And before she said anything else, she said, “Papi,” which we called my father, “and Bübchen are not coming back?”</span> <span id="s2377">And then she screamed.</span> <span id="s2378">“My child is back.”</span> <span id="s2379">“Mein Kind is zurück!”</span> <span id="s2380">And the villagers came out of their houses, and everybody asked, because we had visited my aunt so many times as children, you know, where’s your father and where’s your brother.</span> <span id="s2381">And we stayed in lip -- I mean, Buschi stayed in Lippborg for I don’t remember exactly, maybe a couple of weeks, and my grandmother and my aunts, you know, they bro -- they -- first they got everything going, hot water, and they didn’t have, you know, automatic hot water, they had big stoves and they were heating up the kettles, and -- and the big bathtub on the huge kitchen tile floor, and then Buschi and I were getting baths with -- they were scrubbing us, and my grandmother was saying, “Well you know, you still have to go over the neck, and they are still filthy over here and there.”</span> <span id="s2382">And they discarded our clothes, they gave us new clothes, and they nursed us back to health.</span> <span id="s2383">And they persuaded Buschi to stay longer than he -- she had wanted to, and then Buschi had to go back to Amsterdam, she had to tell her in-laws that she, the Jew survived, and that her husband, their only son, was killed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2384">And Buschi and Hannah stayed friends for -- and I, we stayed friends for life.</span> <span id="s2385">And finally my mother and I were able to come to this country in 1947, and I shall never forget that -- the er -- S.S. Ernie Pyle taking us into New York harbor, and that Statue of Liberty, and I think that most immigrants never forget that picture, you know.</span> <span id="s2386">They all think like I did, she’s giving a special welcome to us.</span> <span id="s2387">So, it would have been nice if we could have come here in ’48.</span> <span id="s2388">We would have had -- our family would have been together, but that was not to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q: You mean ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A: In ’38, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A: I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s2393">But that was not to be.</span> <span id="s2394">And I love this country, it’s -- it’s a wonderful country, and I met my husband here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">Q: And you had two boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: And two boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: And your mother remarried?</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: Yeah, a wonderful stepfather, who I must say I liked, but I don’t think I appreciated him as much as I should have.</span> <span id="s2399">I think I missed my father so much that there was such a resentment that he didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s2400">I mean, don’t get me wrong, we had a very good relationship, but sometimes I feel maybe I could have been more loving to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: The boys only knew one grandfather --</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: -- that was Siegmund, who could not have been more wonderful if they had been his own grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2405">And they loved their grandmother.</span> <span id="s2406">So that’s my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Well, there’s obviously more to tell, but -- thank you so very much for coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: Oh, you’re welcome, it’s -- I think it’s -- it’s a -- it’s a wonderful thing you are doing, and -- and I’m very appreciative.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q: Well, I know this was not easy to -- to do.</span> <span id="s2410">The loss is very great.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">A: Well, yeah, I -- somehow, sometimes it’s harder than others.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: You know, I talk about it.</span> <span id="s2414">I’m not talking about it as much any more as I did.</span> <span id="s2415">I can’t write Hans’ story and keep going out and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: -- and it’s -- I do it at [indecipherable] Valley college.</span> <span id="s2418">I think it’s so important.</span> <span id="s2419">We are busing in 3000 kids every year, and we can’t -- we don’t -- many, many more want to come, and it’s a wonderful program.</span> <span id="s2420">And we have speakers, and we have a discussion group with survivors, and righteous and liberators.</span> <span id="s2421">And I think it’s -- it’s a wonderful program, but I’m not sure how much more I will do going to individual schools.</span> <span id="s2422">It -- it does take a lot out of me, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2424">Well, thank you very much, I’m very grateful that you came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">A: You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s2426">You’re -- you’ve been great, you’re a wonderful interviewer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: You’re very kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: And I have given very few interviews.</span> <span id="s2429">I have given some after the book was published, to, you know, television stations, etcetera, but you are unique, you’re very, very wonderful.</span> <span id="s2430">And the atmosphere is just -- how can you top this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: Yes, can’t top it.</span> <span id="s2432">You can’t top it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: You can’t top this, this is wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: So thank you again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: Oh, you’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">End of Tape Nine Beginning of Tape 10</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">Q: And who is this good looking person here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">A: My mother, (1) Lina Lenneberg.</span> <span id="s2439">She called herself Caroline when -- after she came to this country.</span> <span id="s2440">Approximately 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: And this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">A: (2) My mother and I.

1935 or ’36.</span> <span id="s2449">There is no date on the picture, so this is my guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: And this picture here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">A: My father -- my -- excuse me, my mother’s brother Konrad, my (4) Uncle Konrad Schneider.</span> <span id="s2452">And I was a small child, and I loved him very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: And this shot, three of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">A: (5) My parents, and I was a baby, and that was taken in Dortmund, so it must have been 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">Q: And this shot?</span></p>

mother.</span> <span id="s2472">She perished in Terezín.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">Q: And what is this document?</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A: This is a (11) card written by my brother Walter from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2475">These were cards which prisoners were encouraged to write to give the impression that we were in a wonderful place.</span> <span id="s2476">And it was supposed to go to either relatives, or Germans, to give the impression that we were really living in a wonderful Jewish town.</span> <span id="s2477">So what he wrote is really what he was allowed to write.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: He had a very straight penmanship as a young boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2480">See, at that point, it was already Hauptstrasse.</span> <span id="s2481">They had changed the Q’s and -- so this is -- this is what, instead of 1114 now I ha -- I remember, now it’s Hauptstrasse, it was -- 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">Q: And what is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">A: This is the (12) fake money that was issued in Terezín for the benefit of the Red Cross inspection of Theresienstadt in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">Q: And this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: This myself, (13) Ursula Pawel -- Ursula Lenneberg, sorry.</span> <span id="s2486">Pr-Probably 1940, in Düsseldorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: And this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: This was a (14) blanket issued to me in Merzdorf, and it had my number on it.</span> <span id="s2489">I never had a tattoo, and the number was -- was embroidered on the blanket.</span> <span id="s2490">I carried that blanket all the way from Merzdorf home.</span> <span id="s2491">I still have that blanket, and I have cut the number out, because I used it for some demonstration.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q: And this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: This is (15) Orange, Blanche, Bleu, which is a Dutch flag.</span> <span id="s2494">The roads were very insecure after liberation.</span> <span id="s2495">There was still fighting going on by partisans, and anybody who spoke German was taken into custody.</span> <span id="s2496">And my life was threatened after liberation.</span> <span id="s2497">So my Dutch friend Buschi suggested that I do not speak at all, that I was in shock and I lost my ability to speak.</span> <span id="s2498">And -- and I was -- we were both Dutch, and we made these -- these flags, and put them in our clothing and e -- we made a little bigger ones and put them on our bicycles.</span> <span id="s2499">The old manuscript pa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: That was taken in Deggendorf, in the displaced person camp after liberation, and as you can see (16) I gained quite a big of weight.</span> <span id="s2502">I was very thin when I came out of the camps, and it took me, I think, a couple of years before I went back to normal.</span> <span id="s2503">I really blew up like a balloon after getting proper food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: Are those the same glasses that made through the whole ordeal?</span> <span id="s2505">Your eyeglasses?</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">A: Yes, those are the same glasses.</span> <span id="s2507">I don’t think I got new glasses until I eventually came to Düsseldorf, and I think they were terrible.</span> <span id="s2508">Yeah, they made it through the whole ordeal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">Q: And this shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">A: I believe that was taken (17) in either Düsseldorf or Munich, and it was after the war.</span> <span id="s2511">I think it was 1946.</span> <span id="s2512">I still had a pretty full face, but I think I was getting down to more normal proportions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">Q: And who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">A: This is my husband (18) Hans Pawel, and this is in 1948, when I met him.</span> <span id="s2515">I only knew him six weeks and we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: Oh, you got married after six weeks --</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: -- not just engaged, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: No, no engagement.</span> <span id="s2520">We got married after six weeks.</span> <span id="s2521">And we were married for almost 51 years when he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: And the gentleman on the right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: His father, (19) Dr. Emil Pawel.</span> <span id="s2524">He was a physician and he attended soldiers in the trenches of Verdun in World War І, and his country gave him the Medal of Honor for that, des Eiserne Kreuz 1st Klasse.</span> <span id="s2525">And to top it off they then killed him in Izbica, or one of the other extermination camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q: And this on the left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">A: Hans’ father, my husband’s father, (20) Dr. Emil Pawel.</span> <span id="s2528">It’s pronounced in German Powell.</span> <span id="s2529">And I believe it was 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Q: It says ’38 to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: Oh, ’38, sorry.</span> <span id="s2532">And what was the ’42, then?</span> <span id="s2533">Oh, when he was killed, yeah.</span> <span id="s2534">So, I don’t know, I’m guessing.</span> <span id="s2535">I think it was -- I -- don’t I have a question mark there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2536">Q: Yes, you do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">A: I guess it’s ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">Q: And on the right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">A: His mother, (21) Olga Pawel -- Pawel.</span> <span id="s2540">Her maiden name was Neman.</span> <span
