id="s15">Q: And what name were you born with?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born Anita Weingarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I was born in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: What -- what day?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: October 4th, 1941 in a town, or city at that time in Poland.</span> <span id="s21">The name of the town is Boryslaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: All right, let’s talk a little bit -- let’s talk a little bit about your family, who your parents were.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Okay, my father, his name was Marek, in -- in engli -- in America he would probably be called Mark.</span> <span id="s24">Marek Weingarten and my birth mom, her name was Ethel Birenbaum from Chelm.</span> <span id="s25">Once she married my father, she became Ethel Weingarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Ah, let -- let’s talk about your father’s background, what do you know about that?</span> <span id="s27">Where he was from?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: He was born also in Boryslaw, Poland in 1906.</span> <span id="s29">April 25th, 1906, because my son was born 70 years down the road, April 25th, 1976.</span> <span id="s30">So I remember that.</span> <span id="s31">His background was, from what he told me, is that at one point as a child he was sent away to -- I don’t know if it was an orphanage or it was like a youth home for children.</span> <span id="s32">And he stayed there for awhile, and I think he was also schooled in that area.</span> <span id="s33">And then he returned.</span> <span id="s34">He also told me that his ancestors, or his father, which is actually my grandfather, his father came from Vienna.</span> <span id="s35">And in those days they made shidduchim, a shidduch, so he was matched up with my grandmother, who was from Poland, and apparently from Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s36">So that’s how the famil -- th-the roots of the family came from Vienna into Poland into Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s37">And my father became a craftsman, but the word -- what’s -- not a mechanic, but what is that called, the people who do fences from metal.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: An iron -- an ironworker, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I-I would say yeah.</span> <span id="s40">Worked with iron and created all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s41">And then s -- an-and -- and I think also my grandfather was involved in it, but after awhile he gave it up and he decided to assemble bicycles.</span> <span id="s42">And he opened a little workshop for himself and he employed his younger brother and he also employed a young man in that workshop and that’s what they did, they assembled bicycles and sold bicycles because it -- in those years, that was the mean of transportation, or you had a horse and a carriage, or you took the train.</span> <span id="s43">Not too many cars were yet in Poland.</span> <span id="s44">But what he told me that his dream was, before the war, to import cars into Poland and develop this -- this -- this whole idea of transportation.</span> <span id="s45">Well, unfortunately it didn’t work out, World War 2 broke out and those dreams were shattered.</span> <span id="s46">The other thing also, which I can mention it, he told me that he also was drafted into the Polish army and he served in the Polish army as a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What years was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: That is a good question.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Is this the --</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: I think it was -- it must have been -- if he was born in 906, he must have been in his late 20’s, I would say, maybe 22 - 24.</span> <span id="s51">And -- and he was very good in math, so he told me -- I asked him what was your job there in -- in the Polish army.</span> <span id="s52">And he told me it was buchalterie, which means it had to do with papers, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Bookkeeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: -- bookkeeping and whatever that was involved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Do y --</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: He -- he was fluent in German, and wrote German and he was fluent in -- in -- in the Polish language and wrote and read Polish, so -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Do you know if he experienced any anti-Semitism in the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No, he never mentioned that, no, no.</span> <span id="s59">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Was he a religious man?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: He came from a religious background, but he was not a religious man at all.</span> <span id="s62">He just simply turned away from religion.</span> <span id="s63">He felt that religion separates people and that was his outlook on life.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Let’s now talk about your mother and how they met, about your mother’s background?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yeah, I -- my mother’s background --</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Your birth -- your birth mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: My birth mother, now I don’t know when she was born, but I know that she passed away when she was like 26 - 27, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Which means you were how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Oh, I wasn’t even a year old, so if we can add to ’41 -- go -- you know, go back.</span> <span id="s70">So that must have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: So she died in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yeah, yes, she did, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: And what do I know about her?</span> <span id="s75">From -- very little that whatever my father told me about her.</span> <span id="s76">She was a dressmaker and studied in Vienna.</span> <span id="s77">And apparently she was a very good one, very talented.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: What -- what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Ethel.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And her last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: And her last name was Birenbaum.</span> <span id="s82">Ethel Birenbaum.</span> <span id="s83">And then, you know, when my father met her -- and I think my father was in his 30’s when he got married, I think maybe 33 - 34, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s85">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: And I think they were married a short time, maybe hardly two years and -- and less -- probably less than even two years.</span> <span id="s87">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: [indecipherable] were married, they had you as their child.</span> <span id="s89">How did you get the name Anita in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: The name Anita, my father said he named me Anita because when he ended up in that orphanage or boys’ dormitory, whatever it was, or -- or -- you know, when you send -- it was, I guess, customary in Europe to send children sometimes to go to school away from home, and from what he told me that his family, financially it was difficult for them to raise four children, so they sent him away as a young kid.</span> <span id="s91">And he said the woman that attended in that orphanage, her name was Anita and she was very kind and very nice and he said if ever he will have a child, and she will be a girl, he will name her Anita, and that’s how I got the name Anita.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s93">Obviously you -- you were too young to know what was happening between ’41 and ’45 in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Did your father remarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: My father remarried after -- immediately after the war.</span> <span id="s97">I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Oh, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: After, immediately after.</span> <span id="s100">Not during the war, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Okay, let’s talk now --</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: -- between ’41 and ’45, which obviously you don’t remember.</span> <span id="s104">What -- have you --</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: But what I --</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: -- what have you been told about those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s108">Okay, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Dealing with your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Right.</span> <span id="s111">I was told that the fellow that worked for my father, he was a Christian and I think a Baptist, he mentioned they were Baptists.</span> <span id="s112">And he lived not in Boryslaw, but -- but in a nearby village, apparently not too far.</span> <span id="s113">And when the war broke out -- and I was born in ’41, in October, it was very difficult to hide with me as a child, and my father approached him.</span> <span id="s114">And apparently they were very good friends on top of everything else, and my father approached him and asked him if he would go to his -- he wasn’t married yet, but he had a girlfriend, and his girlfriend was a teacher in that village.</span> <span id="s115">And he said, you know, we cannot hide with my baby.</span> <span id="s116">Would you be willing to take her?</span> <span id="s117">I’ll pay you whatever I have, I’ll -- you know, my money, and whatever I have in terms of furniture, and anything that I have, I will give you and I’ll help you to settle.</span> <span id="s118">Talk it over with your girlfriend.</span> <span id="s119">And so he did and -- his girlfriend at that time.</span> <span id="s120">They said -- she said fine, we marry, but we will have to move to another place because where did this kid come from, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Your -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: The neighbors would see a baby they would immediately know that they are harboring a Jewish kid.</span> <span id="s123">Hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: And you’re -- you’re about a year old now?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: No, I was less.</span> <span id="s126">I must have been like five months, four or five months.</span> <span id="s127">Very young, very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Oh, I thought you said your birth mother survived for a year after you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Separate, not with me.</span> <span id="s130">She was hidden separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: She -- we were -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: At this time your --</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: At this -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: -- your birth mother was still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Mi -- at this time my birth mother was still alive, but we were separated.</span> <span id="s137">I was given to the Baptist family.</span> <span id="s138">Her name was Stefka if I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s139">His name I haven’t -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s140">The guy’s name I don’t know.</span> <span id="s141">Her -- her husband.</span> <span id="s142">Which eventually they married and moved to another town.</span> <span id="s143">She was a teacher and apparently she got a job as a teacher.</span> <span id="s144">And with my father’s financial help that he gave them, they were willing to take me -- and since they had no children, cause they were a young couple.</span> <span id="s145">And that’s how I ended up with them.</span> <span id="s146">But in the meantime --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: What -- what town did you -- do they take you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: This I have no clue.</span> <span id="s149">My father never mentioned the name and I don’t -- even if he did I don’t remember the ti -- the town.</span> <span id="s150">So I spent with them til 19 -- til the end of the war, which was like 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Do you have any memories of those years?</span> <span id="s152">You were only four, obviously, when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Not quite four, because I think -- what I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: -- not the --</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: You were three, three and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: -- three and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Any memory --</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Well, I remember the journey, on a big truck that they came and picked me up with his new wife that my father remarried.</span> <span id="s160">I remember -- what I remember after the war, we ended up in a apartment building, in a tall apartment building, and I remember my father brought little Dominoes and we were building something with stacking up the Dominoes and if I’m not mistaken he lit a -- a match and he put like a match in between those Dominoes and somehow I have this image.</span> <span id="s161">Whether it really happened, that’s what, you know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s162">But that’s what I remember, sitting in an apartment building once I was apparently taken from the Christian family.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Now, what was happening to your father and your birth mother in those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s165">My father told me that he was captured, couple times by the Germans.</span> <span id="s166">And the way he told me, that the Germans used to come into the town --</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: He stayed in Boryslaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: He stayed in Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s169">And what they did, they knew -- it was called aksia, like you know, on this and that day the Germans are coming and speaking to the Jewish authorities, the rabbis, whatever it is, we need so many Jewish workers for a certain project.</span> <span id="s170">Please make sure that on this and that date they all concentrate in the square, they are ready to go.</span> <span id="s171">We build a bridge, or whatever it may be.</span> <span id="s172">And my father was pretty clever, he realized that at that time already, you know, there were rumors that they are being sent, but they’re not being sent to build bridges or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s173">So prior to that aksia he used to run away and escape from Boryslaw.</span> <span id="s174">During the time -- I’m going back now -- he managed to hide my mother -- my birth mother and my grandmother with a Christian woman, and he paid her.</span> <span id="s175">And what he claimed was, she was hiding was in a hole in the ground where they kept like potatoes and onions over the winter so it shouldn’t go rotten, you know, they didn’t have fridges in those days yet, so that’s where she sat with her mother, day after day after day.</span> <span id="s176">And unfortunately she contracted a --</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Tuberculosis?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Tuberculosis, yes.</span> <span id="s179">It started with like emphysema, and you know, they didn’t have antibiotics and the conditions were horrible and so forth.</span> <span id="s180">And then she developed TB and she passed away.</span> <span id="s181">If she would not have contracted TB, she would probably survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: And your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: And unfortunately when she died in ’42, the Christian lady just chased my grandmother out, she said, I don’t want to keep this old lady, out.</span> <span id="s184">And she ended up in one of the concentration camps, and you know the end of it is, you know, death.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Um --</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Boryslaw is near what big city?</span> <span id="s188">Is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: It’s near Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Mm-hm, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Drohobycz.</span> <span id="s192">In that vicinity.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: It’s called Doylni slonsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Mm-hm, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: And apparently there was a big Jewish commun -- I mean, I don’t know how big, but it was a r -- a relatively large Jewish community there.</span> <span id="s197">And Boryslaw was known for having oil -- oil.</span> <span id="s198">So, you know, they were digging for oil and they found oil in Boryslaw, so they had, you know, those --</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Derricks?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yes, right there, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: So now it’s the end of the war and your father comes to get you.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s203">What my father said, that during the time of the war, when he managed to escape each time there was an aksia --</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: -- and one time he was even caught and he ran away from -- managed to escape the camp.</span> <span id="s206">He used to come periodically to visit me at that village, but I was not supposed to know that he was my father and they gave him a nickname like Chapchuss.</span> <span id="s207">You know, whatever, that means nothing.</span> <span id="s208">It’s -- it’s, you know, it’s like a blabber word, whatever.</span> <span id="s209">So whenever they said oh, Chapchuss is coming to see you.</span> <span id="s210">Because in case, if one of the neighbors or Germans would come in, I may say, aw, Marek Wein -- whatever.</span> <span id="s211">In order not to have that, he was called Chapchuss.</span> <span id="s212">So, that was the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: What was your new name during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Oh, my name was Anna Theresa Beitsko.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And that was the name of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: And apparently that was their name, yes.</span> <span id="s217">I was also baptized, by the way.</span> <span id="s218">I was taken to church as a baby and baptized.</span> <span id="s219">So it shows you, I must have been a couple months old, you know.</span> <span id="s220">I don’t know, four or five, something like that.</span> <span id="s221">I was baptized and I was their child.</span> <span id="s222">Now, after the war, when the war ended, they maybe thought that nobody will survive, cause my mom died, grandma was taken into a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s223">They thought my father, who knows, he probably won’t survive either.</span> <span id="s224">But he did, and so immediately after the war, a law came out in Poland that if there is a parent and there is a child that survived, they have to be united.</span> <span id="s225">So that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s226">He came and -- and me -- remarried immediately after the war and came to claim me.</span> <span id="s227">From what he said, they didn’t want to give me up, cause they already raised me and I was three and a half, and they ran away, he claimed with me, and they hid someplace.</span> <span id="s228">But eventually, you know, the police -- the Polish police, which was, I think, called Enkavide and the Russian police too, together came and they said you -- that’s it, you must return the child.</span> <span id="s229">He is the rightful father and, you know.</span> <span id="s230">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s231">And I remember the journey on a truck, in the back of a truck, we were sitting on a truck and my father bought me this huge bear, which wasn't so huge, but it -- in my eyes it was huge and it made moo each time you turned it, and I was petrified.</span> <span id="s232">I was so scared of that bear.</span> <span id="s233">On the other hand I also got a doll, you know, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s234">And then we rode on the track to a city called Lignice and we settled there for awhile.</span> <span id="s235">There were lots of Russians.</span> <span id="s236">I de -- remember, because we lived there already for almost a year, or maybe even a year and a half.</span> <span id="s237">So now I started having memories of that place.</span> <span id="s238">My father opened a shop, like a deli place and --</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Tell me a little bit who your stepmother was.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: My step-mom is also a survivor.</span> <span id="s241">Her name was Clara Bardah from Chelm.</span> <span id="s242">She was one of six children.</span> <span id="s243">They were five sisters and one brother, and her parents both, Sela -- and I forgot the grandfather’s name.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: What was her last name?</span> <span id="s245">Her mai --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Bardah.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: So her --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Her -- her --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: -- maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: -- I -- Morgenstern.</span> <span id="s251">Her maiden name -- grandmothers -- my step-grandmother, her name was Tela Morgenstern, from Chelm, but then she married, I think his name was Wolfe.</span> <span id="s252">This -- her husband’s name, last name was Wolfe, but the first name I don’t remember calling him grandpa, but not by the first name.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: So your stepmother’s maiden name was Wolfe?</span> <span id="s254">Her father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Yeah, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: And from Boryslaw also?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: From Drohobycz.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Which was a relatively [indecipherable] she was not from Boryslaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: From Drohobycz.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s263">And now you’re in this new town with her -- with them --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: With -- with them --</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: -- the three of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Three of us, correct.</span> <span id="s267">And I remember our -- they rented an apartment, a big apartment because my step-mom survived, and her sisters survived, five sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Had she been in a camp, your stepmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: No, no, my step-mom, they all managed to get false papers that they are Christians.</span> <span id="s270">They all had, except one sister, all had blue eyes.</span> <span id="s271">They tied -- you know, they color their hair blonde and they resemble the Irish race, let’s put it that way, yeah.</span> <span id="s272">This was arranged by one -- from what I learned, what they told me, by one Christian man who worked in the government, who fell in love with one of the sisters.</span> <span id="s273">And they were very pretty, that’s true, they were beautiful women.</span> <span id="s274">Three of them were really gorgeous cause I remember them when they, you know, moved to Israel and so forth, so they were very attractive at that time, too.</span> <span id="s275">So I can imagine when they were young, they were probably very attractive.</span> <span id="s276">And he managed to arrange for all the five of th -- four of them to be -- the fifth one could not, because the fifth one was beautiful, but dark hair, brown eyes.</span> <span id="s277">You know, she did not look like an --</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Ar-Aryan.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Aryan, yes.</span> <span id="s280">Like the Aryan race, whatever.</span> <span id="s281">So with her was a different story.</span> <span id="s282">So -- but they worked in a lot of German families as housekeepers.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: And she used to tell us -- she used to tell me, my stepmother it was nerve-wracking, pretending what you are not and acting what you are not and -- and -- you know, and -- so that’s how they survived.</span> <span id="s285">Now, my grandfather, my step-grandfather, who in Poland, interesting was -- owned farmland.</span> <span id="s286">Not that he himself farmed it, but he was a farmer, basically, and that was a little bit unusual for Jews at that time to owe -- own land and be a farmer.</span> <span id="s287">But he did, he had a lot of land and you know, they grew potatoes and -- and whatever farmers did grow in those days and he had people who worked on the land.</span> <span id="s288">But with hi -- he was very religious.</span> <span id="s289">He used to pray three times a day with the Tefillin and all that.</span> <span id="s290">And during the war it was very difficult to hide them.</span> <span id="s291">So -- but they survived.</span> <span id="s292">They said that in the apartment they used to rip off the floor and there was like a sub-floor.</span> <span id="s293">And whenever there was an aksia coming, you know, that the Germans are coming to search for Jews, they used to hide them in there, they used to lay flat, board it again, put that carpet on, you know, and they had to lie there quietly, not a peep out of their mouth til the period of the aksia, you know, when -- then at night maybe they lift it up so they could go to the bathroom or whatever.</span> <span id="s294">So that’s -- that’s -- that’s basically how they survived.</span> <span id="s295">Now, her brother was drafted into the army and sent to the Russian border and he perished there.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: So now the three of you, as we said, are in this [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: In -- in Lignice.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: And -- and what are your first memories of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Well, the fact that my father opened a store, I remember, and I remember Russian soldiers coming in.</span> <span id="s300">And in fact I remember there was a toilet and the Russian opened the door.</span> <span id="s301">They didn’t know what that looked, looked like a sink and they started washing themselves in that toilet.</span> <span id="s302">I remember that.</span> <span id="s303">I remember even seeing the Russian soldier and I asked my father how come they don’t have shoes on.</span> <span id="s304">Some of them came, and that was after the war, they had no shoes.</span> <span id="s305">They had their feet wrapped with cloth and with, like blankets and tied with a rope and I looked at that, it looked horrible to me because it looked like, you know, something in outer spa -- not normal.</span> <span id="s306">Not normal for a child because I already had shoes on and my father had shoes on and here are coming those poor soldiers, you know, and they looked dreadful.</span> <span id="s307">I remember that.</span> <span id="s308">I also remember not a very pleasant episode in that apartment that we stayed.</span> <span id="s309">And apparently there was a hospital not far from there.</span> <span id="s310">One night I remember screaming and yelling in Polish, ratumko, and ratumko means save us, save us, save us.</span> <span id="s311">Apparently some Russian soldiers, drunk soldiers came into the apartment and started beating on the door.</span> <span id="s312">And I remember waking up and opening the door and seeing blood on the door.</span> <span id="s313">And I was rushed in very quickly by my step-mom, quickly into the room and I don’t know, I think I hid under the bed from fear or what have you.</span> <span id="s314">And that’s it, that’s what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: -- member having a housekeeper in -- in Lignice.</span> <span id="s317">She was German, they hired her.</span> <span id="s318">And her name was Gertruda.</span> <span id="s319">Gertrude.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: So your father and stepmother had really nothing against the Germans, as such, they hired this German woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s322">My father felt well, now you as a German -- that’s what he said, I said, why did -- at one point, you know, when I was older, I questioned that and he said well, that was my revenge.</span> <span id="s323">Now she’s gonna work for us.</span> <span id="s324">That was his interpretation, or his revenge.</span> <span id="s325">She was going to be the housekeeper and she was going to work for us.</span> <span id="s326">And I remember her in the kitchen doing the noodles, you know, the old kind where you roll -- made the dough, you rolled it out, and I was watching how she was cutting it into strips.</span> <span id="s327">What else?</span> <span id="s328">You know, I -- apparently she must have taken care of me.</span> <span id="s329">I don’t remember much of a relationship with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: But wi -- talking about relationships, what was your relationship with your stepmother?</span> <span id="s331">What did you call her, first of all?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Well, I called her Mama.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Yeah, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: She was -- you know, I was told that she is my mother.</span> <span id="s335">Now, I must have gone through some traumatic experience because I called her Mama, but I apparently didn’t attach myself to her yet as a mama.</span> <span id="s336">So I don’t remember too much as -- you know, of -- of -- kind of a n -- nurturing time with her.</span> <span id="s337">This I don’t remember, really.</span> <span id="s338">There wasn’t such a nurturing time.</span> <span id="s339">Maybe Gertrude was supposed to fill it in, but she -- you know, she didn’t.</span> <span id="s340">So, you know, I -- I’m sure that my physical taking care was taken care of, you know, making sure that I was fed and making sure that I was dressed and combed and bathed or whatever it is, but I really don’t remember sitting and -- you know, and -- and listening to a story or playing some games.</span> <span id="s341">Stuff like that I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: What kind of neighborhood did you and your family live in after the war?</span> <span id="s343">Was it a Jewish neighborhood, were there many Jews there?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: I was -- in Lignice I was sent to a kindergarten, a Jewish kindergarten --</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: So there were Jews that came back --</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: That came back and apparently settled there because en -- there was a kindergarten there, apparently, because I went to that kindergarten.</span> <span id="s347">In fact, I have a little picture of us being on the stage and performing something for Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s348">You know, like a song or something, which I have it, and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Do you remember -- again, you were very young, any experiences in those early years after the war, of any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yes, later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Later on, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Later on, yes, when we moved from Lignice to another city called Swidnica.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Okay, we’ll talk about that, let’s finish --</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: -- with Lignice.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: So you went to school, and you had Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: And -- and apparently I had some Jewish friends, which I really don’t remember much.</span> <span id="s359">Course, I don’t know, it was -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: You were still very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: -- young, and I don’t know whether parents invited kids over like we do today.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: I doubt it very much, and those parents that survived after the war, you know, life wasn’t easy for them, so who knows how much patience they had to take somebody else in the house an-and be, you know, attentive to them and play with them, or whatever.</span> <span id="s364">I know I di -- I had a lot of toys.</span> <span id="s365">They bought me a lot of toys after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Did you have any contact, do you know, with that couple that raised you the first three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, no, because -- no, because I was told that she is my real mom, my step-mom was my mother.</span> <span id="s368">You see, I was in -- it was inculcated into my brain that this is your mother and I am your father.</span> <span id="s369">This is your mother.</span> <span id="s370">Nothing about the past, that I was raised by a period of my life with a Christian family or that I had a birth mom.</span> <span id="s371">No, that was -- that was discovered much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: When I was in, oh I would say 14 - 15.</span> <span id="s374">I was suspicious already that something is not right, but that was years after.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Yeah, right, later.</span> <span id="s376">Did you call the woman who hid you Mama, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: I have no -- possibly.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Probably --</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Probably, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Probably, yeah.</span> <span id="s381">So now you’re asked to call another person Mama.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Mama, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s386">So you were there for -- in Lignice for a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: I think it may be a year and a half --</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: And you went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: -- two, could be.</span> <span id="s390">Maybe even two years, close to two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: And then we moved, and I went there to the -- to the kindergarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s394">But your father was not religious --</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: -- so you didn’t have any -- did you observe -- again, you were so young -- any holidays, or Shabbat, or nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: No, not that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Was your fath -- do -- do you know if your father was Zionist, a Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: No.</span> <span id="s400">No, he was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: He was not, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: No.</span> <span id="s403">He was a Polish pat-patriot.</span> <span id="s404">He was very into -- he was a Polish patriot.</span> <span id="s405">He loved Poland.</span> <span id="s406">He had opportunity to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Well that was going to be my next question.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yeah, but he did not.</span> <span id="s409">His cousin, his first cousin left in 1939 and came to Washington, and that’s how we ended up in Washington, through the first cousin.</span> <span id="s410">But my father, no, he didn't want to leave Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: And he didn’t want to leave his parents, you know, your commitment to the family, so forth.</span> <span id="s413">And maybe also my father was not that adventurous to move, you know, from different languages, you have to start all over.</span> <span id="s414">He just didn’t -- he wasn’t willing to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Now why did they move to a new -- another city?</span> <span id="s416">Why did you leave Lignice?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: I think because -- my feeling -- he never said that, but that was my feeling, since he lived with the sisters and their husbands and my mother with a big family, and I don’t know whether he was planning to advance himself in the business area, whatever.</span> <span id="s418">He decided he’s moving away.</span> <span id="s419">So he moved to Swidnica.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: And where was that in relation to Lignice?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Not that far.</span> <span id="s422">Closer to Wrocław, which is another city in Poland.</span> <span id="s423">Not that far, in that vicinity, I don’t know, maybe half a day drive or something like that.</span> <span id="s424">And ha -- why did he do that I don’t know, but I know one thing.</span> <span id="s425">Where -- in Swidnica he opened immediately a business with a man, a Christian man who -- whose specialty was he -- to manufacture candies, all kinds of candies.</span> <span id="s426">And so they [indecipherable] together and they opened a factory that produced chocolates and candy varieties, all kinds of varieties of sweets and a store in front that sold the products that they manufactured.</span> <span id="s427">And that’s what my father did, and this I remember very well, because I must have been close to seven years old already, six and a half.</span> <span id="s428">I remember coming to the store.</span> <span id="s429">I remember my father arranging all those gorgeous, beautiful candy boxes with -- with ribbons and what have you, chocolates and all kinds of candies, hard candies, soft candies, chocolates, small chocolates, you know.</span> <span id="s430">All kinds of sweets and delicatessen, you know, all kinds of specialties.</span> <span id="s431">And it went very well, because after the war people were extremely hungry and they craved all those things that they didn’t have.</span> <span id="s432">So he did very well in that respect and we were in Poland, in Swidnica until 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: What kind of neighborhood did you live in in -- in Swidnica?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: In Swidnica I lived, not necessarily in a Jewish neighborhood, no.</span> <span id="s435">I also went to school there, first grade and second grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Was this a public school, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: So you were with child --</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: And I was the only Jewish kid in the whole school.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: In the whole school?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: The whole school.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: So what was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Can you relate some of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: -- experiences that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: I tell you it was terrible because I had a very good friend, her name was Krisha and she was Christian.</span> <span id="s448">And she used to ask me, are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s449">I said no, I’m Christian.</span> <span id="s450">And I used to go with her to church after school.</span> <span id="s451">I re -- that was in first grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Now, you said that because you thought you were Christian, or you thought it would be safe to --</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Don’t forget --</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: -- to say --</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Don’t forget that the three and a half or four years of my life --</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Right, that’s what I meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: -- I was brought up as a Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: And I believed in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: And it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: So at that point you still felt you were a Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: I -- yes.</span> <span id="s464">It was so inculcucated into me that no matter what they said, I -- apparently there was some ritual that I was taught as a little kid, you know, that I had to hold my hands together and say a prayer before I go to sleep, and these things and that stayed with me for a pretty long time.</span> <span id="s465">So I was -- I’m the only Jewish kid in -- in the whole school and the teachers knew about it, that I’m Jewish, you know, I’m not a Christian.</span> <span id="s466">But I wouldn’t accept that.</span> <span id="s467">I wanted to be like all the rest of the kids in school, in the classroom.</span> <span id="s468">And I remember a priest -- we -- we had in Poland at that time, religious lessons in -- in -- in -- in school.</span> <span id="s469">And I remember the priest used to come and he used to say, Anita, up and leave the class.</span> <span id="s470">And I used to burst out in tears, because this was a religious --</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Instruction?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: -- instruction, and I -- and I just wanted to participate like everybody else.</span> <span id="s473">And I started crying and he said, okay, stay.</span> <span id="s474">So I stayed.</span> <span id="s475">I remember that.</span> <span id="s476">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Did you have any negative experiences?</span> <span id="s478">Anti-Semitic expressions to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Well, the only anti-Semitic expressions is what -- with this questioning if you are -- am I Jewish?</span> <span id="s480">Are you Jewish, or are you Christian?</span> <span id="s481">And I used to say no, I am Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: But nothing -- but nothing negative, that’s what I meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: No, not negative, you know, pointing to me that I’m a Jew or something like that, no, no.</span> <span id="s484">What I do remember is at the end of, I think it’s the second grade, everybody got -- every child got a book -- that’s my husband -- every child got a book as a gift.</span> <span id="s485">I got the most smallest, little, tiny book.</span> <span id="s486">Everybody got nice, big books as a gift at the end of the year and I just got a tiny little one.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Because the books they got were Christian books?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: They were Polish books, all kinds of stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No, not necessarily religious books, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s491">But as a gift, as a token to the student, and I got a little one.</span> <span id="s492">And of course I came home and I carried on and so my father and my step-mom went to school and they said, how come you gave her such a little book and all the other kids got big ones, she got just a little one, you know.</span> <span id="s493">And I don’t know if that was an indication of whatever.</span> <span id="s494">I have no clue.</span> <span id="s495">This is what I remember.</span> <span id="s496">And other than that --</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: But you felt confident going out on the street, that you would -- your parents thought it would be -- you were safe to go out on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Not so confident, I mean, from school I walked with that girl, Krisha.</span> <span id="s499">And we went to church after school.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Oh, you did go to church?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes, after school we went to church and after that I went home.</span> <span id="s502">So sometimes she used to come to me.</span> <span id="s503">I had a feeling that, you know, she used to come and play but not as often as I wanted her to come, so maybe the parents were not so happy that she associates with a Jewish kid or whatever, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s504">They probably did know that I’m not Christian, even though I keep on saying that I was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: What was -- and what was the Russian presence in your town at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: The Russian presence I remember only in Lignice, not in Swidnica.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: In Swidnica I don’t remember the Russian presence -- presence at all, not at all.</span> <span id="s509">But what happened after 1951 when we -- when we left Poland and immigrated to Israel is that the Russians were coming into Poland apparently and chopping down all the private initiatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Okay, why did your -- y-y say you stayed there til ’51.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Why did your father and stepmother make the decision to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: The decision they made to leave was because her sisters started immigrating to Israel.</span> <span id="s514">No, sorry, no, no, no, no, they came after us, no.</span> <span id="s515">The reason -- you know, it’s funny because now I remember that once my stepmother said that one of the reasons was because I was so engrossed into Catholicism as a kid.</span> <span id="s516">She said that’s one of the reasons -- she -- she said that eventually I’ll end up marrying out of faith and that’s it.</span> <span id="s517">So she said, now the Russians are already in Poland, they’re coming in, they’re shutting the private initiatives, no more businesses.</span> <span id="s518">You will have to close your business, your private business.</span> <span id="s519">Here is one reason and the other reason is that the kids will grow up -- because in the meantime I had a half sister that was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: When was she born?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: ’48 or ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Her name was Henrika.</span> <span id="s524">Henrika, but her Hebrew name is Balia.</span> <span id="s525">Okay.</span> <span id="s526">And I think basically that -- that’s what drove them to come to Israel.</span> <span id="s527">Now, whether my father was a Zionist, I’m telling you the truth, nope.</span> <span id="s528">And he knew it’s going to be hardship -- oh, there’s something flying here -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Was your stepmother a Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: More than my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Did -- did you want to wear a crucifix, a cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Do you remember ask -- asking your folks if you could?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: They were not too happy, but I wore it.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Oh, you did wear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: I wore it with Mary Magdalena.</span> <span id="s541">Not the crucifix, but Mary with the baby.</span> <span id="s542">That’s what I had on my -- on my neck, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s544">They let you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: They let me, yes.</span> <span id="s546">And then after awhile they started not letting me.</span> <span id="s547">I remember that, it was a big fight all ways.</span> <span id="s548">I always used to pin next to my bed, which had like, in those days had wooden bars.</span> <span id="s549">I used to pin Jesus, picture of Jesus and Mary Magdalena with her hands this way, that way, you know.</span> <span id="s550">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: So what did -- before you left for Israel, what did Israel mean to you?</span> <span id="s552">Did you have any idea what it was, where it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Yeah, I -- my father used to say a barren land, nothing to eat, desert, it’s gonna be rough, rough times.</span> <span id="s554">You know, he pictured it very bleak.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: But was willing to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: But went yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s557">I think he actually wanted to come to United States, that was his dream, to come to America, but it did not materialize for him because -- I tell you the episode why.</span> <span id="s558">He could have come the United States immediately after the war, because his cousin, his first cousin who lived in Vienna, and he managed to escape in ’39, that’s what I was told, and came directly to Washington, through family that arranged this for him, because in those days you just couldn’t come.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: You needed a sponsor.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: You needed a sponsor and it had to be a quota too.</span> <span id="s561">So I don’t know how, whether he had a quota, or maybe somebody really sponsored him with big chunk of money and said if something happens, Jake Schutzman will [indecipherable] us, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s562">So he arrived in ’39 and immediately after the war, there was a contact between my father and him.</span> <span id="s563">And my father started with his business in wa -- in -- in Lignice and things were going well for him and he made good money and so forth.</span> <span id="s564">And he received a package from my cousin -- his -- his -- his cousin, which was my second cousin, a package of clothing and he opened it up and he said, oh my God, what a collection of some shmatas.</span> <span id="s565">What is he sending me, some shmatas?</span> <span id="s566">This is America, he says.</span> <span id="s567">This is -- this is what life is in America?</span> <span id="s568">That’s what -- I mean, here I have decent clothes, I -- I mean, it’s a different life that I live than -- this is th -- you know, that was his impression for some reason.</span> <span id="s569">And Jake Schutzman instead, sent him a letter and sent him papers to fill out at that time and deposit it in the American embassy.</span> <span id="s570">He did that, but much later.</span> <span id="s571">I don’t know, some years went by, maybe three, four years went by by the time you went and deposited those papers in the American embassy.</span> <span id="s572">And -- and then he couldn’t, in ’51, immigrate to United States because Poland -- Poland had a quota of so many people America would accept from Poland.</span> <span id="s573">And then you had to have a sponsor.</span> <span id="s574">So sponsor was Jake, but his financial situation at the beginning, in ’51 wasn’t great.</span> <span id="s575">He wasn’t that long in United States in order to sponsor, and so the other option was only going to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: When did you leave -- when did you leave for Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: 1951, and I think it was in April.</span> <span id="s580">We l -- we left by boat and we arrived in Haifa and I was not quite 10, so you know, I remember the trip, which was horrible, I was so sick.</span> <span id="s581">The ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: What boat do y -- do you remember the boat’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Megbah.</span> <span id="s584">Yes, the boat was called Megbah.</span> <span id="s585">I remember I was sick the whole week from Italy, because from Poland to Italy we rode a train.</span> <span id="s586">And from Italy we took a boat.</span> <span id="s587">And I remember they dressed me, and I’m not exaggerating, with eight or nine dresses, one on top of the other, and on -- because taking stuff from Poland, you couldn’t take everything you wanted to, they rationed you.</span> <span id="s588">You couldn’t take your wealth that you have accumulated, so you had to be very clever, how do you maneuver to get stuff out that, you know, is yours, that you earned it, you know, over the years.</span> <span id="s589">So I remember arriving in Israel --</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: We-Were you very unhappy about leaving Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: You know, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s592">No, I don’t think I was unhappy.</span> <span id="s593">The idea of -- of riding a train and changing and you know, apparently maybe appealed to me.</span> <span id="s594">And there were also pictures from United Jewish Appeal, I remember.</span> <span id="s595">You know, they were asking for donations and we used to get those cards, and I used to look at the cards and they looked very fascinating, very nice, so from what my father said, barren land, and desert and nothing, and here are cards that show farmers working, orange trees with oranges, lemons, it -- you know, it was -- it was appealing to a youngster.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: So now you land in Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Yeah, land in Haifa, sweating like anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Do you remember what your parents’ reaction was when the boat --</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: -- landed and they got on ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yes, yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Israeli ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: -- right.</span> <span id="s604">My fa -- my father was dressed in a suit with a hat with a kapeloush.</span> <span id="s605">My mother was dressed to perfection.</span> <span id="s606">She had a suit on, and a hat, and she had shoes made by a shoemaker in Poland.</span> <span id="s607">You know in those days everything was custom made.</span> <span id="s608">You didn’t go to a shop lu -- like we go here to the mall.</span> <span id="s609">She had on her, I’ll never forget that, a fox.</span> <span id="s610">You know fox?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Right, wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: -- with the -- ye-yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: -- with the head and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: -- a circ --</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: -- with the head and the tail.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yeah, with the tail, silver fox, black and silver, very pretty, I remember that.</span> <span id="s617">And the first thing, they put us in a big room and they started taking fleet it’s called like a fleet, where they disinfect you.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: They sprayed you.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Sprayed us.</span> <span id="s620">And my father, he got so uptight and nervous and he started screaming, what do you think I’m coming from, the jungle?</span> <span id="s621">What are you fleeting me?</span> <span id="s622">You know, and what do you think we are, barbarians?</span> <span id="s623">And you know, it didn’t help much, everybody, no matter where you came from, whether you came from Yemen or Iraq or Tunisia or Sahara or Poland or Germany, fleet everybody was fleeted.</span> <span id="s624">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Let -- let’s back up a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Were the other people on the boat coming over, were they Polish Jews coming to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yes, yes, Polish Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: And di --</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Were there many children on that boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: This, to be honest with you, I don’t remember because I was so sick, seasick.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Oh, what -- yeah, right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: I don’t think there were that many kids there, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: So it isn’t that you talked with other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: -- no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: What language were you speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Only?</span> <span id="s642">That’s all you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: That’s all I si -- knew, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: And your parents spoke to you in Polish, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Polish, yeah, they spoke Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: So now you landed in Israel and you only know Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: And I o -- only know Polish, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Okay, but you got sprayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: And I -- we got all sprayed and we were put into a big tent because they didn’t have enough housing in ’51 to accommodate the -- the Aliyah, you know, the incoming Jews.</span> <span id="s650">And in that tent, I remember that, there was no floor, it was just earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Wa -- where was this in --</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: You were still in Haifa?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: In Haifa, yes, Haifa.</span> <span id="s655">And we received like a bed, everybody got a bed, a folding bed, like army bed with a blanket, and I think a pillow.</span> <span id="s656">And my father also brought food, by the way from Poland.</span> <span id="s657">I remember four jars, red jars, like milk jars, big ones, with schmaltz.</span> <span id="s658">Also dried mushrooms on a string, couple strings of that because there was no -- because we came at a time that it was called senna, there was no food.</span> <span id="s659">Food was rationed in Israel at that time.</span> <span id="s660">And also sausages.</span> <span id="s661">But the kind that are dried, i -- where you don’t have to refrigerate also.</span> <span id="s662">Strings of sausages.</span> <span id="s663">And I remember Daddy took a hammer and a nail from someplace and he hammered it to the pole of the tent and hung the sausages and the mushrooms and that the containers were put aside.</span> <span id="s664">In that tent there were -- we were there, another Romanian family from Romania, which we could not communicate and two other families from Yemen, which we could not communicate.</span> <span id="s665">The Yemenite Jews that came, they were dressed entirely different than those from Europe.</span> <span id="s666">And evening c-came, suppertime, they all sat on the floor and they put this big tray and they started eating with their hands.</span> <span id="s667">And my father and my step-mom, when they saw that, they got up and they went real close to look and they spoke to each other in Polish and they called me to see.</span> <span id="s668">Look, look, take a look, look how they eat.</span> <span id="s669">I haven’t seen anything like it.</span> <span id="s670">You sit on the ground and you eat with your hands.</span> <span id="s671">Where am I, he said.</span> <span id="s672">I came to like nomad lands.</span> <span id="s673">This -- what is this, you know?</span> <span id="s674">He maybe envisioned in his head that it’s going to be more European but it’s not, it’s a mixture of Jews from all over the world.</span> <span id="s675">You know, and that was very hard for him.</span> <span id="s676">We stayed there five days.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Anita Etzyon.</span> <span id="s679">This is tape two, side A, and we were talking about your staying in the tent and watching the family eat and the -- your father’s response.</span> <span id="s680">The family from Yemen.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Ah, right, yes.</span> <span id="s682">It was a cultural shock, I would say, to my father and my step-mom.</span> <span id="s683">They had not seen it.</span> <span id="s684">There were no televisions yet in those days.</span> <span id="s685">Maybe if there would be, you know, they would have seen different cultures, how people eat and how people interact, but it was very strange for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Were there partitions in the tent?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: So it was one open area?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: One open area, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: So it was you and your parents and your sister --</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: -- with these other two families.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: With the other three families.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: O-Other three families.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: There were four families in a tent.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: And then we stayed there a few days and my step-mom had a cousin in Israel by the name Yakov or Kuba Morgenstern.</span> <span id="s698">And he lived in a village called -- at that time it was called Sidney Ali, which -- which is an Arabic name and Arabs apparently lived there.</span> <span id="s699">Later on it became Nofti Yam, was named Nof Yam.</span> <span id="s700">But I remember it as Sidney Ali.</span> <span id="s701">And he took us from -- from Haifa, from that absorption camp to the home that he lived, and he lived in a Arab home, which was left by the Arabs that left the area.</span> <span id="s702">It was an Arab home and we received a room downstairs and his apartment was upstairs.</span> <span id="s703">And we lived there, I think two or three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Were you starting to pick up Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Very little, even though there was some kind of a school there, and it was like one room school and there were like three or four [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s706">This was first grade, this was second grade, this was third grade and fourth grade.</span> <span id="s707">So we were like, you know, different ages in one room, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: When you -- let’s back up to the absorption center, were there other Polish families there that you could speak to?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: There must -- there probably were, but I was not in contact with, I was with my family most of the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: And -- and I think my father left couple times just to see what he can do in Israel, what -- you know, what kind of a job can he get, what can he do?</span> <span id="s712">So he was trying to reach, apparently, some contacts with people and -- and that’s how my stepmother contacted this cousin of hers and that’s how we managed -- you know, he managed to kind of take us out from the absorption.</span> <span id="s713">And then we stayed with him two or three months, not that long.</span> <span id="s714">And th-then we had to move to another -- it’s called in Hebrew Ma’barah, which is another absorption built for Olim Chadashim, which are the newcomers.</span> <span id="s715">And we lived there for almost two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: What -- where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: It was ca -- it was called Ma’barot gelee.</span> <span id="s718">It was in Herzliya on the way to Tel Aviv on the main highway at that time, which was not quite a highway, it was like a dirt road in a sense, but that’s how it was.</span> <span id="s719">And we lived there for two years.</span> <span id="s720">It was one room, made out of tin with a -- with a base that was made out of concrete.</span> <span id="s721">The walls were made out of tin.</span> <span id="s722">And when it rained it was like playing orchestra on top of your roof.</span> <span id="s723">We stayed there for two years.</span> <span id="s724">My father also brought from Poland, I must say, furniture.</span> <span id="s725">My father brought a whole lift.</span> <span id="s726">Where was I?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: You were -- yo-you had moved to the new --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yeah, Ma’barot gelee --</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Ma’barah.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Ma’barah.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: And my father emi -- you know, he was at that time very depressed, I must say, very depressed.</span> <span id="s733">Even in Boryslaw, which was not a very wealthy Jewish community there, he never lived in such conditions, where you live in one little room with -- you know, made out of tin -- pach, in Hebrew, really.</span> <span id="s734">And you know, and there were winds and rain and it was just miserable.</span> <span id="s735">But, you know, as a kid, no matter where you stuck a kid, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s736">You know, children are busy doing their stuff, running around, you meet children, you get -- start playing.</span> <span id="s737">Even if I wasn’t able to communicate, I still remember having couple friends there, because we -- we were all olim, we were all newcomers.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Were there ones from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Okay, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: -- no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: -- so you were picking up Hebrew ne --</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Slowly, yes.</span> <span id="s744">I was picking up slowly Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: But not to a degree that I was able to converse yet, or having a whole conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: But I was picking it up.</span> <span id="s749">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yes, I went to school there, right.</span> <span id="s752">Again, it was a very similar situation in -- and we had like few of those barracks or whatever, those one rooms that were -- in one room you could have two grades, or three grades and one teacher would, you know, teach us.</span> <span id="s753">My father brought furniture from Poland, a lift.</span> <span id="s754">He was able to ship a lift.</span> <span id="s755">We had it for a long time, I remember, a whole bedroom set and a whole living room set with dining table and four chairs.</span> <span id="s756">Clothing, and also money, he was able to bring money and wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: So this arrived in the port of Haifa?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: N -- e -- that arrived in the port of Haifa eventually.</span> <span id="s759">I don’t think it arrived with us, because then it was transported -- this arrived a little bit later and it was transported to the absorption Ma’barot gelee, where we lived for two years.</span> <span id="s760">And I remember my father build another room by himself to house this lift, cause there were a couple big boxes that he built in Poland, you know to hou -- to put the furniture in.</span> <span id="s761">He did that.</span> <span id="s762">My stepmother was very resource -- resourceful in that respect.</span> <span id="s763">She remembered from home because her father owned land and he was a farmer, so what she did, she -- my father made her a big fence around that area that we lived.</span> <span id="s764">They fenced a piece of property, he could have done that, and she started a little farm of her own, with chickens and -- and ducks and -- and boy I remember and -- and turkeys, we had, and I remember how she used to hatch them, take those eggs and -- and put them in a basket and put a hen that was ready to sit on the eggs and -- and inc -- then the eggs incubated and then we had more chickens.</span> <span id="s765">And I was in charge of the ducks, I remember.</span> <span id="s766">And since our -- our serif, that’s what it was, it’s -- it’s that ha -- little hat, was at the end and -- and at the end was a orange grove, a big orange grove.</span> <span id="s767">So I used to go with the ducks and -- and whatever was there, I had a little stick, you know, like a shepherd girl.</span> <span id="s768">Used to take -- there were four of them, they were pretty big, they are not the little ducks, they are those -- they look like swans in a sense, but they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Geese?</span> <span id="s770">Were they geese?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Geese, geese.</span> <span id="s772">Four of them.</span> <span id="s773">They were very aggressive, that’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s774">Anybody who came by they would attack, like a dog, you know, it’s interesting.</span> <span id="s775">So I used to take those geese to the orange orchard and they used to pasture there.</span> <span id="s776">There was like a big pipe that they used to water those trees.</span> <span id="s777">And water used to drip in a little -- and it formed like a little basin or something and those geese used to go and drink and eat the grass around and so forth.</span> <span id="s778">And I loved it, I remember that, that was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s779">And so you know, living in Ma’barah for me wasn’t difficult at all, I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s780">I remember sh -- my mother planted corn and potatoes and I remember there was a mole who used to come and eat the potatoes and we were fighting that mole, you know, with -- with the hoes and water into this -- into their grooves that they made underground, what have you.</span> <span id="s781">So for me I -- I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s782">I -- I -- it didn’t bother me at all living in a -- in hut.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Did you miss Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s785">I didn’t miss Poland, not at all.</span> <span id="s786">I remember taking the dishes -- for instance, you couldn’t wash dishes in this one hut, cause even though my father made a kitchen, but it was very difficult to wash the dishes, so I used to take like a basket or -- or a big pail with the dirty dishes and they built like a long --</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Trough?</span> <span id="s788">A trough?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: A trough with faucets and everybody used to come and polish and wash their dishes there.</span> <span id="s790">Another thing was, at the beginning when we moved into the -- Ma’barah, you didn’t have your private shower, so we all had to shower in a public shower that they built, you know, and they didn't make it compartmentalized separate.</span> <span id="s791">They made -- you know, they put those showers and everybody in, you know, and my father and my mother they just -- they couldn’t.</span> <span id="s792">So this -- first thing my father did after he built that room was immediately to put up a shower so he doesn’t have to go and shower.</span> <span id="s793">He was in that -- very handy.</span> <span id="s794">I must say he was very handy to put up a room to house his furniture, to build the fence, to build a chicken coop for the chickens.</span> <span id="s795">So, you know, make a little kitchen for my mom so she can cook and make a shower for us.</span> <span id="s796">Now, the bathroom had to be a public bathroom and so, you know, we used this public bathroom, which wasn’t a bathroom like we are used to it, it was a hole.</span> <span id="s797">A huge hole in the ground and you know, there were like four compartments, but there was a wall that separated those four, so thank God for that.</span> <span id="s798">And I remember petrified going to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s799">Why?</span> <span id="s800">Because when I looked into the hole, I said oh my God, if I fall in there -- and I was small, you know, I wasn’t a big kid or something.</span> <span id="s801">My God, if I fall into this hole.</span> <span id="s802">That was very, very scary.</span> <span id="s803">That was something that I remember til today, the fear of going to the bathroom, but you had to.</span> <span id="s804">You didn’t have another facility.</span> <span id="s805">So we lived there two years and in the meantime they managed to buy an apartment, which was in the process of being built, and it took almost, I don’t know, a year or so to finish it, so that’s why we stayed there almost two years.</span> <span id="s806">And then we moved to Herzliya, to a place called no -- a -- Noht Sarah, the dwellings of Sarah.</span> <span id="s807">It was a 40 -- 40 unit apartment, a long one, a three story building.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: At this time did you feel Israeli or Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: No, I still felt Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: You still felt very Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Yes, very Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Not -- not Israeli.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Not Israeli.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: But I imagine after two years your Hebrew was much [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Was much better, right, and then I went ow -- enrolled -- they enrolled me in fifth grade elementary school.</span> <span id="s816">I was already -- by then I was 12 and I went into fifth grade.</span> <span id="s817">I was always a year ahead of the others.</span> <span id="s818">When they were 11 in fifth grade, I was 12 in fifth grade.</span> <span id="s819">And maybe because of the lack of --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Language.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: -- language barrier and so forth, so you know, I couldn’t keep up with the material.</span> <span id="s822">And by then I already knew Hebrew and I was slowly acclimating myself.</span> <span id="s823">And luckily was that in Herzliya there were a few other kids that were not born sabras and that was a big thing in those days, to be an Israeli.</span> <span id="s824">And here, I don’t know if you heard or not, but the Israelis were not too happy accepting the new immigrants and they called them, you know, in Hebrew they called them subonim, which means soaps, like you -- you know, subonim.</span> <span id="s825">And they also wi -- didn’t accept them, you know, they stuck together.</span> <span id="s826">And for me it was very important to penetrate that and become like one of them and not be this Polish immigrant.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Let’s talk about what did your pe -- did you know what happened to the Jews during World War II and a -- and do you know what your -- or did your parents talk to you about it and what were their reactions when they heard all the terrible things after the war was over.</span> <span id="s828">Obviously they waited til you were older.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s830">Whether they talked much about it at that time -- they mentioned it from time to time, that we are all survivors and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: What did being a survivor mean to a young girl?</span> <span id="s832">Or wa-was that later on, when you were older?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: To be honest with you not -- I wasn’t very proud of it at that time in Israel, that I’m a survivor, you know, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: But why weren’t you pr --</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: -- because in school, sometimes even the teachers when they were teaching, they were saying oh, those Jews, they went like sheep to slaughter.</span> <span id="s836">They did not resist, they did not fight.</span> <span id="s837">Because in Israel the young generation, the soldiers, the Haganah, the [indecipherable] all of them, they were fighters, they fought.</span> <span id="s838">Now the Jews in Europe, there was a resistance in ghetto Warsaw we know and -- and other places, but they felt that the Jews went like sheep to slaughter, and -- and we were part of that -- you know, part of those Jews who somehow managed to survive, but you know -- so these were -- I -- I -- in fact I remember one of my teachers also said that, that the Jews went like sheep to slaughter and I came home and I said it to my parents.</span> <span id="s839">And they were very upset and they went and they talked to the teacher how, you know, whatever.</span> <span id="s840">But that was the -- that was the attitude of -- of the Israelis in those days, you know.</span> <span id="s841">We are the sabras, we are the born Israelis and you know, proud an-and you know, and tall and strong and whatever.</span> <span id="s842">Free.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Did the -- did the children talk to you like that, or just the adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: No, some of the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: And did you answer them, or did you know what to say, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: At that time I don’t think I knew what to answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Y-yeah.</span> <span id="s848">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: No, I don’t think I knew what to answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Did you have feelings of inferiority at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yes, yes, that I was different, that my folks spoke Polish at home, which bothered me a lot, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Were they learning Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: They were learning, but fa -- it was so difficult for them, because it’s a Semitic language and -- and -- and they just couldn’t, you know, so they continued speaking Polish and -- and my father wasn’t very happy the first couple years living in Israel, so he didn’t make the effort to acclimate himself into the society.</span> <span id="s854">So they had their Polish friends, which they communicate only in Polish.</span> <span id="s855">And -- and the other thing was that also when you went shopping -- well you didn’t have supermarkets then, but we had grocery shops, so the grocer spoke Yiddish, or German or Polish or whatever, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Di-Di-Did your family know Yiddish at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yes, they did, but they did not speak it.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: So you -- did you know Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: No, no, because wa -- they did not speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s860">But later on I picked up somehow by, I don’t know, I picked up the language, not that I’m fluent, but maybe because through my language, my mother-in-law spoke Yiddish and Russian and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: But when you were younger you didn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: No, when I was younger, no, I didn’t speak any Yiddish at all.</span> <span id="s863">But my father spoke German and my step-mom probably spoke a little bit German, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: So -- but the base -- the language they spoke at home and the language we communicated --</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Was Polish.</span> <span id="s868">And when I had friends coming in, that came over to visit, was only Polish.</span> <span id="s869">I used to say, why don’t you speak Hebrew, they don’t understand what you’re saying, you know.</span> <span id="s870">It did upset me, you know, but that was the reality, I couldn't change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Did you have young friends who were sabras?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: So they did accept?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s877">Right, they did.</span> <span id="s878">After awhile they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s881">After awhile they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: So now you’re in your apartment in Herzliya.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Right, and I’m going --</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: And going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: -- t-to elementary school in Herzliya.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: And doing anything else?</span> <span id="s887">Did you do sports, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Well, within the school, you know the activities that we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: And still no religious affiliations?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s891">Not at all.</span> <span id="s892">My parents turned 360 degrees away from religion, both of them.</span> <span id="s893">And they didn’t really celebrate the holidays.</span> <span id="s894">Luckily they were in Israel, so I knew there was this holiday, that holiday, you know, through school and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: But nothing in the home.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Nothing at home, no, nothing at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: And so life went on in Herzliya.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Right, life went on and then I went to the high school in -- in Herzliya as well and became quite -- you know, quite, involved in the social life of school and had a number of fu -- good friends.</span> <span id="s899">And then, after --</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: A-At that point I assumed you felt Israeli, not Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: It’s high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: That -- it was high school already, right.</span> <span id="s904">But, was interesting when I spoke Hebrew.</span> <span id="s905">I have an accent, a Polish accent in the Hebrew language and my pronunciation, you know, the R, raiche, you can hear raiche.</span> <span id="s906">The Israeli sabras, they don’t have the raiche, they have the raiche.</span> <span id="s907">So you could tell that this is not a sabra because her raiche is not raiche, it’s raiche.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: You know.</span> <span id="s910">Other than that, you know, I was -- I felt fine.</span> <span id="s911">I felt like any other Israeli.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: And then I went to a school called Seminare aki Butsim.</span> <span id="s914">After two years of high school in Israel, I transferred to Tel Aviv to study in --</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: With your family, or without your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: No, without my family.</span> <span id="s917">They lived -- we lived in Herzliya but I communicate -- I commuted to Tel Aviv, to Seminare, which -- which prepared you to be a teacher, and I was there for four years, so it was a continuation.</span> <span id="s918">And the reason why I switched was because in those days, and I think it’s today the same story, if you finish high school, you go to the army.</span> <span id="s919">Now, if you stop high school after two years, which is the 10th grade and you transfer to a Seminare and you finish the two years of high school in the Seminare plus two years in the same Seminare tea -- becoming a teacher, then you are not -- your education is not interrupted and you don’t go to the army.</span> <span id="s920">Now, but when you finish the Seminare and you are not married, you go to the army.</span> <span id="s921">So happened I met my husband in the last year of Seminare aki Butsim.</span> <span id="s922">And I’ll never forget he said to me, okay -- I said, you know that at the end of the year I have to go to serve, to the army.</span> <span id="s923">He said [indecipherable] you’ll serve in my army.</span> <span id="s924">And we got married and that --</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: How -- how did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: I met my husband at a wedding that -- in the meantime my father got established in Israel and he picked up a trade which I don’t know whether he learned it in Israel or maybe he had some idea with another par -- par -- partner and he became a -- oh my God, listen -- hm -- plumber, with another partner and Israel was -- at that time they were building Israel so he was doing all the installations to the new homes in Herzliya and -- and so, you know, he did pretty well, worked very hard, you know, wasn’t young any more.</span> <span id="s927">Took him at least five or eight years by the time he managed to open a little business with this partner of his.</span> <span id="s928">And -- and you know, and we lived in Herzliya and --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: And your sister stayed -- stayed in Herzliya [indecipherable] younger --</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Oh y -- absolutely, the younger one, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: She is by eight years younger than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Yeah, eight years, I think.</span> <span id="s935">Seven or eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: And yeah, she stayed in Herzliya and went to school and --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: So you met -- you met your husband at a wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: And my -- I -- at a wedding and it was a wedding of one of the builders that was marrying her son and my father was very insistent that I should go too to that wedding, and I didn't want to.</span> <span id="s940">Because you have to understand that in Israel when you are 18, you are very self sufficient.</span> <span id="s941">You don’t go with your parents.</span> <span id="s942">And I said, I should go with you?</span> <span id="s943">And that makes sense.</span> <span id="s944">I don’t want to go, I don’t want to go.</span> <span id="s945">He said no, you should come, you should see a builder, he is a very well-to-do man and a beautiful wedding and we’re all invited and -- all right.</span> <span id="s946">So we wen -- I went to the wedding with them and I wasn’t very happy because I had to sit with them and it was boring, and interesting.</span> <span id="s947">I’m -- I’m going to back up now.</span> <span id="s948">When we came to Israel in 1951 there was a family from Boryslaw that my father remembered.</span> <span id="s949">He was not in contact with this man, but he knew that he immigrated to Israel.</span> <span id="s950">His name was Joseph Holzman.</span> <span id="s951">He immigrated to Israel as a youngster when he was 17, before World War II.</span> <span id="s952">Left the family, his father, I think died at a -- at the front fighting, I think, I don’t know if it was the Pole [phone ringing] This man, Joseph Holzman, who was born in Boryslaw and my father knew him from Boryslaw, but there was not really a contact between the two til my father arrived in Israel, and he said, I have to find this man, I want to see what he does here so maybe he can guide me what to do in Israel.</span> <span id="s953">And so this man Joseph Holzman, in Herzliya by the beach had a motel, a little motel and that was his business.</span> <span id="s954">And so I remember I was -- we just -- you know, we just arrived in Israel and we were living in the -- in that Sidney ali that I mentioned, which is close to where they lived and had their motel, so we went there one evening, and -- all of us, and you know, they spoke about whatever.</span> <span id="s955">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s956">And maybe he gave my father some advice and we left and that’s it.</span> <span id="s957">And there was never a contact any more.</span> <span id="s958">At the wedding his wife, Joseph’s wife came to the wedding.</span> <span id="s959">He wasn’t there because he stayed in the motel cause they had guests and he had to attend to the guests that they had.</span> <span id="s960">And -- but his wife was with her son at the wedding.</span> <span id="s961">And we were ready to leave the wedding and go back home, it was around 11 o’clock and we had to catch the last bus from Tel Aviv, and so -- where the wedding took place.</span> <span id="s962">And Mrs. Holzman saw my father and she remembered him, she said, hello Mr. Weingarten, how nice to see you, blah, blah, blah, and I’m standing in the back.</span> <span id="s963">And she asks, and this is your daughter?</span> <span id="s964">And my father said yes, and he introduced -- introduce yourself.</span> <span id="s965">So I introduced myself.</span> <span id="s966">She looked at me, grabbed me by the hand and she said, I have a very nice son, and I want you to meet him.</span> <span id="s967">And that was it, and the rest is history.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: And -- and that’s how you met your future husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: That’s how I met my future husband and we started dating and that’s it, and it ended up in marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: And your name is now Etzyon, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Etzyon, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: -- and how did that happen that it was not Holzman?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Because at that time it was very fashionable in Israel not to have a rooted Israeli name.</span> <span id="s975">Not Holzman, not Weingarten.</span> <span id="s976">Many, many families I remember at that time changed their names to Hebrew names.</span> <span id="s977">And in fact, I went through that period too with my folks.</span> <span id="s978">I said, why don’t you change from Weingarten, which is a vineyard, and change it to Karmi.</span> <span id="s979">Karmi is a [indecipherable] name of a vineyard.</span> <span id="s980">Why do we have to be called Weingarten?</span> <span id="s981">So that was a period that a lot of Israelis went through, and changed their names.</span> <span id="s982">And I think what happened also at that time, our Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, when he sent people overseas, diplomatic excursions or whatever, representing Israel, he wanted them to have Hebrew names and not names that were carried from the Diaspora or what have you, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: So you got married after how long?</span> <span id="s984">How long did you know your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Seven months, we got married, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: And you didn’t have to go into the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: And then I didn’t have to go to the army, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: And then where did --</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: And he says I’m still serving.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: And where did y --</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Herzliya.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: In a -- a little town called Kfar Shmaryahu.</span> <span id="s996">We lived there, my husband received a house from his folks.</span> <span id="s997">And we lived in that little house for almost three years.</span> <span id="s998">And in 19 -- and my daughter was born in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Were you working at all, were you teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: I just taught for one year in Israel, in elementary school.</span> <span id="s1001">And then my daughter was born, so I stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: And your husband was doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: My husband worked for an Israeli company doing refrigeration.</span> <span id="s1004">Yes, refrigeration that was called Ampa, and that was his trade.</span> <span id="s1005">And in 1963 we immigrated to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: This cousin, Jake Schutzman, who sent papers to my father in Poland, which took few year for my father to deposit it in the American embassy.</span> <span id="s1008">Things were forgotten, years went by, nobody thought about it.</span> <span id="s1009">It was just erased.</span> <span id="s1010">One day my father receives a letter from the American embassy.</span> <span id="s1011">They are sum -- summoning him to come -- calling him to come to the American embassy.</span> <span id="s1012">He went -- he didn’t say anything to us -- he went to the American embassy to find out why are they inviting him.</span> <span id="s1013">And -- completely slipped his mind, this whole episode what he did in Poland years ago.</span> <span id="s1014">It was like 11 or 12 years ago.</span> <span id="s1015">He came to the embassy and from what I understand, they told him, Mr. Weingarten, your Polish quota -- you deposited papers in this and this year, has finally matured.</span> <span id="s1016">If you want, if you have a sponsor, you can go to United States within the next six months.</span> <span id="s1017">My father came to us and he said listen, I got this letter and they said that I can now immigrate to America, but I’m too old and I’m not gonna start my life all over again.</span> <span id="s1018">Your name is there, and Dahlia’s name is there and Mama’s name, anybody who wants to go -- you want to go, go.</span> <span id="s1019">I don’t know whether you can go, he says, but take this letter and go to the American embassy and see whether you have any rights at all.</span> <span id="s1020">Well, a seed was planted in my mind.</span> <span id="s1021">I said to my husband, you know what?</span> <span id="s1022">Why don’t we go and check out?</span> <span id="s1023">Out of curiosity.</span> <span id="s1024">We don’t have to go, but let’s go and see.</span> <span id="s1025">Maybe we can go for a year, or two years, whatever it is, we don’t have to sell anything.</span> <span id="s1026">Why don’t we just go and see?</span> <span id="s1027">If it works, fine, if not, not.</span> <span id="s1028">So I finally convinced him to go to -- to take the ride with me to Tel Aviv, to the consulate, because the embassy was -- was at the -- yeah, the embassy was in Tel Aviv, not in [indecipherable] in -- in -- in Tel Aviv, right.</span> <span id="s1029">And we arrived there, a young couple and we -- I -- you know, with my broken English at the time, and he looked at us, the -- we -- we met with the consul.</span> <span id="s1030">And the consul said, we -- he said, you are Anita Weingarten?</span> <span id="s1031">Yes, I am Anita Weingarten.</span> <span id="s1032">Well you -- you -- you have the right to go.</span> <span id="s1033">You have the right like your father does, the same way.</span> <span id="s1034">You are m -- but I -- you are married and you have a child, he said, we Americans do not separate families.</span> <span id="s1035">I’ll never forget that sentence.</span> <span id="s1036">We will add your husband and your child to your quota, and in five months you can go.</span> <span id="s1037">Three months I think he said even, I don’t -- you know.</span> <span id="s1038">Well, providing that you have somebody who can sponsor you so you don’t fall on the American government as a burden.</span> <span id="s1039">So I came, I said, listen Dad -- he said well, we have a cousin in Washington, Jake Schutzman.</span> <span id="s1040">Write to him and see how he responds to it.</span> <span id="s1041">So I wrote him a letter, and he said, anything and everything that I can do for you, I will do.</span> <span id="s1042">And we ended up in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: So you came, thinking --</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: In ’63.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: -- in ’63, possibly temporarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Absolutely, with the thought that we are not going to stay more than --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Stay --</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: -- two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: -- two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Maybe, maybe, maximum five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1054">And what was your -- what were your parents’ reactions to the fact?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: My folks were pretty happy.</span> <span id="s1056">His folks, especially his mother, very unhappy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1058">Now his -- your husband’s first name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Eliezer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: As -- Eliezer’s father was from Boryslaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: From -- his family was divorced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: His mother divorced and she remarried Holzman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: And -- but his father came from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: His name was Baruch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1071">And his mother came from Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Russia, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: And they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: But -- but Eliezer was born in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: In Israel.</span> <span id="s1077">Q: In Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: In Herzliya, Israel, right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1080">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: So his mother was very unhappy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: His stepfather, Holzman, you know, he said okay, well the kids want to try, you know, let them try, we’re not gonna stop them, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1084">For her it was very difficult because she had only one granddaughter, that was my daughter, and you know, removing her away and so forth, so that was difficult.</span> <span id="s1085">But then -- since then it’s the history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: So you’re here in -- in the United States.</span> <span id="s1087">What did the United States represent to you at that point in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Loved America from the very beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1091">It meant opportunity, freedom, huge country, and I loved it.</span> <span id="s1092">I loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Did you -- did you speak English well at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: Spoke, you know, like a graduate of a seminar, but I -- I love languages and when we arrived here -- and of course with the help of my second cousin, Jake Schutzman, I immediately enrolled, with my certificates, I started taking courses at Baltimore Hebrew College, and they -- a professor -- the professors used to come to Washington, D.C. and give lectures and I started learning.</span> <span id="s1095">I also listened to the radio.</span> <span id="s1096">I repeated sentences when I turned on the television and I used to repeat after whoever appeared on television, whatever it was, I used to repeat the sentences.</span> <span id="s1097">And learned the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Did you fly from Israel to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: No, we took a boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: I ge --</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Beca -- yeah, we took --</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Which boat was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Israhin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: So it was an Israeli line?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Yeah, an Israeli line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: And you docked in New York?</span> <span id="s1107">A: And we docked in New York, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Did you see the Statue of Liberty?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1110">And my ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Was that an emotional experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Yes, it was, absolutely, because it was also my husband’s birthday when we docked in New York.</span> <span id="s1113">His 26th birthday in April.</span> <span id="s1114">April 28th.</span> <span id="s1115">And it was a very emotional -- now, my husband, when we arri -- when we -- you know, when we were planning to leave Israel, and before that we saw a movie called “West Side Story.”</span> <span id="s1116">And my husband said, is this America?</span> <span id="s1117">That’s what it looks like?</span> <span id="s1118">I said, well I don’t think all America is what you see in “West Side Story.”</span> <span id="s1119">So he was a little hesitant, you know, he said, what am I gonna do there, and I said don’t worry, whatever -- we’ll find what to do.</span> <span id="s1120">We won’t -- we won’t be lost.</span> <span id="s1121">And with that kind of attitude, you know, my cousin Jake Schutzman started looking for him to find him a job so he can, you know, find his way, and he did, you know, went in the evening, took courses in English and slowly, slowly progressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: And what kind of work did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: And he started -- actually, he worked for two companies.</span> <span id="s1124">The first company that hired him, you know, when they told him to bring a certain tool he didn’t understand exactly what they meant, so they he -- he brought another tool, and he didn’t last there too long, they fired him, and he was very devastated because he was never fired before.</span> <span id="s1125">But that’s part of, you know, you -- you -- you acclimate yourself that way, that’s part of life.</span> <span id="s1126">And so then he worked for another gentleman, in fact the gentleman was a member of Beth El and I don’t know what happened then, they fired him.</span> <span id="s1127">And then I took the initiative into my own hands, opened the yellow pages, looked under heating and air conditioning and that was July, and we arrived in April.</span> <span id="s1128">May, June, July, we were three months in Washington and I just figured out I’m going to cope, and I happened to land on a company named Dependo.</span> <span id="s1129">And I called up and Mr. Blom answered the phone, and I said, we are from Israel, we are here three months and my husband worked in this line in Israel, in refrigeration and so forth.</span> <span id="s1130">He said, okay, send him in.</span> <span id="s1131">And he went and he got the job and he worked there for seven years.</span> <span id="s1132">And after seven years he decided well, time to go on my own.</span> <span id="s1133">And since then, with another partner and they opened their own business, and then, you know, sometimes partnerships does -- doesn’t always work well, and after, I think, two years or so they separated and my husband went on his own.</span> <span id="s1134">And sine then has been on his own and has his own company.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Did you have any more children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Yes, I have a son here in America and he was born in 1976.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Exactly the same date like my father, April -- noth -- no, no, no, March 25th, ’76, the bicentennial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Oh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Bicentennial baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: And then did you work at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Oh, all the time, yes.</span> <span id="s1143">I started working in 19, actually ’63 in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: As a teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: As a substitute teacher at B’nai Israel, at the time it was on 16th Street.</span> <span id="s1146">And then I got a job in Beth El the following year on Old Georgetown Road and I worked there for, I think, seven or eight years as a teacher, as a Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s1147">And vis-à-vis I constantly studied through courses from Baltimore Hebrew College and got a degree there.</span> <span id="s1148">And continued working -- later when we moved -- we lived in Silver Spring.</span> <span id="s1149">At first we lived in Washington, D.C. for two years and then we bought a town house in Silver Spring and we lived there for seven years.</span> <span id="s1150">And after seven years we bought this house where we are in now, in Potomac.</span> <span id="s1151">And I switched and I worked for Ha Shalom, vis-à-vis at the -- what is today Charles E. Smith’s Jewish Day School.</span> <span id="s1152">And I sent my daughter to that school.</span> <span id="s1153">Prior to that it was called Solomon Schechter school and it was housed on East West highway at Ora Kodish and in Temple Shalom it was split and -- and I worked there for -- since ’69 -- 1969 at Solomon Schechter and then it became Charles E. Smith’s Jewish Day School.</span> <span id="s1154">And worked with Hashalom for seven, eight years, then the last 20 years at Washington Hebrew congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Let’s talk a little bit about what your thoughts and feelings are.</span> <span id="s1156">What are your thoughts about Germany?</span> <span id="s1157">Granted, you don’t have direct memories of the war, but your life certainly was affected by it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: -- obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: -- absolutely.</span> <span id="s1161">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: What are your thoughts about Germans and Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: My thoughts are I’m sure that there were good people in Germany like in a -- any other country, es-especially at -- beginning when I was younger, of course I hated anything that had to do with Germany or Germans, even to a point that even when my husband says well, maybe we should go to Europe and go to Germany, I said I don’t feel like going there.</span> <span id="s1164">I said I don’t want to buy any car that’s made in -- in germa -- in -- you know, that has anything to do with the German manufacturing, or anything that it was manufactured in Germany.</span> <span id="s1165">You know, some people buy Mercedeses and so I said no, this is not for us, and I was -- and I’m still, until today, not -- you know.</span> <span id="s1166">But I don’t -- you know, there’s no such thing really that I hate, cause I don’t know what to hate there, or not to like there.</span> <span id="s1167">But I feel that anti-Semitism still exists there and -- and -- and on the other hand, now that -- when you read, you know, it’s 60 some years after the war, and you read the circumstances that brought Hitler to power, and the people that would not necessarily follow, or obey, or belong to the Jugenrat, or whatever it is, were immediately either punished or -- or -- you know, they were sentenced to death or they had -- they were not getting the rations or the food.</span> <span id="s1168">So you -- you felt that those people were, in a sense pressured for their own survival, in order for them to survive, so they went with him and they wouldn’t oppose him, because if they would, they would lose whatever they had.</span> <span id="s1169">So, you know, it’s from -- sometimes you wonder.</span> <span id="s1170">Such a thing can happen all over again, and the question is, how would the population react?</span> <span id="s1171">Would everybody worry just about himself or themselves and to heck with the rest of the world as long as I have my food and I have my job and I’m not being threatened?</span> <span id="s1172">Then I, you know, so what do I care about this minority, that minority, whatever min -- it’s very possible that this can, you know, that this -- that this is the reaction of maybe humanity, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Right, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1174">Do you consider yourself a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Absolutely, yes.</span> <span id="s1176">Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1177">I consider myself a survivor thanks to that family that took me in.</span> <span id="s1178">If not the family, I doubted whether I would survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1180">I -- you se -- you said that professionally you’ve taught at different Hebrew schools --</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: -- Jewish schools, but yet your parents were not religious.</span> <span id="s1183">Did -- are you -- do you consider yourself religious or are you just teaching [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: I am more --</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: -- a Jewish history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: I am more of a Reformed Jew.</span> <span id="s1187">I am not an Orthodox Jew, because that really doesn’t speak to me.</span> <span id="s1188">So, I believe in what is called live and let live.</span> <span id="s1189">And I don’t think that really by being an Orthodox Jew and -- and -- and doing everything the way the Orthodoxy does, that this is the only way.</span> <span id="s1190">I believe that Judaism is much broader, much larger, and whether you follow exactly as the Torah tells you to follow, or the Talmud, that you are a better Jew than I am.</span> <span id="s1191">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Do you can -- how --</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: I keep Shabbat, I light the candles, I like the Jewish atmosphere.</span> <span id="s1194">We celebrate the holidays.</span> <span id="s1195">Whether I run to the synagogue to pray and think that the salvation will come from God?</span> <span id="s1196">No, I believe it comes from you.</span> <span id="s1197">And there is even a sentence in Hebrew, it says [speaks Hebrew here].</span> <span id="s1198">And ami is I.</span> <span id="s1199">The emphasis is first on I. Not [speaks Hebrew], but on I. And that’s what I believe that is.</span> <span id="s1200">I, or an -- every individual really is responsible for his deeds and -- and you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: How would you describe yourself?</span> <span id="s1202">Would you describe yourself as Jewish, American, Polish, Israeli?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Not -- no, not necessarily Polish.</span> <span id="s1204">And I was thinking about it and sometimes I thought maybe a world citizen would be real nice.</span> <span id="s1205">To be just a world citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: So, have you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: But I feel very close to Israel, definitely I do.</span> <span id="s1208">And I feel that Jews need to have their own homeland and not be spread all over.</span> <span id="s1209">We should -- we have to have our own homeland, and if we want to live in other places in the world, that’s fine, but we need to have a homeland at this point.</span> <span id="s1210">If -- which is a Utopian thought, one day borders will be broken and people will -- you know, that’s something far-fetched, into the long, long future.</span> <span id="s1211">So at this point we need our homeland, we need our base.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Have you gone back to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Do you go back on a regular basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: We -- we do, every year, every other year, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1216">In fact, we are planning now to go in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: And -- and your children consider themselves Israel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Americans, yes.</span> <span id="s1221">They consider themselves Americans and they love Israel, because I have taken them couple times to Israel.</span> <span id="s1222">They have been numerous times to the land of Israel.</span> <span id="s1223">One of my granddaughter had the Bat Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1224">One of my granddaughter graduated Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School and went to Israel with them, and went prior to Israel.</span> <span id="s1225">So they feel a bond with Israel, but they consider themselves American Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Have you been back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: No, I have not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Do you -- do you want to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: But I would like to.</span> <span id="s1230">Now I would -- before I didn’t have no desire whatsoever, but now I would like to, and I don’t know if it comes with age, or -- I’d -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: You would like to go back to Boryslaw, is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Yeah, to see -- to see what -- well, Boryslaw is not going to be the same when it was 66 years ago, or 68 years ago, it’s not the same.</span> <span id="s1233">But I would like to see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Well, because you know, my father was born there, my grandmother, my mother, I was born -- to see the birthplace, basically.</span> <span id="s1236">To see what it looks like.</span> <span id="s1237">And -- and -- and j -- you know, there is a picture here that I have, which I happened to enlarge, but you can see what Boryslaw looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Are you more comfortable around survivors than you are the people who didn’t have to live through wartime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: No, I don’t have that problem, no.</span> <span id="s1242">What sometimes bothers me is the ignorance of -- of people and -- and you know, it’s a -- and it’s natural, the ignorance of -- of -- of not knowing, or not showing interest or -- or stuff like that, but I feel comfortable among those and among those, both.</span> <span id="s1243">I don’t -- I have an occasionally discussions and -- and when I mention sometimes, you know, a -- since I know the Jewish history well, and I know in every land where Jews lived eventually there was a persecution of the Jewish people, and if I mention nobody knows whether this is not going to happen in uni -- in America.</span> <span id="s1244">Even though this is a free country and so forth, we have no guarantee that this will not happen here.</span> <span id="s1245">We don’t know.</span> <span id="s1246">Depends on population, depends on education.</span> <span id="s1247">Many, many factors go into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: A-Are your parents still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: No, my -- both parents passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: In Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: In Israel, right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Did -- did they get reparations at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: My father did and my stepmother did, yes, they did, right.</span> <span id="s1254">And they claimed it helped them quite a bit to live in Israel.</span> <span id="s1255">That it helped them toward their older age.</span> <span id="s1256">They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Do you think you would be a different person than you are today if you hadn't had to go through what you went through, being given to another family, living in Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: Most like -- yeah, probably I would be different if my -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: -- going to Israel.</span> <span id="s1260">I mean, you didn’t have a typical --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: -- childhood that someone here --</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Right, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: -- yes.</span> <span id="s1266">Very possible.</span> <span id="s1267">You -- you’re referring to the fact that if my father would not have survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Well no, let’s say if you were just born in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Oh, of course would be different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Your -- you would be a different type of person, is what I’m saying.</span> <span id="s1271">Your outlook would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Wa -- yes.</span> <span id="s1273">I have a feeling yes, probably so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: In terms of education.</span> <span id="s1276">I don’t think that if my folks would have left, before the war, let’s say, and immigrated to America and I would have been born here, most likely they would have acclimated themselves to the life in America and -- and you know, when I look -- for instance, I work in Washington Hebrew, so they have pictures from very early century when the synagogue was built by German Jews.</span> <span id="s1277">And you see the kids graduating and so forth and -- and every year it says, this group graduated, that group graduated, ’41 - ’42 - ’43 - ’44.</span> <span id="s1278">And then I think to myself, my God, on the other side of the ocean, what was going on?</span> <span id="s1279">Were they aware what was going on?</span> <span id="s1280">Did they do enough?</span> <span id="s1281">See?</span> <span id="s1282">So -- and I would probably fall in the same category.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1284">So you think psychologically you would be a different person if you had grown up here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Most likely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: Probably maybe less sensitive to the whole issue of the suffering, maybe, of others.</span> <span id="s1292">And -- and you know what -- and -- and even today, when we hear about Darfur, or we hear -- hear about others being repressed different parts of the world, you know, we say we pray for them, this and that, and what are we doing?</span> <span id="s1293">Are we changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Anita Etzyon.</span> <span id="s1296">This is tape three, side A. Do you think people today have learned any -- any lessons of the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1297">Is there anything happening today that concerns you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Yes, conc -- there are a lot of things that are happening that concerns me.</span> <span id="s1299">First of all, I see anti-Semitism on the rise.</span> <span id="s1300">That concerns me.</span> <span id="s1301">I don’t know whether we are doing enough to stop it.</span> <span id="s1302">I’m sure there are means to stop it, but we -- maybe we are ignoring it and thinking the wave will go away.</span> <span id="s1303">That concerns me a great deal.</span> <span id="s1304">What concerns me also is that the attitude toward the state of Israel, my feeling is, in United States, has changed from the time that we arrived 45 years ago, or 46 years ago, to what is happening today.</span> <span id="s1305">It’s not the same, it changed for the worse.</span> <span id="s1306">And I don’t know if this is a -- a propaganda by a lot of Muslim countries, and -- and -- and maybe anti-Semitism was kind of, you know, hidden and begins slowly to mushroom out.</span> <span id="s1307">Maybe that hatred was there and somehow it -- it -- it -- it was either covered up, or maybe it has to do with the newer generation that sees things differently than the older generation.</span> <span id="s1308">It -- it could be.</span> <span id="s1309">What scares me that -- that what we hear today, we did not hear that 40 or 30 years ago.</span> <span id="s1310">Whether it’s in France, whether it’s in -- in -- in Sweden, whether it’s in -- in -- in Norway, Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Do you compare it to Germany in the 30’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: This -- this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: People’s reactions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Yes, people -- I tell you what, another thing that worries me is also the economical situation, because when economy goes down, people are looking for scapegoats and through history we have seen that, that’s what happens.</span> <span id="s1317">Because the everyday person comes across -- so he comes across with the shopkeeper or the owner of -- of a bank, or the owner of a mall or the owner of a car dealer or whatever, and many times he finds Jewish people in this -- in these areas.</span> <span id="s1318">And -- and -- and the hatred begins to boil.</span> <span id="s1319">I don’t know how to tell you but I just want to give you an example.</span> <span id="s1320">I had a girl from the Philippines that came and helped me, and they were hardly here a year, and her remark was -- she hardly knew anybody and her remark was, oh, all Jewish people are rich.</span> <span id="s1321">And I said no, that’s not true, not all Jewish people are rich.</span> <span id="s1322">Jewish people, they are ready to work, they are resourceful and they don’t sit and wait for manna from heaven to fall.</span> <span id="s1323">You know, not all Jewish people are rich, that’s wrong.</span> <span id="s1324">But I just -- that’s -- that’s the perception.</span> <span id="s1325">And what I find out with the younger generation now, scares me.</span> <span id="s1326">The younger generation scares me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: In their sense of lack of awareness?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: Lack of awareness, lack of knowledge, easy to blame.</span> <span id="s1329">It does.</span> <span id="s1330">And I’ll give you an example.</span> <span id="s1331">Yesterday I heard a story of a child, and I don’t want to mention names, who went to a camp over summer and there were -- he was put with another kid.</span> <span id="s1332">It’s -- it wasn’t just only a Jewish camp, it was a camp for Jews and everybody else.</span> <span id="s1333">And there was another child in his bunk who was not Jewish -- and we are talking about 11 year old kid, who said to the Jewish kid, he said, all Jews should die.</span> <span id="s1334">Now where does an 11 year old child come with such a statement?</span> <span id="s1335">He must have heard it at home, or in the surrounding that he comes from.</span> <span id="s1336">So the father mentioned that the Jewish kid slugged him, gave him a beating for it, you know.</span> <span id="s1337">And -- and it shows you that 11 year old kid today, you know, like -- so are we reversing?</span> <span id="s1338">What’s happening?</span> <span id="s1339">I wish I would have an answer for all that, but I really don’t.</span> <span id="s1340">But I’m very sensitive to it, I guess more than others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Because?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Because my family experienced it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1344">What are your thoughts when you enter the Holocaust Museum in Washington?</span> <span id="s1345">Or -- have you been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Oh yes, yes, I have been there.</span> <span id="s1347">Depressing.</span> <span id="s1348">Yeah, very depressing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Whe -- wh-where --</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: Emotionally, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1352">Do you feel it’s necessary to have that kind of a museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: Absolutely, yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s1354">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: But -- for educational pur --</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: For educational purposes, for the second generation, because what happened, you know, things are forgotten, as the years pass by.</span> <span id="s1357">And we know for instance that some leaders of countries deny the whole idea of Holocaust, it never existed, like Ahmadinejad.</span> <span id="s1358">And what bothers me very much, that those very, very ultra-Orthodox Jews side with him and say there is no need for the state [indecipherable] the Messiah will arrive.</span> <span id="s1359">And I don’t know how long, but if he would have crawled already, he would have been here, right?</span> <span id="s1360">So I don’t know when the Messiah will arrive.</span> <span id="s1361">But yeah, def-definitely there is a need.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Do you feel that what you went through as a young child, and all your childhood is the defining event of who you are, the defining element of who you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1364">Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s1365">Yeah, I think it’s a defining [indecipherable] yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: You said it’s made you more sensitive, you did say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1368">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: And then the other ways tha --</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: More aware of different situations.</span> <span id="s1371">Stronger, in a sense that I don’t give in so quickly.</span> <span id="s1372">I -- I don’t know if it’s inborn or -- or -- or whatever I -- I like to achieve.</span> <span id="s1373">I set a goal, I go after it.</span> <span id="s1374">I don’t back out or -- or feel oh, I can’t do it, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1375">I guess that’s it, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Do you think about your childhood often?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: I do from time to time, but not that often.</span> <span id="s1378">I don’t dwell on it.</span> <span id="s1379">I’m trying not to dwell on it, because you know, if I’ll start dwelling on it and I’ll become really a miserable human being and I don’t want that.</span> <span id="s1380">And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1382">What was your reaction during the Eichmann trial?</span> <span id="s1383">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1385">Eichmann trial we were here already, in United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1388">I -- you know what I mem -- now that you brought it up, I remember looking at him sitting in that glass booth, he looked to me like a nebbish nothing.</span> <span id="s1389">And yet, I thought to myself, one human being like that, look much harm he did.</span> <span id="s1390">And -- and -- and -- and what kind of -- you know some -- I -- what kind of thoughts he had when he did what he did?</span> <span id="s1391">What kind of feeling or attitude, or did he have any pity, or -- for others?</span> <span id="s1392">No, you didn’t see that.</span> <span id="s1393">I don’t know, I just -- you know.</span> <span id="s1394">I didn’t even feel such hatred toward him because he looked so nebbish to me, you know?</span> <span id="s1395">But then, when you think about it, were those people in those position emotionally [indecipherable] people, when you think about it, that they needed that boost, for being so important and having this power in their hands that their heads were totally -- I don’t know, the brain was totally screwed up that they could do that to others?</span> <span id="s1396">How could you explain it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Speaking of how to explain things, in raising your children --</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: -- did you talk about your past --</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: -- did you bring -- was this a big element in the raising of your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: In what ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: But i -- you know, I used to tell them that, but I didn’t want them, especially my daughter when she was young, you know, to feel, you know, to feel constant sorrow or -- or -- or seeing her mother being depressed, or what.</span> <span id="s1405">So I really didn’t -- I did and did not put such emphasis when she was younger.</span> <span id="s1406">But she heard the stories ha -- you know, my childhood, she knew about that, yeah, and my growing up and so forth.</span> <span id="s1407">So they know it and my grandchildren as well.</span> <span id="s1408">They were very fascinated.</span> <span id="s1409">They always used to come when they were younger, and Grandma tell us, so what did you do and -- and do you remember, did you have friends?</span> <span id="s1410">You know, the little things that little children ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: Things like that.</span> <span id="s1413">And you know, they -- th-they know that I’m a survivor.</span> <span id="s1414">They know that I am a child that survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Are you a member of any of the hidden children groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: I was at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1417">There wa -- I remember they started it here in Washington some time, but then I did not pursue because I worked in the evenings and I couldn’t always attend to the meetings and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: You had said that you now -- you hadn’t thought of, or you weren’t thinking about going back to Poland, but now you -- you may --</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: So do -- are you -- as you’ve gotten older, do you think more about your childhood than you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: Oh yes, yes, absolutely, yeah.</span> <span id="s1422">Ye -- I would like to see that birthplace of mine, and also see what kept my father not wanting to leave Boryslaw or -- or Poland at all.</span> <span id="s1423">And -- and sometimes I wonder, was it fear?</span> <span id="s1424">Because I did the opposite of him.</span> <span id="s1425">I was 20 -- not quite 23 - 24 when I came to United States, 23 and my husband was 26, with a child, and I was not afraid of changing, trying something new.</span> <span id="s1426">I don’t know, maybe I was stupid, that -- that I have no clue.</span> <span id="s1427">Young.</span> <span id="s1428">But I was not afraid, I always thought, you know what?</span> <span id="s1429">We’ll make it.</span> <span id="s1430">Not -- things will be okay.</span> <span id="s1431">And always had this positive feeling of self assurance or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1432">And -- and I wasn't afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Is your sister still in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: In Israel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: In Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: -- yes, yes, she is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: And is she able to come to visit you here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Oh yeah, she came couple times to visit me here, absolutely and we go and visit there, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1440">And when you were an adult, did you talk more with your parents about the war time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Because they wouldn’t bring up that subject and whenever I started asking -- and also keep in mind that I came in ’63 to United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: So that was really not a subject that they wanted to talk about because they themselves, especially my father, used to get very emotional about it.</span> <span id="s1446">And so not to aggravate him, or cause --</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Get emotional about the war, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: The war and his life and everything that took place and you know, the whole thing, so it used to bring him, apparently memories that he didn’t want to deal with.</span> <span id="s1449">So not really, not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1451">Were they able to come visit you here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: Yes, they did, they came couple times here, and we tried to talk about it and -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Did they consider moving to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: No, no, no, they were too old to do that.</span> <span id="s1455">And you know, they were settled in their ways already in Israel and in their lifestyle and so forth.</span> <span id="s1456">But I have a feeling that my father regretted the fact that he didn't move to United States when he was younger.</span> <span id="s1457">When he came over and he saw, you know and -- for the first time America so to speak and I had a feeling.</span> <span id="s1458">He didn’t -- never verbalized it, but I sensed that he regretted the fact that he didn’t have the opportunity to make it in a younger age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: When you were -- when he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Not -- not when he was 60 something, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: But learning another language, as it was, he had difficulties learning Hebrew, so English, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: They eventually learned Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: They did, but they still continued communicating either in German or Polish, yeah.</span> <span id="s1465">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Well, yeah, be -- before we close --</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: -- is there any message you wanted to leave to your grandchildren?</span> <span id="s1469">Anything you wanted to say special to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Well, special to them, I hope that they will be able to listen to the tape and go and visit the museum and -- and study and -- and learn and you know, they are young, but they -- eventually as they get older, I’m sure they will, you know.</span> <span id="s1471">A certain maturity comes with age.</span> <span id="s1472">So that’s what I would like to see, that they should study, be aware of their surroundings and also be aware of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1473">That’s what I would like to make sure that they do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1475">Well, that’s a very important note to end on.</span> <span id="s1476">Is there anything else you wanted to add be-before we close?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: You know, what I find out is that -- well, maybe now there is a more a-awakening among the Jewish population toward the Holocaust and so forth, because I remember that some families were saying no, don’t teach it to our children.</span> <span id="s1478">We don’t want them to hear those terrible things, you know, that happened.</span> <span id="s1479">They’re too young, they’re too this.</span> <span id="s1480">You know, like not experiencing it, or -- or even through stories and so forth.</span> <span id="s1481">It’s too sad.</span> <span id="s1482">That’s an -- I don’t think it’s such a good idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: You think it should be taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: I think so, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1485">I think so.</span> <span id="s1486">And that’s the way I -- you know, that’s how I feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1488">Well thank you very much --</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: -- for doing this interview.</span> <span id="s1491">This concludes the United States Holocaust
