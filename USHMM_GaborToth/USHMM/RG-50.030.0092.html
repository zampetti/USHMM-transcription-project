day.</span> <span id="s179">They give you a norm and you have to make your norm, so I had to make...for three women and one man who was a little invalid, so I had to make the norm for them, I

moustache, you know, and one day he said...he took a liking to me cause I..</span> <span id="s708">.</span> <span id="s709">I don't know...maybe I was like a weasel.</span> <span id="s710">I used to

blow it up, the tracks, and then he took me into another like a, you know, village.</span> <span id="s745">It was a village, maybe a town, and he said now we're going to...don't be afraid and don't get scared.</span> <span id="s746">We're going to take care of some people.</span> <span id="s747">He didn't tell me kill.</span> <span id="s748">He says...he said to me we're going to take care of the...the...not Nazi but the the collaborators, you know.</span> <span id="s749">So I said how do you know.</span> <span id="s750">He says he knows, you know, and we went to one house I remember and and we shot all of them, all the people, and we went to another one and we shot about three or four men.</span> <span id="s751">You know, I didn't...I didn't keep count.</span> <span id="s752">I know I shot quite a few of them because he told me to do it.</span> <span id="s753">It's to my own protection.</span> <span id="s754">At night, they'll kill me, and since then, you know, I I used to go on raids with him a few times.</span> <span id="s755">We stayed there in that .</span> <span id="s756">We stayed about...I don't know...a month, maybe a month and a half, maybe two months.</span> <span id="s757">I don't remember, and one day we used to go...I used to go on raids with him, you know, to blow up different kinds of track...railroad tracks...</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Phil, tell me about the group.</span> <span id="s759">Who was in Pietre's group?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: No, no, no, no...I don't know the group.</span> <span id="s761">There were three...there were there were...I was with him and and there were two or three more men.</span> <span id="s762">Then there was another group he used to meet, you know, we used to meet and that...because we used to go back to the to the to the village, to the cooperative.</span> <span id="s763">Nobody knew about this.</span> <span id="s764">They used to come in and nobody knew about it, nothing, only Pietre and those two men.</span> <span id="s765">They were from from this village.</span> <span id="s766">Nobody knew, you know.</span> <span id="s767">They...maybe they were afraid of him, the people who lived there.</span> <span id="s768">I don't really know, but he took a liking to me, you know.</span> <span id="s769">He always used to take me to bring him more bread and he used to tell me milk for the for the, you know, for the men, for the old man.</span> <span id="s770">He'd drink milk.</span> <span id="s771">And and and I don't know why but that's what he did, you know, and maybe I was lucky.</span> <span id="s772">I don't know.</span> <span id="s773">I was lucky or maybe I..</span> <span id="s774">.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: I was about uh...at that time I was about fifteen, sixteen.</span> <span id="s777">I was just an adult.</span> <span id="s778">Q: How did you feel as a fifteen year old boy going on these raids?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: From the beginning...terrible, because I didn't know what's happening, you know.</span> <span id="s780">I didn't...I didn't know.</span> <span id="s781">I didn't know, but he probably knew they had a..</span> <span id="s782">.</span> <span id="s783">because we didn't hear radio, nothing.</span> <span id="s784">He probably knew what was going on, you know.</span> <span id="s785">Lwow, as tiny as it was, the Germans were already in there.</span> <span id="s786">Of course, we were deep in Russia, Ukraine, and deep in the Ukrainian, you know, not far from uh uh , and then uh uh, you know, the area.</span> <span id="s787">I don't know now they call .</span> <span id="s788">And uh there were patrols, you know.</span> <span id="s789">So he probably knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s790">We didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s791">I didn't know if my parents were alive or not.</span> <span id="s792">Nothing.</span> <span id="s793">We were like, you know, people in a in a daze just running.</span> <span id="s794">I was with them, so maybe I'm...I I don't remember.</span> <span id="s795">The time to me was...no...didn't pay...I didn't care about time.</span> <span id="s796">Even now I don't wear a watch because time to me doesn't mean nothing.</span> <span id="s797">And and and so he used to take me and I used to go, and then the first time he told me what they do, I I felt like I did something for the good, but I don't know if I did it for the good for killing people.</span> <span id="s798">To me it's....it's a big why.</span> <span id="s799">It bothers me.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: What kind of people did you kill?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Oh, they were their collaborators.</span> <span id="s802">They were...they ...they... you know, I don't know if you know the Ukrainians were throwing...you could see that after, you know, that they were throwing flowers on the Russian tanks, but the Russians...not the Russians, the German tanks, the Nazis.</span> <span id="s803">You know, they were...they were collaborating with them, just...you know, they thought that Communism was going to be worse...uh uh get rid of them.</span> <span id="s804">Meanwhile, after about uh four or five months, six months, they were killing them.</span> <span id="s805">Then they went to the partisans.</span> <span id="s806">They were fighting against the Germans.</span> <span id="s807">They saw what the Germans...they wanted, you know, uh make a make Aryan (ph) and everybody.</span> <span id="s808">The Ukrainians were no good, but meanwhile the Ukrainians collaborated more...they killed more Jews than anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Can you tell us about another raid where you attacked collaborators?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Yeah...well, one.</span> <span id="s811">One that uh uh I went with him and and there was a whole uh...there already were were uh uh having a swastika and one .</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Tell us about that.</span> <span id="s813">Be a little more clear.</span> <span id="s814">Who had it?</span> <span id="s815">Where did you go and who had what?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: We went to different villages, different villages.</span> <span id="s817">You know, the U..</span> <span id="s818">.</span> <span id="s819">when the Germans was coming in, the Ukrainians were in seventh heaven cause they were tired of the Russian dominance or the Russian Communists.</span> <span id="s820">You know, they didn't know better.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Even the Russian Communists, you know, but they saved more people than anybody else, you know, and I I went with him on that raid and and we really went in a
