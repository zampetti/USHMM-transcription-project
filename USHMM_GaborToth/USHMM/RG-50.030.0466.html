1924.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And Karlsruhe --</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Karlsruhe on Rhine --</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: -- was in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: -- yeah, in Baden, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s23">And will you tell me something about your -- your parents, and ge -- let’s start with your father.</span> <span id="s24">What was his family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: He was one of seven children and they were married in 1919.</span> <span id="s26">They were married in Poland and then they moved to Germany right away.</span> <span id="s27">And they lived in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s28">And my brother was born in 1920 in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s29">And I don’t know when they moved to Karlsruhe, I was born in Karlsruhe in ’24.</span> <span id="s30">So between ’20 and ’24 they moved.</span> <span id="s31">I don’t know the exact date.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: And your father’s -- your father’s family, were they middle class, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Yeah, my -- my [indecipherable] what I have been told -- I didn’t know too many of them except the ones who were living in Germany, some stayed in Poland.</span> <span id="s34">He was the baby, and when my dad was born, his oldest brother already had children the age of my father and they were in the United States.</span> <span id="s35">And some of them moved to Karlsruhe, some of them -- his sister lived in Nuremberg, and she would come and visit.</span> <span id="s36">And they had a dairy store.</span> <span id="s37">Dairy, eggs and butter.</span> <span id="s38">And my dad, that was my dad’s job in Karlsruhe.</span> <span id="s39">It was lucky, my mother always said I was the lucky child because the day I was born my dad got that job.</span> <span id="s40">He was the manager of the dairy department in the wholesale grocery store.</span> <span id="s41">And he had this job until he was deported to Poland in 1938, and on the same day my brother came home with a horseshoe, and that’s supposed to be luck also.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: So your father was born where?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: In Dukla, in Poland.</span> <span id="s44">And I never been there, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: And he moved to Germany in?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Well, in 1919, when they married.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Did they marry before they had come to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: 19 -- yeah, 1919.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: They married in Sianów where my mother was from.</span> <span id="s51">And I think it was a match, probably, arranged.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span> <span id="s53">What -- what was your mother’s family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: They were very poor.</span> <span id="s55">There were 10 children and my grandfather had the tailor shop, tailoring shop.</span> <span id="s56">And there hardly was any food on the table and my mother was the second oldest girl, the first one was a boy.</span> <span id="s57">So my mother had to raise all the younger children, so she never had a childhood.</span> <span id="s58">She said she never played with children.</span> <span id="s59">They had the cradle made out of wood and she would look out the window.</span> <span id="s60">And children bear on the sidewalk playing hopscotch, and she participated then, she was in the apartment upstairs and many times the cradle was turned upside down because she got so excited.</span> <span id="s61">But she never had time to really play with children, raising the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s62">My grandfather, I only saw him once or twice in my life.</span> <span id="s63">To me he was a big man with a long beard, Orthodox.</span> <span id="s64">And my mother said that he never held any of the children on his lap.</span> <span id="s65">But the grandchildren he did.</span> <span id="s66">That one time we went to visit I was on his lap and I braided his beard.</span> <span id="s67">And my mother just stood there, she didn’t believe that he let me do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Was your family very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yeah, they were Orthodox, but modern Orthodox.</span> <span id="s70">My dad was clean-shaven and my mother did not wear a wig.</span> <span id="s71">They were modern Orthodox, but very observing, Sabbath and all the holidays.</span> <span id="s72">When my dad worked -- well, the name was [indecipherable], he never had a vacation all his life because he didn’t work on any Jewish holidays and we got a lot of holidays.</span> <span id="s73">So this was taken off as vacation.</span> <span id="s74">So my mother used to take us places, or also we children always -- every summer you had to get out of the city, like, otherwise you would die, it seems like it.</span> <span id="s75">The New Yorkers do that too, don’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: And well, it was camps we used to go to, and also I was very athletic and on weekends we used the train.</span> <span id="s78">And then I also belonged to the Mizrachi, which is a Orthodox Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s79">And I think I was about five or six when I joined, and we had camps for about two weeks, and then we had conclaves.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And you ha-had one sibling, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Two.</span> <span id="s82">My brother, who is four years older, and myself.</span> <span id="s83">My mother always said she only wanted two children, she raised such a large family before that that’s all she wanted, and that’s all she had was two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: When was your brother born?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: June -- wait a minute.</span> <span id="s86">June the second, because my son was born June the fourth.</span> <span id="s87">June the second, 1920.</span> <span id="s88">And he was born in Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Were you close with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: As children we were close in a way, but boys were raised entirely different than girls.</span> <span id="s91">A girl just had to smile and look pretty, that’s all that mattered.</span> <span id="s92">And my brother had to be educated.</span> <span id="s93">So he didn’t have a childhood.</span> <span id="s94">My dad wanted him to be a rabbi.</span> <span id="s95">Is that all right, the way I’m holding it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: My dad wanted him to be a rabbi, my mother wanted him to be a college professor.</span> <span id="s98">So he was educated for both.</span> <span id="s99">So I was school -- we had school, you went to school from eight til 12, and you went back in the afternoon from two til four or from eight til one and three til five.</span> <span id="s100">Whenever he got out of school he had to go to Hebrew school, every day.</span> <span id="s101">So he didn’t have much of a childhood either, in the -- it was really interesting, after we met again after the war, he was married and I was married, and so we talked about our parents and about our childhood and the interesting part was, the way I talked about our parents was not the same way he talked about his parents, which were our parents, you know?</span> <span id="s102">So he told me, he said, “I was so jealous of you.”</span> <span id="s103">And I said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s104">I said, “I was so jealous of you, you were so brilliant.”</span> <span id="s105">And he said, “I had to be, I had to study all the time.</span> <span id="s106">I had no childhood, and you had friends.”</span> <span id="s107">He didn’t have any friends.</span> <span id="s108">You always had friends, you always were playing or going places, doing things.</span> <span id="s109">And it was really interesting.</span> <span id="s110">We were jealous of each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: But it worked out well, I mean, we got it out of our system and we didn’t carry any grudges.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: So do -- your parents didn’t -- weren’t particularly interested in -- in your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I was not a dumbbell.</span> <span id="s115">I didn’t have to work very hard, and I brought home A’s and B’s without any sweat.</span> <span id="s116">And he had to bring home A’s, B’s were not good enough.</span> <span id="s117">And well, that’s what I said, all you had to do was smile, and you had to associate with the people they approved of.</span> <span id="s118">And you couldn’t go with children they didn’t appro -- especially my mother.</span> <span id="s119">My dad was a hardworking man.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: You s -- mentioned that you had a lot of friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s122">I always had a lot of friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Were they friends from school, or from --</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Well, at the beginning I had Gentile friends, but then when Hitler came to power, they got sparse, less and less friends.</span> <span id="s125">And that’s really interesting you’re asking that.</span> <span id="s126">I still remember Fritz Erlow, we were raised together.</span> <span id="s127">And I loved Fritz as much as li -- I liked my brother -- loved my brother, Bernard.</span> <span id="s128">And then when Hitler came to power, he disappeared.</span> <span id="s129">If we passed on the street, he wouldn’t see me.</span> <span id="s130">If I passed on the street when it was dark -- at that time used to go out in the evening -- at the beginning, later on we didn’t go out too much in the evenings, he would look, stare at you like no recognition, but then he would take his hand and wave at you in the back, so he wouldn’t been seen.</span> <span id="s131">So -- but that really hurts, because in a way I knew that the reason for it, because I was a Jew, but it’s very hard for children to accept.</span> <span id="s132">You -- you take it personally, because I would cry.</span> <span id="s133">I came home and I saw some of the girls I used to play with, and they run away.</span> <span id="s134">Why doesn’t she like me any more?</span> <span id="s135">I haven’t done anything to her.</span> <span id="s136">It -- it’s hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: And they probably went home and talked to their parents also, how bad they felt, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Do you remember what was -- were those the first incidents that made you realize that you were somehow different than these other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: When we were kicked out the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: I think it was the beginning of the fifth grade, because I supposed to have gone to the gymnasium also, like my brother did.</span> <span id="s143">But there were articles in the paper that they built in a new school for handicapped children in Frankfurt-au-Main, and this was a very dilapidated school.</span> <span id="s144">I mean, nowadays, it be condemned.</span> <span id="s145">And that’s the school they gave us.</span> <span id="s146">And that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: What year would that have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Let me just think, I was born in ’24, I started school in ’30, it might have been in ’35.</span> <span id="s149">Oh, that -- the dates are getting dimmer.</span> <span id="s150">They really are.</span> <span id="s151">I mean, what happened you remember, but to remember the exact dates, because I started at such a young age and so many things happened until ’45.</span> <span id="s152">And nothing was good, really.</span> <span id="s153">So -- but what they didn’t know, we got a much better education than we did in public school, because they wouldn’t let Jewish college professors teach, so we got the college professors to teach us.</span> <span id="s154">So we benefited from it, we really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: How far did you have to travel to go to school every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: It’s -- didn’t have to travel, it was within walking distance.</span> <span id="s157">In [indecipherable] of so many miles, they had a school close by.</span> <span id="s158">And we weren’t bused at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Was your family afraid when Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Well, I saw Hitler many times.</span> <span id="s161">I was a nosy child.</span> <span id="s162">And whenever he came, I would not go down to see him in my neighborhood because everybody knew I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s163">I would go blocks and blocks out of my way.</span> <span id="s164">And -- where they didn’t know me.</span> <span id="s165">And I was standing in the front row, I was -- I was just fascinated by him, it was just like he hypnotized people.</span> <span id="s166">But you know, I usually talk with my hands [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s167">That’s all -- I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s168">Well, I would always be in the front row, many blocks away from where I lived.</span> <span id="s169">And I would stay on the front row with everybody else, and everybody yelling, heil Hitler here.</span> <span id="s170">He always came in a convertible, and naturally he would hold his hand on the belt.</span> <span id="s171">I can close my eyes and see him.</span> <span id="s172">Heil Hitler, heil Hitler, and people just went crazy screaming, you know.</span> <span id="s173">And they all were running and I was right there with them.</span> <span id="s174">And he wouldn’t let them get too close, and then he just would take his hands slowly, and everybody would go back.</span> <span id="s175">It just like you were hypnotized, you know?</span> <span id="s176">So this was ’33.</span> <span id="s177">But really, ’32 already it started.</span> <span id="s178">There were Communist parties, Nazi parties, Socialist parties, and they always scheduled marches about the same time and there always -- somehow there was a shooting going on, and they’re yelling and they used to hit each other.</span> <span id="s179">And my mother always used to grab my hand and let’s go upstairs, let’s go upstairs.</span> <span id="s180">No, I want to see what goes on.</span> <span id="s181">In ’32, you know, I was eight years old, I was nosy.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What did you think when you were watching these -- these speeches and Hitler --</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s184">I really don’t, I just was fascinated by that whole thing.</span> <span id="s185">It was just like everybody was hypnotized.</span> <span id="s186">And his speeches were in -- he didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s187">He said three, four words and then yell, everybody yelled, heil Hitler, heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s188">I don’t know, as a child -- the one thing I remember, he’s always, when he came to Karlsruhe, it was a pretty good size town at that time, the size of Lovell, he would stay in the Hotel Germania, and every time I passed that hotel, I was going to stay there someday.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: So you admired him a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s191">You’re kind of fascinated, until, you know, then I didn’t admire him any more.</span> <span id="s192">I mean, what came afterwards.</span> <span id="s193">My mother always said, it can’t get any worse, it can’t get any worse.</span> <span id="s194">Like when they deported my dad to Poland in ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Why don’t you tell me a little more about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: One night we were home, Mother wasn’t feeling well and she already was in bed, and the doorbell rang.</span> <span id="s197">They always were very noisy and always yelling and always rushing.</span> <span id="s198">And they always rushed, you know, and they were yelling, open that door, open that door, and they kicked the door.</span> <span id="s199">So my dad went to the door and they came in and they said, empty your pockets.</span> <span id="s200">And my dad said, “Why?</span> <span id="s201">I haven’t done anything.”</span> <span id="s202">He was at work that day, came home from work.</span> <span id="s203">Well, just empty your pockets and you do as we tell you, and your sooner you do it, your sooner you be home.</span> <span id="s204">And they took my dad away.</span> <span id="s205">Th-They pocket all his belongings and his favorite watch.</span> <span id="s206">I don’t remember who gave him that watch, it was a gold watch.</span> <span id="s207">It was a pocket watch, that was the style at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Were you there when he --</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes, I was there, I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: My mother was there and that night my brother came home from Würzburg, it was a teacher’s college.</span> <span id="s212">And we had the whistle, and I don’t remember it now, that when we whistled downstairs we knew it was one or the other.</span> <span id="s213">I mean, my parents knew, my mother knew.</span> <span id="s214">Middle in the night we heard that whistle, and it was my brother came home.</span> <span id="s215">That was in ’38.</span> <span id="s216">So after they deported my dad to the Polish border, they had some kind of agreement that if any Jew in Germany was not in Poland for the last 10 years, that they gonna make them staatenlos, that you didn’t belong anywheres, you had no -- no country.</span> <span id="s217">And Germany did not want to get stuck -- your back hurts?</span> <span id="s218">It’s okay?</span> <span id="s219">Germany did not want to get stuck with the people without a country.</span> <span id="s220">So that’s why they pushed them to the border, and the Polacks were shooting and the Germans were shooting and somehow they came to an agreement.</span> <span id="s221">Now, I was not there, this was told to me afterwards by my dad, that then they finally let them there -- let them in.</span> <span id="s222">So then, after ’38, this was October, in November they had Crystal Night.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Before we talk about Crystal Night could you just tell me a little bit about how your mother and you and your brother dealt with the -- the absence of your father immediately after he was deported?</span> <span id="s224">How did you find out where he had gone, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Do you know, I don’t remember ho --</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: -- did you expect him to come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: No, I didn’t expect him to come back because they called a meeting to all the wives of Polish citizens, and my mother was sick in bed.</span> <span id="s228">I think this was sometime in ’39, that was already after Crystal Night, and we were told to be at the police station that there is going to be a meeting and we have to be there.</span> <span id="s229">If we not gonna be there, then they were gonna arrest us.</span> <span id="s230">So my mother was sick, and she sent me.</span> <span id="s231">So I went there and when they called my mother’s name, I stood up and apologized that my mother couldn’t be here, but I’m here and I will give her the message, whatever the meeting is about.</span> <span id="s232">He yelled at me to come forward.</span> <span id="s233">He yelled so hard, and I was a child.</span> <span id="s234">You know, I was 15 years old, and we were children at 15, not -- not the children 15 seemed like they’re very grown up, but we were not, we were children.</span> <span id="s235">I was shaking from head to toe.</span> <span id="s236">He gave me a pencil to sign my mother’s name that we had to leave Germany by August ’39 or we were going to be arrested.</span> <span id="s237">Well, I couldn’t hold the pencil, my hand was just shaking.</span> <span id="s238">So he took his gun out and put it to my temple.</span> <span id="s239">And I really don’t remember whether I signed the name or I put the X mark -- he was satisfied, so maybe I signed the name.</span> <span id="s240">I don’t remember what I did, he seemed to be satisfied.</span> <span id="s241">And we left, we left in August of ’39, beginning of August, and they followed us.</span> <span id="s242">September, beginning of September, second World War started.</span> <span id="s243">It’s when they came, invaded Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: So after your father was deported --</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: -- you -- you weren't really sure where he had gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes, we knew that he -- he -- that they deported him to Poland and my mother had the sister in Kraków and we were pretty sure that’s where he was headed.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: And what happened in -- in those months before -- before you left, when you weren't with your father?</span> <span id="s249">Did you have any word, or what -- what did you and --</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: I don’t remember how my mother found out, I couldn’t tell you that.</span> <span id="s251">There was so much going on with me also.</span> <span id="s252">Like, the Jewish welfare office was trying to get one child out of every Jewish family, and I was designated to go to England, they found foster homes.</span> <span id="s253">And -- but then they were going to round up the young man, and my mother made me go to the Jewish welfare office, and she told me to really make a scene and cry that I don’t want to go to England, I want to go with my mother.</span> <span id="s254">And evidently they bought it, and -- I really was scared, you know?</span> <span id="s255">I was crying, I was scared, also.</span> <span id="s256">So then they sent my brother instead.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Was that what your mother wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: That’s what my mother wanted, because they were not -- they were not doing anything to the girls, but they were already taking the young men to Dachau, so she wanted him out of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: What do you remember about Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Crystal Night, it was wild.</span> <span id="s261">We didn't go out, and excuse me -- got the hair right behind the eye.</span> <span id="s262">I’m looking at you -- okay.</span> <span id="s263">They banged at the door and my mother yelled, “We don’t have any man here in the house, you deported my husband.”</span> <span id="s264">And my brother hid in the apartment at a -- I think in the closet or something, or the bathroom.</span> <span id="s265">And we didn’t open the door.</span> <span id="s266">And we screamed and they screamed and then they went away.</span> <span id="s267">Several times they came that night, and then later on we found out they burned the synagogues, they burned the Torahs, they took the rabbi and set his beard on fire.</span> <span id="s268">And this was afterwards, ab -- I didn’t go -- we did not go out, we were too scared to go out.</span> <span id="s269">This was November ’38.</span> <span id="s270">It was horrible, it really -- it was horrible when they took my father away, but they just went crazy, they really did.</span> <span id="s271">We lived on Main Street and there was so much yelling going on, I stood behind the curtain just to see something.</span> <span id="s272">And then they broke all the glass in the Jewish stores, and there were quite a few Jewish stores on Main Street.</span> <span id="s273">They went berserk.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Did your mother have any plans to leave Karlsruhe at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Well, you need an affidavit to come to the United States and my Aunt Minna, the one that I came to the United States with had a brother-in-law in Lexington, Kentucky.</span> <span id="s276">And after -- we were in Poland, we lived in the same apartment house my aunt lived in.</span> <span id="s277">And we talked, if somebody was going to survive that, to get in touch with Leon Erbach, and there was a street, but I didn’t remember it when I wrote to them.</span> <span id="s278">And that’s how we were going to be re -- reunited.</span> <span id="s279">So -- what was the question you ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: I asked if your mother had plans to leave Karlsruhe.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yeah, yeah, Erbach sent us an affidavit, but it was already too late, because Hitler went into Austria.</span> <span id="s282">That was in ’38, and the Austrian quota -- did you see a -- there was a quota, German citizen, Polish citizen, Austrian citizen.</span> <span id="s283">You had to wait, you got the number.</span> <span id="s284">So they raised the Austrian quota for the Jews get out of Austria.</span> <span id="s285">So we couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s286">If -- maybe another six months, we could have made it.</span> <span id="s287">But I guess it wasn’t meant to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: And you didn’t have any contact with your father at all until --</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Until we met again -- we were reunited in Kraków.</span> <span id="s290">We had to leave in ’39, August ’39, and we were reunited with my dad.</span> <span id="s291">And they rented a small apartment and --</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Let’s go back t-to a -- just after you had found out that you were -- you and your mother -- you had signed a form and you knew that were to be leaving --</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: -- Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: What -- what did you do?</span> <span id="s297">How long did it take for you to be deported?</span> <span id="s298">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: I worked in a Jewish welfare office, I was like a gopher, you know, taking papers.</span> <span id="s300">There were Jewish offices in different -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: -- can you understand it?</span> <span id="s302">I talk with a very heavy accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Yes, yes, that’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: You can understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green.</span> <span id="s306">And Mrs. Green, if you would just repeat that from the beginning, the question about what you did after you had signed that affidavit?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: I worked in the Jewish welfare office, and -- like a gopher, you know, taking papers.</span> <span id="s308">They had offices in different parts of town, and also, when the switchboard operator went to lunch, I would take over for a very short time.</span> <span id="s309">That was one job I hated.</span> <span id="s310">Was a nervous wreck.</span> <span id="s311">Always thought I was going to connect the wrong people.</span> <span id="s312">So, I don’t know, that’s just about all I remember what happened.</span> <span id="s313">I don’t know how else I passed the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: How long did it take until you actually had to leave Germany because of that paper that was signed?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: There was a -- well, we had to leave or -- I think they gave you a few months to get ready.</span> <span id="s316">And well, my brother, he -- we had a like an overseas trunk and -- and he packed everything, and it was shipped to Poland.</span> <span id="s317">And the bedroom was shipped to Poland.</span> <span id="s318">We didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s319">So, we left by August, beginning of August you just had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Were you on a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s322">We stopped by -- we stopped off in Berlin.</span> <span id="s323">My brother went to England the same night my mother and I caught the train to Poland, but we stopped off in Berlin.</span> <span id="s324">My mother wanted me to talk to the American consulate.</span> <span id="s325">And she thought I could s -- do better, you know, to talk to -- that maybe we could get out and come to America.</span> <span id="s326">I didn't even get to see the consulate in Berlin.</span> <span id="s327">I just talked to the secretary or somebody at the front desk.</span> <span id="s328">Maybe some other people had the same idea, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: How long did the trip take?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: I know it was an overnight trip, but I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s331">It’s very hard to remember everything, it was such a long period of time.</span> <span id="s332">Like I told you when I talked over the telephone to you, I started right from the beginning with him.</span> <span id="s333">Look, that was ’33 until ’45, that’s 12 years.</span> <span id="s334">That’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Did you know where you were headed?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Poland, yes.</span> <span id="s337">We were headed to Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: By choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Well, we had to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s340">Yeah, by cho -- by cho -- choice, excuse me.</span> <span id="s341">After we’ve crossed the border, it was our choice to go to Kraków, because my aunt lived in Kraków.</span> <span id="s342">If we had somebody in Warsaw, maybe we would have gone to Warsaw, but we didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s343">My mother was born in a little town near Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: So she -- you mentioned that she thought that was where your father would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s346">And I don’t remember whether she knew or she thought he would be there.</span> <span id="s347">Because my aunts -- my aunt lived in Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Was that your father’s sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: No, my mother’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Do you remember what happened when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s352">We want -- we went on the vacation.</span> <span id="s353">My Aunt Minna was in the vacation -- vacation in Jordanów.</span> <span id="s354">It was a vacation place, and we went there for a whole week.</span> <span id="s355">I even got a picture of that.</span> <span id="s356">And my dad came, or he was there also.</span> <span id="s357">And it was great, I -- I just thought well now, everything is going to go get back to normal and since they rented an apartment, that everything is going to be okay now.</span> <span id="s358">We were together, and my brother was in England, so -- but we were wrong.</span> <span id="s359">We really were wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Do you remember meeting with your father again, being reunited?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Well, not exactly.</span> <span id="s362">I don’t know whether -- on the picture he was in Jordanów with us, so I don’t know whether he was on vacation with my aunt, or he came to Jordanów.</span> <span id="s363">It was not very far from Kraków.</span> <span id="s364">It was a vacation place.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Where did you live in Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: First we lived with my aunt.</span> <span id="s367">Can’t remember the name of that street, but as soon as they stopped bombing Kraków, we were in the basement and the house across the street got bombed in middle in the night.</span> <span id="s368">We just took sheets and dumped stuff in there, clothes and whatever.</span> <span id="s369">And we walked all the way to Sepastiana number nine.</span> <span id="s370">That was a place where we rent an apartment afterwards.</span> <span id="s371">I don’t remember the first address.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: So it was the -- you and your mother and your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: My father, all three of us.</span> <span id="s374">And then, we were not the only ones, because my aunt lived in that apartment, and then some other sisters came from the country.</span> <span id="s375">And at the beginning we all stayed at my aunt’s place.</span> <span id="s376">And the children slept on the floor, and the adults used the beds, and my mother wouldn’t let me sleep on the floor, she thought I was too good to sleep on the floor, and I was just dying to sleep on the floor with the other kids.</span> <span id="s377">Seems like such a silly thing to remember, you know?</span> <span id="s378">But I guess it must have made an impression on me that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: What did you do with your days?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Well, this was ’39, September ’39.</span> <span id="s381">In 1940, just a few months, then we had to sweep the streets.</span> <span id="s382">We had to wear armbands, that was 1940.</span> <span id="s383">We had to -- even if it rained we had to sweep the streets.</span> <span id="s384">We had to clean barracks.</span> <span id="s385">We scrubbed the barracks on our knees.</span> <span id="s386">We carried railroad tracks all in 1940, but we still lived in the apartment.</span> <span id="s387">We had to meet in the mornings.</span> <span id="s388">And my trouble was, I was very tall, I was five-eight.</span> <span id="s389">And they would line us up, the tallest in the middle and then the shorter ones and shorter ones and I really got the heavy load.</span> <span id="s390">And they were not very kind to us when we cleaned the barracks.</span> <span id="s391">I mean, they would yell and scream, or kick, or scare us they were going to shoot us.</span> <span id="s392">But in the evening, after we went back, my mother always have a hot meal for us, and yeah, I can hear my mom say, “It’s not going to get any worse.</span> <span id="s393">It’s not going to get any worse.”</span> <span id="s394">And all during the war I can hear her say it’s not going to get any worse, but it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: So you were working with other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: With other children, yeah.</span> <span id="s397">That was ’40, I was 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Was -- did your mother and father work?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: No, no, they didn’t work.</span> <span id="s400">I don’t know whether they didn’t ask them to work, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s401">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: And did you have any sort of education, even informal during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: How -- how many hours a day did you have to work at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s406">From morning til it got dark.</span> <span id="s407">But that hot meal sure tasted good.</span> <span id="s408">It really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Did you have weekends free?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s411">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s412">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s413">Do you know, it came to a point you were well, like a zombie.</span> <span id="s414">You only did what you supposed to do, more later on, even.</span> <span id="s415">And you didn’t question it, you just did it.</span> <span id="s416">Worse thing really happened to me was, my parents and my aunt always said, “Sylvia, if Germans are around, never speak German.</span> <span id="s417">You don’t want them to know that you German.”</span> <span id="s418">So I spoke Polish, naturally with an accent.</span> <span id="s419">And there was a German -- we were carrying the railroad tracks and loading them on trucks, so I did not know and I was talking German to another German Jew.</span> <span id="s420">He came up, and he said, you speak with a bade -- a Badensa -- Baden.</span> <span id="s421">It’s like the state of Baden, like Kentucky, you know?</span> <span id="s422">Badensa accent.</span> <span id="s423">You speak exactly like I do.</span> <span id="s424">And he was the meanest thing, he would scream, he always sit on top of the truck and yell at us.</span> <span id="s425">And we never did anything right.</span> <span id="s426">And always had the gun, was gonna shoot.</span> <span id="s427">And he said, “Where you from?”</span> <span id="s428">And I had to tell him.</span> <span id="s429">I said, “Karlsruhe on Rhine.”</span> <span id="s430">I’m from Karlsruhe on Rhine.</span> <span id="s431">You come on and you sit on the truck and he gave me his lunch.</span> <span id="s432">And he made everybody watch.</span> <span id="s433">I couldn’t swallow.</span> <span id="s434">I could -- I mean, my throat closed up, you know?</span> <span id="s435">And he was yelling at me, “You eat, you eat.”</span> <span id="s436">I don’t know whether he wanted me to have his lunch, or he did it out of meanness, or maybe he thought he was helping me, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s437">But I sure couldn’t swallow.</span> <span id="s438">It just got in -- got stuck in my throat.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Did you have to march a long way?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Ye -- oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s441">You marched there, y-you had the meeting point and you marched, and you marched home that night.</span> <span id="s442">And you had to wear your armband.</span> <span id="s443">And I don’t understand, some people say they -- they wore a armband with a yellow star which said Juden there.</span> <span id="s444">We had the blue star, a white armband in Kraków.</span> <span id="s445">That’s what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Do you remember -- did you -- were you able to make any friends or was there just no time?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Well, we really couldn’t talk too much, because we bet -- watched so closely.</span> <span id="s448">You made friends and you didn’t make friends.</span> <span id="s449">One day you had friends, the next day they were gone.</span> <span id="s450">I was fortunate that I was with my aunt constantly, and we talked a lot, and specially at night, you know, after we got together, we talked a lot.</span> <span id="s451">But you couldn’t have friends because --</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Did you find any ways to have fun?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Huh?</span> <span id="s454">Fun?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s457">You know how I had fun?</span> <span id="s458">To aggravate the Germans.</span> <span id="s459">That was our fun.</span> <span id="s460">We would laugh so hard where we felt like crying, and they could not understand.</span> <span id="s461">And then we -- we would tell jokes, and we would laugh.</span> <span id="s462">Really, we didn't feel like laughing, but we did laugh.</span> <span id="s463">And that just about killed them.</span> <span id="s464">My God, you should be crying there, what are you laughing?</span> <span id="s465">You know.</span> <span id="s466">But if they got closer to you, you really shut up and you didn’t look at them.</span> <span id="s467">You turned your head.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Did you ever see them hit any o -- anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s470">I saw them hit people, I saw them kill people, a -- I saw them kill babies, and …for no reason.</span> <span id="s471">Really, sometimes you wonder how they could live with themselves, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s472">I think a lot of them were drunk.</span> <span id="s473">I really do.</span> <span id="s474">I did not realize that until I saw “Schindler’s List.”</span> <span id="s475">Then I saw there, I mean, they were drinking.</span> <span id="s476">I knew Goeth.</span> <span id="s477">Well, I’m getting ahead of myself already.</span> <span id="s478">But th-they must have been drunk, because they were yelling, yelling, yelling, my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: So you kept on working like this until --</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Like that day after day, whatever they ask me to do, I did.</span> <span id="s481">And then ’41 was the ghetto.</span> <span id="s482">We were notified we had to leave, so like in “Schindler’s List,” we grabbed a -- a bedsheet again, we dumped everything in there, in the suitcase, and you walk.</span> <span id="s483">And like I told you on the phone, when I saw that “Schindler’s List,” I was looking for myself in there because it was so real it -- to me it was a documentary, it was not just a movie.</span> <span id="s484">I was looking for my relatives, I was looking for my parents, I was looking for myself.</span> <span id="s485">And that was no picnic, five, six people in a little apartment where you barely had room even to sleep on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Was it just your family, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: My family and my relatives.</span> <span id="s488">And then that got smaller all the time.</span> <span id="s489">I mean, one day -- well, I’m getting ahead again, is -- no, we did the same thing there, we -- they -- we would march to work outside the ghetto, and did the same thing.</span> <span id="s490">We shoveled snow, we washed the streets.</span> <span id="s491">And the same yelling.</span> <span id="s492">There were different faces of -- watching us, but it seemed like they were all the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: So you were doing the same --</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: The same thing, until ’42, we got the job, my aunt got the job in Kabelwerk, and we marched from the ghetto to Kabelwerk every morning, it’s -- was a cable factory.</span> <span id="s495">And there were different departments there.</span> <span id="s496">I had to cover cables, I was in charge of 10 machines.</span> <span id="s497">And my aunt, they made -- what did she do?</span> <span id="s498">Oh, I can’t think of that word, you plug it in.</span> <span id="s499">You know what I’m talking about, a cord you plug in, those -- what you call them?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: [indecipherable] extension cord.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Extension cord?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Yeah, something like that, but you plug it in in outlets.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Like -- what’s that called?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Plug.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Plug?</span> <span id="s508">Okay.</span> <span id="s509">Well, she put those together, my aunt.</span> <span id="s510">It was a different department she worked in.</span> <span id="s511">And for morning we marched with the O.D. man, that was the Jewish police -- police and then we went back again.</span> <span id="s512">And then I think it was towards end of ’42, then we were concentrated in Plaszów, Potkish Plaszów, the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s513">And we went to work to Kabelwerk from Plaszów.</span> <span id="s514">And I only saw my parents twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Be -- before will -- you tell me about Plaszów, will you describe your -- your living quarters to me?</span> <span id="s516">I know you -- you said you were in very cramped conditions.</span> <span id="s517">Was -- was it cold, was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Well, it was always cold, and I don’t know what I looked like.</span> <span id="s519">There was no mirror, you know, but I looked at my aunt and I knew what I looked like, a skeleton.</span> <span id="s520">We were always cold, so all we wa -- wore are prison garb, and it was in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s521">Naturally you got cold, and Poland is cold.</span> <span id="s522">And then you had to stand appelle, they would count you and count you.</span> <span id="s523">They wanted to make sure that a half a person wasn’t missing or something.</span> <span id="s524">Sometimes it was for hours, just of meanness, til they got bored with it.</span> <span id="s525">The quarters, they were barracks, and with wooden slats, and you just -- there were bottom one, I think there were like a bunk, like a bunk -- you couldn’t call it bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: This is in -- in pla --</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: In Plaszów.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Plaszów.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Potkish Plaszów.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: What about in the -- what about in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: In the ghetto it was apartments.</span> <span id="s532">Still apartments, but overcrowded.</span> <span id="s533">Because the ghetto, at one time, people lived there.</span> <span id="s534">Before the ghetto, there were homes, you know.</span> <span id="s535">I mean, apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: And you -- you -- did you manage to get enough to eat during that time that you were in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Probably I did, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s538">We got the meal in Kabelwerk.</span> <span id="s539">The interesting thing was that the first time -- I always ate kosher, and when I start working in Kabelwerk they served us meals, and it was the same meal the Gentile workers got.</span> <span id="s540">So that wasn’t that bad, because had lots of vegetables in there.</span> <span id="s541">I don’t remember about meat now, maybe it did.</span> <span id="s542">And I wouldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s543">I came home and I barely dragged.</span> <span id="s544">My dad said, “What’s the matter?”</span> <span id="s545">We still were in the ghetto at that time.</span> <span id="s546">What’s a matter?</span> <span id="s547">I said, “Dad, I can’t eat that, they’re serving traif.”</span> <span id="s548">So it must have had meat in there also.</span> <span id="s549">And he said, “You have to eat.</span> <span id="s550">You have to have strength to survive this, you have to eat.”</span> <span id="s551">So the next day I ate and I couldn’t keep it down, I was throwing it all up.</span> <span id="s552">I came home and I dragged again.</span> <span id="s553">I told my dad, I said, “I can’t keep it down.”</span> <span id="s554">He said, “You have to eat, you have to force yourself.”</span> <span id="s555">And the third day I was glad to get it.</span> <span id="s556">So from that on, I start eating traif, and was lucky enough to get it, you know, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Were your parents working at Kabelwerk?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s559">Just my aunt and I, and I was promised that I -- if I would work in Kabelwerk that my aunt -- my parents would be safe in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s560">But naturally it was broken promises.</span> <span id="s561">So the liquidation of the ghetto was March the 13th, 1943.</span> <span id="s562">And my father got killed in the hospital -- schpital.</span> <span id="s563">What happened was, every so often in the ghetto, they were rounding up people to send them to concentration camps, and he -- they rounded him up on the street in the ghetto and he jumped out the window.</span> <span id="s564">And he fell -- he was going to run away and hide somewheres in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s565">And he fell, he broke his leg.</span> <span id="s566">So this was a makeshift hospital and they had some Jewish doctors who practiced -- I mean, they were doctors before the war.</span> <span id="s567">And he was in traction and -- his leg was in traction, was the last time I saw him.</span> <span id="s568">And he was shot in the hospital, because my cousin saw him, he was in the clean-up crew, and he saw him laying there on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s569">And there were pictures of my mother, and of me and my brother around him.</span> <span id="s570">But I didn’t know until I saw “Schindler’s List,” that they gave them poison.</span> <span id="s571">The nurses gave them poison.</span> <span id="s572">I did not know that, and I was thankful.</span> <span id="s573">Did you see it?</span> <span id="s574">They were grateful.</span> <span id="s575">The patients were grateful to get it, they were even smiling.</span> <span id="s576">Because you heard them downstairs already, yelling and screaming.</span> <span id="s577">And about the time they came up they start shooting, and they didn’t even notice that they were already dead.</span> <span id="s578">And I don’t know what happened to my mother, I thought my mother might have ended up in one of the concentration camps, but she might have been shot in the ghetto, because they would just shoot left and right.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Were you with her up until that day --</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: -- up until the day of deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s583">I was in the Kabelwerk at that time.</span> <span id="s584">I mean, I was working in Kabelwerk and after the liquidation of the ghetto, then they build barracks in Kabelwerk, and we were there.</span> <span id="s585">We were not walking to Plaszów any more.</span> <span id="s586">We were concentrated where the factory was.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: That was yu --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: That was til about September.</span> <span id="s589">This was, I think, May -- March ’43, until I think September ’43.</span> <span id="s590">We were concentrated in the factory where we worked.</span> <span id="s591">And that wasn’t that bad.</span> <span id="s592">The only upsetting thing I still remember is they supposed to have somebody come from Switzerland, a Red Cross representative come from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s593">And we had to clean the barracks, and we all got a care package, which we had to open but not touch.</span> <span id="s594">So when the representative from Switzerland came, he looked around, the barracks were clean and we all talked to him on the side, how bad it is, you know?</span> <span id="s595">And he was not very sympathetic.</span> <span id="s596">He said, “The barracks are clean.</span> <span id="s597">Look at the nice care package.</span> <span id="s598">What are you complaining?</span> <span id="s599">People are getting killed, there is a war going on, you got it good here.”</span> <span id="s600">So we told him, we said, “We ha-have to return those, we can’t even touch it.”</span> <span id="s601">The order was to open it up but not to touch it.</span> <span id="s602">And they took those care packages away.</span> <span id="s603">But it was so upsetting to us that he didn’t believe us, the representative from the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Before the ghetto was liq -- liquidated and you left, do you remember the last time you saw your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: The last time might have been maybe a month before.</span> <span id="s606">My aunt knew the O.D. man, the one used to march us from one place to another, and he had to be in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s607">And my aunt asked him whether he would take me along.</span> <span id="s608">So I marched with him, and he was yelling at me just because there were Germans around, you know, even going from one place to another.</span> <span id="s609">Now you walk straight, you know?</span> <span id="s610">And it might have been about a month before, I went to the hospit -- I went first and saw my mother.</span> <span id="s611">And my mother told me my dad was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s612">So I went to the hospital and I only had a very short time, I don’t remember exactly, maybe a whole hour or a half an hour, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s613">And my dad said -- he was so happy to see me, he was just smiling.</span> <span id="s614">And he had this leg in traction.</span> <span id="s615">So he said, “I want you to meet my doctor, he is such a nice man.”</span> <span id="s616">I said, “Dad, I have to go, I have to go.”</span> <span id="s617">They just gave me so much time, and I says, “I got to go,” and we hugged, and I kissed him and I was walking out and the doctor just walked in.</span> <span id="s618">And my dad said, “This is my daughter I have told you about.”</span> <span id="s619">I was dad’s little girl, always.</span> <span id="s620">And -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning of Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: This is tape two, side A of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green.</span> <span id="s622">And Mrs. Green, I’m -- I’m going to ask you to repeat the story that you were telling about your vit -- your last visit with your father in the hospital in the Kraków ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Ghetto -- yeah.</span> <span id="s624">Do you want me to hold it -- or you holding -- ah, the last visit, I went into the ghetto, an O.D. man had to go to the ghetto and he was a good friend of my aunts, and so my aunt asked him to take me along so I could see my parents.</span> <span id="s625">And so we marched and he was yelling at me.</span> <span id="s626">I knew he was just doing that, you know, for the other Germans around, the ones who would walk.</span> <span id="s627">And as we entered the ghetto, I went to my mother’s place first and then she told me that my father was in the hospital, and I went to see my dad and he was so happy to see me, because I always was daddy’s little girl.</span> <span id="s628">And we talked for awhile, and he had his leg in traction and he told me what happened, how he broke the leg, that he jumped out the window because they were rounding them up to send them to gas chambers.</span> <span id="s629">And well, we talked for awhile, and then I said Dad, I have to go -- well, I called him Papa.</span> <span id="s630">We called the father Papa.</span> <span id="s631">I have to go because so and so, the O.D. man, I can’t remember his name now, I have to go back with him.</span> <span id="s632">And he said, “Oh, I wanted you to meet my doctor so badly.”</span> <span id="s633">And I start walking out and the doctor walked in.</span> <span id="s634">And my dad smiled, “This is her, this is Sylvia.</span> <span id="s635">I have told you so much about it.”</span> <span id="s636">And the doctor said, “I’m so glad to meet you, he’s talking about you all the time.”</span> <span id="s637">And we exchanged pleasantries, I don’t know exactly what, and my dad and I, we hugged, and we kissed.</span> <span id="s638">And I walked out and I met the O.D. man and this was the last time -- might have been maybe a month or a few weeks before the liquidation of the ghetto, and I’m really happy I had the chance to go there to see my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: And your mother?</span> <span id="s640">Do you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I -- I don’t know what happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s642">I saw in the paper that the Red Cross has a new list, they found it somewhere, some -- in Russia, which they kept under cover for years and years.</span> <span id="s643">And I went to the Red Cross here in Winchester and she asked some background information and I gave it to her, and she said, maybe you be lucky that you can find out what happened to your mother and then my aunt’s husband and my aunt’s daughter.</span> <span id="s644">And they haven’t found out.</span> <span id="s645">I got the -- she couldn’t find out anything and then I also got the letter from Baltimore, they could not trace what happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s646">I always thought she ended up maybe in Auschwitz or Treblinka or somewheres.</span> <span id="s647">But after I saw “Schindler’s List,” I saw they were shooting like crazy.</span> <span id="s648">I mean, it’s not what your looks was, they was just shouting and shooting, going crazy, so I don’t know whether she was shot in the ghetto, what happened to her, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Do you remember the last time you saw her, or close to the last --</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: That was the last time, when I saw my dad that was the last time, about a month or two weeks before the liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s651">The ghetto was like --</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: She was there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Yes, yeah, I went to her place first and she told me my dad was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s654">I was looking for him, you know, when I went there, I thought I was going to see both of them.</span> <span id="s655">So that was the last time.</span> <span id="s656">And that was ’43, and my mother was born ’87, that would make them 53 years old.</span> <span id="s657">And you know my dad never even had a cold?</span> <span id="s658">I don’t remember ma -- he had -- he only missed work one time I recall.</span> <span id="s659">He had an abscess on his chest and my brother cleaned it out and it got infected.</span> <span id="s660">My da -- my dad thought he was dying, he never was sick.</span> <span id="s661">He didn’t know how to handle it, you know?</span> <span id="s662">He went to bed.</span> <span id="s663">He never was sick and he got killed, and he only was 53 years old.</span> <span id="s664">Nice looking man.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Are you -- you had mentioned the -- the O.D., the -- those were the Jewish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Jewish policemen, kapo, O.D., Jewish policemen.</span> <span id="s667">Some of them were pretty mean also if they thought they would get a better treatment when they mistreated us.</span> <span id="s668">Some were pretty rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Did you ever get beaten yourself by Germans or --</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No.</span> <span id="s671">I got beaten one time, 25, by -- that was in Plaszów, Potkish Plaszów, the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s672">It was in a barrack and it was the one who was in charge of the barrack, and I got 25 paddles.</span> <span id="s673">There was a bad odor in that neighborhood where -- where I was on the double decker wooden thing where were laying, and somebody had their period or something, and they put some -- it wasn’t pads, it was something, and pushed it over where I was sleeping, and she said it was mine, it didn’t happen to be mine, I got 25 paddles.</span> <span id="s674">But that, I think was the only time.</span> <span id="s675">My aunt always told me, don’t walk erect.</span> <span id="s676">Make yourself shorter, you know, that you wouldn't stand out.</span> <span id="s677">And I always knew, wherever I went I just walk like that.</span> <span id="s678">So at so -- some -- some girls got raped.</span> <span id="s679">And I was pretty fortunate, but I wasn’t much to look at, because all those years already took its toll at a very young age.</span> <span id="s680">And I was still in the developing age, you know, when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Do you remember the deportations that happened before the ghetto was liquidated?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: No, I was not in the ghetto when it was liquidated.</span> <span id="s683">So I don’t know anything, it’s just what I heard, that all was hearsay.</span> <span id="s684">And my cousin was in the clean-up crew and he saw my father there, and he told me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: You mentioned that wa -- as you were working at Kabelwerk --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Kabelwerk, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: -- you were in charge of 10 machines.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: 10 machines, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: And were you supervising other workers at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s691">I was in charge of all 10 machines and there was another person, another 10 machines and then in the back of you there were 10 machines and they had to be in operation at all times.</span> <span id="s692">If not, a si -- the thing was it was a very fine but strong thread but if something went wrong and it skipped a stitch, you had to cut that open and -- and do it again.</span> <span id="s693">I mean, you really had to watch it so it’d be evenly covered.</span> <span id="s694">And there for awhile, I just worked daytimes.</span> <span id="s695">But then, you worked one week 12 hours, daytime and the following week 12 hours nighttime.</span> <span id="s696">And they did this on purpose, because you never could sleep.</span> <span id="s697">I mean, there was no way to get adjusted from one to another.</span> <span id="s698">So, well, we were sent back to Potkish Plaszów, September ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: When you say sent back, you meant -- you had been there before?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s701">I was in Plaszów -- I was in Plaszów and we walked from Plaszów to Kabelwerk, from Plaszów.</span> <span id="s702">And then they concentrated us in Kabelwerk for a short time, and then -- but -- but the time we s -- were sent back to Plaszów, we did not work in Kabelwerk any more.</span> <span id="s703">This was September ’43.</span> <span id="s704">And when I got there, well, we had to work in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s705">We had to open graves, pull out gold teeth.</span> <span id="s706">And the people who were in charge of this place were prisoners, German prisoners.</span> <span id="s707">And they were completely out of control.</span> <span id="s708">I mean, they were murderers, they -- they were in prison because they were murderers from way before the war, and they let them out to -- to oversee us.</span> <span id="s709">And the guy’s name Hammond, oh wow, he was crazy.</span> <span id="s710">He really was crazy.</span> <span id="s711">I saw Goeth many times and as soon as we heard he was walking through the camp, I was running away, because we knew he was target shooting, he didn’t care what you looked like.</span> <span id="s712">He was just target shooting.</span> <span id="s713">He wanted to see how close he could shoot or how far he could shoot.</span> <span id="s714">And Schindler was with him many times.</span> <span id="s715">And they were drinking buddies.</span> <span id="s716">And I really don’t think Schindler -- well, he saved a lot of Jews, and like they say, who saves one life, saves the world.</span> <span id="s717">But I can guarantee you this man did not start out to save the Jews.</span> <span id="s718">He started out to -- to fill his pockets.</span> <span id="s719">And somehow, I think towards the end, he found out that it’s a losing war they fighting.</span> <span id="s720">So he changed his mind.</span> <span id="s721">But thank God he did, because he saved a lot of Jews.</span> <span id="s722">But this was terrible, I mean in the Plaszów, whether we had to go outside and load railroad tracks again, or in -- if we worked inside, then we had to dig -- I mean, open the graves and pull out the golden teeth, or we carried barracks.</span> <span id="s723">They were always building barracks and we had to -- to carry that stuff.</span> <span id="s724">And really my legs are my weakest, my -- my health problem are my legs.</span> <span id="s725">You can’t work like dog -- like a man and not come out scarred.</span> <span id="s726">So we were there until -- oh, I didn’t tell you about my cousin, Janek Kalbenstok.</span> <span id="s727">When we came back in September ’43, people were telling me about my cousin Janek.</span> <span id="s728">He and a little boy were walking in the concentration camp, and evidently Goeth was walking towards him, and my little cousin Janek had a habit, he drove his mother crazy.</span> <span id="s729">When he was upset, he would whistle.</span> <span id="s730">He didn’t even know he did this.</span> <span id="s731">And somebody told me that he was whistling -- whistling that -- it was a Russian song, or -- or a French anthem, I don’t know, I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s732">And they arrested him right there, in ’43.</span> <span id="s733">And they built a gallow to hang him, all night long.</span> <span id="s734">And the next day they brought him out to hang him.</span> <span id="s735">They made his father sit in the front row, my oncl -- Uncle Henek Kalbenstok.</span> <span id="s736">And the rope broke.</span> <span id="s737">So he sent somebody for new rope and my poor little cousin must have been just scared to death and he was crawling up to Goeth’s foot and kissing his boot.</span> <span id="s738">And they said that he was just hissing.</span> <span id="s739">Goeth took the gun out and shot him right there.</span> <span id="s740">My uncle saw it and he had a complete stroke.</span> <span id="s741">Never came back from it because when I went up there, I went to see him in Plaszów, in that concentration camp where it all happened.</span> <span id="s742">He was just a vegetable.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: How old was your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: He was younger than I am.</span> <span id="s745">I really don’t know exactly, maybe four or five years younger.</span> <span id="s746">This was in ’43, I was 19, he might have been 15 -- 14 or 15, I don’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Had you known him?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: I did not know them very well, because I was born and raised in Germany, and I was not in Poland, I think maybe about a couple times.</span> <span id="s749">My mother went to visit, but she didn’t take us children.</span> <span id="s750">Somehow you take children more now than you used to, it seems like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: What kept you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Well, this is interesting question.</span> <span id="s753">I don’t know really what kept me going.</span> <span id="s754">The only thing my aunt and I, we talked all the time, and other people, too.</span> <span id="s755">Somebody hads -- hads to survive to tell the world.</span> <span id="s756">We did not know that the world knew about it.</span> <span id="s757">We thought everybody was just ignorant about it, you know, they did not know.</span> <span id="s758">And I don’t know if -- don’t ask me whether -- people say you must have been very healthy.</span> <span id="s759">I wasn’t any healthier than the ones who died next to me, because I had typhus for two weeks, I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s760">I was so sick and we had to stand appelle, and they would drag me out, which I did not know, and they -- they stood me up, holding me up.</span> <span id="s761">The only thing I can think of is, my time was not up.</span> <span id="s762">Somebody still had some purpose, and also, I don’t know, maybe it was a strong will to live, to tell the world.</span> <span id="s763">But my world crumbled pretty quick after I came to the United States, when I found out the world did know, and didn’t do a thing about it.</span> <span id="s764">And maybe it was lucky I didn’t know, because I am pretty sure I would have given up.</span> <span id="s765">My aunt would have given up.</span> <span id="s766">My aunt was just like my mother.</span> <span id="s767">We were just constantly together.</span> <span id="s768">Really, by yourself you could not survive.</span> <span id="s769">You had to have somebody to care for.</span> <span id="s770">Your back’s hurting now?</span> <span id="s771">Okay?</span> <span id="s772">You had to have somebody to care for, and she did.</span> <span id="s773">The ration of bread we got, she want to share with me her portion.</span> <span id="s774">“I’m really not very hungry Sylvia, why don’t you take this?”</span> <span id="s775">I just couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s776">I said, “Minna, I don’t want it.”</span> <span id="s777">I said, “You just want me to have it because you know I’m so hungry.”</span> <span id="s778">“No, no, no, honest.</span> <span id="s779">I just can’t eat another bite, I’m just not hungry.”</span> <span id="s780">That was my aunt, God bless her.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Did you have faith at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: I didn’t have much religion all during the war, and after the war, oh God, I was bitter.</span> <span id="s783">I blamed God what happened, and why.</span> <span id="s784">And I still got a lot of whys.</span> <span id="s785">Thank God, I got over the bitterness.</span> <span id="s786">The bitterness doesn’t work, it eats you up alive.</span> <span id="s787">And it’s -- it doesn’t harm the people you hate.</span> <span id="s788">It -- I couldn’t even talk German after the war, a complete blank.</span> <span id="s789">I blocked it out.</span> <span id="s790">And my brother told me, “Sylvia,” he said, “the German language is beautiful.”</span> <span id="s791">I said, “The German language?”</span> <span id="s792">I connected it with Hitler, it’s not beautiful, it’s terrible.</span> <span id="s793">And then to meet people who had anything to do with Germany or German descent, I had to run away.</span> <span id="s794">And this kind man helped.</span> <span id="s795">He was so kind, because I just wanted to shut the door and that’s it, not think about it, and -- when I got married.</span> <span id="s796">And even after, I was an atheist, I didn’t believe in anything.</span> <span id="s797">I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s798">And -- so after I got married, I still did not talk about it to anybody.</span> <span id="s799">It was like I was ashamed of it, like some of it was my fault, you know?</span> <span id="s800">And I knew it wasn’t, but somehow I just couldn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s801">And then it was a small town, with not many Jewish people.</span> <span id="s802">I already had one monkey on my head to be a Jew in a small town.</span> <span id="s803">And -- but the door would not stay shut, when I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s804">And then it all came back, the nightmares, and waking up screaming -- not waking up -- oh, excuse me -- screaming in my dreams.</span> <span id="s805">Sobbing wet.</span> <span id="s806">Jake would wake me up, and we would come in and we sit for hours and I had to start talking.</span> <span id="s807">And this man sat next to me.</span> <span id="s808">I don’t know whether he listened what I said, or what, but his ear was there and that’s what I needed.</span> <span id="s809">So I was pretty lucky to have a wonderful husband.</span> <span id="s810">And the children are great, they really are.</span> <span id="s811">They loving, very loving.</span> <span id="s812">I h -- said that in the documentary, I did not want to raise them full of hatred.</span> <span id="s813">In fact, they didn’t know much about the Holocaust til I made that documentary.</span> <span id="s814">I want them to -- want to raise them healthy, happy and -- physically and mentally.</span> <span id="s815">And they got problems, I mean everybody’s got problems, but the problems are not connected with my past, because I did set myself a goal that if I failed, then Hitler had won out, and he didn’t, because they’re loving children, they really are big hearts.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Let’s go --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: But well, September -- January.</span> <span id="s818">January ’44.</span> <span id="s819">Naturally we had to line up, we had to be counted.</span> <span id="s820">And they were telling us we were going to a wonderful place.</span> <span id="s821">There’s going to be clean beds and plenty food.</span> <span id="s822">You’re gonna work hard, but you’re gonna have it good.</span> <span id="s823">And my aunt said, “Wow, it sounds like paradise,” you know.</span> <span id="s824">And then we were crammed into cattle wagon.</span> <span id="s825">And Kraków -- Auschwitz is not that far from Kraków but it tuck -- took such a long time because the train stopped every few feet because the planes were bombing.</span> <span id="s826">And before we got into the cattle wagon, they gave us some bread, and that was all.</span> <span id="s827">And there was a container with water, and one container for the bathroom.</span> <span id="s828">And they stopped, and gosh were we pray -- praying.</span> <span id="s829">Yeah, they jumped out the -- the -- the trains, and they were hiding in ditches, the German.</span> <span id="s830">And we were laughing, we really were laughing.</span> <span id="s831">There was a little window up in top those cattle wagons, the old ones.</span> <span id="s832">And we would get on each other’s shoulder to lift them up to see so we could get a good laugh, cause they were so scared.</span> <span id="s833">And we yelled, “Bomb us, bomb us, come on."</span> <span id="s834">You know, we didn’t care.</span> <span id="s835">We really didn’t care, as long as they would have gotten killed.</span> <span id="s836">And then we went a little bit longer.</span> <span id="s837">To me it seemed like we went the whole week, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s838">But you see, a time was -- didn’t seem important at all.</span> <span id="s839">It was just running into a day or night, til the cattle wagons stopped, they opened the doors, and they were yelling.</span> <span id="s840">Out, out, out, out, out.</span> <span id="s841">Kicking and dogs, and we were running.</span> <span id="s842">And then we looked and we knew where we were, because we saw the chimneys burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: You had heard about Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s845">Everybody heard about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s846">And you could smell it, the smell of human flesh.</span> <span id="s847">So, you know how they kept the records so neat, you know, they had to have orders.</span> <span id="s848">They didn't have any orders.</span> <span id="s849">We arrived without orders, they didn’t know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s850">So we were sitting there or standing there, between the ovens, near the gate when they opened.</span> <span id="s851">And on the other side were the barracks.</span> <span id="s852">And you sat there for 48 hours.</span> <span id="s853">And they were running like crazy.</span> <span id="s854">They couldn’t get any orders, they didn’t know whether we end up in the -- should end up in the gas chamber, or at the camp.</span> <span id="s855">And we just sat.</span> <span id="s856">And it was cold, it was January.</span> <span id="s857">And finally, there still were no orders, but then we took a -- I guess they were afraid to send us to the ovens if the orders came that we should not been killed, they couldn’t bring us back after they once gassed us, you know.</span> <span id="s858">So then they told us to go into showers, and we took the shower, naturally there’s never enough water.</span> <span id="s859">And then we walked out in the nude in January in Poland, shivering.</span> <span id="s860">And then we got prison garbs.</span> <span id="s861">And they gave me wooden shoes, and they made me wear those shoes.</span> <span id="s862">I couldn’t walk in thats -- in the shoes.</span> <span id="s863">It seemed like the shoes had a mind of their own.</span> <span id="s864">And then they put us in barracks.</span> <span id="s865">And about -- well, we didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s866">You just laid there, or you stood there.</span> <span id="s867">And we were there about 12 or 14 days, too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: This is tape two, side B of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green.</span> <span id="s870">Did they -- did they give you a tattoo when you arrived at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: No, no, in Auschwitz -- and I found that out later on, that you had to work there before they tattooed your arm, and we didn't work there.</span> <span id="s872">We just were there 12 - 14 days, and we didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s873">One time we got black coffee, whatever it was, it was awful, in the morning.</span> <span id="s874">And we had to carry -- they were heavy kettles.</span> <span id="s875">And in the evening you got the water soup.</span> <span id="s876">So I remember that very well, it was my turn to go.</span> <span id="s877">And some other girls also went and coming back and we were almost our barrack and those stupid wooden shoes wouldn’t stay on my feet, and I dropped the kettle and our whole supper was there.</span> <span id="s878">Really was scared that the people gonna kill me, the hungry people, you know, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s879">We just all lay down and we licked the floor, whatever fell there.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Did they shave your hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Already, partially, every so often it was shaved, the hair.</span> <span id="s882">It was already very short before we went in Auschwitz, and then in Auschwitz they shaved it again and delouse them, they sprayed you.</span> <span id="s883">And they deloused you, yes, was some kind of powder they did, they -- they sprayed you with.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Were you still with your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s886">We were liberated together.</span> <span id="s887">Let’s see, after about 12 or 14 days in Auschwitz, we were shipped back in the cattle wagon to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s888">And when we got to -- I think it was still January ’44, because we were, pretty much, one of the first ones there.</span> <span id="s889">When we came to Bergen-Belsen they had nothing but tents.</span> <span id="s890">And then there was a big storm one night and it was quiet.</span> <span id="s891">There was no shouting and it was very quiet in comparison to Auschwitz, there was so commotion constantly.</span> <span id="s892">It was very quiet and my aunt said, “You know, Sylvia, in comparison to Auschwitz, this is a vacation.”</span> <span id="s893">But we didn’t know that was -- there was no gas chambers, but it was starvation camp.</span> <span id="s894">They just starved you to death.</span> <span id="s895">So there weren't that many people, but then we had a big storm and it knocked all the tents down and they moved us to barracks.</span> <span id="s896">And they were looking for somebody who spoke a lot of languages, so I applied for it.</span> <span id="s897">I spoke German fluently.</span> <span id="s898">By that time already I spoke Polish fluently but couldn't read or write it, because when you’re young you pick up languages.</span> <span id="s899">They said I spoke it with a heavy accent.</span> <span id="s900">So I applied for it, and I -- I knew about three words of French, or maybe five words and two words of Russian.</span> <span id="s901">So I got the job, not very long though, but enough that I had the foot in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s902">And so I could steal food so my aunt wouldn’t be hungry.</span> <span id="s903">So there were Jewish people working in the kitchen and some Russian soldiers working in the kitchen and there were three Frenchmen.</span> <span id="s904">They were college students and they worked with the underground Gentiles and they got caught.</span> <span id="s905">So they were funny, they were so funny.</span> <span id="s906">They all spoke German and wouldn’t let the German know that they spoke German.</span> <span id="s907">And they would sing, and they would sing the French anthem.</span> <span id="s908">And they would laugh, and they made us laugh.</span> <span id="s909">But the Russian people, we had to stay away from them.</span> <span id="s910">When we stole food, we didn’t tell on each other, but the Russians told on us when they saw us stealing food.</span> <span id="s911">They kept to themselves pretty much.</span> <span id="s912">We were afraid of them.</span> <span id="s913">So, well, I got typhus in Bergen-Belsen and Paul LaPietra, one of the Frenchmen stole food and send it to the camp.</span> <span id="s914">So by the time I got the food, there wasn’t that much food left because she shared it with other people, but evidently it must have helped some.</span> <span id="s915">And when I got better after two weeks, I noticed that I -- I didn’t have any shoes, I don’t know what happened to them, my shoes.</span> <span id="s916">And I told the girl, I said, “I can’t go back to work in the kitchen without shoes.”</span> <span id="s917">So Paul LaPietra stole some man’s boots and send it to the camp with a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s918">And after I went back to the kitchen, those three Frenchmen hoisted me up on their shoulder and they were marching and they were singing la mar -- what is that?</span> <span id="s919">La Marseille, th-the French anthem.</span> <span id="s920">Oh, the German, I’m telling you, they would get so red and yell.</span> <span id="s921">And we say, your gonna have a stroke, he’s gonna have a stroke, but no, not such luck.</span> <span id="s922">And we were liberated April the 14th.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Before --</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: ’45.</span> <span id="s925">It was really strange.</span> <span id="s926">By that time I wasn’t working in the kitchen any more, nobody was working anywheres, because there was no food.</span> <span id="s927">And they already knew that they were in bad shape because the guards were disappearing there.</span> <span id="s928">And they came back.</span> <span id="s929">There was no place for them to go.</span> <span id="s930">We didn’t know that, they were surrounded by the Russians, by the British and by the Americans, and there was no place to run around.</span> <span id="s931">So they were digging ditches.</span> <span id="s932">And oh, they were angry.</span> <span id="s933">I’m telling you, you couldn’t even set the foot out.</span> <span id="s934">If not, you got shot.</span> <span id="s935">So we stayed pretty much indoors, and everybody was sick.</span> <span id="s936">No energy, no water, no food.</span> <span id="s937">And then I got dysentery problems again.</span> <span id="s938">I went out one night to relieve myself and felt something cold I was sitting on, and I looked and it was a body, and I just moved over.</span> <span id="s939">I mean, you got -- evidently you got conditioned to that.</span> <span id="s940">I mean, just thinking about it, it blows my mind, you know?</span> <span id="s941">And I crawled back in.</span> <span id="s942">So one night, it was between 14th and 15th the night, or was early in the morning, we heard the -- heard a lot of tanks, rolling and rolling and rolling.</span> <span id="s943">We didn’t know what was the matter.</span> <span id="s944">And it was morning and somebody came running in, we are liberated, we are liberated.</span> <span id="s945">And they said, by the British army, we are liberated.</span> <span id="s946">Well, I crawled out there, and my aunt went out there, too.</span> <span id="s947">I said, “What are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s948">The German commandoes, they were standing in front of the tanks.</span> <span id="s949">They tied them down there evidently, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s950">And they -- with no medals, they stripped them of all the medals, but I didn’t see that.</span> <span id="s951">I still saw the Nazis.</span> <span id="s952">I said, “What you talking about, here they are.”</span> <span id="s953">And then we found out we were liberated, and I stood up and I start singing the British anthem, God Bless the King.</span> <span id="s954">I remember that from school.</span> <span id="s955">And oh, there was such, so much commotion going on, they were so wonderful.</span> <span id="s956">And they gave us care packages.</span> <span id="s957">We didn’t know how to handle those care packages, we ate everything.</span> <span id="s958">And that’s why so many died.</span> <span id="s959">On that starvation diet for so many years and then you drank cocoa, I mean the powder, and coffee, smoked cigarettes, chocolate.</span> <span id="s960">All at one time and sardines.</span> <span id="s961">They meant well, I mean, they didn’t mean any harm.</span> <span id="s962">But I think the ler -- that the world learned from that.</span> <span id="s963">Whatever prisoners come back, they kind of condition them slowly with food.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Let’s go back a little bit to before liberation, and you mentioned that -- that you had typhus.</span> <span id="s965">And I remember earlier you had said that you -- you -- you had to go out to roll call every day and other people were holding you up.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Yeah, I don’t -- I didn’t -- I don’t remember two weeks, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s967">I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s968">They told me -- you see, the thing about it is, they had to have a certain amount.</span> <span id="s969">They had the number there and that number had to satisfy them.</span> <span id="s970">Well, they dragged me out, and somebody called, you said, one, two, three, you know, you -- you called your own number, so somebody must have called a number for me.</span> <span id="s971">If not they’d be still standing there today.</span> <span id="s972">I mean, it had to be like to say 550, it had to 550.</span> <span id="s973">If not, they went back in the barracks [indecipherable] they counted the dead.</span> <span id="s974">So they told me that they dragged me out every day and when it came -- I mean, that’s a lot of people, that’s you know, lined up, that probably when it came to me, they just held me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Do you know if you were in a hospital that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: No, I was not in the hosp -- there was no hospital there.</span> <span id="s977">After the war they made a hospital where Himmler’s palace was in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s978">He had the palace there, and they made this into a hospital.</span> <span id="s979">The ones who were so sick, they took them there.</span> <span id="s980">But by that time I was -- I wasn't that sick any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: How did you get better?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s983">I don’t know, the grace of God, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s984">I told you my time wasn’t up, I guess I had to have those beautiful babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: And your aunt, was she working?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: In the camp, no.</span> <span id="s987">I stole food while I was in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s988">But then, there were times we just laid there.</span> <span id="s989">She had typhus before I had it, even.</span> <span id="s990">My aunt.</span> <span id="s991">Everybody had typhus.</span> <span id="s992">It’s a dysentery, but to get well, it’s hard to explain with any antibiotics or anything, because now you hear about typhus, e-everybody died.</span> <span id="s993">It was like cholera, you know, long time ago people died, not many survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Did you have the sense around that time that -- that the end of the war was coming close and that you were going to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: No.</span> <span id="s996">That’d be too much thinking, I didn't have the energy.</span> <span id="s997">I think I told you that early in that interview.</span> <span id="s998">You did what you supposed to do and you did it, and hour went into hour, into day and night, it -- there was no difference.</span> <span id="s999">No, I never did, I -- the only thing, like sometimes we would sit around and be miserable, and then somebody would say, you know on Shabbas, Friday night?</span> <span id="s1000">Boy, my mother set a table fit for a king.</span> <span id="s1001">What did she cook?</span> <span id="s1002">Well, there was fish and chicken soup and chicken and roast beef and vegetables and dessert.</span> <span id="s1003">And somebody would pop up, that’s enough food, I can’t eat another bite.</span> <span id="s1004">Do you know really, I’m not kidding, we could taste that food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Did you have other fantasies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: No.</span> <span id="s1007">Just blank.</span> <span id="s1008">Just a zombie.</span> <span id="s1009">And I don’t think I was the only one, I think everybody was that way.</span> <span id="s1010">I was so conditioned from the time I was nine years old, until the end of the war, that -- the only thing many times you ask yourself why, why, why.</span> <span id="s1011">I still ask myself now, why?</span> <span id="s1012">I said, when my time comes, I’m gonna have a list that long.</span> <span id="s1013">And I’m -- when I get upstairs I’m gonna ask him, maybe he can -- why this, why that, you know.</span> <span id="s1014">But you know what’s very upsetting to me?</span> <span id="s1015">The world didn’t learn anything by it.</span> <span id="s1016">If the ler -- the world just would have learned something by it.</span> <span id="s1017">Look that ethnic cleansing now.</span> <span id="s1018">They’re killing babies.</span> <span id="s1019">So I feel like that whole thing was a waste.</span> <span id="s1020">At least if people would have learned by it.</span> <span id="s1021">But they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: Do you remember at liberation, and you -- you suddenly saw -- realized that you were liberated --</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: -- and you were inspired to just sing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1026">Oh yeah, at the national an -- th-the British, God Save the King.</span> <span id="s1027">I met a British soldier and I still remembered, whoever lives gonna get in touch with Erbachs in Lexington, Kentucky.</span> <span id="s1028">So I told him about -- I had about two years of English, and I didn’t do too well, but I still have the letter here.</span> <span id="s1029">I’ve -- I was going to pull it out and show it to you.</span> <span id="s1030">I wrote to Erbachs in Lexington, Kentucky, but we couldn’t mail, I mean there was no mail going between Germany and -- and America at that time, and I gave it to that British soldier I met, and he sent this letter to his mother in England, and his mother, or his parents forwarded that -- that letter to America, to lex -- Erbachs, Lexington, Kentucky.</span> <span id="s1031">And at that time Lexington, Kentucky was small.</span> <span id="s1032">There were about 65,000 people.</span> <span id="s1033">So everybody knew each other, so it got there, just Leon Erbach, Lexington, Kentucky, United S -- U.S.A..</span> <span id="s1034">So my brother was in the American army.</span> <span id="s1035">He ga -- Erbach sent him an affidavit from England to come to the United States in 1940, and he was drafted in ’41.</span> <span id="s1036">So, he was still serving in the American army, he was with Intelligence, he spoke seven languages fluently.</span> <span id="s1037">And Erbachs got in touch with him.</span> <span id="s1038">And he came to Bergen-Belsen and I think I told you that previously, when they came running in telling me that my brother was out there, and I run out and all in a sudden I just stopped.</span> <span id="s1039">I thought my dad was there, because they look so much alike.</span> <span id="s1040">So then he took us to Munich, he was stationed in Munich.</span> <span id="s1041">My brother was stationed in Munich.</span> <span id="s1042">And he sent the ambulance after us.</span> <span id="s1043">I think was around October ’45.</span> <span id="s1044">When he came to the camp, he brought oranges, food.</span> <span id="s1045">And oh, we -- we just had a party.</span> <span id="s1046">And my brother said, “I just bought that for you and Aunt Minna.”</span> <span id="s1047">I said, “I can’t eat that by myself, not sharing it, what you talking about?”</span> <span id="s1048">He didn't understand.</span> <span id="s1049">You know, you’re hungry together, you party together.</span> <span id="s1050">So it was good food, it really was.</span> <span id="s1051">And he rented an apartment in Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: When you saw him and he arrived at Bergen-Belsen and you -- you thought it was your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: It was scary.</span> <span id="s1054">That’s why I -- I t -- I couldn’t talk.</span> <span id="s1055">I just stood there like paralyzed.</span> <span id="s1056">Even had -- had the moustache like my dad, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Did you have a feeling of -- of s -- of sadness, or of joy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: I had no feeling, I just looked.</span> <span id="s1059">I t -- I knew my dad was killed and I thought my dad was standing there.</span> <span id="s1060">It wasn’t sadness, I just couldn’t understand it, you know?</span> <span id="s1061">They look so much alike, almost like twins.</span> <span id="s1062">And then I was very happy.</span> <span id="s1063">You know, we just grabbed, and we hugged, and -- he went through his own hell, because he went in my place to England and all during the war that was on his mind.</span> <span id="s1064">He told me, he said, “I’m so happy that you are alive.</span> <span id="s1065">I don’t know how I would have managed to -- to live, to know that you got killed and I’m alive.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Had you thought about him much through those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Yeah, my mother would talk.</span> <span id="s1068">I wonder how Bernard is getting along, you know, but that’s -- we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1069">I hope he’s doing okay.</span> <span id="s1070">But we knew at that time he was in England, we didn’t know he came to America.</span> <span id="s1071">But we felt like he was safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: So you went to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: We went to Munich and he could have -- he was discharged about -- we came in June, he was discharged about two or three months before and he could have come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1074">So he signed up as a civilian for another six months, because he wanted us -- he wanted for us to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1075">He was afraid that we weren’t pushy enough, probably, you know.</span> <span id="s1076">And so he stayed and he took care of all the papers, and we got out but -- ba -- June, we arrived in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Would you stay -- say you were still feeling numb about everything that had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Well, you come to a strange country, you scared.</span> <span id="s1079">People you didn’t know -- all right, the Erbachs were related to my aunt, but they were no relations to me.</span> <span id="s1080">No, I was -- wasn’t feeling numb then.</span> <span id="s1081">I was angry.</span> <span id="s1082">I was full of hatred.</span> <span id="s1083">I think it brought -- I brought this up before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: I’m sorry, how long had you been in Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: From October ’45, until June ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: And what did you do while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Go crazy, go wild.</span> <span id="s1088">Eat, drink, bleach your hair blonde.</span> <span id="s1089">Peroxide my hair.</span> <span id="s1090">We didn’t know whether to walk on our heads, we didn’t know whether to walk on our feet.</span> <span id="s1091">I mean, all of that freedom, all in a sudden, listen, that’s -- that’s overpowering.</span> <span id="s1092">And my brother brought a lot of food home from -- oh, what you call that?</span> <span id="s1093">A mess hall or something.</span> <span id="s1094">Is it called mess hall, I think?</span> <span id="s1095">Brought a lot of food, and all his friends brought food.</span> <span id="s1096">I guess they felt so sorry for us, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: And you didn’t have to do any work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: No.</span> <span id="s1099">No, no, he took care of us.</span> <span id="s1100">Well, the strangest thing.</span> <span id="s1101">He got that apartment f-for us, and he just told the Germans to get out.</span> <span id="s1102">And they were crying and they were crying, that’s our apartment, how we c -- we been living here.</span> <span id="s1103">And he was not very sympathetic.</span> <span id="s1104">He told them they had to get out, and some of his friends also.</span> <span id="s1105">We got the apartment.</span> <span id="s1106">So while we already lived in -- in that apartment, they came, ringing the doorbell.</span> <span id="s1107">We want to move back.</span> <span id="s1108">This is our apartment.</span> <span id="s1109">So, I was so angry, I said, “What are you talking about?</span> <span id="s1110">I like to see my parents, too.</span> <span id="s1111">What did you do to them?”</span> <span id="s1112">I wasn’t -- we weren’t very sympathetic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: And they just left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Yeah, they left, and they came back two, three days later on.</span> <span id="s1115">Looking back now, I’m -- I mean, they were -- it was theirs, you know, but look what they did t-to us.</span> <span id="s1116">I mean, the one they killed, you couldn’t bring those back, could you?</span> <span id="s1117">And this was only material things.</span> <span id="s1118">But I told you I was angry.</span> <span id="s1119">It was just all bundled up, you know, and all in a sudden it just had to explode.</span> <span id="s1120">But Munich was great, really was.</span> <span id="s1121">We went to museums and we went to concerts, we went to the opera.</span> <span id="s1122">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: So when -- when you were in Munich you -- you -- you were angry, but you were also having fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Oh, I was having fun, and I’m not the only one, I mean, everybody had fun.</span> <span id="s1125">Somebody said, oh y -- I used to be a blonde as a child, kind of golden blonde.</span> <span id="s1126">Oh, you got brown eyes.</span> <span id="s1127">Blonde hair and brown eyes is unusual.</span> <span id="s1128">How about bleaching?</span> <span id="s1129">So it -- they used peroxide.</span> <span id="s1130">And I came to the United States as a blonde.</span> <span id="s1131">And then there was a museum, was kind of meeting place of the survivors.</span> <span id="s1132">And once in awhile you would meet some which you knew.</span> <span id="s1133">I mean, you met people all the time, so you couldn’t remember everybody, you know?</span> <span id="s1134">But sometimes you run across somebody and oh, you are here, you are here.</span> <span id="s1135">You know, you survived that.</span> <span id="s1136">And we grabbed and we hugged, and we were wild.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: You made new friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: In Munich?</span> <span id="s1139">No, not really.</span> <span id="s1140">I mean, people a -- was together.</span> <span id="s1141">Then I was with my brother a lot.</span> <span id="s1142">My aunt was with us constantly.</span> <span id="s1143">You see, the -- my aunt was my best friend.</span> <span id="s1144">There was nothing I couldn’t tell her, and she knew exactly how I felt about things.</span> <span id="s1145">She was my best friend, she was my psychiatrist and I helped her.</span> <span id="s1146">But my brother was very good to us.</span> <span id="s1147">He really took us places, and his American soldiers, his friends were very nice.</span> <span id="s1148">Yeah, we did make some friends [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1149">He came back to Munich after the war, and he opened a store they had before the war.</span> <span id="s1150">And he got us some material and we had some raincoats made.</span> <span id="s1151">At that time a lot of things were custom made, you just couldn’t go in the store.</span> <span id="s1152">Maybe housedresses they would sell in the store, but not like you go and you can buy suits and all that.</span> <span id="s1153">Those things were custom made a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: This is tape three, side A, of an interview with Mrs. Sylvia Green.</span> <span id="s1156">Mrs. Green you were just talking about your -- your stay in Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: And you spent almost a year there, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: No, not quite a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: There --</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: From October until June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: October until June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: So a little over a half a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1167">And -- and during this time, did you reflect much on what had happened to you before in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: No, not too much.</span> <span id="s1169">I had a lot of living to do, because I didn't live before.</span> <span id="s1170">That’s -- everybody felt that way.</span> <span id="s1171">We ate too much, we drank too much.</span> <span id="s1172">We just felt like a -- a bird coming out the cage.</span> <span id="s1173">It’s very overpowering, all -- all that freedom.</span> <span id="s1174">You were not told what to do, you could walk, you could go to bed when you wanted.</span> <span id="s1175">Had nice beds and sheets.</span> <span id="s1176">I mean, things you take for granted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Did you think much about the future?</span> <span id="s1178">About what you would do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Well, I knew that we were coming to the United States, this we knew, because my brother filled forms out all the time, you know, and then we had to go for examinations.</span> <span id="s1180">And you had to get passports, and finally the day came when we left Germany, and I think we were -- we came over on the ship Marine Perch, and -- from Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s1181">And I think we were on board about 11 days, because they had to stop, there were some mines and they didn't tell us they had mines in the water until they deactivated it.</span> <span id="s1182">They didn’t tell us, we probably would have been scared to death.</span> <span id="s1183">But I would say there were about 800 passengers, maybe with the crew also.</span> <span id="s1184">Was a very small ship, and it was not equipped, it was not a luxury liner.</span> <span id="s1185">We had one little room, but from the 800 people, there might have been about 40 - 50 who didn’t get sick, most of them got sick, seasick.</span> <span id="s1186">And my aunt was seasick.</span> <span id="s1187">They -- the younger people they put in the bunkbeds, and was a great, big room, and the food was served buffet.</span> <span id="s1188">And that -- but my aunt, she was over 40, and she had, I think it was a semi-private room, they just gave it to her.</span> <span id="s1189">After -- up to a certain age.</span> <span id="s1190">And they ate at a table, they were served, and my poor aunt was in bed all the trip.</span> <span id="s1191">I went down every day to see her, and I want to bring her some food, and she said, “Get out of here, get out.</span> <span id="s1192">I can’t look at that food.”</span> <span id="s1193">So we had a good time, we entertained ourselves that -- the 45 - 50, and it was just amazing to us, when we got to New York, all in a sudden those people start pouring out the ship, you know, you haven’t seen them.</span> <span id="s1194">How did you get on?</span> <span id="s1195">I didn’t see you.</span> <span id="s1196">But so many were sick.</span> <span id="s1197">Then we had to wait that you had relatives, somebody had to pick you up at the pier, they wouldn’t just let you go loose.</span> <span id="s1198">And my aunt and I, we waited and waited, and my cousin in New York supposed to pick me up.</span> <span id="s1199">I did not know those cousins except one cousin.</span> <span id="s1200">He was in Karlsruhe, and he was just like my brother.</span> <span id="s1201">At that time first cousins were like brothers and sisters, very close.</span> <span id="s1202">And he’s supposed to pick me up, and he just didn’t show up, and my aunt and I, we were the last ones, and oh God, were we scared.</span> <span id="s1203">I start crying, and all in a sudden a woman came up to me and she said, “You’re Sylvia Farber, aren’t you?</span> <span id="s1204">From Karlsruhe?”</span> <span id="s1205">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1206">And she said, “I don’t know, do you remember Bernard Weismann?”</span> <span id="s1207">I said, “Yeah, I went to school with him.”</span> <span id="s1208">The -- the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s1209">He had a speech defect, and the children were not very kind to him, and -- children can be cruel.</span> <span id="s1210">So she said, “Well, I really didn’t have you on my list, but I looked at the list and I saw Sylvia Farber, and I wanted to greet you.</span> <span id="s1211">So I s-switched with somebody and I want to say welcome to America, and thank you for being so nice to my son Bernard.”</span> <span id="s1212">A-And that kind of felt good, that people remembered you, you know, and he was such a nice boy, but the kids just didn’t give him a chance.</span> <span id="s1213">He was very intelligent.</span> <span id="s1214">His father was a doctor, I don’t know what happened to him, lost contact.</span> <span id="s1215">So while we were talking, my cousin came with other cousins.</span> <span id="s1216">The other cousins -- but I didn’t know the other cousins, they were waiting for that one cousin, he had to sign for us.</span> <span id="s1217">And he came, and he looked like a Farber.</span> <span id="s1218">He looked like my dad, he looked like my brother, and we just start hugging and kissing, you know?</span> <span id="s1219">It seemed like the Farber, the looks goes through the family.</span> <span id="s1220">It’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Was your brother with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: My brother didn’t come until September.</span> <span id="s1225">You see, he signed up six more months to make sure to get us out.</span> <span id="s1226">And I really loved New York, I wanted to stay there, but my brother wouldn’t let us.</span> <span id="s1227">My brother said, “Listen, we gonna make a home in Lexington, Kentucky, it’s a beautiful little town, and that way we can be together, we don’t have parents.”</span> <span id="s1228">And I listened to him, and I stayed in Lexington.</span> <span id="s1229">Do you know where he ended up?</span> <span id="s1230">New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1231">He got his undergraduate degree from University Kentucky.</span> <span id="s1232">He got his master’s degree from Chicago, University of Chicago.</span> <span id="s1233">He was working on his Ph.D. in cuk -- at Columbia University.</span> <span id="s1234">And he stayed there.</span> <span id="s1235">Then when he got married, they moved to New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: This relative of yours in Lexington, ha -- will you describe how he was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: They really were not related to me.</span> <span id="s1238">The very -- the -- the one -- Leon Erbach was my Aunt Minna’s brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1239">My Aunt Minna’s husband Alec, and Leon Erbach were brothers.</span> <span id="s1240">And I was related to my Aunt Minna through my mother.</span> <span id="s1241">You see, so they really were not related, but they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s1242">They really were wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: And so your brother had been living with Leon Erbach?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: When he came in ’40, he lived with Leon Erbach, then he went to Lovell.</span> <span id="s1247">And they grabbed him right away in ’41 for the army.</span> <span id="s1248">So they really were wonderful people, and they treated me better than the daughter, the daughter said.</span> <span id="s1249">Because I was older than their daughter, five and a half years, and I could stay out longer on a date.</span> <span id="s1250">And she resented that.</span> <span id="s1251">She said, “They love you more than they love me.”</span> <span id="s1252">They really were great people.</span> <span id="s1253">But we didn’t stay very long.</span> <span id="s1254">My brother came in September and we rented an apartment, and we lived on my brother’s army pay, 90 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s1255">45 dollars rent.</span> <span id="s1256">Water bill was cheap, two dollars electric bill.</span> <span id="s1257">And we made it, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1258">And we only had hamburger on Sundays.</span> <span id="s1259">But we wanted to be independent.</span> <span id="s1260">Er-Erbachs didn’t want us to leave, but we wanted to get started.</span> <span id="s1261">So my brother start teaching languages.</span> <span id="s1262">He -- he was working on this undergraduate degree, and he was tutoring in French and German.</span> <span id="s1263">And sometimes he didn’t go to bed until two, three o’clock in the morning because he had to do his own homework.</span> <span id="s1264">And he caught the flu, he couldn’t get over it and the doctor said, “Something has to give, you need sleep.”</span> <span id="s1265">So I went to work, for 18 dollars a week, but that was money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Did you speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: By that time a little bit.</span> <span id="s1268">Erbachs -- you see, we came in June and I went to work, I think it was Christmas or right after Christmas.</span> <span id="s1269">And they were nice enough to give me a job.</span> <span id="s1270">It was [indecipherable], they were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1271">And I think they gave me a job they felt sorry for me, and then I was a novelty.</span> <span id="s1272">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: This was in the paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1275">That’s me, a young Sylvia Farber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: And you have blonde hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: And there’s your aunt --</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Do you know it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: -- and your aunt is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: -- stayed blonde --</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: -- on the left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: -- in perox -- yeah, that’s my aunt.</span> <span id="s1284">Ah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: The headline says, Polish ref --</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Polish refugees -- that was students.</span> <span id="s1287">They kind of messed it up a little bit, they didn’t get it straight.</span> <span id="s1288">Some of it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Will you read it -- the entire headline?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1291">This was 9-27-46, and it was the Lexington Leader, Polish refugee ex-prisoners, now at Henry Claire High School.</span> <span id="s1292">We ju -- we just sat through English classes, American government classes.</span> <span id="s1293">And then some of the students gave up their study hour to help us learn how to read.</span> <span id="s1294">I thought it was very nice of them.</span> <span id="s1295">And then also, when I was working, I audited some classes at the University Kentucky from eight til nine in the morning.</span> <span id="s1296">And Joe Wall’s niece, who went to University Kentucky, picked me up and took me to work so I would be there by nine o’clock.</span> <span id="s1297">And they were very nice, because I should -- supposed to been there 10 minutes to nine, but I talked to him and then he said that’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Were you interested -- very interested in getting an education?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: It was not the education as much what I wanted.</span> <span id="s1300">I wanted to learn how to speak English.</span> <span id="s1301">It’s very hard to think in German and then have to translate everything.</span> <span id="s1302">It’s not easy.</span> <span id="s1303">I mean, were you ever in a foreign country, where you walked around with a dictionary?</span> <span id="s1304">And my problem was that I always would put the buggy before the horse somehow.</span> <span id="s1305">Th-The sentence construction was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1306">And English is a very hard language.</span> <span id="s1307">And the spelling, my God, there’s so many words they sound alike.</span> <span id="s1308">Now I wish I would have gone on to get an education.</span> <span id="s1309">I really wi -- but the education at that time wasn’t that important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: What were you doing in your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: I started out as wrapping packages, and -- but at April, I just felt like, you stupid.</span> <span id="s1312">You can do better than that, you know?</span> <span id="s1313">So I start sneaking out and waiting on customers, and the customers loved it.</span> <span id="s1314">Because I was a survivor, which they never met another one.</span> <span id="s1315">And that publicity, I mean, everybody knew about me.</span> <span id="s1316">So I remember Joe Wall said to me, “What are you doing on the floor?”</span> <span id="s1317">I said, “I’m not stupid.</span> <span id="s1318">I can do better than that, just wrap packages.</span> <span id="s1319">And well, normally a clerk couldn’t have said that.</span> <span id="s1320">But then, I didn’t have the clothes I was supposed to wear, I was supposed to wear dark clothes, navy blue, or gray, or black.</span> <span id="s1321">I didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s1322">He told me, “You wear what you got.”</span> <span id="s1323">So he really made -- made allowances for me.</span> <span id="s1324">In fact, people must have talked about this, a Holocaust survivor in another department store, Martin, the buyer -- I don’t remember, I don’t think she came into [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1325">She must have waited outdoors or something, she came up to me, and she said, “I really would like for you to work for Martin’s.</span> <span id="s1326">How much money do you get at [indecipherable]?”</span> <span id="s1327">And I said, “Eighteen dollars a week.”</span> <span id="s1328">She said, “We can do better than that.</span> <span id="s1329">We can pay you 25 dollars.”</span> <span id="s1330">So I said, “Let me think about it.”</span> <span id="s1331">So I went to Joe Wall.</span> <span id="s1332">I thought that was the right thing to do, because he gave me the chance.</span> <span id="s1333">The factories wh-where I ap-applied in Lexington wouldn’t hire me because I couldn’t speak English fluently.</span> <span id="s1334">Now you could sue them because you discriminated, but at that time you didn't know about suing people.</span> <span id="s1335">So I told him, I said, “Listen, they approached me at Martin’s and they would pay me 25 dollars a week.”</span> <span id="s1336">He said, “Well, if Martin’s can pay you 25, I can give you 25.”</span> <span id="s1337">I did feel guilty because the people I worked with, s-some been working there 10 - 20 years and didn’t make more than 25 or 27 dollars.</span> <span id="s1338">But I told him, I said, “You know, we need the money.”</span> <span id="s1339">He said, “I know.”</span> <span id="s1340">So people in Lexington were very nice and very decent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: When did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Jake?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A2: [indecipherable] I think you would wind this up, three hours is enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: -- open through his cousin.</span> <span id="s1345">We met his cousin.</span> <span id="s1346">We lived on Macdowell Road, Chevy Chase area, I don’t know whether you know that area there.</span> <span id="s1347">Okay.</span> <span id="s1348">And Martha Steinberg, and she said, “I know a young man I would like for you to meet.”</span> <span id="s1349">And I was going with that Hungarian fellow I was telling you I met on the boat, from Budapest.</span> <span id="s1350">And he proposed before we got off the boat, he wanted to get married.</span> <span id="s1351">But my aunt said, “No way.</span> <span id="s1352">He is scared.</span> <span id="s1353">He doesn’t want to be alone to get into a country, not knowing anybody.”</span> <span id="s1354">So we corresponded, and we talked on the telephone sometimes.</span> <span id="s1355">So I was telling Martha, I said, “Well, I’m dating a fellow in New York.”</span> <span id="s1356">But we had the understanding that we could date other people also, since we were that far apart.</span> <span id="s1357">And she said, “I really would like to.”</span> <span id="s1358">And my aunt said, “Well, you have nothing to lose.”</span> <span id="s1359">So they fixed up a date.</span> <span id="s1360">They fixed up a date, Martha and Jake for eight o’clock a certain day.</span> <span id="s1361">It was 8:20 - 8:30, quarter to nine, no Jake Green.</span> <span id="s1362">I got undressed, I put my slack suit back on, I was madder than a hornet.</span> <span id="s1363">I wasn’t used to be stood up.</span> <span id="s1364">Doorbell rings there, “I’m Jake Green.”</span> <span id="s1365">And I said -- he said, “If you don’t want to go out with me, I will understand.”</span> <span id="s1366">I said, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s1367">He said, “I got lost.”</span> <span id="s1368">Well, where we lived it was like Macdowell Road, and then there was a circle.</span> <span id="s1369">And the next road Irvin, there was a circle, and he drove around in circles in the dark, and he went downtown to a gas station, and they gave him directions.</span> <span id="s1370">And this really made sense, it’s really hard, because many times we drive by now where I used to live, to see the changes in the apartment house and it’s very easy to get lost.</span> <span id="s1371">It’s like a cul-de-sac, you know.</span> <span id="s1372">It’s a -- in circle.</span> <span id="s1373">So that’s how I met my husband.</span> <span id="s1374">And we went out dancing, and -- I don’t know, the evening passed by so fast, and I ask him now, I said, “How could you understand me?</span> <span id="s1375">I couldn’t even understand myself.”</span> <span id="s1376">He said was very easy.</span> <span id="s1377">I learned a little Jewish, Yiddish, and he knew a little Yiddish, and some German, and some English.</span> <span id="s1378">We had a marvelous time, and we both liked to dance.</span> <span id="s1379">And we dated about a year and a half and we got married January the 16th, 1949, which is gonna be 47 years.</span> <span id="s1380">Long time.</span> <span id="s1381">My brother said, “It won’t last.”</span> <span id="s1382">I said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s1383">He had nothing against Jake, he just said, “Nobody could live with you any longer 10 days to three weeks.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Why did he say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Why did he say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Well, you know how brothers and sister -- he meant well, but he was so strict with me.</span> <span id="s1388">Now, you wouldn’t even listen to a brother, but at that time you did.</span> <span id="s1389">And I just listened to him.</span> <span id="s1390">When I had a date, even before Jake, they had to come inside the house, they had to talk to him.</span> <span id="s1391">He had to look him out -- over, whether they were good enough for his sister.</span> <span id="s1392">But I wasn't a child.</span> <span id="s1393">I already was 23 -- 22 - 23 years old.</span> <span id="s1394">But he just took it on himself like he was my father, like I told him, “You’re stricter on my like Dad would be.”</span> <span id="s1395">But then after we got engaged and everything was all right, he said, “Oh well, it’s not so bad.</span> <span id="s1396">I’m not losing a sister, I gained a bathroom.”</span> <span id="s1397">You know, one bathroom in apartment, two bedrooms.</span> <span id="s1398">And I had a problem after the war.</span> <span id="s1399">I took an awful lot of baths.</span> <span id="s1400">We didn't have a shower, I just felt dirty.</span> <span id="s1401">Three, four times a day, but everything turned out all right.</span> <span id="s1402">They were kind of worried about me, because all that time, you know, you had lice in the camps, and you were itching, and -- and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1403">And you were dirty all the time.</span> <span id="s1404">And even if they gave you water on purpose, they would give you soap, but never let you wash off the soap, they just turned the water off.</span> <span id="s1405">They got their kicks that way, I guess.</span> <span id="s1406">So I did have a problem, so he probably was happy, he gained a bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Okay, we have a tape -- a -- a photograph here of yourself with your family before the war.</span> <span id="s1408">And will you da --</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: -- just describe the people from left to right and say something about oo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Well, this was taken in a garden.</span> <span id="s1412">That’s a botanic garden.</span> <span id="s1413">And I remember when that was taken except my brother had this blown up and at that time you didn’t have color picture, he -- he had to tint it.</span> <span id="s1414">The pictures were just black and white.</span> <span id="s1415">And I kind of feel bad.</span> <span id="s1416">This was a blue dress, and he had to tint it green.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: You [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: So I got the picture and I thanked him so much for it.</span> <span id="s1419">I said, “Bernard,” I said, “the dress was blue.”</span> <span id="s1420">He said, “No, it was green.”</span> <span id="s1421">I said, “No, it was blue.”</span> <span id="s1422">And he kind of felt bad about it, but I really shouldn’t have told him that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: So this, on the left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: This is my mother.</span> <span id="s1425">This is -- well, her name was Selka, which -- it’s a Polish name, and then she all -- and they would call her, Selie.</span> <span id="s1426">And then after she came to Germany, she couldn’t be called Selie, because it’s -- she would spell it C-i-l-l-y.</span> <span id="s1427">It would be silly, you know?</span> <span id="s1428">S -- and she was a big woman, and like I told you, I was Daddy’s little girl.</span> <span id="s1429">And I always said, “I look like a Farber.</span> <span id="s1430">I am a Farber.”</span> <span id="s1431">Look, I’m the image of my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: You’re almost as tall as she is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1434">Mother told me she grew very late in life.</span> <span id="s1435">About 17.</span> <span id="s1436">They used to call her shrimp, because she didn’t grow.</span> <span id="s1437">Very slow, she got her period very late, then she start growing.</span> <span id="s1438">And she ended up about five six, or five six and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: And you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: And this is -- I always was called Klina Sylvia because from all my cousins, I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s1441">And I remember the dress, it was a very pretty dress, and you call that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1442">I don’t know what do you call this in Engli --</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: The -- the bodice, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: The bodice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: And th-that was all made.</span> <span id="s1447">And this -- this is work because you have to pull the threads out and then finish it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: How old were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: I think I was about -- in 1933, I think I was maybe about nine.</span> <span id="s1450">And my mother said I was skinny.</span> <span id="s1451">Being heavy was stylish, because many times when we walked down the street and we would see a chubby girl passing by, she’s -- we’d say, isn’t she beautiful?</span> <span id="s1452">Then she look at me, hm.</span> <span id="s1453">I don’t -- I am not skinny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: You look thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: Huh?</span> <span id="s1456">Nah!</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: You look thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: No.</span> <span id="s1459">I mean, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Very healthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: Yeah, I was healthy.</span> <span id="s1462">I was a healthy child.</span> <span id="s1463">Next to me is my brother in his Bar Mitzvah suit.</span> <span id="s1464">This was custom made and he had short pants and long pants, but the short pants weren’t real short, they come about -- just up to the knees, a little above.</span> <span id="s1465">And he’s wearing his gymnasium cap, and every year they would change the band different colors.</span> <span id="s1466">And this is my handsome dad.</span> <span id="s1467">And I think this picture must have been taken about ’33 because in ’36 my mother went to Poland, and she had some modern suits.</span> <span id="s1468">I just go by the style.</span> <span id="s1469">This was in ’36, she had some made in Poland, and she brought them back in ’36, and they were double breasted suits, so this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: This is a single breasted suit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: This is a single breasted suit, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: And he’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: -- he’s wearing a vest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: He’s wearing a vest --</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: -- and a tie, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: But not only that, I don’t see the spats.</span> <span id="s1478">Maybe he wore spats in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s1479">I remember his spats, and at times he would carry a cane, just for the fun of it.</span> <span id="s1480">It was a style, I guess.</span> <span id="s1481">He has a very kind face.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: Do you notice this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Nice smile.</span> <span id="s1486">He had black eyes, and my brother inherited his black eyes.</span> <span id="s1487">[doorbell rings].</span> <span id="s1488">And mine are dark, but not as dark as theirs.</span> <span id="s1489">Mine -- my mother’s eyes got a little mingled in there in -- in mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Do you have any --</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Yeah, we smoked cigarettes also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Do you have any closing comments you’d like to make today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: Oh, didn’t think about that.</span> <span id="s1494">My life certainly has been interesting.</span> <span id="s1495">It -- I divided it up.</span> <span id="s1496">This was then, and raising the children I really enjoyed.</span> <span id="s1497">I didn’t work outdoors, they were my whole life, my children.</span> <span id="s1498">But I wanted to, I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1499">And well, they wonderful, we love them dearly, they love us dearly, but they got their own life, and it was a good life.</span> <span id="s1500">And altogether the only thing, I thought, well, everybody has to go through some kind of hell.</span> <span id="s1501">And I always thought, well, I went through it early in life, and the rest of the life be -- I got smooth sailing.</span> <span id="s1502">But I guess it wasn’t enough, because then this came up with my husband’s illness.</span> <span id="s1503">But we holding together.</span> <span id="s1504">The -- certain things I would love to do, I would love to travel.</span> <span id="s1505">I used to travel by myself, because Jake wanted to work.</span> <span id="s1506">And he really could have gone with -- but no -- with me, but in that respect, he was a small town boy, and he really didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1507">But I went to New York, I went to visit my brother.</span> <span id="s1508">I went to Israel in ’85 by myself, and that’s -- was a highlight in my life because I always wanted to go to Israel when I was a member of the Mizrachi, I was -- at that time I was going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1509">At the time I was five or six and I was going to build it up single-handed, I really was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s1510">And I always said someday, someday I was gonna go.</span> <span id="s1511">In ’85 I said well, you feel pretty good now and that someday has to be now because you don’t know what’s ahead of you.</span> <span id="s1512">And I went for two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: So you ha -- ha -- had an opportunity to travel, and a -- this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: Not a whole lot.</span> <span id="s1516">We would go -- after my grandson was born in Chattanooga, we would go Chattanooga about every three to four months.</span> <span id="s1517">And we would drive.</span> <span id="s1518">And he enjoyed that, Jake, he really did.</span> <span id="s1519">But just stay over a weekend.</span> <span id="s1520">But even before then I would go to New Jersey by myself.</span> <span id="s1521">Now he did go with me to the Holocaust reunion in ’83.</span> <span id="s1522">I could have gone to Israel at that time, but he wouldn’t go with me and I was afraid to go to myself.</span> <span id="s1523">I did not know how I was going to react, because I was not in touch with survivors.</span> <span id="s1524">And after we got to Washington in ’83, all the survivors -- and I just thought it was me made the children her life, almost every survivor made the children their lives, and enjoyed taking care of them.</span> <span id="s1525">So, it was good to -- to -- to talk to other survivors.</span> <span id="s1526">Now some of them were very bitter and I really felt sorry for them.</span> <span id="s1527">I mean, I feel like if you’re that bitter, you wasting your life.</span> <span id="s1528">I mean, what you got left, you should make -- make it as comfortable for yourself, because hatred just doesn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">End of Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives
