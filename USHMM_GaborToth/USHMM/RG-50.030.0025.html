id="s10">01:01:12</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Okay, Sonia, the first thing I want you to do is tell me your full name, and when and where you were born.</span> <span id="s12">And then just tell me a little bit about your growing-up years, your community.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I was born in a small town there in Poland, this was a big town, Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s14">They had 10 or 15,000 people there.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in April 15, 1922, to a very rich father and mother.</span> <span id="s16">I had four brothers, two older and two younger than me.</span> <span id="s17">And I had my education there.</span> <span id="s18">I was studying in a liceum, with languages.</span> <span id="s19">I finished gimnazjum, and then I went for two years in liceum where I studied Latin, French, Polish, and History.</span> <span id="s20">When -- before the war broke out, I was two, three months before finishing my studies.</span> <span id="s21">I was dreaming to go to Paris, because we had a family there, to study dentistry in Sorbonne with the whole family.</span> <span id="s22">My mother’s was there.</span> <span id="s23">But the war came in, and my dreams finished.</span> <span id="s24">The German came to the city in December 1941.</span> <span id="s25">We didn't know nothing about the war.</span> <span id="s26">You know, it was small town.</span> <span id="s27">We know only that very bad will be for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s28">But we couldn't imagine it should be so, so bad, because when the first German came, they were dancing with us.</span> <span id="s29">And one -- I was a pretty girl, and one told my parents, “Make her papers that she is Polish and let her go from the city, because it will be very bad.”</span></p> <p><span id="s30">01:03:13 And that's what -- when they went, they came, the S.D. and the S.S., and the war began.</span> <span id="s31">In the beginning it was not so bad, because they begin -- After two months, they began to organize the ghetto.</span> <span id="s32">So all the people went out from the houses, and they put us on -- in a small -- in a couple of houses.</span> <span id="s33">Pereseka.</span> <span id="s34">They're called, Pereseka.</span> <span id="s35">This was like Brooklyn, New York, and Queens, like one of the city.</span> <span id="s36">And we were staying there till they said we have to go out in the streets, and this began the Aktion.</span> <span id="s37">When the Aktion began, my father saw that is very bad, so he took me, and -- I had a brother -- Jay, and he said, “Come on.</span> <span id="s38">I will show you something.”</span> <span id="s39">And he ran away.</span> <span id="s40">He knew the policeman, the Polish, and they let us go.</span> <span id="s41">So I ran away to a village where my mother was born.</span> <span id="s42">And we stayed in a church because my father know there the people.</span> <span id="s43">We stayed there about seven days under the church.</span> <span id="s44">They had a place in Poland where the potato -- they were holding the potatoes should not freeze.</span> <span id="s45">And we staying there for a whole week.</span> <span id="s46">He let us stay.</span> <span id="s47">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s48">And after a week, he said, “The action is gone and you can go to the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s49">We didn't know where my mother was.</span> <span id="s50">But my mother was a very intelligent girl.</span> <span id="s51">She was a rabbi's daughter.</span> <span id="s52">And she saw from far that my father went away with me, with my brother.</span> <span id="s53">She understood that he will take care, too, on us.</span> <span id="s54">So she took care on herself.</span> <span id="s55">She run to the village where she was born, this was Barabevit.</span> <span id="s56">And there friends of hers, what she was studying with them in school, he keep her for 10 -- or two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Was he Jewish or not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: The friends?</span> <span id="s59">Not Jewish, no.</span> <span id="s60">The people -- they were very good people, too, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s61">Not every Jew is good, too.</span> <span id="s62">There is certain people what are better than Jew.</span> <span id="s63">They were keeping us, and if they would find them, he would be killed together with his whole family.</span> <span id="s64">But he was keeping us.</span> <span id="s65">After two weeks, when I was already with my father and brother in the ghetto, he came in and he said, “You know what, I would like to know if Mr. Boldo is alive.”</span> <span id="s66">He didn't say that he has my mother.</span> <span id="s67">So they said “yes.”</span> <span id="s68">They let him in.</span> <span id="s69">And he said, “You know, I have your wife.”</span> <span id="s70">This was a shock for us because we were sure that she is not alive.</span> <span id="s71">And after a couple of days, she came and she was with us in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">01:06:21</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Will you tell me -- go back a little bit to the action and tell me what happened, and how your father got away.</span> <span id="s74">I mean, were you right there or did--</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: We stayed near my father.</span> <span id="s76">My father was a tall, strong guy, and everybody knew him.</span> <span id="s77">So he sneaked in and he took me and my brother away from the line.</span> <span id="s78">And you know this small houses, so he keeps us in the house for two hours or three hours till they took away everybody for killing.</span> <span id="s79">And we went out.</span> <span id="s80">The policemen saw him, but he didn't hold us.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">They let him go because he knew him from before.</span> <span id="s82">He was a Polish policeman.</span> <span id="s83">And that's how we survive for the couple of months.</span> <span id="s84">After the action, we came back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s85">We didn’t -- we were not hungry because the villages, the people, knew that we are there.</span> <span id="s86">They were bringing us food, bread, meat, everything.</span> <span id="s87">They were beautiful, wonderful people.</span> <span id="s88">And till today, we are sending them packages.</span> <span id="s89">They are not alive, but we send them packages to give to the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Those -- the first actions, were they for specific people or -- I mean, in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: In our town, the first action was before the ghetto.</span> <span id="s92">They took all the doctors, the intelligent people, and they killed them in the marketplace – 50 of them.</span> <span id="s93">They took away the head of the city.</span> <span id="s94">And then in the month -- in December, this was a regular action for whoever was in the street they took.</span> <span id="s95">This is the -- first of all, they took the men.</span> <span id="s96">They said that they are going to work on a -- work in a camp, a working camp.</span> <span id="s97">But they never came back.</span> <span id="s98">Nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s99">But the paysans, that means people from the villages, they knew because they saw it.</span> <span id="s100">And they were coming to the ghetto and they were saying, “There is no camp.</span> <span id="s101">They are all killed.”</span> <span id="s102">This was the first action.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">01:08:56</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: That's how your father knew what was happening?</span> <span id="s105">A: Right.</span> <span id="s106">Right.</span> <span id="s107">He knew everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s109">So you came back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s110">And then tell me a little bit about living in the ghetto, and how long you were there, what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: We stayed in the ghetto, I think, a couple of months they came to the ghetto -- after the couple of months, this was a regular living.</span> <span id="s112">You were working.</span> <span id="s113">I was working in the hospital, and the others was working in the street because the street were bombardment, bombard.</span> <span id="s114">Everything was broken, so they were cleaning up.</span> <span id="s115">And this was not so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Nobody – they were thinking, you know -- people were thinking what’s good is for me.</span> <span id="s117">They were thinking, “I will survive.</span> <span id="s118">They are not touching us no more.”</span> <span id="s119">And they were sitting.</span> <span id="s120">Then one day, a son of friends of ours came in.</span> <span id="s121">And said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s122">I saw 11 people from the ghetto that went out at night and I know where they went.</span> <span id="s123">They went to the forest, but nobody survived.</span> <span id="s124">Because they told them where to go, and the Germans were staying there already and waiting for them.”</span> <span id="s125">And this was the first group for the trying to went out, and they were killed.</span> <span id="s126">So, you know, that’s very difficult to go out.</span> <span id="s127">We can go out, but we will not be alive.</span> <span id="s128">So this was first time.</span> <span id="s129">This was -- I think this was already after the winter.</span> <span id="s130">The winter was very bad.</span> <span id="s131">In Poland, the winter is terrible.</span> <span id="s132">So this was probably in March or April another group went out, and we never heard about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">The German came and the they were gave -- they went to segregate the young and the healthy, and they took them to the court there.</span> <span id="s134">In Novogrudok, there was a court.</span> <span id="s135">And there in the court they were working, and the rest stayed in the ghetto on the Pereseka.</span> <span id="s136">There were the kids, the older, and the sick.</span> <span id="s137">They didn't kill all of them right away, but after a couple of months, yes.</span> <span id="s138">They begin to talking about in the court that something is wrong.</span> <span id="s139">They’re preparing something, the Germans.</span> <span id="s140">Nobody knew what and where.</span> <span id="s141">My parents stayed in there, in the ghetto, in Pereseka.</span> <span id="s142">And my father said, “I don't want her to be there,” to my mother.</span> <span id="s143">So they paid.</span> <span id="s144">We had money.</span> <span id="s145">We had gold.</span> <span id="s146">We had many things.</span> <span id="s147">And they paid to a Polish man what he was bringing the bread to the ghetto, to the court.</span> <span id="s148">So he paid him.</span> <span id="s149">And he bring in -- one night, he bring the bread to the court, and he put me in the basket from the bread.</span> <span id="s150">And he brought me to my parents.</span> <span id="s151">I was there not a long time, because my parents began to receive letters from the partisan, from my husband, from Alex. And he wrote him -- he didn't know me, I didn't know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">01:12:22 There is a big difference between from the village.</span> <span id="s153">He was from a village, very small, Stankiewicze.</span> <span id="s154">There were five houses.</span> <span id="s155">One of the house, one Jewish family, the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s156">And they had, I think, about 10 brothers and two sisters.</span> <span id="s157">And his sister was married to uncle of mine, but I never knew him, too.</span> <span id="s158">It was great uncle, whatever.</span> <span id="s159">And she said -- she was too, in the forest.</span> <span id="s160">And she said to him, “You know what, I saw by the Boldos’ a beautiful girl, and I would like you to send somebody after her.”</span> <span id="s161">And he was a very good -- he had two -- he had a wife and a three-month-old child.</span> <span id="s162">But he didn’t go -- after she gave birth to the child, she didn't want to go to the forest.</span> <span id="s163">So this day when he send after her was the liquidation of this house, and she got killed with the child.</span> <span id="s164">So he was by himself.</span> <span id="s165">And he wrote a letter to my parents that he will guarantee my safety.</span> <span id="s166">But I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s167">I was afraid for the tree.</span> <span id="s168">I was afraid for the forest.</span> <span id="s169">I was afraid for everything because I never were there.</span> <span id="s170">But when my parents saw what is here, they said, “Listen, I want you to go.</span> <span id="s171">I would like you -- better to die there than I would see you dead here.”</span> <span id="s172">And he send a couple of men with rifles.</span> <span id="s173">And at night, my father paid again to the police, Polish.</span> <span id="s174">And I went out with the friend of mine, Leah,to the forest.</span> <span id="s175">I came there -- we went out there about 12 o'clock, we came there about four o'clock, to the forest where we saw already about 18 people with rifles.</span> <span id="s176">I was afraid of them, too.</span> <span id="s177">I was not used to that, but I got used to that.</span> <span id="s178">And then I met my husband.</span> <span id="s179">So it was very nice in the morning, about 6 o'clock in the morning, my friends Chayathat was already the girlfriends from mine other brother-in-law, Asael.</span> <span id="s180">She said, “You know, I have a commander and I am with him and I am very happy.”</span> <span id="s181">I said to her – I was looking on her -- and I said, “Can you tell me maybe there's another commander?”</span> <span id="s182">She said, “Yes.</span> <span id="s183">One is Alex, his brother, the younger.”</span> <span id="s184">I said, “Who is he?</span> <span id="s185">Where is he?”</span> <span id="s186">She said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s187">About seven o'clock you will see him."</span> <span id="s188">And really about seven o'clock I saw a man with rifles, all over.</span> <span id="s189">I saw a man, a giant.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">He was six-two, and a young handsome -- I had afraid of him, too.</span> <span id="s191">But life is life.</span> <span id="s192">After -- He was very good to me from the beginning.</span> <span id="s193">He was very good to me.</span> <span id="s194">And he said to me, "You know, you came here.</span> <span id="s195">I would like you to stay with me."</span> <span id="s196">I said, "You know what, I will stay with you, but I want you to take out my parents."</span></p> <p><span id="s197">01:15:35 And I made with him like, “You know, you have to take them out, then I will stay with you.”</span> <span id="s198">And it took him all about seven or six days and my parents came.</span> <span id="s199">After my parents came, after a day, the whole ghetto went in flames.</span> <span id="s200">But I came to the forest end of August.</span> <span id="s201">August 15 was the second Aktion.</span> <span id="s202">And my brother died there, got killed.</span> <span id="s203">He didn't get killed in the action, but he saw that they were taking away my mother.</span> <span id="s204">My father was staying with me.</span> <span id="s205">So he went to work.</span> <span id="s206">My mother, so he wanted to take care on her.</span> <span id="s207">So he took her out from the lines, dead, to the lines of living.</span> <span id="s208">You understand what I am talking?</span> <span id="s209">And the German -- the people were counted.</span> <span id="s210">And he knew that somebody is missing, but he couldn't give out my mother.</span> <span id="s211">So they took him in on the truck, but he was killed when he was running from the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: They were doing a selection?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Selection, sure.</span> <span id="s214">Sure, a selection.</span> <span id="s215">This was August 15, and in this selection my brother was -- got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: August 15, ‘42?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Forty-two.</span> <span id="s218">In this selection, my brother was killed.</span> <span id="s219">That was my youngest brother and he was 17, whatever.</span> <span id="s220">That's it.</span> <span id="s221">Then my mother said, "You have to go."</span> <span id="s222">When the bread came</span></p> <p><span id="s223">1 Leah Berkowski</span></p> <p><span id="s224">2 Chaya Bielski</span></p> <p><span id="s225">3 Asael Bielski in, he took me to my parents.</span> <span id="s226">This was after August 15.</span> <span id="s227">He send -- my husband send a letter and I went away to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s228">That -- what I met him, in the morning, seven o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s229">And whatever he promise, he delivered.</span> <span id="s230">He delivered my parents.</span> <span id="s231">He took care very well on them.</span> <span id="s232">My mother was very fragile, but in the wintertime, she wouldn't stay in the forest.</span> <span id="s233">So he took all these men and they were putting her every day in another house by the, by the villages.</span> <span id="s234">And she survived the winter.</span> <span id="s235">In the summertime she went to the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: So, talk to me a little bit about.</span> <span id="s237">Should we tell people to be quite?</span> <span id="s238">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s239">01:17:57</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Tell me -- You know, it's unusual, this situation where a tremendous number of the people, the peasants and maybe even the people in the towns helped, but also there were collaborators.</span> <span id="s241">So tell me a little bit about how that worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: The people from our city, they were very good to us.</span> <span id="s243">They knew us.</span> <span id="s244">And when the German came, my father and mother give away everything to the people.</span> <span id="s245">So they took care on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">And they were very nice, because their life was the same thing, in jeopardy like our life.</span> <span id="s247">And they did everything.</span> <span id="s248">And they were very good.</span> <span id="s249">I know after the war when I came to the city, to the house.</span> <span id="s250">They recognize me right away, and they said “Sonia, tell me what you need.”</span> <span id="s251">And to my parents the same thing.</span> <span id="s252">They give the first food.</span> <span id="s253">They said, “You can stay with us.”</span> <span id="s254">They were very nice.</span> <span id="s255">They were people, beautiful.</span> <span id="s256">If not the people nobody survive, too.</span> <span id="s257">They gave us help.</span> <span id="s258">You cannot tell that everybody was very bad, but there were people very good, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: This situation where the actions happened, and they happened, small actions, but many, many.</span> <span id="s260">And the news spread of them, that's somewhat unusual.</span> <span id="s261">There were a lot of areas where people didn't know what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: No, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s263">In the morning, they came about six o'clock when the people are going to work and they right away they took them to the trucks, so how did you know?</span> <span id="s264">You didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s265">When you knew, already it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: When you got taken out of the ghetto and went to the forest, when was that?</span> <span id="s267">Was that August or was that in the Spring?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: This was end of August, beginning of September.</span> <span id="s269">01:20:38</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s271">Do you know about a man named Anton Schmidt?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Schmidt?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: He was a rescuer who was executed in April.</span> <span id="s276">I was going to ask you about him.</span> <span id="s277">A: No, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: I know about KozlowskiKozlowski.</span> <span id="s280">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Kozlowksi was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s282">He born not far from my husband's village.</span> <span id="s283">He were coming -- He went to the German, to the Polish, and he will bring all of the news to the brother Bielskis.</span> <span id="s284">They knew everything.</span> <span id="s285">If you need something, medicine or something, he went to the city and he bought it, or stole it, whatever.</span> <span id="s286">But the medicine we got.</span> <span id="s287">We got the salt and the sugar, whatever we needed from him.</span> <span id="s288">He was wonderful.</span> <span id="s289">Now the children become -- his children are alive and we are sending them money and packages and everything.</span> <span id="s290">He was one from the first.</span> <span id="s291">But he was bringing us everything.</span> <span id="s292">I know about him, because if somebody came from the ghetto -- people were coming from the ghettos -- they didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s293">So the first house was Kozlowksi's house.</span> <span id="s294">So he was keeping them.</span> <span id="s295">And he said, "Don't worry, somebody will come and they will take you to the forest."</span> <span id="s296">They were beautiful people.</span> <span id="s297">You don't have to forget this.</span> <span id="s298">You cannot say that everybody was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">01:22:14</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Tell me what it was like in the forest.</span> <span id="s301">Tell me about the setting up of the community, and tell me how it changed from that first --</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: When I came into the forest, they had only 75 people.</span> <span id="s303">That was the group of the Bielskis brothers.</span> <span id="s304">That was the four brothers -- the three brothers and they had their brother, Aaron, 13 years old.</span> <span id="s305">And they have a sister, what she was married to Chaya's brother.</span> <span id="s306">So that was the Bielskis and the Dzienciolskis.</span> <span id="s307">This was the whole thing.</span> <span id="s308">But later came another seven men and they made 70 people, 70 or 80 people, when I came in.</span> <span id="s309">This was the beginning of the partisans because people were -- went away from the forest -- went away from the ghettos.</span> <span id="s310">They didn't have a place there.</span> <span id="s311">And they -- the doors from the Bielskis brother were open for everybody, for old, children, sick people.</span> <span id="s312">And they had always food.</span> <span id="s313">They didn't</span></p> <p><span id="s314">4 Konstanty Kozlowski have steaks, but they have bread and water.</span> <span id="s315">They were very good.</span> <span id="s316">They were no different, but later, then many people came in.</span> <span id="s317">So there were men that said, “Listen, why do I have to go and grab food and risk my life?</span> <span id="s318">My wife is not here, my children are not here.</span> <span id="s319">Why should I risk the life for them?”</span> <span id="s320">But the Bielskis brother said, “Everybody who is coming has to have a place here.</span> <span id="s321">And eerybody will have a piece of bread.”</span> <span id="s322">They will not have maybe something else, but bread they will give everybody.</span> <span id="s323">This was one kitchen, one big kitchen and they were cooking potatoes with a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s324">And this was the food.</span> <span id="s325">Later, when the people came in more and more, they went out and knew that the Germans were in this village.</span> <span id="s326">And the German came into the village and knew they will collect bread and butter and milk and meat, whatever.</span> <span id="s327">So we were putting ambushes -- ambush is that the right word?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: …and they were taking away the food from them.</span> <span id="s330">And that's what we had the food for the partisans.</span> <span id="s331">We made ambush on them and got their rifles.</span> <span id="s332">We got everything from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Nobody was sending us.</span> <span id="s334">They were killing the German.</span> <span id="s335">They took away the food, took away the rifles, and we were in business.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">01:24:59</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Do you know about -- I think it was probably soon after you came -- the big harvest, when the Germans were going to get a percentage of the harvest, and so they burned the -- tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: The villages told us everything.</span> <span id="s339">Not us, to the Bielskis brother.</span> <span id="s340">They were afraid of them, terrible.</span> <span id="s341">One cannot fight, but if you three brothers, six-two with rifles and you knew you cannot live, you knew that he will touch something, whatever, you will not do the right thing, they will be killed.</span> <span id="s342">So they did everything.</span> <span id="s343">They were telling us that in a couple of days they have to pay to the German so much and so much.</span> <span id="s344">Not in money, but in food.</span> <span id="s345">So the Bielskis knew that the food is coming.</span> <span id="s346">The villages are giving them.</span> <span id="s347">We need it, too, the food.</span> <span id="s348">So that's what we took away.</span> <span id="s349">That was the harvest.</span> <span id="s350">That's what you mean, right?</span> <span id="s351">And we took away and we told to the villages, remember one thing, you giving them because you don’t want, because Germans, too, they were killing them.</span> <span id="s352">They were killing them.</span> <span id="s353">They put everything on a fire and they went away.</span> <span id="s354">So you have to give them, half them and half to us.</span> <span id="s355">And that's what they did.</span> <span id="s356">They were not always friendly, because you see, there were Aktions.</span> <span id="s357">The Bielskis were fighters.</span> <span id="s358">Not everybody, but they had a group of fighters.</span> <span id="s359">They had, the beginning, they had about 50 fighters.</span> <span id="s360">Later, the number went up and up and up.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">And they were not only fighting with the Polish police, they were fighting between the partisans, too.</span> <span id="s362">They were Polish -- not Polish, but German partisan – German -- Russian partisans.</span> <span id="s363">They were against us, too.</span> <span id="s364">First of all, because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s365">Second, because we knew better the neighborhood and we knew the people.</span> <span id="s366">So this was a plus, a big plus for us.</span> <span id="s367">And they were saying that we are taking away all of the food.</span> <span id="s368">Remember 1,000 people in the beginning.</span> <span id="s369">You have to feed them.</span> <span id="s370">And they were not sitting all of them in one place.</span> <span id="s371">We had afraid for that.</span> <span id="s372">So in groups, this was about 20 people in groups, they were sitting in the summertime up.</span> <span id="s373">In the wintertime, we had under the -- underground they were sitting.</span> <span id="s374">And when you are in the snow, every little thing you can see.</span> <span id="s375">So we were very careful, but you know you cannot take away from the villages.</span> <span id="s376">They knew very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">01:27:49 The Bielskis knew the place, but they knew, too.</span> <span id="s378">So we have to be in peace with them.</span> <span id="s379">You cannot take away everything.</span> <span id="s380">You have to leave them, too, for the family, something.</span> <span id="s381">But we managed.</span> <span id="s382">We managed.</span> <span id="s383">In the wintertime, I never were in the forest.</span> <span id="s384">I was always -- it's called a hutor.</span> <span id="s385">This mean a farm from one house or two houses.</span> <span id="s386">So I went with my husband and another 15 people.</span> <span id="s387">They were riders.</span> <span id="s388">And went there, sleep over about four or three hours and we went back to the forest.</span> <span id="s389">But they were very good to us.</span> <span id="s390">I cannot say it.</span> <span id="s391">Nobody would survive if not the people from the villages.</span> <span id="s392">They had afraid, but they give us whatever we needed.</span> <span id="s393">Later, already in -- this was in ‘43.</span> <span id="s394">In ‘44, we got already the rifles and everything from Moscow.</span> <span id="s395">They were sending us by planes.</span> <span id="s396">And they were bigger commanders than the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s397">They were commanders what they put on the front from the Russians, from Moscow.</span> <span id="s398">And they were good.</span> <span id="s399">They said to us like that.</span> <span id="s400">We were complaining always.</span> <span id="s401">You know, they have took a group of ours, 14 people.</span> <span id="s402">They took away their rifles, took away their food, and let them go without shoes even.</span> <span id="s403">They said, “Remember Mr. Bielski -- brother Bielski, remember one thing, this is life.</span> <span id="s404">You have to fight for them -- for that.”</span> <span id="s405">Not once my husband -- My husband was always between the German and the Polish army.</span> <span id="s406">The Polish, they were working together with the German, the Kozaks.</span> <span id="s407">He was always on the horses.</span> <span id="s408">He was giving everything to the all partisan and from the Naliboki puszcza.</span> <span id="s409">You know what is a puszcza, puszcza is the biggest forest, you cannot live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">This is only for the animals.</span> <span id="s411">This is not far from Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s412">This was between Novogrudok and Minsk.</span> <span id="s413">But we were there in the beginning.</span> <span id="s414">And they couldn't find us because you have to go by foot or by horses.</span> <span id="s415">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s416">They cannot go with the tanks there.</span> <span id="s417">They were surrounding us and we heard them talking and shooting.</span> <span id="s418">And we were sitting on mud without food for 10, for 12 days, till my husband -- I am telling you everything in one story -- till my husband said, “They cannot take no more hunger.”</span> <span id="s419">This was the only brother he said, “I cannot -- I have to go fight myself.”</span> <span id="s420">So he took 150 people -- not 150, 90 people, and I was, too, in the group by my husband, and he opened the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">We come in after the German who saw the fire still burning.</span> <span id="s422">They were warming the food, but nobody touch it.</span> <span id="s423">When we went out to open the forest, after a day, another 100 people went out and another hundred people because the Germans left us alone and we went away from there.</span> <span id="s424">And then we went to get organized again.</span> <span id="s425">This was the life.</span> <span id="s426">We were fighting them not in the open.</span> <span id="s427">You cannot fight a German soldier in the open.</span> <span id="s428">We were surrounding them.</span> <span id="s429">We know where they are and we were fighting them and took off everything from them.</span> <span id="s430">And that’s what this was life of the partisan.</span> <span id="s431">Not only us, there were the Russian partisan.</span> <span id="s432">The same thing, they were fighting, not in the open field, because in the open field you got killed from them.</span> <span id="s433">They had better everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">01:31:48</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: So you hid in the woods and waited till they came?</span> <span id="s436">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: And when you rode with your husband, that time when you first left the thick forest, were you carrying a gun, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Yeah, I had a gun.</span> <span id="s439">I had always a gun.</span> <span id="s440">But I never shoot the gun, no.</span> <span id="s441">When I was with my husband, I was not afraid of nothing, nothing at all.</span> <span id="s442">But when I didn't see him, I was afraid of everything.</span> <span id="s443">I had a gun for myself, for my protection.</span> <span id="s444">He gave it to me.</span> <span id="s445">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s446">This is it.</span> <span id="s447">I had a very good life in the forest.</span> <span id="s448">He gave to me everything.</span> <span id="s449">I never cooked.</span> <span id="s450">I never did nothing.</span> <span id="s451">I was the commander's wife.</span> <span id="s452">You met my sister-in-law, Lilly.</span> <span id="s453">There were three brothers.</span> <span id="s454">The oldest was Tuvia.</span> <span id="s455">You know, in a small villages in small cities, the older brother is the head of the family.</span> <span id="s456">And when they got together, they put him, Asael, his older brother, and Zusiathey made him a hero.</span> <span id="s457">They made him the head of the partisan.</span> <span id="s458">He was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s459">They, all of them, they were very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">01:33:15</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: If they hadn't been there do you think that things would have worked out the way they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Never.</span> <span id="s463">Never.</span> <span id="s464">Nobody knew the forest.</span> <span id="s465">They were born there.</span> <span id="s466">They were born in a small village, and they knew the forest and they knew the people.</span> <span id="s467">They knew everything.</span> <span id="s468">How could I survive, or somebody else?</span> <span id="s469">All 1,200 people, nobody would survive.</span> <span id="s470">Because there were people from other city, too, not only from Novogrudok, from Lida, from Baranovichi, from Vilna -- the people never were in the forest.</span> <span id="s471">You know, Jewish people, they are not going to the forest.</span> <span id="s472">They are in the city.</span> <span id="s473">Only they survived because of the Bielskis brothers.</span> <span id="s474">I cannot say because of Tuvia, because of Asael, because of Zusia.</span> <span id="s475">No, the three of them, they were one.</span> <span id="s476">Because nobody did something where the other one didn't want it.</span> <span id="s477">All of them, they work together.</span> <span id="s478">Whatever they had between them, nobody knew, but they were together.</span> <span id="s479">And that is what we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: How do you think they knew that the only way to survive was to go to the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Their instinct, instinct.</span> <span id="s482">You know, when you are born in a village, yes, you think that is the whole world.</span> <span id="s483">That is the whole world for them, for the people.</span> <span id="s484">They knew that if they would go to the ghetto they will get killed because once Tuvia got to the city to take something and they took him.</span> <span id="s485">The German took him, hit him so, so much.</span> <span id="s486">And he -- I don't know how he survived.</span> <span id="s487">At night we were sitting, and he said, "What I am sitting?</span> <span id="s488">What am I waiting for?"</span> <span id="s489">And he ran away to the forest.</span> <span id="s490">The first in the forest was my husband and his brother, Asael.</span> <span id="s491">How come the first?</span> <span id="s492">My husband, when the German came, he was in the Russian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">They took him.</span> <span id="s494">You know, the Russian, when they came in ‘39, they were taking the young</span></p> <p><span id="s495">5 Aleksander Bielski people to the army for work, whatever.</span> <span id="s496">So he was in the army.</span> <span id="s497">But he saw on the road going home, he said that was terrible.</span> <span id="s498">Whoever came and they were asking him, “Are you a Jew, or you are Polish?”</span> <span id="s499">whatever, they got killed.</span> <span id="s500">So he said “no.”</span> <span id="s501">He was speaking very nicely Russian and speaks beautiful Polish.</span> <span id="s502">And He doesn't look like a Jew, he looks like a Russian.</span> <span id="s503">So he said that he will not get in the Russian -- in the German and that's what he did.</span> <span id="s504">He came home at night.</span> <span id="s505">He was in Bialystok in the army there.</span> <span id="s506">He came at night.</span> <span id="s507">He was swollen in the legs and everything.</span> <span id="s508">So his mother said to him, “Stay for a couple of days home.”</span> <span id="s509">He said, "No, Mother.</span> <span id="s510">I am not staying.</span> <span id="s511">I will stay in the forest near the house.”</span></p> <p><span id="s512">01:36:31 And that's what happened, because in this time when she said to him, “stay in the house,” and they came in the morning and took away his mother and his father and two brothers.</span> <span id="s513">And they never see the light of the day.</span> <span id="s514">And they were sitting not far away.</span> <span id="s515">And by now the girlfriends – he had a girlfriends, a Polish, and she made a place for him in the house.</span> <span id="s516">So the first to went to the forest was my husband and his brother, Asael.</span> <span id="s517">When they were already in forest, then came Tuvia.</span> <span id="s518">This was – didn’t take a long time, probably about a week or two.</span> <span id="s519">So and they had a sister in another village, Tajba.</span> <span id="s520">She was married to the Dzienciolski.</span> <span id="s521">When they heard about the German, the whole Dzienciolski family ran away and they left her with a small baby in the house, the sister, Tajba.</span> <span id="s522">So my husband went and he took her out with the baby to the forest.</span> <span id="s523">She had the baby of nine months.</span> <span id="s524">She is still alive today.</span> <span id="s525">And they went in the morning to the people -- they didn't have children.</span> <span id="s526">And they said, “Listen, at night” -- This was wintertime already – “at night I will bring my sister's daughter, Lola.Please take care.</span> <span id="s527">If you will not take care and something happen to her, you will not be alive.”</span> <span id="s528">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s529">He put -- my husband, he put the baby onto the door.</span> <span id="s530">It was winter.</span> <span id="s531">And they were watching and they didn't hear nothing.</span> <span id="s532">They were sure that the baby is already in the house.</span> <span id="s533">They forgot about it.</span> <span id="s534">So the baby was already frozen when they took her into the house.</span> <span id="s535">And they took care on her.</span> <span id="s536">And they said, “God sent us a baby daughter.”</span> <span id="s537">And they took care till after she was three years.</span> <span id="s538">They didn't want to give her back after the war.</span> <span id="s539">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">But you know they took away and they appreciate very much, too.</span> <span id="s541">The daughter is alive.</span> <span id="s542">She is now 50 something.</span> <span id="s543">And last year, she was there and she saw not the family -- the family's dead already -- but the children of the family.</span> <span id="s544">And this is -- she is alive today.</span> <span id="s545">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">01:39:12</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Let's talk about the community in the forest and when it got big, and the ziemlankas?</span> <span id="s548">A: Ziemlankaziemlanka.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Tell me about building those for the winter.</span> <span id="s550">Tell me how they were made and how many there were and who stayed in them, and what they were used for.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">6 Lola Dzienciolski 7 Earthen hut (Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I never stayed there.</span> <span id="s553">I went only to visit, because I had my parents there.</span> <span id="s554">This was for families, for sick folk, for children, for old.</span> <span id="s555">They had two fighters, because they went for food.</span> <span id="s556">And they stayed there the ziemlankas – they called them ziemlankas -- for the winter.</span> <span id="s557">It was like small rooms.</span> <span id="s558">And many -- this was one row with houses, second row, third one.</span> <span id="s559">They had a factory.</span> <span id="s560">They made there – bakers they had -- they had bread they made.</span> <span id="s561">They made other foods.</span> <span id="s562">They made for the saddles for the horses.</span> <span id="s563">They made boots for people.</span> <span id="s564">And the Russian partisans, they were coming there.</span> <span id="s565">They were living there.</span> <span id="s566">They had a good dinner there, because you know, you had already everything.</span> <span id="s567">The people were giving you, because they had afraid of their lives.</span> <span id="s568">And they didn't give.</span> <span id="s569">So they send people out, and the people was bringing.</span> <span id="s570">They were not hungry.</span> <span id="s571">They had about 1,000 people.</span> <span id="s572">My husband was always in between the German and the Polish police.</span> <span id="s573">He never stayed there, he came only to visit them.</span> <span id="s574">So it was about 100 miles away from us.</span> <span id="s575">This was the big puszcza, Naliboki.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: How long did that community exist?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: This was staying till the end, till the end.</span> <span id="s578">Q: From – but when did it start?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: It started after the Germans surrendered there.</span> <span id="s580">It was in ‘43, I think, they surrendered there.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">And we were not still there, we were on in the rajonThat mean between the houses.</span> <span id="s582">Between the forest, the small forest, not big.</span> <span id="s583">And got killed, a couple, and I think five or six people got killed.</span> <span id="s584">And then we didn't have already a place there.</span> <span id="s585">It was too many.</span> <span id="s586">So we went to the Naliboki puszcza.</span> <span id="s587">And there we were settled and built the houses and the ziemlankas and the factories and the bakeries and everything.</span> <span id="s588">And the Ge-- and the Russian partisan came to us and they took, they took boots, they took for the horses, whatever they need to drive, too, saddles.</span> <span id="s589">And they were very happy with us.</span> <span id="s590">They had a good time with us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: And you gave them --</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: We gave them everything.</span> <span id="s593">Q: …anything they wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Everything you wanted.</span> <span id="s595">Everything, because they were higher than us.</span> <span id="s596">There in the puszcza, they had like people what they would send from Moscow.</span> <span id="s597">And this you had to give it to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: But you were respected, the Bielskis?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Oh, they were respected all over.</span> <span id="s600">They were respect very much, because when they heard</span></p> <p><span id="s601">8 area (Polish) that the German are making, they wanted to surrender puszcza.</span> <span id="s602">They called right the Bielski brothers and they said, “What to do, how can you help us?”</span> <span id="s603">They wanted to take away Asael and wanted to take away Zusia -- Alex, and Asael didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s604">And Zusia went because he saw that we have no other way.</span> <span id="s605">So he took 150 people, but they were only the fighters.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">And they put him in a new otriad.</span> <span id="s607">This mean a new partisan.</span> <span id="s608">They called Ordzonikidze.</span> <span id="s609">And he was bringing them to Platon.</span> <span id="s610">Platon was the head of all partisan.</span> <span id="s611">He was bringing all of the news, my husband was, like, you know, intell- -- like -- You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Intelligence.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Intelligence, right.</span> <span id="s614">He was the intelligence.</span> <span id="s615">And you were bringing him everything.</span> <span id="s616">And that is what we stayed -- not in the puszcza, he stayed always but five or four miles from the German, four or two miles from the police, the Polish.</span> <span id="s617">And were always fighting.</span> <span id="s618">Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Did you and your husband trust General Platon or -- 01:44:14</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Not always.</span> <span id="s621">Not always.</span> <span id="s622">But remember, he was a very tough guy, my husband.</span> <span id="s623">He was -- till he went out, he would send the people to see if this is correct.</span> <span id="s624">But we didn't have too many things that they said to us that’s true and was not true.</span> <span id="s625">Maybe a couple of times, but not too many.</span> <span id="s626">They had afraid of them.</span> <span id="s627">They had one partisan Victor Panchenko.</span> <span id="s628">He was a Russian commander.</span> <span id="s629">He began the partisan when the Russian people -- the soldier run away from the German, so he had the couple, and he began to be bigger and bigger and bigger.</span> <span id="s630">He was fighting us, too, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s631">Because he said, “You taking away everything; there is nothing for me.”</span> <span id="s632">But they made it okay.</span> <span id="s633">If they will take about 50 -- sometimes Tuvia and Asael sent out about 15, 20 people for bread.</span> <span id="s634">So the Russian partisan, they were taking away the bread.</span> <span id="s635">The were taiking aywat the bread and the salt.</span> <span id="s636">They were taking away the shoes and rifles.</span> <span id="s637">And we came in on that action where they took away everything.</span> <span id="s638">I came in with my husband.</span> <span id="s639">I was -- I didn't go always with him, but this time I went with him.</span> <span id="s640">And he saw that everything, the horses stays, he said, "Where are the people?</span> <span id="s641">Where are Tuvia's partisan?”</span> <span id="s642">He said, “They are in the house.</span> <span id="s643">They took away everything from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Panchenko people took away everything from them.”</span> <span id="s645">He went into the house, and he said, “Who gave it to you?</span> <span id="s646">Who gave it to you the right to take away everything from them?”</span> <span id="s647">So they put the rifles to my husband.</span> <span id="s648">And he took right away the gun and said, "Come on.</span> <span id="s649">Come on, we will fight."</span> <span id="s650">After 15, 10 minutes, another Russian partisan came in and said, “Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">That is nothing.</span> <span id="s652">Come on.</span> <span id="s653">Take away everything.”</span> <span id="s654">They give him away everything, because they had afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: How did they work that out?</span> <span id="s656">How did it end up working out that -- A: The Russian and the Jewish partisan?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: They have places, and they said, “Let's divide this.</span> <span id="s659">The west is yours, the east is ours.”</span> <span id="s660">And that's what they are fighting.</span> <span id="s661">You cannot go in all the places yourself because you have to give a chance to the other one, too.</span> <span id="s662">And then it was quiet.</span> <span id="s663">They were coming to the puszcza, and it was good.</span> <span id="s664">They were drinking vodka, they were eating.</span> <span id="s665">And everything was, again, in order.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">01:47:25</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Tell me about the friction with the other partisans because the Bielskis took in children, the old people, people who couldn't carry guns.</span> <span id="s668">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: I remember today there was a time that too many people came in.</span> <span id="s670">They were sick, and old, and children.</span> <span id="s671">So the other two brothers said, “Listen, we are taking too many.</span> <span id="s672">What will be the end?</span> <span id="s673">Now is summer, is not too bad, in the winter” -- so Tuvia said like that, "I don't care.</span> <span id="s674">I have to give place to everybody.”</span> <span id="s675">The other partisans, they didn't want them, because when -- if somebody was going away from the ghetto and you were a Jew, sometimes they were killing them.</span> <span id="s676">They took away the boots.</span> <span id="s677">They were killing them.</span> <span id="s678">They took whatever they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: You mean the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: The partisans, yes.</span> <span id="s681">But once they took away and somebody told us, so they did the same thing to the Russian.</span> <span id="s682">And they stopped.</span> <span id="s683">They said, “What are you doing?</span> <span id="s684">What are you doing?</span> <span id="s685">What for you need these people, they can't bring nothing.”</span> <span id="s686">But we did – the Bielskis didn't listen to them.</span> <span id="s687">They took in everybody.</span> <span id="s688">This was like the angels.</span> <span id="s689">Where would I go, and hundreds of me?</span> <span id="s690">I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s691">I didn't know the forest.</span> <span id="s692">I even didn't know how to take care of nothing.</span> <span id="s693">I was sitting maybe -- there were people were sitting under the tree and waiting somebody should come to take them.</span> <span id="s694">Didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s695">I have a partisan of ours, he is in London -- Cohen.He was with frozen legs.</span> <span id="s696">This was wintertime.</span> <span id="s697">And he was sitting three days with frozen legs under the tree till he saw from far away horses.</span> <span id="s698">So he covered himself with the snow.</span> <span id="s699">He had afraid.</span> <span id="s700">He heard somebody talking something Commander Bielski.</span> <span id="s701">So he went out.</span> <span id="s702">My husband took him on his horse, and took him to the place where he was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s703">And he is today without the fingers, but he is alive.</span> <span id="s704">And he's in London.</span> <span id="s705">There another thing, we went to Israel a couple years ago, a couple -- about 10, 15 years ago, and when we came, we have there two people what they were in the partisans, and they said to us like that, "You know what, one child wants to see you."</span> <span id="s706">So my husband said, "How old is the child?"</span> <span id="s707">"The child is about 35 years old."</span> <span id="s708">He said, "Who is she?"</span> <span id="s709">"You maybe don't know, but you met her under the tree with her mother.</span> <span id="s710">She was a baby, small baby.</span> <span id="s711">And she was sitting and crying.</span> <span id="s712">She didn't know what to do."</span> <span id="s713">My husband said, "Don't cry.</span> <span id="s714">You will be all right.”</span> <span id="s715">And he went and put her under the horse, the mother and child and they still -- they are alive today with families.</span> <span id="s716">So you cannot 9 Jack (Idel) Kagan remember everything what you did, but you did one thing, you gave them survivals.</span> <span id="s717">You gave them life.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">01:50:38 Then people were not so happy, too, in the partisan, because maybe somebody when he went to take the food, he had more food than somebody sitting the forest.</span> <span id="s719">So -- but he had a piece of bread and the potato.</span> <span id="s720">The other one, maybe put a piece of butter or something else in pocket.</span> <span id="s721">He bring to his girlfriends, so maybe the other one was not happy.</span> <span id="s722">There were command, she -- partisans, but they were the head of 10 or 20 people.</span> <span id="s723">So they had better than somebody else, but that's life.</span> <span id="s724">That's life.</span> <span id="s725">There were many complaints, but this was nothing.</span> <span id="s726">Because the life for them, they were alive.</span> <span id="s727">They went to sleep, and didn't have afraid of the German for a long time.</span> <span id="s728">And this is what they did, the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s729">They will go into history like not many people, because Jewish partisan, Jewish were very little.</span> <span id="s730">There were Jews in other Russian partisan, but not like the Bielskis brother.</span> <span id="s731">They took anybody had the place, anybody had the place.</span> <span id="s732">And that's what they did.</span> <span id="s733">The name -- I know my son.</span> <span id="s734">I have three sons.</span> <span id="s735">They are all born in Israel were.</span> <span id="s736">One is already a doctor, 45.</span> <span id="s737">I have another son, he is 40.</span> <span id="s738">And my baby -- no, the other one is 42.</span> <span id="s739">This one is 41.</span> <span id="s740">And this one, wherever he hears something, he is staying tall.</span> <span id="s741">He is six-two, too.</span> <span id="s742">“That is my father.”</span> <span id="s743">And the fighters, the same thing, like the father.</span> <span id="s744">My son the doctor, in ‘56 -- no, ‘73, he went to Israel.</span> <span id="s745">He left his studies and he were fighting there on the Jordanian border.</span> <span id="s746">My middle one is not so, but the baby, he finish college, and he went and he was a parachute.</span> <span id="s747">You know what is parachute?</span> <span id="s748">And he finished the parachute, they ask him to stay in the army.</span> <span id="s749">He say, “No, I have to go home, because I didn't say goodbye to my parents.”</span></p> <p><span id="s750">01:53:00</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s752">I will ask you something specific.</span> <span id="s753">You saved a person named Daniel Ostraszynski.</span> <span id="s754">A: Yes, Ostraszanski.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Tell me about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Daniel Ostraszanski was a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s757">We studied together in gimnazjum and liceum.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">And he was very intelligent guy.</span> <span id="s759">I took French, he took German.</span> <span id="s760">So when the German came, they ask, “Who knows German?”</span> <span id="s761">So he said he.</span> <span id="s762">And he was in the JudenratSo everybody, you know, you have a family, and you are expecting if you know somebody, he should take care on yourself.</span> <span id="s763">But he couldn't.</span> <span id="s764">He even couldn't take care of his mother and two sisters.</span> <span id="s765">He lost them, too.</span> <span id="s766">After the liquidation of the ghetto, he came to the forest.</span> <span id="s767">I, with my husband, went to sleep, to a village.</span> <span id="s768">And in the morning about seven o'clock, we came with the horses.</span> <span id="s769">My husband, he didn't go by himself, always with 10 people, riders.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">10 Jewish council (German); term used for Jewish administrative boards appointed by the Nazis to oversee Jewish communities and ghettos.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">We came in.</span> <span id="s772">I see my friend is here.</span> <span id="s773">And they took off his boots and they put him on the tree for shooting.</span> <span id="s774">I said, "Listen, Alex. That’s my friends."</span> <span id="s775">He said, "What do you mean your friends?"</span> <span id="s776">I said, "I study with him."</span> <span id="s777">And I told him the story, he couldn't take care of his mother and sisters, too.</span> <span id="s778">So my father – my husband took him out from the tree.</span> <span id="s779">He gave it to him the boots.</span> <span id="s780">And he said like that, “Whatever he did, this will be after the war.</span> <span id="s781">Not now.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">You cannot -- you cannot kill him now, because we will hear his story.</span> <span id="s783">We heard your story, but he has something to say, too.”</span> <span id="s784">And this was -- they took him off of the tree, and he is still alive in Israel.</span> <span id="s785">He is accountant, 20 people working for him.</span> <span id="s786">Whatever he did, I don't know.</span> <span id="s787">I don't know.</span> <span id="s788">My brother was, too, was in August 15 died.</span> <span id="s789">Maybe if I would see something, I would have said, “You could save my brothers.”</span> <span id="s790">But he couldn't save.</span> <span id="s791">He couldn't save his own family.</span> <span id="s792">How could he save somebody else?</span> <span id="s793">But the people, you know, they looking for something.</span> <span id="s794">You know, when you losing a child, you losing a mother, you losing a brother, you want to say, “that's his fault,” but that is not true.</span> <span id="s795">Not in my book.</span> <span id="s796">And he is still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">And he is my best friends.</span> <span id="s798">He was my friends, and he is my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Did he also rescue anybody?</span> <span id="s800">A: Ostraszynski?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: It's just that he -- they thought he was a collaborator?</span> <span id="s804">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: and you think he couldn’t have been— A; He never was.</span> <span id="s806">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Because if he had been, he would have saved his family?</span> <span id="s808">A: Right.</span> <span id="s809">No, he was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s811">Well, we're almost out, so we should break.</span> <span id="s812">Okay.</span> <span id="s813">We're going to change roles.</span> <span id="s814">It's 10:30.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">01:56:53 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s817">02:01:18</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: I want to talk about the food collections.</span> <span id="s819">Did you ever go on the food collections, or was that just a specific --</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Tell me about the rules with the food collections?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Mostly for the food, when the boys -- you have to mention, too, because there were heroes.</span> <span id="s823">Not everybody was going and eating the food, because they were collecting the food for the whole people.</span> <span id="s824">And they were wonderful young people.</span> <span id="s825">They gave lives away.</span> <span id="s826">I have to mention their names.</span> <span id="s827">You don't mind?</span> <span id="s828">Okay.</span> <span id="s829">One was Pesach Friedberg.</span> <span id="s830">One was Boris Rubin.</span> <span id="s831">One was the “Aloshki,” they called him.</span> <span id="s832">They were from the -- our city.</span> <span id="s833">They were not so -- you never knew them, but they were very good boys.</span> <span id="s834">They went and collect the food and they give the food to the place where everybody has to give.</span> <span id="s835">Janek Rudniski.</span> <span id="s836">Olek Peck.</span> <span id="s837">Alexander Peck.</span> <span id="s838">They were the best guys.</span> <span id="s839">The best.</span> <span id="s840">They didn't have afraid for nothing.</span> <span id="s841">They knew that they have to go collect the food, because if not -- if they will not collect, they will die from hunger.</span> <span id="s842">That's not when you live in a small village and you are not far, 500 mi-- 500 feet, and you can go in and ask for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s843">This was far away from the villages.</span> <span id="s844">This was in a puszcza, Puszcza Naliboki.</span> <span id="s845">If you will go out yourself, the animals will kill you.</span> <span id="s846">So they knew what they were doing, and they did a marvelous job.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">They were fighting and they were taking the food and they were bringing the food.</span> <span id="s848">And nobody should forget the Bielskis brother -- without the people, they will not be Bielskis partisan.</span> <span id="s849">They were the heads, but they have to work with something.</span> <span id="s850">And the young people made the partisans.</span> <span id="s851">That is what you have to give credit.</span> <span id="s852">There is no commander without the army.</span> <span id="s853">And not everybody likes to mention this, but I have to mention.</span> <span id="s854">Eisenhower would never win the war without the young people from the United States, without the fighters.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">They made him whatever he was.</span> <span id="s856">The same thing with the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s857">The people that were surrounding them, the young boys, they were not afraid of nothing.</span> <span id="s858">The commander sent them and they went.</span> <span id="s859">You have never to forget this.</span> <span id="s860">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">02:04:18</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Tell me about the food collections, did these – they go every day?</span> <span id="s863">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Tell me how big of a job it was and how long they spent and tell me, could they just take anything they wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: No.</span> <span id="s866">They went out like every second week, every week.</span> <span id="s867">They didn't have bread.</span> <span id="s868">Later, they had bread.</span> <span id="s869">They bake bread by themselves.</span> <span id="s870">But in beginning, no.</span> <span id="s871">They couldn't grab meat.</span> <span id="s872">They couldn't grab whatever.</span> <span id="s873">If the villages had something too much, they took it.</span> <span id="s874">But you cannot grab everything for them.</span> <span id="s875">Because once you take away and the other one, they will send the German on you.</span> <span id="s876">So you had to be afraid, too.</span> <span id="s877">You have to let them survive, too, the war.</span> <span id="s878">The war was a very bad war.</span> <span id="s879">And that is what the Bielskis did.</span> <span id="s880">You cannot take away the pillow, the last one from them.</span> <span id="s881">They were people, young, they didn't know.</span> <span id="s882">They took the pillow, they took the cover.</span> <span id="s883">What for?</span> <span id="s884">But they took.</span> <span id="s885">They were complaining to the Russian partisans that, “They took away my pillow.</span> <span id="s886">They took away my last piece of meat.”</span> <span id="s887">So the Bielskis took care on that.</span> <span id="s888">You couldn't take away everything.</span> <span id="s889">You take only that’s what you have to.</span> <span id="s890">Bread we needed, that's what you have to take, nothing else.</span> <span id="s891">You have to be very careful.</span> <span id="s892">But they went out every two weeks, every three weeks.</span> <span id="s893">Whatever they needed went out.</span> <span id="s894">They were fighting the way to go out, too.</span> <span id="s895">So it's not so easy.</span> <span id="s896">That's what you have to remind the young guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: So how big of a group?</span> <span id="s898">And then, would they be gone -- A: Ten.</span> <span id="s899">Ten people.</span> <span id="s900">Minimum 10 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Overnight?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: They went overnight.</span> <span id="s903">Sometimes they were three nights away, too.</span> <span id="s904">And they were thinking they will never see them, but then later they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Do you know about the time when they -- Do you know about a guy named Belarus?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Belarus?</span> <span id="s907">They took a coat.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: No.</span> <span id="s909">I don't know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: You don't know that.</span> <span id="s911">Okay.</span> <span id="s912">You say that you didn't sleep in the forest.</span> <span id="s913">You came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Not always.</span> <span id="s915">In the summertime, sometimes.</span> <span id="s916">In the wintertime, never.</span> <span id="s917">My husband didn't like it to sleep outside.</span> <span id="s918">And the same thing, in the same house.</span> <span id="s919">He was always one night a couple of hours in one house, and then five miles away in the other house tomorrow for another day.</span> <span id="s920">He had afraid.</span> <span id="s921">He was always with people, because they were looking for us.</span> <span id="s922">They gave thousands of marks to -- only to find the Bielskis – a head.</span> <span id="s923">So they have -- the people, the Polish people, they have two people what they were looking for the Bielskis to give them the head.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: How exhausted were you from this?</span> <span id="s925">How tired were you all of the time?</span> <span id="s926">I mean, you must have had not gotten much sleep or--</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: You see, I cannot say that I was always tired, no.</span> <span id="s928">You cannot say that, because there were weeks, two or three weeks that you didn't hear about the German.</span> <span id="s929">But later when we left puszcza, yes.</span> <span id="s930">When I was with my husband already between the German and the Polish, there was no sleep.</span> <span id="s931">You were always watching yourself every step, because you didn't know from where is it coming.</span> <span id="s932">You had to go for water and you have to wash yourself.</span> <span id="s933">Because all over the water was divided between the villages.</span> <span id="s934">And there were washing the things there and drinking the water and bathing themselves.</span> <span id="s935">So all over there were people and ice.</span> <span id="s936">And we have to watch ourselves.</span> <span id="s937">The worst thing was in the winter.</span> <span id="s938">The worst thing, because it was cold.</span> <span id="s939">And the snow will tell you where the people are.</span> <span id="s940">And to take the food was very bad, because you couldn't go off it -- you have to take the food on a wagon or something.</span> <span id="s941">So you left always -- you saw every step, you were watching.</span> <span id="s942">I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s943">You see, I was never afraid when I was with my husband.</span> <span id="s944">Never.</span> <span id="s945">But as soon as I didn't see him, I was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">02:09:20</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: How -- do you know about how they got weapons in the beginning?</span> <span id="s948">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: In the beginning, the Bielskis brother had – they’ve lived always in a village, so they were feel more secure when they had something with them.</span> <span id="s951">So they had small things, small rifles.</span> <span id="s952">They were went to a paysan, the villages, and he said, "You know, when the Russian ran away, they left a lot of rifles, in this and this house.</span> <span id="s953">You get."</span> <span id="s954">So they went to the village and said, "Listen, how many you have?"</span> <span id="s955">He said, "I have only one."</span> <span id="s956">He said, "Give me the one."</span> <span id="s957">When he went for the one, they find more than one.</span> <span id="s958">So they got the rifles from the villages.</span> <span id="s959">Later, they made -- 10 or five German, they went for the food.</span> <span id="s960">German were always looking for food, for eggs, for chickens, whatever.</span> <span id="s961">So they made an ambush on them.</span> <span id="s962">They saw them going and coming back.</span> <span id="s963">They made an ambush of them.</span> <span id="s964">They kill them.</span> <span id="s965">They took the boots.</span> <span id="s966">They took the foods and the rifles.</span> <span id="s967">And this was the beginning.</span> <span id="s968">Later, with the Russian -- in the beginning, they were fighting together with the Russian, the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s969">They didn't have so many people, so they were fighting together.</span> <span id="s970">And they were dividing the rifles, whatever they finded.</span> <span id="s971">But the German, that they find, they had them, so they had enough.</span> <span id="s972">They didn't have enough, in the beginning, people.</span> <span id="s973">And they have enough rifles.</span> <span id="s974">And you had people what came from the ghetto, they knew how to clean them, how to take care of them.</span> <span id="s975">So the rifles was very good.</span> <span id="s976">This is the beginning.</span> <span id="s977">Later, the Russian in ‘43, the beginning, they were sending them us by plane.</span> <span id="s978">But we were paying them.</span> <span id="s979">Nobody knew about it, but I knew.</span> <span id="s980">I knew it.</span> <span id="s981">They preparing -- they took from everybody whatever they have, a ring, or a watch, whatever they had.</span> <span id="s982">They giving away and they give to the Russian commander, to Platon, or whatever.</span> <span id="s983">And they give us for that the rifles.</span> <span id="s984">This was not easy, but they managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">02:11:40</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Tell me, were you involved in the move when they moved to the Naliboki forest in 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Were you there for the whole moving?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: I were, but not for a long time, because the Russian commander, Platon, told my husband he is the head of the intelligence and he has to go.</span> <span id="s989">So he took 150 people, but they were young, with rifles.</span> <span id="s990">They were fighters.</span> <span id="s991">And he took me, too.</span> <span id="s992">And I went with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Tell me what you know about the move.</span> <span id="s994">What--</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: The move was very bad.</span> <span id="s996">I will tell you why; because nobody knew what to expect.</span> <span id="s997">You know, when you are sitting in a place, you are moving from one place to another one, only a couple of -- not miles, but kilometers was there, so you know what to expect.</span> <span id="s998">Yeah?</span> <span id="s999">But now you have to go to a puszcza, to Naliboki puszcza.</span> <span id="s1000">From where will you take food so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">How will you survive there?</span> <span id="s1002">So not everybody was happy with that, but they didn't have nothing to say, because Platon said this is the only survival.</span> <span id="s1003">“You have to go.</span> <span id="s1004">I don't want him here.</span> <span id="s1005">I don't want him here between the German and the Polish police.</span> <span id="s1006">I want him there, because they are in the way for fighters.”</span> <span id="s1007">That's what Tuvia and Asael did.</span> <span id="s1008">They didn't have nothing to say.</span> <span id="s1009">Because over them--</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: They didn't move because they wanted to be in a--</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1012">Platon told him, “The kids and the women and the old are in the way.</span> <span id="s1013">You cannot -- you have to take them away.”</span> <span id="s1014">So that's why they took them to the Puszcza Naliboki.</span> <span id="s1015">And the fighters stayed outside.</span> <span id="s1016">So from time to time, every once in two, three weeks, or four weeks, it was quiet, so my husband took the 10 or 15 horses with him and me and we went to visit my parents.</span> <span id="s1017">We went to visit the people, but we knew them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: And it was far?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: It was far.</span> <span id="s1020">It was, I think.</span> <span id="s1021">There, 50 miles was far.</span> <span id="s1022">That's not when you are sitting in a car going 50 miles is nothing.</span> <span id="s1023">But on horses, you have to be quiet when you are going.</span> <span id="s1024">At night you couldn't go either, you didn't know how to go.</span> <span id="s1025">But in the daytime, you know.</span> <span id="s1026">My husband was looking on the tree and he knew where he is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: So when you would go and visit, it was a big -- it was three days?</span> <span id="s1028">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1029">We went, we stayed three days or four days, whatever.</span> <span id="s1030">02:14:42</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Tell me about when Regina Ticktin got the flu and you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1033">Chrapiniewo this was ‘43, in the beginning, I think.</span> <span id="s1034">Right, ‘43?</span> <span id="s1035">Q: Yeah, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: They got -- came once a man and he said -- not the man, it was the villages, and he said that the German preparing for Iwje.</span> <span id="s1037">It was a city, Iwje.</span> <span id="s1038">Iwje.</span> <span id="s1039">Preparing action for Iwje.</span> <span id="s1040">So they got in touch with the people there, the Bielskis, and they said, “We will come and we will take you out from the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s1041">This was not too many already, you see, because there was action and action.</span> <span id="s1042">And over staying in Chrapiniewo -- this was a village before Iwje.</span> <span id="s1043">It was two houses.</span> <span id="s1044">One house I was staying with Chaya, and the other house was Grishaand the Ticktins.</span> <span id="s1045">This was Tuvia's girlfriends, Sonia, and her sister, Regina.</span> <span id="s1046">She had the flu so, they were staying in another house, not with us together.</span> <span id="s1047">And they let us stay in the two houses with a couple of men with rifles, with pulemyot,you know, and it was the automatic, everything.</span> <span id="s1048">And they went for -- there were about 60 or 50 people to take out the people from the ghetto, Iwje.</span> <span id="s1049">But when they came already, it was too late.</span> <span id="s1050">It's not like you are going a mile or two and that's it, but they were surrounded, the German and everything.</span> <span id="s1051">But the Germans were very smart.</span> <span id="s1052">They knew that we are in the two houses, so they surround us, too.</span> <span id="s1053">I was in the first house near the forest, and Regina with Sonia, Tuvia's girlfriends, were in the other house.</span> <span id="s1054">When they surround us from in the back, we heard already they came in white.</span> <span id="s1055">You know, was winter.</span> <span id="s1056">The snow with the white things, you couldn't know that somebody is moving.</span> <span id="s1057">But a commander in Russia, a Russian commander, a Russian partisan, he knew that we are staying there.</span> <span id="s1058">And he came and said, "Go out right away from the house, because you will get killed.</span> <span id="s1059">The German are around."</span> <span id="s1060">I was out without boots, without a coat, without nothing.</span> <span id="s1061">And I said to Chaya -- Chaya was the wife of Asael -- I said, "Go.</span> <span id="s1062">You will tell how I died."</span> <span id="s1063">She said, "I am not going with you -- without you."</span> <span id="s1064">And she took me for the hand.</span> <span id="s1065">I fall in snow.</span> <span id="s1066">The snow was so deep.</span> <span id="s1067">Fall in snow ‘til end.</span> <span id="s1068">I said, "I am not going.</span> <span id="s1069">Okay," I said.</span> <span id="s1070">"So I will die together with you here.</span> <span id="s1071">I am not going."</span> <span id="s1072">She took me for the hand and led me to the forest.</span> <span id="s1073">They were near our noses and we survived.</span> <span id="s1074">She gave me the hand and she said, "Sonia, you are not staying.</span> <span id="s1075">I cannot come to Zusia and say that I let you down.”</span> <span id="s1076">And this was all of them that dying, only me and Chaya survive, and another partisan.</span> <span id="s1077">What is his name?</span> <span id="s1078">It was “Aloshka,” “Aloshka.”</span> <span id="s1079">“Aloshka” they called him.</span> <span id="s1080">He took us out.</span> <span id="s1081">We were in the forest till at night.</span> <span id="s1082">At night, he went and took a sled and we came to the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s1083">But they were fighting very hard the first round.</span> <span id="s1084">There was fighting, and they were fighting, we could survive.</span> <span id="s1085">We couldn't run away.</span> <span id="s1086">And when the Bielskis came, they didn't know that we are survived, nothing.</span> <span id="s1087">They saw only the two houses in flame.</span> <span id="s1088">That's it.</span> <span id="s1089">They were thinking that everybody is gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">02:18:46</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: So it was a Russian partisan that warned you and saved you in that case?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1093">He said, “Go out because this is the end of that,” and he show us how to go out, the way, because this was the first time that we went there.</span> <span id="s1094">We didn't know where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Oh, there was a secret way out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">11 Grisha Meitis</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">12 Machinegun (Russian)</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1099">Yeah, he knew.</span> <span id="s1100">He knew the secret, how to go out.</span> <span id="s1101">Because when you are surround, you have to know a place where -- how to go out.</span> <span id="s1102">If not, you are finished.</span> <span id="s1103">And he told the partisan, the “Aloshka,” where to take us.</span> <span id="s1104">And he took us like that, and we survived.</span> <span id="s1105">There were very beautiful people, too.</span> <span id="s1106">Beautiful people.</span> <span id="s1107">You should never forget they were beautiful Russian people and Polish people.</span> <span id="s1108">They were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Well, you talked about the commander's nothing without his army, but did the Bielskis need to do what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: No.</span> <span id="s1111">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Why did they do it?</span> <span id="s1113">Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: I think because of the good heart.</span> <span id="s1115">They are wonderful people with a good heart.</span> <span id="s1116">If he had a piece of bread, he will divide it between -- if there is four people there, or six people there, he would divide it.</span> <span id="s1117">He will give you the last bite.</span> <span id="s1118">They were wonderful, wonderful people.</span> <span id="s1119">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s1120">They are not born no more like that.</span> <span id="s1121">Maybe they are born, but we don't know them.</span> <span id="s1122">Only because of the good heart.</span> <span id="s1123">Because they could survive like the best people.</span> <span id="s1124">They could survive by the ladies.</span> <span id="s1125">They took care on them.</span> <span id="s1126">And they choose not to.</span> <span id="s1127">They choose to take her out some people.</span> <span id="s1128">And remember, 1,500 people they took her out, and 1,200 people, I think, survive.</span> <span id="s1129">They lost about 300 people.</span> <span id="s1130">But they did a very good job.</span> <span id="s1131">I think in the history you cannot find like that.</span> <span id="s1132">Maybe, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s1133">I know the Polish history.</span> <span id="s1134">I know the Jewish history.</span> <span id="s1135">I know the French history.</span> <span id="s1136">But I didn't know something like that.</span> <span id="s1137">People should divide their lives with people what they didn't know even.</span> <span id="s1138">They were great, great people.</span> <span id="s1139">And good people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: And they left a legacy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1142">I know one thing, that people came out without boots from the ghetto, without clothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s1143">So the first thing what they did, the commander go and bring her pair of boots, bring her something to wear it.</span> <span id="s1144">And they did.</span> <span id="s1145">They did everything they were told.</span> <span id="s1146">Sometimes there were people that they didn't hear, so they taught them a lesson.</span> <span id="s1147">Next time he didn't go.</span> <span id="s1148">And he was young, he wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1149">But they changed.</span> <span id="s1150">In the beginning, not.</span> <span id="s1151">They were robbing.</span> <span id="s1152">They were taking many things.</span> <span id="s1153">But later, they learned their lesson.</span> <span id="s1154">They took only what they told them.</span> <span id="s1155">I think the history didn't forgot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">02:22:26</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Now, there was an incident in November of ‘42 with a group that left to go to a puszcza, the Lu---</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Lipiczanka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Lipiczanka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1161">In the beginning, everybody wanted to be a commander.</span> <span id="s1162">So in the beginning, it was – I think it was maybe about 20 people or maybe 25, maybe 30.</span> <span id="s1163">I was already in the forest.</span> <span id="s1164">And this was Motke Berger, Lubczanski brothers and another 10 people.</span> <span id="s1165">And they said, "Why are you a commander?</span> <span id="s1166">Who gave to you the right?</span> <span id="s1167">We don't want to go there.</span> <span id="s1168">We don't want to do that."</span> <span id="s1169">So the Bielskis brother said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s1170">You don't have to be.</span> <span id="s1171">You came here.</span> <span id="s1172">Now you have to go.</span> <span id="s1173">You leave everything what took here, the rifles, and you can go.”</span> <span id="s1174">And they left.</span> <span id="s1175">After two days, they came begging.</span> <span id="s1176">"We don't know where to go.</span> <span id="s1177">We want to be with you."</span> <span id="s1178">And this was the end of the Lubczanski.</span> <span id="s1179">They didn't go -- they didn't stay, I think, more than three days and they came back begging.</span> <span id="s1180">We know the people.</span> <span id="s1181">But everybody is entitled to a mistake.</span> <span id="s1182">They made a mistake.</span> <span id="s1183">“I don't want to go fight for them or for her or for him.</span> <span id="s1184">My father and mother died.</span> <span id="s1185">My sister died.</span> <span id="s1186">My wife is dead.</span> <span id="s1187">I don't want to go.”</span> <span id="s1188">“You don't want it?</span> <span id="s1189">Go ahead.”</span> <span id="s1190">They didn't touch them.</span> <span id="s1191">They only leave the rifles and go.</span> <span id="s1192">And they were very good partisans.</span> <span id="s1193">And a couple of them, they are alive now.</span> <span id="s1194">There were more people, other ones what -- that didn't work, not so good and not so fine.</span> <span id="s1195">They went to Platon and they said that the Bielskis brother are communist.</span> <span id="s1196">And when the Bielskis brother came there to Platon, he said, "You have people what are there that are no good."</span> <span id="s1197">They said, "We know that."</span> <span id="s1198">But they didn't touch them.</span> <span id="s1199">A couple of times they killed them, other ones.</span> <span id="s1200">But this was a must already, you know, so it was too much.</span> <span id="s1201">But otherwise, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">02:24:41</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Tell me about order and rules within the otriad.</span> <span id="s1204">Tell me how --</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: It was order.</span> <span id="s1206">And they said -- they came out in the morning and they said, “Listen, today this three, this seven, these 10 people are going for food.</span> <span id="s1207">These are staying and watching the camp.”</span> <span id="s1208">The camp was always watched by the people.</span> <span id="s1209">So once he said, “I cannot go.</span> <span id="s1210">I have a cold.</span> <span id="s1211">I have a bad headache.</span> <span id="s1212">I have something.”</span> <span id="s1213">This was only in the beginning, but later it was Malbin.He was an old fighter, a Polish fighter.</span> <span id="s1214">And he knew how to give the order.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">And he helped a lot, to the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s1216">They were another couple of people, what they were helping them, and they had the army.</span> <span id="s1217">They were in the Polish army.</span> <span id="s1218">So they knew how to give the order.</span> <span id="s1219">And Tuvia by himself was in the army.</span> <span id="s1220">Zusia was in the army.</span> <span id="s1221">So they knew how to give the order.</span> <span id="s1222">And there is no such a thing, “no.”</span> <span id="s1223">Everything is “yes, yes, and yes.”</span> <span id="s1224">Because if everybody would do whatever he wants, it was bad.</span> <span id="s1225">Nobody would be alive today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Well, what happened if somebody didn't do it?</span> <span id="s1227">I mean, tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: There were a prison in the camp.</span> <span id="s1229">They were sitting in the prison.</span> <span id="s1230">They couldn't get the food.</span> <span id="s1231">And this was a very big help.</span> <span id="s1232">But very minor incident like that.</span> <span id="s1233">Everybody was -- knew that</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">13 Lazar Malbin you cannot get away with something like that.</span> <span id="s1235">You have to listen.</span> <span id="s1236">And they were listening.</span> <span id="s1237">There were people very sick with typhus.</span> <span id="s1238">With everything in the forest, in the puszcza, we had doctors, we had nurses.</span> <span id="s1239">We have everything, but what you need is in one city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">02:26:48</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Didn't some people just want to kill the first people who had typhus for fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Yeah, but they didn't let them.</span> <span id="s1243">They wanted.</span> <span id="s1244">This was a couple of people that got typhus.</span> <span id="s1245">And the doctor said, “It's no good because everybody will get.</span> <span id="s1246">So maybe you should put them away.”</span> <span id="s1247">So they said, "Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1248">We will take."</span> <span id="s1249">The hospital was far away a little from the camp, and the doctors and the nurses worked with them together, and said "They can die by themselves, but we will not kill sick people."</span> <span id="s1250">And then -- but there were people that said, “We have to kill them.”</span> <span id="s1251">But nobody get killed and everybody got well because of the hearts, the Bielskis heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: What about babies?</span> <span id="s1253">Were there any babies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Not too many.</span> <span id="s1255">Not too many.</span> <span id="s1256">Were a couple of babies.</span> <span id="s1257">They came with babies.</span> <span id="s1258">Because if you were pregnant, we had a doctor what he did what he had to do.</span> <span id="s1259">And there were six or 10 babies that came with the parents, but that's all.</span> <span id="s1260">We didn't let her go pregnant.</span> <span id="s1261">This was not the place for pregnancy.</span> <span id="s1262">And they said, “You have to be very careful.”</span> <span id="s1263">Because if you were a girl, young, 16 or 17 years old, if you were by yourself, you couldn't get everything.</span> <span id="s1264">You wouldn't -- you didn't have shoes.</span> <span id="s1265">You didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s1266">So everybody was looking for somebody, a partisan, who should take care on her.</span> <span id="s1267">So that's what happened.</span> <span id="s1268">And many people are still alive together.</span> <span id="s1269">They got together in the forest and they went out from the forest with them.</span> <span id="s1270">And they have children and families and everything.</span> <span id="s1271">And other ones went away.</span> <span id="s1272">They were looking for something better.</span> <span id="s1273">I don't know if they made it better or worse.</span> <span id="s1274">This is after then.</span> <span id="s1275">But this was mostly all the girls, whatever they had, they were with a partisan, with somebody should keep them company and to watch on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Protect them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Protect them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: From --</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Protect them from everything, from cold.</span> <span id="s1280">Nobody went to a girl and said, “You have to sleep with me.”</span> <span id="s1281">No.</span> <span id="s1282">If she slept with him, she wanted.</span> <span id="s1283">He couldn't do something to her what she didn't want it.</span> <span id="s1284">No.</span> <span id="s1285">Nobody tortured.</span> <span id="s1286">It’s not like today, you going out, you don't know if you will coming home.</span> <span id="s1287">There you knew that if you don't want it, nobody will touch you.</span> <span id="s1288">It was an order, and they were listening very careful to everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">02:29:50</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: The big hunt, do you know about the big hunt?</span> <span id="s1291">Were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: This was in ‘43.</span> <span id="s1293">Right?</span> <span id="s1294">We were surrounded with the army, the German army.</span> <span id="s1295">And we went till here in water [interviewee gestures].</span> <span id="s1296">And in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Mud?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Mud.</span> <span id="s1299">And it was hunger.</span> <span id="s1300">We were sitting there 10 days, and we heard the German talking to each other.</span> <span id="s1301">We heard the dogs barking.</span> <span id="s1302">And they were shooting over our head and nobody opened their mouth.</span> <span id="s1303">Somebody opened, "I am dying."</span> <span id="s1304">So my husband came, "You are not dying yet, but you will die now.</span> <span id="s1305">I will kill you."</span> <span id="s1306">And this is the big hunt was.</span> <span id="s1307">They didn't kill too many from us, because we were sitting in the mud.</span> <span id="s1308">And my husband opened -- I told you that he open the road.</span> <span id="s1309">He went out the first because he couldn't take the hunger.</span> <span id="s1310">I went with him.</span> <span id="s1311">I think 100 people were.</span> <span id="s1312">I mentioned that when we went -- when the German only left five minutes ago, the fires still was burning.</span> <span id="s1313">They saw the cans of the food, they didn't touch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">02:31:10</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Tell me -- go back to the beginning and explain to me what happened.</span> <span id="s1316">The Germans came close and surrounded the whole, the whole --</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Right, the whole.</span> <span id="s1318">The German couldn't go -- 10 there Germans, or 20.</span> <span id="s1319">It was a big place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">They took it the whole army, the German army.</span> <span id="s1321">They surrounded the whole puszcza.</span> <span id="s1322">In the beginning, in the forest, too.</span> <span id="s1323">If they were surrounded in the forest, we were sitting, they would kill us all.</span> <span id="s1324">But they didn't surround it.</span> <span id="s1325">There were not so many Germans.</span> <span id="s1326">They were busy on the fronts.</span> <span id="s1327">Later, when they run away from the fronts, when they went away already, they took of whole army of German and they wanted to kill all of the people that were in the puszcza, in the Naliboki.</span> <span id="s1328">But it was very difficult, to do it, too.</span> <span id="s1329">Because they didn't want to lose their lives, too.</span> <span id="s1330">They couldn't come with tanks.</span> <span id="s1331">That's a forest, a wild forest.</span> <span id="s1332">So who wants to risk their life when they see everything that’s going kaput?</span> <span id="s1333">They were seeing everything is going kaput.</span> <span id="s1334">You know what that’s meaning?</span> <span id="s1335">Everything is gone to the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Hitler is gone.</span> <span id="s1337">Everything is going down.</span> <span id="s1338">So he was looking by himself to survive.</span> <span id="s1339">So he didn't go to forests, because if he would go ‘til the mud, he will kill us all.</span> <span id="s1340">He didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1341">He knew that’s will be the end of his life, too.</span> <span id="s1342">That was the big hunt.</span> <span id="s1343">Many people die.</span> <span id="s1344">Many partisan died, but from the Bielskis, nobody had brains to sit in the mud.</span> <span id="s1345">And they said, “that’s the only survive, to sit in the mud, because they will not come here.”</span> <span id="s1346">And that's how we survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Who decided to go to the swamp and sit in the mud?</span> <span id="s1348">How did--?</span> <span id="s1349">A: The Bielskis brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: And how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Happen we had one man, what -- I don't remember his name, and he was working always there, in the puszcza.</span> <span id="s1352">And he was from Naliboki.</span> <span id="s1353">And he said that he remember that not far from the beginning of the puszcza there is mud.</span> <span id="s1354">Nobody can go into the mud.</span> <span id="s1355">So the Bielskis brothers were talking to each other and they decided that we have to try this way, because we couldn't go out from there.</span> <span id="s1356">We were surrounded with the army and this was their decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">We went to the mud and was sitting in the mud, I think, about 7, 10 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">02:33:42</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Tell me the details of that.</span> <span id="s1360">How did families stay together in the mud and everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: They were staying and sleeping in the mud.</span> <span id="s1362">And they are not talking because nothing was to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1363">You couldn't talk, because we heard the German talking.</span> <span id="s1364">And they didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s1365">You know, everybody has a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1366">That they knew there would come a moment that they will not have nothing.</span> <span id="s1367">So they had a package – a small package of bread, so they were mumbling about the bread till the bread ends.</span> <span id="s1368">How long can you hold a piece of bread?</span> <span id="s1369">They kill one horse.</span> <span id="s1370">In a minute, the meat went away.</span> <span id="s1371">They were eating the horse, dead.</span> <span id="s1372">And this is it -- listen, there is no -- people get used to everything.</span> <span id="s1373">How could you eat a piece of meat raw, meat from a horse, from a dead horse?</span> <span id="s1374">But they were eating.</span> <span id="s1375">We see now, too, in the United States, some days friends went out and a plane fall.</span> <span id="s1376">I don't remember when was it.</span> <span id="s1377">And the friends eat the meat of the other friends.</span> <span id="s1378">I don't remember, but it was like -- something like that.</span> <span id="s1379">So this is it.</span> <span id="s1380">You are trying.</span> <span id="s1381">The survival is so big that you want to do everything to survive.</span> <span id="s1382">Same thing was in the partisan.</span> <span id="s1383">You were thinking that you will survive.</span> <span id="s1384">You will see a world.</span> <span id="s1385">You will see somebody.</span> <span id="s1386">Maybe somebody is still alive.</span> <span id="s1387">So they were hoping, always hope that something will happen good with you.</span> <span id="s1388">And that’s was holding us all together.</span> <span id="s1389">When we were sitting at night and they were singing -- far in the puszcza, nobody was there, only us -- so we were singing and -- you know -- and talking, so they said, “You know what?”</span> <span id="s1390">this is already a couple of years like that – “I am sure that this will be a break.</span> <span id="s1391">Roosevelt will send somebody here and we will survive.”</span> <span id="s1392">Only hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Nobody was thinking that, “I will die.”</span> <span id="s1394">When I was asking my husband some place, "Tell me, will we survive?"</span> <span id="s1395">He said to me like that, "I don't know about me, but you will survive."</span> <span id="s1396">And I was quiet then.</span> <span id="s1397">I was so sure that whatever he said to me this will be.</span> <span id="s1398">This is the hope.</span> <span id="s1399">He gave it to me, the hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">02:36:16</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: Did anybody drown in the swamp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1403">Yes, but this was nothing.</span> <span id="s1404">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1405">The sick, the old one couldn't take it, the hunger.</span> <span id="s1406">But it was not too many, probably about five or six, whatever.</span> <span id="s1407">We didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s1408">This was the day and this is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: And then when you went back to the puszcza, but it was gone, the Germans destroyed it?</span> <span id="s1410">A: No.</span> <span id="s1411">You cannot destroy the puszcza.</span> <span id="s1412">The puszcza stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1414">No, but the ziemlankas, the villages?</span> <span id="s1415">A: The villages around?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: No, the thing you had created, the partisan village?</span> <span id="s1417">Your--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: No.</span> <span id="s1419">It stayed, because in the last days when the German was running so we went out from the ziemlankas because they had afraid.</span> <span id="s1420">The Germans came on the ziemlankas.</span> <span id="s1421">They were keeping themselves there – they were keeping, so -- and we left.</span> <span id="s1422">We left everything.</span> <span id="s1423">Many were killed by us, but they killed, too, a couple of us.</span> <span id="s1424">We left everything.</span> <span id="s1425">I know last year -- two years ago a group went to see them.</span> <span id="s1426">There is some ziemlankas still staying.</span> <span id="s1427">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1428">They were built beautiful.</span> <span id="s1429">In the winter was not cold.</span> <span id="s1430">They live like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: In the winter, how did you heat them, the fire in the middle of them?</span> <span id="s1432">Tell me about--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1434">In the ziemlankas, was a small fireplace.</span> <span id="s1435">Like here, you have a fireplace.</span> <span id="s1436">And this was warm.</span> <span id="s1437">They were cooking, because everybody was cooking for themselves later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: With a hole in the roof?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1440">Yes.</span> <span id="s1441">Mostly they were cooking at night, not in the daytime.</span> <span id="s1442">They should not see the fume from there.</span> <span id="s1443">They knew how to behave.</span> <span id="s1444">They knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">02:38:29</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Tell me about the tunnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: The tunnel was built in the court.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Tell me when we are.</span> <span id="s1449">This is near the end, right?</span> <span id="s1450">This is when there weren't many Jews left?</span> <span id="s1451">A: No many, not many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Describe to me the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A The situation -- I was not there, but I will tell you.</span> <span id="s1454">Ostraszynski, Daniel, and my best friends Bursztyn,they were planning this and they did it.</span> <span id="s1455">Nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s1456">But the ones they</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">14 Moshe Burnstein called the Bursztyn -- I don't know how else -- this my friends.</span> <span id="s1458">And they took him to the prison and he wrote with his fingers with blood that they asking him, but he told them he didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s1459">They killed him.</span> <span id="s1460">But Ostraszynski went out, too, from the tunnel.</span> <span id="s1461">And many friends of mine Oshmans, Sonia, Aaron, another couple, they went out from the tunnel.</span> <span id="s1462">Not everybody, because the first group went out, but the second group got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">They caught them going out from the tunnel.</span> <span id="s1464">But a couple, when they went out, they saying and they telling us how was it.</span> <span id="s1465">They were working at night.</span> <span id="s1466">Nobody knew about it till somebody told them that -- they heard something is going on so quiet.</span> <span id="s1467">So this is the story from the tunnel.</span> <span id="s1468">They survive.</span> <span id="s1469">This was -- you know, when I am looking now, when I am thinking about it, you see the Japanese who are in the prisons camps.</span> <span id="s1470">People what they were in the army that dig tunnels.</span> <span id="s1471">Not everybody survive from there, but they did.</span> <span id="s1472">And this is only young people, young Jews that they never were in the army, in the Polish.</span> <span id="s1473">And they made such a plan.</span> <span id="s1474">This was something very smart.</span> <span id="s1475">Not too many survive.</span> <span id="s1476">They were beautiful friends of mine.</span> <span id="s1477">Girls.</span> <span id="s1478">Beautiful.</span> <span id="s1479">So they caught them, and they did whatever they did, and they killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: So the tunnel, do you know how long it was in the building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: I don't know, but it was not too long because it was under the building, and right away was the surrounding.</span> <span id="s1482">They went out to forest, not far.</span> <span id="s1483">So who was running fast or knew how to run, ran out.</span> <span id="s1484">Now, they were looking where to go, they didn't know where to go, so they caught them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: And some stayed inside and got caught inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: They caught, yes.</span> <span id="s1487">Everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s1488">I think about 20 people, whatever 25 went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">They had the plans.</span> <span id="s1490">They have in Israel the plans.</span> <span id="s1491">I think here in the Holocaust Museum is too, they have too the plan, how did they go out, and how was they planned it – the tunnel made.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">02:41:34</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: When the group left to go to the other forest, the Lubczanka, didn't they have a group of people with them who didn't come back, who died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: Die, on road, yeah.</span> <span id="s1495">This was not too many.</span> <span id="s1496">Not too many.</span> <span id="s1497">No.</span> <span id="s1498">Not too many, 10, about 15 people.</span> <span id="s1499">Not too many.</span> <span id="s1500">They didn't want to be with the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s1501">They were looking for something else.</span> <span id="s1502">You think always the grass is greener on the other side.</span> <span id="s1503">But they got killed.</span> <span id="s1504">Who wanted that Jew, that old Jew?</span> <span id="s1505">Who want it, between me and you?</span> <span id="s1506">When you are young, something else, you may be a fighter or whatever.</span> <span id="s1507">But they didn't go.</span> <span id="s1508">The fighters didn't go for a couple of them.</span> <span id="s1509">But they got killed on the road.</span> <span id="s1510">The only survivors mostly were by the Bielskis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: The partisans who fought with the Bielskis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: The partisans.</span> <span id="s1513">We had many partisan Russians near us.</span> <span id="s1514">Iskra was very good.</span> <span id="s1515">There were other small Jewish otriad, but they didn't survive.</span> <span id="s1516">And the Jew were what they were, but the Iskra were the best fighters, the best.</span> <span id="s1517">They went all over.</span> <span id="s1518">They were fighting, but nobody even mentioned them because this was a Russian partisan.</span> <span id="s1519">Iskra.</span> <span id="s1520">They were the best fighters for the Jewish people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">02:43:28</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: You talked a little bit about good people.</span> <span id="s1523">There are good people and bad people in all groups.</span> <span id="s1524">By and large in the forest community, were people pretty generous and pretty selfless?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Not too many.</span> <span id="s1526">Not too many.</span> <span id="s1527">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Not too many.</span> <span id="s1529">Mostly they were very good people.</span> <span id="s1530">You know, they were always giving a hand to the other ones.</span> <span id="s1531">If I had another pair of shoes, I would give to the other one, the ones that didn't have.</span> <span id="s1532">They were not grabbing everything for them.</span> <span id="s1533">No, there were not too many like that.</span> <span id="s1534">If you had a couple of people, so they were not with the groups, they were lonely.</span> <span id="s1535">And if you were good with all of them, you work together, you were not so lonely.</span> <span id="s1536">You spoke about your families.</span> <span id="s1537">You spoke about your future, what it will be.</span> <span id="s1538">You were singing.</span> <span id="s1539">They were dancing.</span> <span id="s1540">They were waiting for a plane from Moscow, like -- I don't know -- like angels were coming.</span> <span id="s1541">And they knew everything.</span> <span id="s1542">I know when my parents were alive with me in the partisan, came a plane.</span> <span id="s1543">And I had a cousin, a doctor in Moscow, my mother's cousin.</span> <span id="s1544">So my mother wrote a letter.</span> <span id="s1545">She knew the family.</span> <span id="s1546">She knew that they were doctors.</span> <span id="s1547">And she sent a letter to them and, “Please, if you're alive, I have two sons in Israel.</span> <span id="s1548">Tell them that we are alive, and I hope to be alive still.”</span> <span id="s1549">And you know what, when we came to Israel - we were the first in ‘45, in October ’45, we were already in Israel because Sharett -- this was a minister, an Israeli -- Israeli was not then in existence.</span> <span id="s1550">It was Palestine.</span> <span id="s1551">Israel came alive in ‘48.</span> <span id="s1552">So he heard about the Bielskis when he was sitting in Israel.</span> <span id="s1553">You know, people from Europe, they were talking about the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s1554">And he said when we came he send us the first papers to Romania, with legal right to go by plane -- by boat to Israel.</span> <span id="s1555">When we came into Israel in ’45, my brother said, "I knew about you.</span> <span id="s1556">I got a letter from Moscow.</span> <span id="s1557">And I knew that you are alive, that my brother, Jay,is not alive.</span> <span id="s1558">But I knew about you and the parents."</span> <span id="s1559">So you see, everything you cannot -- everything you knew about.</span> <span id="s1560">Everything.</span> <span id="s1561">You knew in Israel about the fighters.</span> <span id="s1562">You knew about the Jewish partisan.</span> <span id="s1563">You knew about the people, the leader -- the fighters -- the Israeli came to Europe to fight the German.</span> <span id="s1564">They each know about the other one.</span> <span id="s1565">And when we came to Israel, they took us on beautiful -- they gave us right away a house.</span> <span id="s1566">They gave us everything what they could, what they had.</span> <span id="s1567">And</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">15 Jacob Boldo we made a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">02:46:52</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: What did -- did you know anything else that was going on in other parts of Europe then?</span> <span id="s1571">Did you know about concentration camps and death camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Sure, we know.</span> <span id="s1573">We know about the concentration, because the people were telling us about Majdanek, Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1574">The Polish people, they were saying to each other what happened there.</span> <span id="s1575">We knew everything.</span> <span id="s1576">We knew even -- we didn't know how many, we didn't know -- but we know about the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1577">We knew everything.</span> <span id="s1578">There was no secrets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">You know, we didn't have so many telephones, but the people are telephones, living telephones.</span> <span id="s1580">One was saying to the other one, and the other one was telling the other one, and that's what we knew about everything.</span> <span id="s1581">But we couldn't help nothing.</span> <span id="s1582">The helping hands was that the Bielskis gave so many people life in the forest.</span> <span id="s1583">They were keeping them and feeding them.</span> <span id="s1584">And you know that from the people when they came to the forest from Lida, they were people came were 15 years, 16 years, 17 years, young boys.</span> <span id="s1585">And then now, they went out in the forest, they came to the United States, to Canada, they billionaires.</span> <span id="s1586">And they were helping other ones here, too.</span> <span id="s1587">Because they learn a lesson, that you have to help somebody if you need.</span> <span id="s1588">And they give many, many, many thing to help people to stand on their feet.</span> <span id="s1589">All over the world you have partisan house, in Australia, in Canada, in Johannesburg, in Africa.</span> <span id="s1590">Many, many.</span> <span id="s1591">When we have -- they are coming some place every five years, every six years, they coming Israel for a reunion from all over the whole world.</span> <span id="s1592">And they asking, “You need something?”</span> <span id="s1593">This is something what you put it in when they were young when you will not put it in, you will not have it.</span> <span id="s1594">The same thing like parents.</span> <span id="s1595">You have children, you teach them what is good and what is bad, and even if they are not doing this right away, they will do it later, because they remember what mother and father taught them, how you have to behave.</span> <span id="s1596">And if you are not teaching this to the children, they will not do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">02:49:44</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Tell me about an average day in the forest for women and children.</span> <span id="s1599">What would they be doing all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: The day begin at six o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1601">They were cooking, and feeding the children, and feeding the old.</span> <span id="s1602">Everybody did something.</span> <span id="s1603">They went after the forest to take off to take the -- to put the fire.</span> <span id="s1604">They were preparing for the kitchen, the potatoes, the soup.</span> <span id="s1605">They were baking the bread.</span> <span id="s1606">So it was a long day, a very long day.</span> <span id="s1607">But everybody did what he had to do.</span> <span id="s1608">Not everybody ate the same thing, no.</span> <span id="s1609">The commander, they eat something else, but nobody was hungry.</span> <span id="s1610">That is the main thing.</span> <span id="s1611">They complaining.</span> <span id="s1612">They were complaining.</span> <span id="s1613">Not everybody -- the children had milk, the old one they had milk.</span> <span id="s1614">And this ones that came from the houses they said, "Where is the milk I brought in?</span> <span id="s1615">I want a little milk."</span> <span id="s1616">“You cannot have it.</span> <span id="s1617">That's for the children, for the old, for the sick.”</span> <span id="s1618">And they didn't touch it.</span> <span id="s1619">Women were working, too.</span> <span id="s1620">Sometimes, not too many went with the men, but not always.</span> <span id="s1621">Not always.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Mostly they were working on the -- in the puszcza near the kitchen, near the children, near the hospital.</span> <span id="s1623">They were sewing.</span> <span id="s1624">A regular work day, six o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1625">The men would tell them at night they went for three, four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: And repairing guns and--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Everything was in the puszcza.</span> <span id="s1628">We had people, they were working.</span> <span id="s1629">They knew how to repair, and the other ones, they teach to each other.</span> <span id="s1630">And they knew everything was working in very good shape.</span> <span id="s1631">You had to have -- to prepare the everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">02:52:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: In the puszcza, in the community, were people unafraid or were they afraid most of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: No, they were not afraid.</span> <span id="s1635">They were very happy to be there.</span> <span id="s1636">In the beginning, they didn't know what is it – how will be.</span> <span id="s1637">But later, the German were far away.</span> <span id="s1638">They heard only when they came -- the boys came with the food that they say this village was attacked by the German.</span> <span id="s1639">This and that.</span> <span id="s1640">But they lived a very quiet life.</span> <span id="s1641">They were working and did what they’s told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: What about recreation?</span> <span id="s1643">I mean, what about having fun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: The fun was, they were sitting together near the fire and singing and talking.</span> <span id="s1645">That was the fun.</span> <span id="s1646">Whatever they did in the ziemlankas we don't know.</span> <span id="s1647">Probably, you know, the young people.</span> <span id="s1648">But that was the fun, what we knew about it.</span> <span id="s1649">Everybody was getting near the fire.</span> <span id="s1650">Everybody was looking for somebody, for a little warm talking, remember the house, remember the parents.</span> <span id="s1651">It was -- most were from the city of Novogrudok, Lida, Baranovichi.</span> <span id="s1652">This was not far away from each other.</span> <span id="s1653">In the summertime, in the good times, they were meeting each other in Novoyelnya, this was like here you coming to Florida.</span> <span id="s1654">So they knew mostly each other.</span> <span id="s1655">If didn’t know personal, so they heard about them.</span> <span id="s1656">And this was nice to talk, to remember.</span> <span id="s1657">Not to forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">02:53:48</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Did they -- did people get to go back to their homes after the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: Yeah, they came to the houses.</span> <span id="s1661">The houses were already occupied by the Polish people.</span> <span id="s1662">And nobody wanted to stay in the family, to remember.</span> <span id="s1663">Everybody was killed there.</span> <span id="s1664">So this was not in their interest.</span> <span id="s1665">If you were from Novogrudok, they went out to Lida where they didn't know them.</span> <span id="s1666">They didn't want to stay in the houses no more.</span> <span id="s1667">They were empty.</span> <span id="s1668">When you came to the house where you lived, what will you see there?</span> <span id="s1669">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1670">So they run away from there.</span> <span id="s1671">And everybody took the easy way, to go away to another city, to stay with other people.</span> <span id="s1672">This is it.</span> <span id="s1673">But nobody stay in the same city, in the same houses.</span> <span id="s1674">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1675">I know now people went to Novogrudok about two years ago.</span> <span id="s1676">There is only one from the partisan.</span> <span id="s1677">He marry a Polish girl and has his children and he stays.</span> <span id="s1678">No more else.</span> <span id="s1679">There were marriages, many, after the war where they marry – where a Jew marry a Polish, a Polish girl marry a Jew.</span> <span id="s1680">You know, like all over the world.</span> <span id="s1681">But they were not staying in the cities.</span> <span id="s1682">They went away -- they went away to Europe, they went away to Israel.</span> <span id="s1683">Not too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: I think we're about to run out; am I right?</span> <span id="s1685">Why don't we stop now.</span> <span id="s1686">02:55:34 End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">03:01:11</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Now, Sonia, we're going to talk a little bit about various things.</span> <span id="s1690">And so first, why don't you tell me a little bit about the Bielski parents, the parents of the three brothers, or really it was many more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: I really didn't know them, but I know them from my husband what he is repeating, what he is telling us.</span> <span id="s1692">They were very honest, poor family.</span> <span id="s1693">He fell in love with a girl which she didn't have money.</span> <span id="s1694">Once upon a time, you couldn't marry if you didn't have money.</span> <span id="s1695">But the husband, David, the father, he fell in love.</span> <span id="s1696">She was a beautiful, a tall girl, a blonde.</span> <span id="s1697">All of them looks like their mother.</span> <span id="s1698">And she was working with him, hand-in-hand.</span> <span id="s1699">And they had a woman -- they had 12 children, and all of them a year, two, three, four, five, six, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">So they had -- they were working in a place where they making for the corn, flour.</span> <span id="s1701">What is it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: A mill.</span> <span id="s1703">A flour mill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Yes, very small, on the water, and everybody was working there till they grow up a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">When they grow up, the first one, the father of this girl, Walterwas the oldest.</span> <span id="s1706">He went to school in the city.</span> <span id="s1707">Then, Tuvia, the second one, was too, in the city for a couple of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">And another sister was too in the city, were going to school.</span> <span id="s1709">The other ones were small children and they were in the house.</span> <span id="s1710">They had always a teacher for them at home.</span> <span id="s1711">They couldn't afford to send them out.</span> <span id="s1712">And mother was working, and father was working, and the brothers were working.</span> <span id="s1713">And they made a living.</span> <span id="s1714">They put -- made the flours and market it with another boy, with the son, took the flour to Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s1715">And they were selling the flours.</span> <span id="s1716">This is the living.</span> <span id="s1717">They had a garden near the house.</span> <span id="s1718">They had water enough, so they have a garden and all the vegetables they had.</span> <span id="s1719">I don't think they had fruits, but vegetables.</span> <span id="s1720">And they had a little fish in the water, and a chicken and eggs – plain, but healthy living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">You see, when you are living like that, if you can -- if 10 brothers can grow up, six-two, so probably food was good.</span> <span id="s1722">They had always a woman from the village which she was helping her -- the mother.</span> <span id="s1723">And there was a lot of love between them.</span> <span id="s1724">Father was crazy about the mother.</span> <span id="s1725">And he should be, because she was working very hard, more than him.</span> <span id="s1726">This I know.</span> <span id="s1727">I never saw them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">03:04:21 I once asked my mother, "Mommy, do you remember this lady from the village?"</span> <span id="s1729">She said, "I never knew them, but I know they were a very honest family."</span> <span id="s1730">And everybody who came to the mill to ask for something, they were helping them.</span> <span id="s1731">Because in the village there were only five houses, four from the villages and one house was their's.</span> <span id="s1732">So they were very poor,</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">16 Velvel Bielski the people from the village, the village -- five houses.</span> <span id="s1734">So they were always coming to ask for a little flour, for a couple of pennies to lend them.</span> <span id="s1735">He was -- always had a open house for them.</span> <span id="s1736">Maybe they stood.</span> <span id="s1737">They were a member.</span> <span id="s1738">But there were many from other villages that were a little farther.</span> <span id="s1739">They came first to tell them that the brothers beat up somebody when the German camp.</span> <span id="s1740">Came to beat up them and they tell them that the brothers are Communist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">And they were not Communist, but they wanted, you know, to take away the mill with everything, and they brought in the German.</span> <span id="s1742">And they took them away, the mother and father and two brothers.</span> <span id="s1743">But they’re not alive no more.</span> <span id="s1744">When they went already to the forest, they took -- they invited them and killed them all with their children with everybody.</span> <span id="s1745">They were -- everybody had afraid of them.</span> <span id="s1746">They knew what they did.</span> <span id="s1747">You understand?</span> <span id="s1748">I was very sick in the partisan.</span> <span id="s1749">I was so sick.</span> <span id="s1750">I was not prepared for the winter.</span> <span id="s1751">I was not prepared for the living.</span> <span id="s1752">And I had blood in my bladder.</span> <span id="s1753">And the doctor said that I have to have a warm bed.</span> <span id="s1754">I have to have a couple of times, because I was so sick, I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk, nothing.</span> <span id="s1755">So there was not far a big mill from flours with a family.</span> <span id="s1756">And there they had a beautiful daughter and to the daughter they came, the Germans.</span> <span id="s1757">And Zus took me there to the mill and said to her, "This is my wife.</span> <span id="s1758">You have to take care of her.</span> <span id="s1759">She is very sick."</span> <span id="s1760">And they took care of me.</span> <span id="s1761">They put me in a place that nobody saw me.</span> <span id="s1762">And she brought me - she cooked for me, she gave me beds, the mother.</span> <span id="s1763">And I heard the Germans laughing and drinking and eating.</span> <span id="s1764">And I was there 10 days and nobody touch me.</span> <span id="s1765">I am still alive.</span> <span id="s1766">They took care of me only because they had afraid of the Bielskis.</span> <span id="s1767">If not, I would not be alive because I had blood all over.</span> <span id="s1768">This is from the winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">03:07:34</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: Belarus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: Belarus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: Belarus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: Tell me the story of Belarus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Belarus was a very rich family, too, not far from them, I think, about 10 miles, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">And the boys, the young boys, they went to take bread and poultry and eggs, whatever.</span> <span id="s1777">And they had a very good day then, because they took away all the food from the German.</span> <span id="s1778">Yeah and they kill about four, five German.</span> <span id="s1779">And they were already tired, the boys.</span> <span id="s1780">And this was already night, so they decided to sleep over by the Belarus.</span> <span id="s1781">In this time, one from the villages saw that the Jewish partisan are by the Belarus, so he gave it to him a letter to the German, the Belarus.</span> <span id="s1782">“You should come right away.”</span> <span id="s1783">They drink a lot, and they were very tired.</span> <span id="s1784">They had a very good day.</span> <span id="s1785">So the German came and they killed them all.</span> <span id="s1786">Only two -- one from the boys, when he saw the German and were -- blood all over.</span> <span id="s1787">You know, in the villages you have a big, big stove, and under the stove are the chickens sitting.</span> <span id="s1788">The chickens are sitting under the stove because there is warm.</span> <span id="s1789">So he saw that he doesn't have nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s1790">So he went into the place where the chickens are and he -- they spared him.</span> <span id="s1791">The German went away.</span> <span id="s1792">And he got out and he said, “What did you do with my friends?</span> <span id="s1793">Why did you went to the German?”</span> <span id="s1794">What we did to you?”</span> <span id="s1795">So he took and he killed them, too, the Belarus.</span> <span id="s1796">This another man from the villages came and he said -- repeated this to Kozlowksi.</span> <span id="s1797">Kozlowksi was our man.</span> <span id="s1798">Whoever came from the ghetto, he was holding him till somebody came to pick him up.</span> <span id="s1799">And he told this to the Bielskis, because we didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s1800">Everybody were died.</span> <span id="s1801">So this took only about five or 10 days and the Bielskis, Asael, his brother, I don't think Zus was – Zus was not, I think.</span> <span id="s1802">Anyway, the Bielskis, they came and they said to him, "Boys, what did you do?"</span> <span id="s1803">He said, "I didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s1804">The German find out and they kill them."</span> <span id="s1805">So they took all, about two, three houses from there.</span> <span id="s1806">Yes?</span> <span id="s1807">And they fix them up, all of them.</span> <span id="s1808">One of our partisans, he took a jacket.</span> <span id="s1809">A fall jacket, you know, like they’re wearing.</span> <span id="s1810">And he was looking for something.</span> <span id="s1811">So he find a letter from the German.</span> <span id="s1812">“Mr. Belarus, thank you very much what you did.</span> <span id="s1813">And here is 500 German money, whatever.</span> <span id="s1814">And whatever you will find another Jew partisan, you will get it more.”</span> <span id="s1815">This was Belarus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">03:10:51</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">Q: So the partisans executed him?</span> <span id="s1818">A: Yes, and the whole family.</span> <span id="s1819">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: The reprisals like that, do you know if they made a di-- did they get -- were there fewer and fewer incidents?</span> <span id="s1821">Did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: Less and less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: So it did some good to--</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1825">This was a lesson for the all the villages, for all the people.</span> <span id="s1826">“Don't do that.”</span> <span id="s1827">Everybody has the right to live.</span> <span id="s1828">They had, they had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: Lilly's father was there, too, my sister-in-law's.</span> <span id="s1831">He was within this partisan what executed the Belarus.</span> <span id="s1832">He died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">03:12:01</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: Can you talk to me a little bit about the military hierarchy?</span> <span id="s1835">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: Just sort of any way that you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: You see, there were not too many Jewish -- Jews when they went to the Polish army.</span> <span id="s1838">First of all, they didn't want it.</span> <span id="s1839">Because the antisemitism was very high there.</span> <span id="s1840">So they tried to not to go to the army.</span> <span id="s1841">They did something, or bought something that -- but few of them they went to the army.</span> <span id="s1842">And they -- when they came to the partisan, they were already -- they knew how to behave in the army.</span> <span id="s1843">So when the people who had already about 1,200, 300, so the Bielskis, they divided them in groups.</span> <span id="s1844">It’s was too much one group.</span> <span id="s1845">So everybody was the commander of a group.</span> <span id="s1846">A group had about 20 people, 25 people.</span> <span id="s1847">So the people what they were in the army, they were the commanders of the group.</span> <span id="s1848">And they were listening to them, because they had afraid.</span> <span id="s1849">This was a discipline.</span> <span id="s1850">Because without the discipline, you couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s1851">They were complaining, sure, they were complaining.</span> <span id="s1852">Who is not complaining?</span> <span id="s1853">If somebody is eating a piece of meat and you are watching him to eat meat, and you eat only a piece of bread, so sure they were complaining.</span> <span id="s1854">They said, “He went for a – for to take the food, and he was eating the food by himself.”</span> <span id="s1855">That was not true.</span> <span id="s1856">But maybe he put a little more for him.</span> <span id="s1857">So they were complaining.</span> <span id="s1858">They were complaining that at night nobody were asleep.</span> <span id="s1859">There were a couple of people near the groups; they were watching if the German are not coming.</span> <span id="s1860">There were about five or six people, they were watching.</span> <span id="s1861">So they were complaining, “How come he didn't stay a whole week at night?</span> <span id="s1862">He was asleeping, and I was staying.”</span> <span id="s1863">This was, too.</span> <span id="s1864">So they said to him, the Bielskis, “He is the commander.</span> <span id="s1865">Whatever he will say, that what you have to do it.”</span> <span id="s1866">And they got used to that.</span> <span id="s1867">They had trouble, too, there.</span> <span id="s1868">They had.</span> <span id="s1869">All the groups had trouble, sometimes.</span> <span id="s1870">But this is minor.</span> <span id="s1871">That's nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">03:14:20</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: What about relations with other partisan groups and what about when Platon came in and Russians were assigned to all of the high po-- tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1875">We didn't know about the other Russians, they were partisans.</span> <span id="s1876">All of them, they were Russian, but Platon was head of the puszcza Naliboki.</span> <span id="s1877">He was sent from Moscow.</span> <span id="s1878">So the Bielskis was complaining.</span> <span id="s1879">“They took away our food.</span> <span id="s1880">They took away our horses.</span> <span id="s1881">They took away some, some other things what we were taking this for our partisan.”</span> <span id="s1882">So Platon was very smart.</span> <span id="s1883">He said, “Listen, you Bielskis, you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s1884">You have to remember that you have to fight.</span> <span id="s1885">You have to fight with them for your survival.</span> <span id="s1886">After the war, we will then see what we can do.”</span> <span id="s1887">So -- but we had trouble, too, with Platon.</span> <span id="s1888">He said, "Are you grabbing too much food?"</span> <span id="s1889">“What are we grabbing?</span> <span id="s1890">Grabbing only bread.</span> <span id="s1891">But we are fighting the German.”</span> <span id="s1892">The same thing, maybe more than that.</span> <span id="s1893">But later, in ‘43 when they separated, the 150 whatever, and they make Ordzonikidze with Zus.</span> <span id="s1894">Zus went to them -- Aleks.</span> <span id="s1895">So they didn't believe that he will be partial to the Bielskis otriad.</span> <span id="s1896">You see, this is the boys were from the Bielskis otriad, from Bielskis Brigade.</span> <span id="s1897">You understand?</span> <span id="s1898">But they didn't believe him that he will be more partial to Platon than the Bielskis brother.</span> <span id="s1899">So they put Panchenko -- not Panchenko -- yeah, Panchenko, I think.</span> <span id="s1900">Right?</span> <span id="s1901">Panchenko, and he was the commander and Zus was after him.</span> <span id="s1902">But they were working very hard and very good.</span> <span id="s1903">Once they had incident with another group of partisan.</span> <span id="s1904">I told you about it.</span> <span id="s1905">They took away the horses, and the rifles, everything.</span> <span id="s1906">And Panchenko came in and he said, "What happened?"</span> <span id="s1907">One Russian commander, he took the rifle and wanted to shoot to Alex, so Alex took out his revolver and Panchenko came in between and he pushed them together.</span> <span id="s1908">And he was very nice with him, Alex. They did everything together, and very good.</span> <span id="s1909">They were working very good.</span> <span id="s1910">We didn't have -- only that’s was the only one, Panchenko.</span> <span id="s1911">Then when Zus, he was the commander of the intelligence of the whole forest for the Russian, and for everything.</span> <span id="s1912">So they were working very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">03:17:13</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: What did he do in that role?</span> <span id="s1915">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: Alex.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: Alex went 20 yards from the police -- from the Polish.</span> <span id="s1918">He went half a kilometer, it’s about three-quarters of a mile from the German.</span> <span id="s1919">And he was seeing where are they going, and what they are doing, where is the concentrations from them.</span> <span id="s1920">This was his doing.</span> <span id="s1921">And he reported this everything to Platon.</span> <span id="s1922">He did a very good job, and a very big job, because you could not go to fight them if you didn't know what they doing there.</span> <span id="s1923">He never go get by himself.</span> <span id="s1924">He went always with 10, 15 people on horses.</span> <span id="s1925">They were killing.</span> <span id="s1926">They were running away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">They had many things.</span> <span id="s1928">You cannot say that you were always the best of them.</span> <span id="s1929">No.</span> <span id="s1930">They were very good, too, the German.</span> <span id="s1931">Who is stronger, then, is the winner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: What else did Alex do?</span> <span id="s1933">Did he do -- did he have something to do with keeping roads open?</span> <span id="s1934">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1937">The roads are not like here.</span> <span id="s1938">They have one road what is going one direction, and the other direction.</span> <span id="s1939">And you have smaller road that the German didn't know.</span> <span id="s1940">But Alex knew.</span> <span id="s1941">If this road was closed, he was saying to them, “You have to go.”</span> <span id="s1942">He sent a man to tell him where to go, how to go out from this.</span> <span id="s1943">Because one day, I remember this was in the beginning of ‘44, Platon came with commanders from Moscow.</span> <span id="s1944">And they went to look for the partisan, how they were working, and how they were doing and everything, and the German came in.</span> <span id="s1945">They were surrounding them around, around, and around.</span> <span id="s1946">They couldn't go out from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">So then Asael, his brother, and Alex, they went to see something.</span> <span id="s1948">And they saw what happening, so they took him out, but 10 people from the Moscow.</span> <span id="s1949">This was because they knew how to go out from the roads.</span> <span id="s1950">You cannot -- you would not be able to use one road.</span> <span id="s1951">Because even not the markets there was a road, but they knew.</span> <span id="s1952">I am telling you, they knew.</span> <span id="s1953">They were looking on the tree and they knew where to go out, how to go out.</span> <span id="s1954">And they had a small brother, Aaron.</span> <span id="s1955">He is 13 years old.</span> <span id="s1956">He knew better than them.</span> <span id="s1957">He knew everything.</span> <span id="s1958">He was only 13 years old.</span> <span id="s1959">He is now 60 something.</span> <span id="s1960">He would tell you stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">03:20:12</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Where is he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: In New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">03:20:26</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: Do you know about the early incident in Novogrudok where Tuvia saw the action?</span> <span id="s1966">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1969">I was still in Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s1970">This was only the beginning.</span> <span id="s1971">This was like -- the ghetto was already -- no, the ghetto was not.</span> <span id="s1972">This was December.</span> <span id="s1973">And they took her out the first 50 people were this; druggists, lawyers, doctors.</span> <span id="s1974">Fifty of them.</span> <span id="s1975">That was the intelligence of the city.</span> <span id="s1976">And they killed them, all 50 of them, in the middle of the marketplace.</span> <span id="s1977">This was a small city, Novogrudok, with a marketplace where everybody is coming, Thursday and Wednesdays.</span> <span id="s1978">And they killed them.</span> <span id="s1979">The other ones should be afraid.</span> <span id="s1980">Tuvia was there in the city, in Novogrudok.</span> <span id="s1981">He went for something.</span> <span id="s1982">And the German never killed before.</span> <span id="s1983">So they ask him who are you?</span> <span id="s1984">They didn't have to ask him, because the other one -- somebody told he is a Jew.</span> <span id="s1985">They hit him very well.</span> <span id="s1986">They beat him up terrible.</span> <span id="s1987">He had the first thing that you saw the German.</span> <span id="s1988">And they told him to sit here, not to run in no place.</span> <span id="s1989">It was a little dark, and he said to himself, “What am I doing here?</span> <span id="s1990">If they will kill me, let them kill me when I will not see it.</span> <span id="s1991">But to sit and wait for them?”</span> <span id="s1992">And he run away.</span> <span id="s1993">So this when he came in, already Alex and Asael saw him the first time after two, three weeks.</span> <span id="s1994">They were already in the forest.</span> <span id="s1995">He came into the forest and he said, "I am not going no more.</span> <span id="s1996">I am staying with you."</span> <span id="s1997">This is the first encounter with the German.</span> <span id="s1998">He never went.</span> <span id="s1999">And he saw only a German when he kill them or a dead.</span> <span id="s2000">Zus -- Alex is wearing still a comm-- jacket for a commander, a German.</span> <span id="s2001">He took him alive.</span> <span id="s2002">He were looking for eggs, for chickens, him and another three.</span> <span id="s2003">And he saw him from far away when he went out from the farm.</span> <span id="s2004">And he took them alive.</span> <span id="s2005">So he said, “Who is the commander?”</span> <span id="s2006">He said, “I am the commander.”</span> <span id="s2007">“So take it off the jacket.”</span> <span id="s2008">He took it off the jacket, and the other ones, two, three killed and him, he said, "Listen, don't kill me.</span> <span id="s2009">I have a wife and children."</span> <span id="s2010">He said, "No, no.</span> <span id="s2011">We will not kill you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">What did you do with us?"</span> <span id="s2013">So he is wearing now the jacket, in all of the books, he is in the jacket from the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">03:23:14</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: Did he -- Alex have an incident where he was called a "dirty Jew" on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2017">In Novogrudok.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2019">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: In Novogrudok there was a store for meat.</span> <span id="s2021">I don't remember, he told me once what his name was, but I don't remember.</span> <span id="s2022">I will not tell you what I don't remember.</span> <span id="s2023">And he was -- before the war, he was very good with him.</span> <span id="s2024">You see, Alex's house was -- they didn't eat meat what is not kosher.</span> <span id="s2025">They had a brother, what was a rabbi.</span> <span id="s2026">And the other ones, they were eating, you know.</span> <span id="s2027">But he was very good with him.</span> <span id="s2028">I forgot his name.</span> <span id="s2029">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s2030">So they were friends, but when the German came, the friendship went by.</span> <span id="s2031">And he had pains in his teeth.</span> <span id="s2032">So he went to a dentist.</span> <span id="s2033">Still the dentist were alive there, so he went and he saw him from far away.</span> <span id="s2034">So you called him, "You dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s2035">How come you came here?"</span> <span id="s2036">He didn't answer.</span> <span id="s2037">He went away, but he was running after him.</span> <span id="s2038">He run after him.</span> <span id="s2039">And he that saw he doesn’t have where to go, so he didn't kill him, but he hit out – he hit him so much that he was unconscious.</span> <span id="s2040">And he went away to the forest.</span> <span id="s2041">That was the encounter with his best friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: Was that a common situation or uncommon, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: It was common, yeah.</span> <span id="s2044">Yeah, this was happening, many things, many.</span> <span id="s2045">Because in the times -- in the last times, in the last year in ‘39, there was the young Polish, the youth, like the youth, the German youth.</span> <span id="s2046">That was the same thing in all Europe, the Polish had too, the youth.</span> <span id="s2047">And they were very antisemitic and they were trying -- they didn't know yet to kill, but they were beating up.</span> <span id="s2048">So who was more, you know, had more force?</span> <span id="s2049">So they hitting back and the other ones went away.</span> <span id="s2050">But this was in the last year, very common, yes.</span> <span id="s2051">It was very uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: And it wasn't out of fear, it was out of antisemitism?</span> <span id="s2053">A: No, they didn't have fear, no.</span> <span id="s2054">No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">03:25:56</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: I was going to ask your husband about getting young fighters, Koscik?</span> <span id="s2057">A: Kozlowksi?</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: I don't know.</span> <span id="s2059">Koscik, K-o-s-c-i-k.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: Oh, Kozaks, yes.</span> <span id="s2061">This was his – Moskvaasked for a language, a live language.</span> <span id="s2062">They didn't want to kill all of the German.</span> <span id="s2063">They wanted more the majors and the captains.</span> <span id="s2064">They wanted to talk about it with the German, to know how the positions and everything.</span> <span id="s2065">And the – that’s</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">17 Moscow (Russian) there are places in Russia, near Belarussia and Ukraine, the Kozakswere alive there and they were working with the German.</span> <span id="s2067">So this came from Platon, a word that, “Alex, you have to prepare about two or three Kozaks alive, and you have to bring them to us and we will ask him how is – how are they doing, the German, where they are staying, how many people, and everything.”</span> <span id="s2068">So this took him probably about three or four days till he caught up with the Kozaks.</span> <span id="s2069">They were terrible fighters, terrible, but they took them alive.</span> <span id="s2070">They were washing themselves, cleaning up.</span> <span id="s2071">And he with the horse on them, so he took three of them.</span> <span id="s2072">He couldn't shlep them, the three of them, so he took only the oldest.</span> <span id="s2073">And he brought him to Platon.</span> <span id="s2074">And they said everything, and everything true.</span> <span id="s2075">And this it is.</span> <span id="s2076">That’s was Kozaks.</span> <span id="s2077">He did a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">03:27:42</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: Describe the three Bielski brothers each individually.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: The best for nature was Asael.</span> <span id="s2081">The best.</span> <span id="s2082">The strongest from them all, that he -- you cannot buy him with nothing, was Alex. You couldn't buy him for no money.</span> <span id="s2083">If he said that’s has to be done, has to be done.</span> <span id="s2084">Tuvia had a golden heart.</span> <span id="s2085">He said, "I don't care how many will come.</span> <span id="s2086">Let them come.</span> <span id="s2087">There will be a place for them, all of them.”</span> <span id="s2088">But the strongest of them was Alex, the strongest of them.</span> <span id="s2089">I will tell you.</span> <span id="s2090">This was a story when we went out from the forest, from the jungle.</span> <span id="s2091">Yes?</span> <span id="s2092">And I came in with him when the groups were already out, and they were organized and everything.</span> <span id="s2093">And we saw one woman, a young woman, I think about 32.</span> <span id="s2094">And she was standing and crying.</span> <span id="s2095">So Alex said to her, "Why you crying?"</span> <span id="s2096">She said, "The whole group went by and, you know, the commander, he told me they don't have a place for me."</span> <span id="s2097">He said, "Who is the commander?"</span> <span id="s2098">He called the name of this commander and he said, “Where he is?”</span> <span id="s2099">He said, “Maybe about 10 kilometers, not far.</span> <span id="s2100">Because, he told me not to move.</span> <span id="s2101">He doesn't want me.”</span> <span id="s2102">So he run away by himself, on the horse, he took the commander and brought them in where we were staying.</span> <span id="s2103">We were staying probably 20 people, the fighters.</span> <span id="s2104">He said, "You know her?"</span> <span id="s2105">He said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s2106">"Why did you let her stay here?"</span> <span id="s2107">"I don't have nothing to do with her.</span> <span id="s2108">I don't want her."</span> <span id="s2109">"What do you mean you don't want her?</span> <span id="s2110">You had to take 20 people and she was the 21, so what?"</span> <span id="s2111">He said, "I am not taking."</span> <span id="s2112">He said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s2113">You not taking?</span> <span id="s2114">Okay, so you not alive either."</span> <span id="s2115">That’s was the first killing of his.</span> <span id="s2116">He killed the man.</span> <span id="s2117">And this was, you know, this was like from God.</span> <span id="s2118">Because every woman and every child had already a place where to go.</span> <span id="s2119">Whatever you took her, you have to take her with you.</span> <span id="s2120">He was sorry after that because he is not a killer, but he had to do it.</span> <span id="s2121">He had to do it.</span> <span id="s2122">This was a big accident because he couldn't sleep, and couldn't eat, but this was a very good medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">03:30:15</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: It meant that a lot more people got rescued afterward?</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">18 Cossacks (Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: Yes, absolute.</span> <span id="s2127">Absolute.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: Well, tell me more about the brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: The brothers were very good together.</span> <span id="s2130">Nobody can go in between.</span> <span id="s2131">Nobody.</span> <span id="s2132">You cannot decide by yourself and no one from them could decide.</span> <span id="s2133">They went to the side, the three of them and the baby brother, the 13, he went, too.</span> <span id="s2134">And they were thinking up of something and whatever decided is done.</span> <span id="s2135">Nobody, not Tuvia by himself, not Asael, or Zusia could decide by himself.</span> <span id="s2136">The three of them decided what to do.</span> <span id="s2137">And this was the blessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: And they were all fighters?</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: They were fighters, very good fighters.</span> <span id="s2140">They were young, 29, 30, 32 – six-two.</span> <span id="s2141">Everybody had afraid of them.</span> <span id="s2142">You will look on them you know that they mean business.</span> <span id="s2143">And were good in heart, very good.</span> <span id="s2144">Sometime they went out for a couple of days, there were not food, so they had -- whatever they had they were dividing between them.</span> <span id="s2145">They were good.</span> <span id="s2146">I think the smartest one from all of them, may be not the smartest, the smartest -- more sophisticated was Tuvia.</span> <span id="s2147">He was the oldest.</span> <span id="s2148">He made his living already, you know.</span> <span id="s2149">He went to school more than there.</span> <span id="s2150">So maybe, but the hearts was the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: They were heroes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: They were heroes.</span> <span id="s2153">Each of them were a hero.</span> <span id="s2154">They never had afraid for nothing.</span> <span id="s2155">We said “We are surrounding,” because we were surrounded not once.</span> <span id="s2156">"So what," he said.</span> <span id="s2157">"We are only dying once."</span> <span id="s2158">I was dying every minute of that.</span> <span id="s2159">And they were dying only once.</span> <span id="s2160">He said, “There is nothing to be afraid.</span> <span id="s2161">You are not with the German now.</span> <span id="s2162">We will see who will die and who will live.”</span> <span id="s2163">They not – they were never afraid.</span> <span id="s2164">They were heroes.</span> <span id="s2165">They not coming no more like that.</span> <span id="s2166">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2167">Maybe that’s because they were healthy, from the village, from the nature, whatever.</span> <span id="s2168">They not coming no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">03:33:10</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: There was a sad incident with a man named Kaplan.</span> <span id="s2171">Do you know what I am talking about?</span> <span id="s2172">A: Kaplan?</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2174">Do you know what I am talking about?</span> <span id="s2175">He, he said, "Those who take the gold can take the people, too."</span> <span id="s2176">Do you know about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: I asked you at the beginning about a commander named Shematovietz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">19 Ivan Shematovietz</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: Shematovietz.</span> <span id="s2181">He was a Russian guy.</span> <span id="s2182">He was a very nice guy.</span> <span id="s2183">He was a politrukYou know what is a politruk?</span> <span id="s2184">A politruk is a man what is teaching the communism.</span> <span id="s2185">And he was teaching Communism.</span> <span id="s2186">He came from Russia.</span> <span id="s2187">So one of the Lubczanski brother what they wanted to be the commander.</span> <span id="s2188">So they said to them, “Go ahead.</span> <span id="s2189">You can go ahead and take another couple of people and make yourself a commander.”</span> <span id="s2190">So he came to Platon and he said to Lubczanski, “They are not Communists.”</span> <span id="s2191">So he said, "How do you know they are not communists, the Bielskis brother?"</span> <span id="s2192">"Because I never saw them reading Stalin's words, or Lenin’s words."</span> <span id="s2193">So the call Shematovietz and he said, "Who said they are not Communists?</span> <span id="s2194">All of them are Communists.</span> <span id="s2195">They are praying every morning for the health of Stalin and Lenin."</span> <span id="s2196">You know, we had the Orthodox Jew so they were in the morning five o'clock, six o'clock, they were standing in group and praying.</span> <span id="s2197">So he said that is the praying for Stalin and Lenin.</span> <span id="s2198">He was a very good guy, an honest guy, a good guy.</span> <span id="s2199">They were a couple of very good guys.</span> <span id="s2200">Yeah, they're nice guys, Russian guys, very good ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: Are there any things that you would have done differently or that you think Alex would have done differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: Or Tuvia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: No.</span> <span id="s2205">They did a great job.</span> <span id="s2206">Nobody could match them.</span> <span id="s2207">Nobody could match them.</span> <span id="s2208">If you would find in this time, in the time of the war, a terrible war, a place to go in and to sit quietly for three, four years.</span> <span id="s2209">I would sit quietly two and three years.</span> <span id="s2210">Nobody should see me.</span> <span id="s2211">I would not think about nobody all but myself.</span> <span id="s2212">Many people are doing like that.</span> <span id="s2213">I know a group of people, they were sitting, 10 people, they had a lot of money and they were paying to the village soltysthat’s mean like a mayor.</span> <span id="s2214">They paying him money, and he was cooking for them and attending them, and everything.</span> <span id="s2215">There were not thinking where nobody -- another man to put her in, in the group he should survive, no.</span> <span id="s2216">So who could do it without money, without nothing?</span> <span id="s2217">They did only for the good hearts what they had.</span> <span id="s2218">And they were saying that they were taking money.</span> <span id="s2219">They took money, they took jewelry, everything.</span> <span id="s2220">We had to pay for the rifles what came from Moscow and we send everything to Moscow, and they sent it.</span> <span id="s2221">But they didn't put nothing, money, in the pockets.</span> <span id="s2222">We send for salt, you have to pay this.</span> <span id="s2223">You didn't have money, so you paid with jewelry.</span> <span id="s2224">You had to buy medicine.</span> <span id="s2225">You pay this with jewelry.</span> <span id="s2226">But they didn't keep nothing for themselves.</span> <span id="s2227">If they would keep so much money, they would be millionaires.</span> <span id="s2228">They came out from the war with nothing, with not a penny.</span> <span id="s2229">We came to Israel in ‘45 in October.</span> <span id="s2230">We didn't have for what to buy a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s2231">So there this the Jewish -- that was not yet -- Israel was in ‘48.</span> <span

id="s2234">So if we would have had money, we would do 20 political instructor (Russian) 21 village administer (Polish) that?</span> <span id="s2235">We didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s2236">We kept out nothing.</span> <span id="s2237">We had only a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s2238">They did for the greatness of their heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">03:38:04</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: Tell me how the otriad came to an end.</span> <span id="s2241">Tell me about the -- A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2242">This was ‘45, ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: Forty-five?</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: Forty-five in June.</span> <span id="s2245">I was sitting in the forest and we heard trucks.</span> <span id="s2246">So we were sure that the German army is going to surround the – around -- to take us around.</span> <span id="s2247">So we were sitting quietly.</span> <span id="s2248">So then Tuvia was a little farther than us.</span> <span id="s2249">Zus said, "No, that is impossible," because they didn't go by trucks.</span> <span id="s2250">They went by tanks, the German, around.</span> <span id="s2251">That's not like a truck -- not like a tank.</span> <span id="s2252">That’s much lighter sounding.</span> <span id="s2253">So he went with another couple of men more to the – to this road.</span> <span id="s2254">And he saw the Red Army.</span> <span id="s2255">When he saw the Red Army, he said, “Come on, the German are gone.</span> <span id="s2256">The Red Army is already here.”</span> <span id="s2257">And they saw him, so they came with the rifles like that to us.</span> <span id="s2258">"Who are you, traitors?</span> <span id="s2259">You not?</span> <span id="s2260">Who are you?"</span> <span id="s2261">and took about two, three hours till they recognize that we are partisan.</span> <span id="s2262">And we went after them right away.</span> <span id="s2263">They went to the front and we went to the city.</span> <span id="s2264">We went to Novogrudok and there we were staying there for a couple of days, maybe 10 days.</span> <span id="s2265">And the Red Army came in and said, “You have to go to the army.</span> <span id="s2266">You are partisan.</span> <span id="s2267">You are fighters, but now you have to fight with us on the -- across -- against the German.”</span> <span id="s2268">Then they took Asael he was-- because they saw him a first.</span> <span id="s2269">So they took him right away to the army, and he died in the front in Prussia.</span> <span id="s2270">And they let Zus and Tuvia to stay with the people.</span> <span id="s2271">They should stay with the children, with the woman, whatever.</span> <span id="s2272">That's what -- how we survived.</span> <span id="s2273">We came to the city together with them.</span> <span id="s2274">And they tried to give us papers that we are partisan.</span> <span id="s2275">And this was the end of that.</span> <span id="s2276">Later, they came from Russia.</span> <span id="s2277">They came, and they organize whatever they have to organize for the people what they stayed there.</span> <span id="s2278">This all the end of that.</span> <span id="s2279">Whatever they saw the Russian, you had a watch or something, they took it away by themselves.</span> <span id="s2280">They were robbing, too.</span> <span id="s2281">You know, like a front.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">03:40:59</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: Did you tell me everything about -- did we do everything we should about Lubczanski?</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: Lubczanski, they were a very bad boys.</span> <span id="s2285">They were two brothers.</span> <span id="s2286">There were always, always, you know, complaining.</span> <span id="s2287">They said, “They are not Communists, they are fascists.</span> <span id="s2288">And they are taking money and jewelry from the people.”</span> <span id="s2289">And they went in to Platon even.</span> <span id="s2290">So they called the Bielskis brother, the three of them they went, and he told them what are the Lubczanskis doing.</span> <span id="s2291">So Platon said, "Kill them.</span> <span id="s2292">Kill them."</span> <span id="s2293">But, you know, we saw already the end of this everything, so they didn't touch them.</span> <span id="s2294">They didn't touch them.</span> <span id="s2295">They told them only, “Go away we should not see you.”</span> <span id="s2296">This is it.</span> <span id="s2297">And they still alive.</span> <span id="s2298">They are still alive in</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: Are there any other things you want to tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: We talk about everything.</span> <span id="s2302">What can I say more?</span> <span id="s2303">You went through everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: You don't have any rememberances of stories you should tell me that I didn't ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: No.</span> <span id="s2306">You went over everything.</span> <span id="s2307">Everything.</span> <span id="s2308">There in the partisan were these two friends of mine, they were writing everything every day, a diary.</span> <span id="s2309">And now, she will write a book about it.</span> <span id="s2310">They were mostly not – you know, they were sitting in the forest and only thinking how to survive, how to survive.</span> <span id="s2311">That was the only thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">03:43:01</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">Q: And it was a very unusual situation where you fought.</span> <span id="s2314">Everywhere else people didn't know in time or only the young unattached people fought?</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">Q: There weren't heroes that rescued?</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2318">The heroes was only the brothers Bielskis.</span> <span id="s2319">Alright, they had help.</span> <span id="s2320">I said before, they couldn't be a partisan Bielskis if they didn't have the all people.</span> <span id="s2321">They were young people.</span> <span id="s2322">They were fighting with them.</span> <span id="s2323">They were doing everything what they told them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">And because of them, there are the Bielskis partisan otriad.</span> <span id="s2325">Because without them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2326">What do you think?</span> <span id="s2327">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2328">Whoever will survive, survive, and that's the end of that.</span> <span id="s2329">And like that a whole generations, two, three generations are still alive because of the Bielskis brothers.</span> <span id="s2330">And all over the world are they, all over the world.</span> <span id="s2331">And sometimes we are coming in touch with them for a wedding from the grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2332">The wedding.</span> <span id="s2333">And they said, “Listen to me, what would be without the Bielskis?</span> <span id="s2334">What would -- we would not have children, and grandchildren, nothing.</span> <span id="s2335">We have to thank them.”</span> <span id="s2336">But not always was like that.</span> <span id="s2337">No.</span> <span id="s2338">But when you getting older and smarter and you see many things in other perspectives.</span> <span id="s2339">You didn't see this before, but now, when you going to bar mitzvah, you going to a wedding for your grandchild and you think, “Listen I did it.</span> <span id="s2340">I did it with the help of the Bielskis.”</span> <span id="s2341">This is something.</span> <span id="s2342">Something.</span> <span id="s2343">They are in the army, they are all over, professors, doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">Everything you have.</span> <span id="s2345">Every -- many, many doctors.</span> <span id="s2346">And they said, “I am giving all of my life for the poor, for the old.”</span> <span id="s2347">And they are like that.</span> <span id="s2348">Many.</span> <span id="s2349">They going away to Israel in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s2350">You know what’s a kibbutz?</span> <span id="s2351">And they working there and they trying everythin.</span> <span id="s2352">They put everything aside here the money, and they working there, “because I have to remember what they did for my parents once.</span> <span id="s2353">People -- brother Bielskis, what they didn't know even us.”</span> <span id="s2354">And this something.</span> <span id="s2355">Something when you are going out and you see all of them on a wedding or something.</span> <span id="s2356">How the young generation is dancing and singing and comes a professor from Harva-- or from this – or from Columbia University and said, “Wait a second” -- we had a 50 anniversary, me and Alex, two years ago and came two professors, I never heard about them, I never knew them – “I have to remind you of something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Remember one thing, because of” -- the other brothers are not alive.</span> <span id="s2358">He said, “Because of the brothers, and Zusia, we are still here.</span> <span id="s2359">And we have our families, and thanks to him.”</span> <span id="s2360">This is something, you know, when you are sitting and you hear this.</span> <span id="s2361">You know, your heart is pounding, pounding.</span> <span id="s2362">You think, “Really, was it like that?”</span> <span id="s2363">And this was really like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">Q: Well, thank you, Sonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">A: It's an honor to be with you.</span> <span id="s2366">Q: It's an honor to be with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">A: It's an honor to be with you.</span> <span id="s2368">You making this so easy.</span> <span id="s2369">I am not a nervous person, but in the morning, I said to my son, I said, "You know what, I am afraid."</span> <span id="s2370">He said, "Mommy, what are you afraid?</span> <span id="s2371">You be only you."</span> <span id="s2372">And this is the true.</span> <span id="s2373">You are only you.</span> <span id="s2374">Tell whatever you know.</span> <span id="s2375">And you making this easy.</span> <span id="s2376">Not everybody has it -- some, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">A: Thank you again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">03:47:40 End of Tape #3
