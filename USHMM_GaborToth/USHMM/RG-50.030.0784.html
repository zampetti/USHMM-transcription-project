classmates how well I could throw a rocks.</span> <span id="s392">And I did throw it at the tree.</span> <span id="s393">I wanted to hit the stem – trunk of this – of the pine tree.</span> <span id="s394">I missed, but I didn’t miss the window that was behind it to my – to my headmaster’s office.</span> <span id="s395">Now, he was a friend of my father’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Oh,

trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: – in trouble too.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: There was another instance where it was pretty scary, when the yard of the house where we lived in Nowogródek was a well, the one that you crank and l-lower the bucket into the well, and then crank it up.</span> <span id="s409">Well, it just happened that th-there was a – I don’t know how, but few buckets got lost, they det-detached from the chain and – and fell into the –</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Into the well.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: –

climbed into the bucket and he lowered me to the well.</span> <span id="s417">About halfway there, the crank loosened up.</span> <span id="s418">The crank that the chain was –</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: – wound on, and I slid, I fell down all the way into the well.</span> <span id="s421">Lucky that there were some –</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Buckets.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: – buckets, because I was standing on them, and I was about waist deep in water.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s425">Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: It – h-he tried to secure the drum on the – on the crank, and he would pull me up few feet, and I’d drop again.</span> <span id="s427">It took about half an hour, and finally the neighbor happened to come and – to come by, and both of them pulled me out of the well.</span> <span id="s428">And I – I remember perfectly, looking up and seeing just a little – little opening, skylight from – from the bottom of the well.</span> <span id="s429">Wound up with a wet pants, some few scratches on my knees and my elbows.</span> <span id="s430">But except being scared, there was no –</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Did you bring the buckets up?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: No, no, the buckets left [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: It

get another thing a little bit clear in my mind.</span> <span id="s443">When you’re talking about pulling up water from the well, this is when you lived in Nowogródek, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Nowogródek, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: So the family had moved from –</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Koralice(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Koralice(ph) to

border?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Sort of – yes, very loose description of a border.</span> <span id="s584">Borderland.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Borderland.</span> <span id="s586">And were the towns and the places on the borderlands much more mixed, as far as the different ethnicities?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s590">On the south of the borderland were the main town of Lwów.</span> <span id="s591">It – that area was populated by the Ukrainians and Poles</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Usually the villages were Ukrainians, towns were Poles</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s595">And that had been for generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: For generations, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s598">Did you ever travel west to visit your father’s relatives, who were still in the western part?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: No, not – not really.</span> <span id="s600">My sister, my older sister, she already did some traveling, but I was a little too small for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: And in general, did ever – anybody ever travel, let’s say, to Warsaw, or to other large towns, or did you pretty much stay in the same area?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: We – my father, he used to travel a lot.</span> <span id="s603">And first of all, they had conventions of the – the soldiers’ conventions, spre – specially from the legion of – Marshall Pilsudski’s legion.</span> <span id="s604">So he used to – every year he used to have a convention that he used to travel.</span> <span id="s605">Sometime he would take my mother, then my grandmother was in charge of our brood.</span> <span id="s606">So my father did – I was my – like I said, my older sister did travel some se – west – western part of Poland, but I did not.</span> <span id="s607">I – maybe 50 – hundred kilometers from Nowogródek, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: That was about it.</span> <span id="s610">I never even got to Wilno.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: So – I lost my train of thought for a second.</span> <span id="s612">It’ll come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: You’re doing a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Oh, thank you.</span> <span id="s615">So are you, so are you.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: In – in Nowogródek, did the larger questions of, you know, the politics of the times, did they – did people talk about these things, like what was going on nationally, what was going on in Germany, what was going on in Russia, things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s619">Very, very much so.</span> <span id="s620">Especially Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Especially Germany.</span> <span id="s623">Russians – with Russia we did have some, because there were some people that’s – woulds tried to escape from Russia and then eventually wind up in our town.</span> <span id="s624">So we knew very much so what was happening in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Oh yes, we – we – we were pretty well informed on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Tell me again how far from the border –</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: It was 50 – 50 miles.</span> <span id="s629">Wer – about 70 some kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: So that’s pretty close.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: That’s pretty close, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: And what were some of the things that you were hearing about from Germany, that people talked about, and then we’ll talk about the people who escaped from Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Well, Germany at that time already, were – of course there were pretty strong nations, pretty stor – strong country.</span> <span id="s634">And they were already trying to get some of the territory that belong and was given to Poland in peace talks after first World War, which separated Germany from east Prussia, they – but also gave Poland access to Baltic Sea –</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: So t</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: – which was a very important terri – territory to Poland, but Germans wanted that part for them, so they have – so they’ll be connected to east Prussia.</span> <span id="s637">And Germany was threatening Poland with the aggression and – and I remember hearing about – about it in my parents’ discussions, my parents’ friends’ discussions, that the ri – the Germans were threatening all the time to – marching to that part of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: So this would be territory that was along the Baltic Sea, the coastline?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: I-It was – it was – if you know the area, it [indecipherable] Gdansk.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Gdansk?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: And Gdynia.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Gdynia.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Gre – Gdansk was the free town, which meant that it was – that didn’t belong to any nation, no – not Polish, not German, it was a free town.</span> <span id="s644">That’s one –</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: That’s a very unusual construct.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: It was –</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Excuse me, can we stop for a second?</span> <span id="s648">Would you like some water.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: I would love – [break]</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: So, we’re talking about the territory that – that Germany wanted, and the, I guess, administrative status of the free city of Gdansk, which is called Danzig, I believe, in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s653">So they wanted the city, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: They – they wanted the city, and the rest of the east Prussia.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Which was a – quite a big – big territory, which was ruled by Germans, and they wanted to connect it to the main German territory, and this piece of land separated – separated east Prussia from main Germany, but it gave Poland access to the Baltic Sea, which is very important for the modern nation to be able to exist from the country to the rest of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: To have a coastline, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s659">Well, the – the trades – the – the shipping is very important for the well-being of the nation.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s661">And as a result of World War One’s outcome, it had been land that was then –</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: That was th – assigned to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: And we call it po morze, which means, close to the sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: So this – these types of events, they were taking place, what time was it, the mid-1930s, the early 30s, the late thir –</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: This was the la-late 30s.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: The late 30s.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: And – and the conversation between your parents and amongst other people often was about these questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s672">What did people say about Hitler, for example, and the Nazi party?</span> <span id="s673">Was that a separate conversation, or intertwined?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: As a matter of fact, we were very well aware what he was doing, and as a matter of fact, lot of people were predicting da – what would happen in the future, that there has to be a – the wa – second World War with the Germany being the aggressor.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: So people were talking that Germany will start a war?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Wa – how – how much information, and how much focus was there, in the circles that your parents moved, and so on, about Germany’s policies to Jews in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: That we were not really aware of.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: We were not aware of what was happening there.</span> <span id="s681">As a matter of fact, I think no – not many people in the world knew about it.</span> <span id="s682">Germany were pretty quiet, pretty quiet and – about what they were doing to Jews at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Did news of Kristallnacht reach Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: I couldn’t really tell you, I fir – I – I know what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: And I know when it happened, but I only know it from the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: But not from the – my childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s690">Because I wonder how the Jewish population in Nowogródek was responding and talking about this.</span> <span id="s691">You might not know about that if you weren’t in – you know, didn’t have that many contacts.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s694">All right, let’s turn now eastwards.</span> <span id="s695">You say that, you know, being so close to the Soviet border, there were people who would try to escape, and sometimes succeeded.</span> <span id="s696">What was the kind of news that they brought with them, about what was going on in the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Well, I – I have a very well – very good information when it comes to that, because as a matter of fact, one of the men that worked for my parents escaped fr-from communist Russia through the borders and he worked for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: What was his name?</span> <span id="s699">Do you –</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Alexand – no, Antek(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Antek(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Which was Anthony.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Anthony.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Anthony.</span> <span id="s705">I don’t remember his last name, but I remember he – he was a terrific guy.</span> <span id="s706">He spent a lot of time playing with my brother and myself.</span> <span id="s707">He lived in our house and he worked for my parents.</span> <span id="s708">Very good man.</span> <span id="s709">He had experienced some tortures even, in – in Russia.</span> <span id="s710">He was accused of being a spy, and I don’t remember now how it happened that he escape, but he did escape from Russia and –</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Did you – did he ever say where – where he was from, was he born there, or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: No, or if he did, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: But I remember him as a very good, very, very honest, hard-working man.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s716">And what other kind of news did you hear about what was going on in the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Not really much more, because they were very, very – not publicizing at that time, what was happening, and there was no contacts with any of the people.</span> <span id="s718">There were no contacts at all.</span> <span id="s719">As a matter of fact, my mother and my grandmother had very little contact with their own family in – in – in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Did people know about the famine that was in the Ukraine?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Where – at that time, I did not.</span> <span id="s722">Of course, I knew later, but at that time I didn’t know about it.</span> <span id="s723">Don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: This – yeah.</span> <span id="s725">One of the reasons I ask this is that – is just it’s, in today’s world, when we’re talking in 2015, it sounds almost inconceivable, that with our means of information and communication, that we wouldn’t know what’s going on in a country that’s next to our own, because you find out so quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Well, Russians, who had a clamp on everything, on – on – on whatever was happening, the government had a clamp on it.</span> <span id="s727">The propaganda came right from the main – from Moscow.</span> <span id="s728">There people are not allowed to listen to radio.</span> <span id="s729">Of – what they were reading in the papers was written by the government.</span> <span id="s730">There was no free speech, there was no free publicity of any that kind.</span> <span id="s731">So there was very little knowledge of what was happening coming out, out of Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s733">Were there different political parties in Nowogródek?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Oh yes, of course.</span> <span id="s735">That’s – Poles are known for it.</span> <span id="s736">There is – as a matter of fact, I remember saying that it-it – that if they – you have three Poles together, you have at least three different parties, political parties.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Poles are known for that.</span> <span id="s739">Everybody is – has his own opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Did your parents have a particular bent, or a particular political point of view within Polish politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s742">Well, to m – to us, whatever Marshall Pilsudski said, that was a – that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: It was a ru-ru-rule that has to be good, because he was a great man.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: So he was the authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: He was the authority and to, he was – he died in ’35, and we cried.</span> <span id="s747">I remember we cried when he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: When you said your father served in his legion –</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Is that correct?</span> <span id="s751">How did he – I want to get a sense of, was he close to him personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: No, he was – he was just his leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: He was his leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s758">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: He – he – at – at one time, he was practically a dictator.</span> <span id="s760">That’s how strong a rule he had over Poland.</span> <span id="s761">But he was one of the good e – good dictators, which done very – done a lot of good things for Poland at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: In the late 30s, of course, as you say, there was talk of war.</span> <span id="s763">Do you remember what the summer of 1939 was like, what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Well, yes, the international situation was very on the edge, very s – on the edge, as you – Germans were pressing more and more for that territory, and threatening, and Poland had a problem, because for practically 150 years, Poland as a nation, as a country in Europe did not exist.</span> <span id="s765">It was not on the map of Europe.</span> <span id="s766">It was divided into three parts.</span> <span id="s767">Parts of Russia, parts of Germany, parts of Austria.</span> <span id="s768">Those countries tr – took advantage of Poland’s production, they – they milked Poland to death, taking advantage of everything.</span> <span id="s769">So, from 1920 to 1939, it wasn’t even 20 years that Poland was a free country, taking care of its own.</span> <span id="s770">So we didn’t – we were not prepared for any kind of war.</span> <span id="s771">We were – Poland was building schools, road, bridges, railroads.</span> <span id="s772">We were not prepared for the war, and it – but war was on the – on the horizon.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: That summer, did you – were you at home, were you on – in vacation, where – what were you doing right before the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Well, w-wer – we – it was just over the summer holidays.</span> <span id="s775">S-Sc-School was started over in 1939, w-we just started to school when the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Were you in school when it started?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Do you remember where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: – no, we were – we were at home.</span> <span id="s780">As a matter of fact, wa – was – what I remember distinctly, we had two beautiful German Shepherd dogs.</span> <span id="s781">They were young dogs, they’re guard dogs.</span> <span id="s782">And from the early morning, they were howling.</span> <span id="s783">They were howling, and we didn’t know what happened until we heard on the radio that Germany attacked Poland.</span> <span id="s784">And that wa – so, very early in the morning on the 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: September first, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Th-Th – oh – that was September, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Mm-hm, September first.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: First, that Germany attacked Poland.</span> <span id="s789">Within the next day, my father got his orders to report to the town of Zhest(ph), where there was a big Polish army unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: And where is Zhest(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Zhest(ph) was the ep – west of – west of Nowogródek.</span> <span id="s792">It divides – it’s right on the river, and it’s – it was like a fortress in the years past, and there was a thi – that’s where my father was assigned to.</span> <span id="s793">He was reporting – had to report to his unit over there.</span> <span id="s794">I remember he li – leaving the town.</span> <span id="s795">We cried.</span> <span id="s796">I remember he went to his bedroom, and on the wall there was a picture of Holy Mary, and he cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: He cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Because he had to leave his family.</span> <span id="s799">And I hold his – I was holding his hand, and I wa – cried with him.</span> <span id="s800">And he – we took him to the bus, he took a bus to Zhest(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s802">It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s803">What do you think the dogs were howling at?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: I don’t know how, they had a feeling that some – some – something was happening.</span> <span id="s805">And I – it was scary.</span> <span id="s806">It was really scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Well, lotta – lotta young people were drafted right away.</span> <span id="s809">They had to report to his – to their military units.</span> <span id="s810">And within a few days, there was a – there were a couple instances where German planes flew over Nowogródek, but they – they didn’t drop a single bomb.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: So, did you continue going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yes, we continued going to school.</span> <span id="s813">Within about 10 days, my father came back.</span> <span id="s814">Let’s face it, my father was in his lates – late 40s.</span> <span id="s815">There were, in the unit that my father was assigned to, there were a lot of young officers that were very well prepared.</span> <span id="s816">My father was an old man already, considered in those times.</span> <span id="s817">So he was put on a standby and came home, in the uniform, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: That must have been a relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Well, for us it was a – oh God, it was a real wonderful surprise.</span> <span id="s820">But it didn’t last long because on the 17th of September, Russians march into Poland.</span> <span id="s821">Of course, we didn’t know at that time that they – what they had the agreement with Germany, that as soon as Germany attacks Poland from the west, Russians will attack Poland from the east.</span> <span id="s822">Our forces were fighting as hard as they could to keep ra – Germans from marching far into Poland, but eventually they did get all the way to Warsaw, to capital.</span> <span id="s823">But in the meantime, Russians took over the whole eastern part of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: So, if they attacked, or marched in on September 17th, they must have reached Nowogródek within an hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: They were second day.</span> <span id="s826">They were second day they were in pol – in Nowogródek.</span> <span id="s827">We couldn’t – we couldn’t understand some Belarussians and Jews were greeting them.</span> <span id="s828">They were greeting Russian soldiers marching into Nowogródek, and they were – the orang – Russian army was pitiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: What do you mean – what do – why do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Neglected – neglected only – the ones on the horses, the horses were – some of them were like skeletons.</span> <span id="s831">People were dirty in the – I could – it’s hard to explain.</span> <span id="s832">We had to c-compare what we were comparing to our soldiers that were really, you know, sharp looking.</span> <span id="s833">This was misery.</span> <span id="s834">But they were in power, so what can we do?</span> <span id="s835">And within a – one day of getting into Nowogródek, the terror s-started.</span> <span id="s836">Russians, with the help of the local communists were arresting policemen, government people, any military, teachers, priests, they were arresting.</span> <span id="s837">Pretty soon the local jail was full of our local best – our local people.</span> <span id="s838">Of course –</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Did you know anybody –</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Do you – do you know – did you pers –</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Most of – most of our friends’ fathers were in there.</span> <span id="s843">And of course, the second say, my father was arrested.</span> <span id="s844">And the I – they arrested him in town, but in the afternoon he came home.</span> <span id="s845">They – they questioned him and released him, and I remember hearing my parents whispering, talking.</span> <span id="s846">My mother insisted that he leaves Nowogródek and goes over to the German side, to the town where he is from, where his family was, and my father didn’t want to go because he wa – didn’t want to leave the family alone.</span> <span id="s847">Well, he – he – they didn’t have to make a decision, because that night we were already in bed, some of us, some of them were going to bed.</span> <span id="s848">There was a – rifle butts against the doors, banging on the doors.</span> <span id="s849">Local Jews – Jew, with a red band just [indecipherable] that he was a – one of the commissars that became communist commissar, led three or four, I don’t remember now, Russian soldiers with the rifles with bayonets.</span> <span id="s850">They took my father, they put the br – put him [indecipherable] and marched him, and that was the last time we seen him.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: We haven’t seen him since.</span> <span id="s853">For – for quite a while, it got to be known that if the jail would allow us to be – to give some food parcel or clothes parcel to the people in jail, that meant that the person was still in jail.</span> <span id="s854">After about two or three weeks, they stopped taking parcels.</span> <span id="s855">That was indication that my father was not in local jail any more.</span> <span id="s856">Where, or how, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s857">We could never, during the war, after the war, we could never find out what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Did you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: And du – du – his main sin was that he was active in a community life, that he fought at least Russians in 1920.</span> <span id="s860">Russians and Germans practiced the same thing.</span> <span id="s861">If you eliminate leaders of the community, it’s going to be that much easier to run the community.</span> <span id="s862">Well, that was my father’s problem.</span> <span id="s863">He was active of the – in his community life, so they had to get rid of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Well, when they came into the house, did they give a reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: They searched, of course, they searched the house, and – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: You say there was a local Jewish person who –</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: There was a local Jewish person that –</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Did you know him, did you recognize him?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: I – I didn’t know him personally, my sister insists that she knew who he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: And – and – but it turn out there were a lot of Jews in Poland that were communists, and there were some – there were some [indecipherable] people that were communists.</span> <span id="s874">And they, of course, right away worked for Russians, worked for communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Were there – was there a Polish communist party?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: There – not legal.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Before the war, all the communist party in Poland was not legal.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Were there any – any Poles who were members of this illegal party?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Of course, of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s882">What a terror for your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Oh God, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s884">On top of it, within a couple weeks of arresting my father, Russians authorities came, lived on the edge of the town – and like I said, we had a big house, we had a big barn, they wanted our property, because they wanted to – for Russian people to take to live in there.</span> <span id="s885">My mother insisted that we will move if they give us a house to move in.</span> <span id="s886">And that’s why we did – we were not very surprised when on the 10th of February, 1940, again a Russian officer with a – some soldiers, at night – they always done all those arresting and deporting at night.</span> <span id="s887">They – it was the middle of the winter, cold, about a foot or so of snow.</span> <span id="s888">They marched to our house and told us to get ready, pick – get ready, pick up whatever you can carry, because you’re getting deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Was this the same house, or had you moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: No, it’s the same house.</span> <span id="s891">But we were – we were thought that we were being deported from our house to the other house.</span> <span id="s892">We were – we went – we didn’t know we were being deported to Russia, to Siberia.</span> <span id="s893">So it was quite a shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s895">Let’s talk a little bit about the months in between.</span> <span id="s896">Did you ever go to the prison where your father was, to bring food?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: My mother used to.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: My mother used to, at least few times a week.</span> <span id="s900">Sh –</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Had you ever been to this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: So you didn’t know what it looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: No, no, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s907">I went by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: You know, from the street, I seen the entrance to it, was big –</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Was it – was it a city jail, or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: It was a city jail, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: And how long was it that your father was held there, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Well, we’re – as a matter of fact, we were pretty sure that, although they were not taking parcels to him, that he was still there, because there was my sister’s friend, my gir – her girlfriend, when she wasn’t a – she wasn’t deported, so she was there, and she, after the war, she told us that she saw my father about a month – month or so after we were deported, he was being led to the railroad by – with a group of other prisoners, and she knew my father well.</span> <span id="s914">And, as a matter of fact, supposedly my father asked her, cause when he spotted her, where are we?</span> <span id="s915">What happened to his family.</span> <span id="s916">And of course she said that she told him that we were already deported to Russia.</span> <span id="s917">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s918">After the war she told us.</span> <span id="s919">That’s when she told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Let’s – let’s talk about this a little bit more.</span> <span id="s921">You say you never found out what happened to your father.</span> <span id="s922">That is, in – where – what his destiny was, where he was taken, or anything.</span> <span id="s923">Is that – that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: That’s correct, yes.</span> <span id="s925">We tried, through Red Cross, we – all kinds of institutions that had lists of – of our people that were murdered, in Katyn forest, in other areas.</span> <span id="s926">We – n-none of those lists have my father’s name.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: So this –</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: But then, of course, they were – lot of our people, lot of men and women were murdered in the small towns and buried right there, close to it.</span> <span id="s929">And some cemeteries were never found out, never opened, never found out where, who was.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s931">And did you ever go back to Nowogródek after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I did not.</span> <span id="s933">My brother and my sister did.</span> <span id="s934">As a matter of fact, they went to there, to our house, our –</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: – original house.</span> <span id="s937">And people were afraid.</span> <span id="s938">They thought that they were coming to take over, because there were people living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s940">What years did they go, or what year did they go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Oh, this must be about – at least 10 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: So would be like 2005?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yeah, something like that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Yeah, so would have been, oh man, 65 years after –</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: – afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: And in 2005 if they were there, then it was Belarus.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Belarus, yes.</span> <span id="s950">They flew from Warsaw to Linz, and then they took a – I think a car, and drove to Nowogródek.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: And was it feasible, or was it already, you know, no ho – no hope that there might be some information in the municipal records about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Nothing, nothing, nothing could be found.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: They looked?</span> <span id="s954">Or they tried?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: They – they s – they tried, yes.</span> <span id="s956">Nothing could be found of what happened to my father, which is so painful that we still don’t know what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: About – did – was there ever any story about, or any research done on any of the prisoners, or of the – the fact that they were held in this city jail for – you know, the ja – as you said, the jails filled up so quickly after the Soviets marched in, and what happened to most of the people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Well, si – you see, the Russians, probably some of the lists of people that they were arrested, and some of the people that they murdered, it j – it just happens that Belarussians do also have lists of people that they arrested.</span> <span id="s959">They were arrested in that territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: And th-they were – for some stupid reason, they will not release that list.</span> <span id="s962">So there is possibility that my father could be on that list, but th-th – the – the existing government of Belarus will not – not release that list.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Won’t – so that’s – that’s – yeah, I understand.</span> <span id="s964">I understand.</span> <span id="s965">Before we go to that night where you thought you were being taken to your second home in – or another house, and it turned out not to be the case, tell me a little bit about those months in between, about October, November, December.</span> <span id="s966">How did life progress?</span> <span id="s967">What was going on with your mother, your – your businesses?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Well, well, the business they took over right away.</span> <span id="s969">Within a week they took over the business, and my mother worked for them.</span> <span id="s970">She had to work for them, and so it wasn’t our business any more.</span> <span id="s971">As far as the life, right away there were shortages of just about everything.</span> <span id="s972">Even the – such a thing as salt, y-you had to queue – line up for hours sometime to get some salt.</span> <span id="s973">Sugar was hardly ever in the stores.</span> <span id="s974">Meat.</span> <span id="s975">The only thing that we could get pretty easy was bread, but otherwise, there were shortages of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: How do you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Well, Russians were exporting – taking everything into Russia.</span> <span id="s978">There were trains being loaded and taken into the deep Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: And of course, supply lines were – were cut.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Acor – of course.</span> <span id="s981">So – and of course the – the life was miserable.</span> <span id="s982">Everybody – the fear – this is the way they run the country, fear.</span> <span id="s983">One person against the other.</span> <span id="s984">And they, right away that – did that fear took over the whole town.</span> <span id="s985">People were afraid, they were li – would – before they would say anything, they would look around if there was anybody listening.</span> <span id="s986">Because all you had to do was say something about that you were not pleased what was happening, you can wind up in jail right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Did this extend to school, as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Well, of course, the teachers were our old teachers, but at least once a week we would have to have special classes, where they would try to convince us of what a wonderful country, what a free country Russia is, how – how advanced, how – of course, we knew better, even though we were children.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: So, what – what happened to that gentleman, you said his name was Alex, or Alexi, who was working with you – working for your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Well, he – he left us.</span> <span id="s991">As soon as Russians came in, he left.</span> <span id="s992">He ma – he was there maybe a couple days and he left.</span> <span id="s993">I don’t know what – what happened.</span> <span id="s994">Maybe he was afraid that they would put him in jail, too, because he escaped from there.</span> <span id="s995">But h-he left and ru – I don’t recall ever seeing him, or hearing of him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s997">Now I’d like to – I’d like to broach a subject that is a – a painful one, and a very sensitive one, but you – you mentioned that it was a local Jewish communist who came in when – when they arrested your father, and took him away.</span> <span id="s998">How – how did people – did people say, uh-huh, the Jews have betrayed us?</span> <span id="s999">Was that a sentiment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1001">That was the feeling.</span> <span id="s1002">That was – there were – I wouldn’t say they were all – all of them were communists, but there was quite a few of them, and the ones that did it, right away took – took over some th – important position in local government.</span> <span id="s1003">They – they – quite a few of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: But not all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Were there any people who, let’s say were Jewish and well-to-do, who were also arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Not – no – not that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: At that time, I di – did not – not that – not that I know of.</span> <span id="s1010">Could be – could be –</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Or deported, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Not at that time.</span> <span id="s1013">Later on I was told that they were, later on, just before Germany attacked Russia, there were some Russians – some jer – Jews were arrested and deported into the deep Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Before the war, how were relations – I mean, many Jewish people say that Poles are very anti-Semitic, or that anti-Semitism was rampant in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Well, a lot of it is true, a lot of it is true.</span> <span id="s1016">But, at the same time, if you know the real life in all the European countries, Poland was pretty free [indecipherable] as far as the religion is concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: So, whoever – whatever religion you were, you were free to practice it.</span> <span id="s1019">Before, in the first – 30s, where Nazis took over Germany, they deported a lot of Jews to Poland, or a lot of Jews came into Poland for escape from Germany to Poland, and they were doing pretty good.</span> <span id="s1020">But you have to realize that most of the industry, most of the business in Poland was in Jews’ hands.</span> <span id="s1021">Jew – Jews had a saying that was very popular, you have the streets, but we have the buildings on them.</span> <span id="s1022">Which meant that they – they were in control of quite a bit of industry, quite a bit of – bit of business.</span> <span id="s1023">Now, there – they were known for being bankers, for – for doing lot of trading and that.</span> <span id="s1024">And sorry to say, but our average people don’t like rich, rich people.</span> <span id="s1025">And they were – they represented the rich people.</span> <span id="s1026">So lot of common people were, of course, hateful of them.</span> <span id="s1027">Wa – but we didn’t have any – with Russians were doing those pogroms and that, we de – we didn’t have anything like that.</span> <span id="s1028">But fact was, we didn’t like them, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Were there any Jewish kids in your classes at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Of course, of course.</span> <span id="s1031">But there were some good Jews, and I have an example.</span> <span id="s1032">I was going to tell you that later.</span> <span id="s1033">I will tell you later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s1035">I know that this is a very –</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Touchy [indecipherable] subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: – touchy – touchy sensi – it’s very sensitive subject, but in – particularly in the areas of the kressi(ph), where there were so many different occupations and occupations by – by different forces, armies and – and so on.</span> <span id="s1038">It was one of the reasons why I was asking you too, wha-what was the make-up of the towns, and the people, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Well, yes, like the – in Nowogródek there was a – quite a good sized population of Jews, but then there was also Belarussian and the Poles.</span> <span id="s1040">It was pretty – I would say it was evenly divided.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1042">Well, we’ll break for lunch right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: And come back and talk later –</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: – for – and take the story forward when –</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: – after you’re arrested.</span> <span id="s1049">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Good, good.</span> <span id="s1051">I’ll be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Okay, so Mr. Szymel, we s – what we see here is a photograph.</span> <span id="s1055">Tell me who is in the photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: They’re my family.</span> <span id="s1057">My father, my mother, my grandmother, my older sister and me when I was one year old, practically one year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: So that means it was taken in 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: ‘29.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Oh, 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: And how is it that you came to have this photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: My parents send it to our relatives in Poland at that time, and when we were visiting them after the war, we found it and they made a copy of it, and they – here it is.</span> <span id="s1064">To me, it’s a relic.</span> <span id="s1065">It’s – it’s something that I cherish, because that’s the only picture of our childhood with our – babyhood, not just childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Is it the only photo you have of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: No, I have some others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: You have some others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1071">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1072">Thank you very much, we can put it to the side now.</span> <span id="s1073">Okay, before the break, we kind of stopped at the point where in February 10th, 1940, soldiers came to your home again and in the middle of the night, knocked on the door and told you you are going to have to leave.</span> <span id="s1074">Can you remember how long you had to put your things together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: They gave us about a half an hour, they told us that we have half an hour to pack whatever we can carry.</span> <span id="s1076">And of course, I was – we were being deported from our house.</span> <span id="s1077">And – now this is the middle of the severe Polish kind of winter, about 25 degrees below zero, but at least a foot of snow on the ground.</span> <span id="s1078">And middle of the night, we – my grandmother and my brother and my sister, were put on this sled, horse-drawn sled and my mother, my older sister and me, we walked.</span> <span id="s1079">We walked, and we were taken to the government building, not far from railroad station, and the building was pretty soon being filled up with a family li – just like ours.</span> <span id="s1080">All the people from Nowogródek, most of them women and children, because most of the men were either in jail, or – or gone somewhere.</span> <span id="s1081">So, this is – this is the first day, first night of our experience, when they were being de – we were being deported to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: What did you manage to take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Well, most of we – what we tried, was we took clothing, some clothes, because of the fact that it was so cold, winter, and with that, there was hardly anything we could carry.</span> <span id="s1084">There were a few things that were put on the sled, but otherwise we had to carry everything.</span> <span id="s1085">So most of it we – we took with us was clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1087">I-In that government building, you said there were families like your own.</span> <span id="s1088">Did you recognize any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Of course, most of them were friends of our parents, and of us children.</span> <span id="s1090">And so we knew just about – at least 90 percent of people, they were either acquaintances, or friends of ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: The next morning – the next morning they packed us – they told us we have to march to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1093">When we got there, there was a whole line of freight cars that were prepared for transporting mass people.</span> <span id="s1094">The way it was built, on each end of the – the freight car, there were shelves, two shelves on each end, where they packed us, about 40 people to each car, which meant that we were to lay down like sardines, you know, one – you know, next to each other, on the mi – in the middle of the – th-the wa – the wagon, there was a coal – there was a cast iron stove, to provide heat.</span> <span id="s1095">And then on the side there was a hole in the floor of the car, as a – to serve as a toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Were there – was there anybody who didn’t have – who didn’t fit on those two platforms, who was in the middle of the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: No, they were – they were – they were just managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: We just managed to be either sitting down, or laying down on those platforms.</span> <span id="s1102">On this – on the top sides on each side there were small windows, with the crates – with the crates so, you know, nobody could get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: With grates, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: And the – of course, the whole train was surrounded by Russian soldiers with rifles, so there was no way to get in or get on of the train.</span> <span id="s1105">We were totally captive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Did anybody at any point official, tell you why you had been arrested, or where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Not – not at all, not at all.</span> <span id="s1108">Nothing, nothing there – there – they wouldn’t ask us, they wouldn’t tell us, they were just giving us orders, do this, do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: And the orders were, I take it, in Russian, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Of course, ti – only Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Could – could you understand what they were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Well, most of it, but if not, my mother would translate it to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: There were a lot of people that did not understand Russian, but like I say, lucky there were a few people that would translate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: There were no Polish, or Jewish, or Belarussian civilians involved in this.</span> <span id="s1117">This was strictly Russian soldiers that were guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: And tha – and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1121">Did that little –

metal parts eventually were covered with a – ice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: So that’s how cold it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: So that stove didn’t do much good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Well, if you were next to it, yes.</span> <span id="s1135">So we – we had everything that we brought with us, we – were dressed in it.</span> <span id="s1136">Later, when the doors were closed completely, it wi – it did warm up to the extent that we could take some of the clothes off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Did you have any food with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: We brought si – very little, very little, but we did bring some.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Were you fed on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: On the train, once a day, sometime even twice they would bring a bucket of hot water, and a bucket of what they called soup – that’s what they called it, it was a – loo-looked like a dishwasher water, and a loaf – couple loaves of bread for the 40 people.</span> <span id="s1141">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1143">And – and then, when did the train start moving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Very next day.</span> <span id="s1145">Very next day you started moving through the – we-went through the – Baranowice, which was a big railroad center first.</span> <span id="s1146">It was close to Russian border.</span> <span id="s1147">And then next day we crossed the – the border between Russia and Poland, all border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: How did you know when you got to the border that you were crossing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: Well, we would – we would read the signs.</span> <span id="s1150">We could read the signs only – also, we would see the miserable view of people.</span> <span id="s1151">People were dressed in a shabby clothes, in a padded – women and men in the same, with the padded pants and coats, miserable looking people, moving around like robots.</span> <span id="s1152">And we – you could tell that it was not Poland any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Did – did you have a sense of what your final destination would be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Well, by that time they did ha – it did come – I don’t know how it – it was told us that – we were told we’re being deported to Siberia, but where Siberia, we didn’t have the slightest idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1156">Did people get sick on the train journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Well, not so much physically, but emotionally.</span> <span id="s1158">There was a lot of crying.</span> <span id="s1159">There was lot of – most of it was, I would say crying and sobbing from all the mothers that were there with all the small children.</span> <span id="s1160">It was – the feeling was terrible, terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Did you know the other people who were in your wagon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Ninety percent of them we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Okay, so in this wagon you weren’t – you weren’t with strangers, you were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: No, no, they were – they were – they were – most of them were at least acquaintances.</span> <span id="s1165">Not friends, but acquaintances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1167">What kind – was there any conversation going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Oh, all the time, all the time.</span> <span id="s1169">Comparing notes, com – talking about parts of – people of the families that were not with us, like, you know [indecipherable] my father, that were arrested, and some other men that were arrested.</span> <span id="s1170">There were – there was a lot of talk about it, between the women, especially.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Were there any men on the – on the – in your wagon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: There might have been, out of 40, there must have been about two men, maybe.</span> <span id="s1173">Most of them were older men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1175">So that does present a very sad picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Very sad, very sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Did – did – so, but did everybody make it, that is, to the final destination?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Well, everybody made it.</span> <span id="s1179">Our – we were gone from Poland, we were moving straight east for about a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: You have to realize that we were not a priority, so the train sometime would stop for the longest time on the sidings, and then we’d continue going.</span> <span id="s1182">And eventually we arrived in Moscow.</span> <span id="s1183">The reason we knew, because we could see the signs, Moscow on the – on – in the station.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Did you see anything of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: No, absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Through the – through the wi – little window?</span> <span id="s1187">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: No, absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1189">Especially it was winter, everything was covered in snow, and f-from that time on, from Moscow our destination changed.</span> <span id="s1190">We were moving straight north.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Before we were going east, now we were going straight north.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: And how could you tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Well, we could tell by sun, by – most of it sun, you know, that’s we – we changed the direction.</span> <span id="s1195">And of course the – the – the countryside that we would see through those windows was changing gradually too.</span> <span id="s1196">There were more snow, more – it was getting colder, and there were more and more forests.</span> <span id="s1197">And we traveled another two – after Moscow, we traveled another two weeks, directly north.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Oh wow.</span> <span id="s1199">So, it took a long time actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Totally it took us three weeks on the train.</span> <span id="s1201">By the time we got to our destination, which we didn’t know it was our destination, but the – the name of the town was Vowogda(ph), which was a big railroad center.</span> <span id="s1202">And up there we were told to get out of the train, and they put us on a slow horse-drawn sleds.</span> <span id="s1203">And again, the grown-ups and older children had to walk.</span> <span id="s1204">Only the smaller and old were riding i-in the sled.</span> <span id="s1205">And for three days we traveled to our final destination, staying at night, staying at the local schools.</span> <span id="s1206">And few of them, we could see there was somebody spending nights up there before, most likely people just like us, the deportees, that they were spending nights up there.</span> <span id="s1207">And thi –</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: How wa – how was your mother holding out in all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: My mother was a trooper.</span> <span id="s1210">She was so strong.</span> <span id="s1211">She was so – how shall I put it?</span> <span id="s1212">She – she could practically do miracles.</span> <span id="s1213">She would, if she had the chance, she would warm up some water for us so we could drink s – warm water.</span> <span id="s1214">She would divide pieces of bread into few pieces so every few hours we would have a few bites of bread.</span> <span id="s1215">She was unbelievably strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Did – did – did she cry during the trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Not that I seen here.</span> <span id="s1218">She was – she wa – she wouldn’t allow herself to see us that she cried.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: She had to keep up the morale, so I never, never seen her cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: So – and your brothers and – and your brother and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Well, we’re –</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: All four of you were deported, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: All four of us, oh my – my sister was – by this time she was practically 15.</span> <span id="s1225">I was already 12, younger sister was 10, and the brother was eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: So your family was a little bit older, in the sense that there were no infants.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: No, there were no infants, but on the – in the train, in the car, there were some small babies, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1229">And were you amongst those who had to walk beside the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Yes, yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: – the sleigh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: – yes.</span> <span id="s1233">Each – every time, I was already 12 years old, so I was considered that I could si – take it, take care of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: And, were you thinking of what your father had said before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Well, not at that time, but after that, when I grew up, many a times it came to my mind what – what he meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Because at that time it sounds like your mother was taking the burdens on her shoulders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: She – totally, totally.</span> <span id="s1238">She was in charge.</span> <span id="s1239">She was in charge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: When you – when did you – where did you end up being your – what ended up being your final destination?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Well, on the third day we arrived what – which was a logging camp.</span> <span id="s1242">There were about five bar – wooden, log barra – barracks, designed for the people that would work f-falling timber – logging.</span> <span id="s1243">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: What was the name of this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: The – the name was Rzhavka(ph), which took the name from the small river that flow through it.</span> <span id="s1246">The ri – the name of the river was Rzhavka(ph), which means rusty.</span> <span id="s1247">And the – the reason it was rusty – called rusty, because the water in it was colored of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Of rust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: – rust, yes.</span> <span id="s1250">From the vegetation that it flowed, the – most of the area were marshes, and the – our camp was on the lower hill, among marshes, right in the middle of virgin forests.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: That sounds very pretty, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: It – it wasn – part of it was beautiful, not just pretty, it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1253">The nature can be that way, but it – they – also can be cruel, because of the cold, because of the terrain and whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: So your – the – the – settlement that you go to is Rzhavka(ph), yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: And they – it’s made of – it’s comprised of five log cabins?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: So it’s a rather small place –</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: It’s not a cabin, it’s a big building.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Oh, big buildings, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Big building, well, I would say the length of my – this, my house, and there be anywhere 30 to 40 people in each building.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: So it was like a barracks?</span> <span id="s1263">A: It was a barrack, yes.</span> <span id="s1264">And in – each side had a couple windows in it, and a big stove, and brick stove for heat, and for you – there was some cooking you could cook up there, but it was a big stove.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: So di – were – was everybody responsible for their own food, their own cooking at this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Well, there was – we didn’t have t – anything to cook, first of all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: So we were rely – we had to rely on what was in the camp.</span> <span id="s1269">There was a bakery, and there was a, what they called restaurant, where, if you had money, and you had a coupon, you could buy some soup, and of course, you could buy your allowance of bread.</span> <span id="s1270">Everybody, every person, child and old people were assigned 200 grams of bread, black bread, which amounted sometime to a couple of slices.</span> <span id="s1271">We were assigned that much a day, and we could buy it.</span> <span id="s1272">That – no more, no less, but that was what we could buy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: So, in other words, you weren’t given food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: No, we had to buy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: And in the beginning, how did you buy it, if you had no money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: Well, we had some money with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: We brought some money because at that time in – in Nowogródek, the – the currency already was Russian dru – ruble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Okay, let me go back for that, I didn’t think of this before.</span> <span id="s1280">Your family had been well-to-do, and when the Soviets took over, then they nationalized and took away your businesses.</span> <span id="s1281">But wer – were you given any compensation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: No, no, I don’t know, but my mother would get paid –</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: – for her work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: And so that’s where she had the rubles from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Well, we also had – it turned out my mother has quite a bit of money.</span> <span id="s1287">We, among other things we had a beautiful horse.</span> <span id="s1288">And the young man that worked for us, and he still lived with us when Russians came in, told my mother that he heard, among men, that they were goin – the Russians were going to take our horse away.</span> <span id="s1289">But he suggested that he – he even had the person that was willing to buy our horse, somebody connected to the Russians, that he would buy our horse.</span> <span id="s1290">And my mother sold that horse, and she got quite a bit of money for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: And she took that one you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: And sh – and it turned out, that was the money that saved us in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: That’s an interesting point.</span> <span id="s1294">I wanted to – to get a sense of when you had –</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Yes, we –</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: – when you took clothes and no food, then you were in a – in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: – yeah, I – I – w-we never seen the money, my mother never showed it to us.</span> <span id="s1298">But I know that for a fact, that she sold the horse, and I didn’t know how much she got.</span> <span id="s1299">Of course, I got to know it later, when we were outside Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1301">So when you first got there, she had a way of being able to buy food for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Well, it was – you know, whatever was assigned to us.</span> <span id="s1303">And of course, she got – she was one of the first that she got a job.</span> <span id="s1304">Her job was to bring water from the river, that was farther on, not wer – next to our camp, there was a area about a couple kilometers from there, where there was a spring.</span> <span id="s1305">And she would bring clear water.</span> <span id="s1306">Sh – what she would have to do is fill the wooden barrels, which were on this wood – on this horse-drawn sled.</span> <span id="s1307">She would have to go to the – chop the ice, fill ti – with the bucket, walk up and fill up the barrels, and then take it to the bakery, take the water there.</span> <span id="s1308">Again, dip the water out of the barrels and take it to the barrels inside the bakery.</span> <span id="s1309">She would do that all day long.</span> <span id="s1310">It wou – believe me, I helped her sometime, it was a back blake – breaking job.</span> <span id="s1311">And especially, she used to wear a sack in front of her as a apron.</span> <span id="s1312">From splashing water and freezing, she sounded like she was a – she was armor, th-the – the ice so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: It would freeze, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: – freeze, it would freeze.</span> <span id="s1315">She – but she never gave up, she worked, because she had six mouths to feed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1317">Your grandmother too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Well, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1319">Well, all of us, were si-six of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: So, she worked very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Was your sister put to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: When my sister turned 16, I believe – anybody over the age of 16 had to work.</span> <span id="s1324">And lucky for – for her, she got a job in the local nursery, so she took care of little children.</span> <span id="s1325">At least she didn’t have to work in – because the – all the other – and the other industry was logging.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: And eventually my mother worked there too.</span> <span id="s1328">What the de – women would do, when the men felled the trees, the women would chop the branches, and clear the snow so the – the horse-drawn drivers would haul the logs up to main drag, and then big, huge sleds, pulled by the tractors, would dr-draw – would draw those logs to the river, which again in the spring would be floated to the destination whate – whatever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: I want to go back to one point, just to make it clear, and it’s about the food.</span> <span id="s1330">That is, you were able to buy food for yourselves if you had the money, but not as much as you wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Only one bre – specially the bread, that was assigned to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: So in other words, it was rationed, but it wasn’t handed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: It was rationed in the sense that you could only get a certain portion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: And you had to pay for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1339">And that was with all food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: The – the only thing is, all the time we were there, we never had any – even the smallest amount of sugar.</span> <span id="s1343">The – n-no butter, no meat.</span> <span id="s1344">I nev –</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: So what did you have, what did you eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Moi – mainly bread.</span> <span id="s1349">Sometime later, in – when we were already a couple years in Russia, in there – well, maybe a year, they allowed f – us to receive parcels from Poland.</span> <span id="s1350">And sometime – my grandmother, sometime some friends – as a matter of fact, we received a package of food from one of the Jews of Nowogródek that owed my father some money.</span> <span id="s1351">And he – he looked into it and found our address where we were at, and send us lifesaving food that we’re – I’m still grateful for it.</span> <span id="s1352">So, like I said before, there were Jews, and there were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Just like there are Poles and there are Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Thank you for that.</span> <span id="s1356">Thank you for sharing that.</span> <span id="s1357">Oh, do you remember what it was that was in that package?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: I think it – most of it was pork belly, which is, to us, was – God, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: There’s a lot you can do with pork belly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1361">Especially when you’re starving, a little bit of fat –</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: – is – it’s a treasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1365">So, did anyone get sick here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Lot of people.</span> <span id="s1367">Within a, I would say six months of being in that camp, we started losing some infants, some babies.</span> <span id="s1368">There was no – women didn’t have enough milk to feed the babies, there was no milk to be had.</span> <span id="s1369">The babies were starving, they were dying.</span> <span id="s1370">Pretty soon, about a kilometer behind our camp, on a little hill, started appear wood crosses.</span> <span id="s1371">And after children, little children, the older people started dying.</span> <span id="s1372">Within a year, we must have lost oh, at least 50 people, older people.</span> <span id="s1373">Our camp consisted of people from two different parts of Poland.</span> <span id="s1374">Half of us were from Nowogródek, and half were from the southern part of where – what was – what is now Ukraine, close to the Lwów.</span> <span id="s1375">So there were people from two – two different parts of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: In – how large was the camp, population-wise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: It was about, I would say, close to 500 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Oh, that’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Quite a few.</span> <span id="s1380">There were, as far as Russians, there was one man, commander – commandant, we called him commandant.</span> <span id="s1381">And there was one KGB man, and one bakers with his family.</span> <span id="s1382">And there was one Russian i-in th – a woman, which wer – she was in charge of the restaurant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: That’s an important position.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Very important.</span> <span id="s1385">The rest of it was Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: And – how – what was their manner towards you, how did they behave towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Well, of course, the – the commandant wasn’t bad man, but the – but the KGB, he was typical communist.</span> <span id="s1388">To him, the only thing that mattered was his party, his nation, and he tried to convince us that we should be grateful that we wound up in Russia.</span> <span id="s1389">Within about six months, they opened a school, wi-with one teacher, Russian, of course.</span> <span id="s1390">And everybody, all the children, until 16 years, they had to go to school.</span> <span id="s1391">And of course, we didn’t mind subjects like math and arc – physics, chemistry, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1392">But of course they also tried to convince us again of the advantages of communist system, which didn’t work with us at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: So how did it – did children just stay silent when this sort of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Well, we – we learn how to go along with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Just to get a ga – got along them.</span> <span id="s1397">They – I – I was already twel – like I said, I was 12 years old, and what happened to me once, sometime we would sit on the bench, couple of our boys, and we sing our Polish national songs.</span> <span id="s1398">And they through – we were trying to get our teacher mad.</span> <span id="s1399">And one day he called me in and he told me if I keep it up, nothing may happen to me, but my mother wi – may wind up in – in jail.</span> <span id="s1400">So of course, we stopped doing that, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: What kind of interaction was there with the KGB men?</span> <span id="s1402">Like what – what was his – what was his function?</span> <span id="s1403">How did he – how did he – what was his role in your life?</span> <span id="s1404">Did he come and just talk to people, or did he –</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: Well, he wanted – he wanted to make sure we were afraid of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: So how did he ensure that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Well, his manner, first of all, his manner.</span> <span id="s1408">He would march into to the room, told the kids, sit down.</span> <span id="s1409">You know, his voice, his manner, and h-he would really rough kind of a talk, let us know that he was in a cha – in charge, he was the boss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Was there informing going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Very – if there was, it must have been very little, because we were – pe-people were very, very well in touch with another.</span> <span id="s1412">If there was, I never heard of any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1414">So it wasn’t the same sort of situation as even back home, where people started being afraid of what they would say in – in public.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: No, in the camp – in the camp, wa-wa-wa – it was w-w-wa – solidarity was a main thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: And, where did these officials live?</span> <span id="s1417">How did they live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: They had their own quarters.</span> <span id="s1419">There was special barrack.</span> <span id="s1420">In this special barrack they – the baker has his couple rooms in there, next to the bakery, and so the – the woman that’s in charge of restaurant, and the KGB and – and the commander was – they had th-their own – their own building.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: And you said the commandant was not such a bad guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: No, he – he – he was authority, but he didn’t over – didn’t abuse it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: He – maybe he felt sorry for us, of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1426">And so it was mostly what he didn’t do, rather than what he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1429">So, you – it took half a year for you to be in school after you arrived, so what did you do in that half year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1431">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1432">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1433">In the winter, there wasn’t much you could do really, because eventually there were either four or five feet of snow sometime.</span> <span id="s1434">And in the – you were sometimes so cold that you couldn’t even breathe in the cold air, because it was – when you – if you didn’t have anything in front of your mouth, you could feel like knives, okay, cutting into your lungs.</span> <span id="s1435">So you always had to have something in you – in front of your face.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: And your mother would work in this sort of situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Yes, she did.</span> <span id="s1438">Unless it got to be about – below 40 degrees, then nobody worked.</span> <span id="s1439">But if it was warmer than that, then everybody had to go work, and men w-worked falling trees, and women doing the rest of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Here’s a part I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s1441">I understand that she goes to a spring to get water in the summertime, to haul it back up, but in the winter there’s all this snow outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Well, di – di – you had to shovel – you have to shovel the snow wherever you could.</span> <span id="s1443">Sometime it was like a tunnel between the – on the each side there be about five feet of snow, and you just go.</span> <span id="s1444">And the roads, with the passing of the sleds, eventually, you know, it was a track that you could go by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: And of course, the snow lasted about Ma-May – May sometime, middle of May, before the snows would start to melt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: That’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: That’s a long time.</span> <span id="s1449">By June, it wer – snow was gone and then summer right away would start.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Would it be hot in summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: Well, I wouldn’t say hot, but it was nice and warm, and it’s – the beauty of nature up there at that time, everything explodes.</span> <span id="s1452">Everything grows so fast, I never seen anything grow that fast in that humid, warm air.</span> <span id="s1453">And as a matter of fact, if it wasn’t for nature, I don’t know if we would have survived.</span> <span id="s1454">As soon as it got warm, some – a different kind of mushrooms would appear in the forest.</span> <span id="s1455">And children – and I was among them, we would spend at least half a day, every other day, picking mushrooms.</span> <span id="s1456">And later on, all kinds of berries: blackberries, raspberry – wild raspberries.</span> <span id="s1457">And like I said before, if it wasn’t for nature, I don’t know if we would have survived.</span> <span id="s1458">The problem was, we could not preserve any of it for wintertime, so we had to consume it right there.</span> <span id="s1459">Sometime we would bring a bucketful of mushrooms, cook it and eat it for next couple meals.</span> <span id="s1460">And that was my job, picking mushrooms, picking berries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Had you done that at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: Mushrooms, yes, and berries of course, too.</span> <span id="s1463">But I do – I done it for different reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: For pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: For pleasure.</span> <span id="s1466">Here, it was to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1468">And that was the summertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Summer –</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: So the – so there was no – like a fence around this settlement.</span> <span id="s1471">You were allowed to go into –</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: We were allowed, but there were hundreds and hundreds of kilometers of nothing but virgin forest.</span> <span id="s1473">And we were not in touch with any – eight kilometer from our camp was the – what Russians call was baza, which is like a center, gog – government’s center, where they control all the activities in the neighborhood, for – where were – they just decided where the logging would be.</span> <span id="s1474">It was all run by – by Russians, of course.</span> <span id="s1475">And about 20 some kilometers farther, there were a couple of Russian villages, which at time, we were given permission – we were given the pass, that we could go to those villages and trade, barter for some of the clothes that we brought with us from Poland for some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: And did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: Oh yes, I would go with my mother and carry a sack, maybe oh, 20 – 20 some pounds of flour, or some – some wa – whatever else we could.</span> <span id="s1478">That helped, of course, sur – to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: But other than that, you didn’t have any contact with any local people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: The – the only other person that I remember, there was a young woman.</span> <span id="s1481">She was about 18 years old.</span> <span id="s1482">She was a mail girl, she used to bring our mail from the baza to our camp, and she would carry that, pass it on to every barrack.</span> <span id="s1483">And she was a – a think when we got there, she was a hundred percent communist.</span> <span id="s1484">She would t – always tell how much she hated us, and for all different reasons that she would give.</span> <span id="s1485">But be – by the time we were leaving camp, she was our best friend.</span> <span id="s1486">She would come and pray with us, as a matter of fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: I don’t know how it happened, but she finally came to conclusion that we were the ones who were suffering, and we were the ones that were penalized for no reason at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: And that was without you telling her so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Well, she became a – one of the friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: And I – I – it was like a miracle.</span> <span id="s1493">She ta – changed her feelings completely.</span> <span id="s1494">Her name was Lisa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: Lisa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: Lisa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: And we – just happened that in our camp was a nun.</span> <span id="s1499">She was a sister of my father’s friend.</span> <span id="s1500">And Russians didn’t know she was a nun.</span> <span id="s1501">If she – if they did, most likely she would wind up in jail somewhere.</span> <span id="s1502">But she would have classes, religion classes with us.</span> <span id="s1503">Boys would stand guard around the barracks, in all corners, and she would talk to children, small children, about religion, about Christ and that.</span> <span id="s1504">And why we were watching, making sure that nobody would spot us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: And nobody did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: And nobody did.</span> <span id="s1507">As a matter of fact, she was saved.</span> <span id="s1508">She wa – she was – she went back to Poland, and she even – she was in charge of monastery later, in one of the Polish towns, and she visited my grandmother when my – my grandmother went back to Poland from India.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s1510">Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1512">We called her sister wi – not so much sister, as ciocia, which means aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Sh – God.</span> <span id="s1515">Last name was Petrowski(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Petrowski(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Petrowski(ph), but i – I don’t remember her – her monastery’s name.</span> <span id="s1518">I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: It’s okay.</span> <span id="s1520">So summertime was a reprieve from the cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Oh God, it was.</span> <span id="s1522">But you have to realize, our clothes, my first year, were in shreds.</span> <span id="s1523">I – my older sister and I had one pair of shoes –</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Between you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: – between us.</span> <span id="s1526">W-Walking in the woods barefoot, is sometime even dangerous.</span> <span id="s1527">My – my whole everything, pants, jacket, everything was in shreds.</span> <span id="s1528">We happened to receive a parcel from Poland.</span> <span id="s1529">I don’t remember who it was from, but whoever sent it, wrapped it in a piece of cloth.</span> <span id="s1530">My grandmother says, Adam, I’m going to make you a pair of pants from it.</span> <span id="s1531">And she did.</span> <span id="s1532">She sewed it by hand, can you imagine that?</span> <span id="s1533">And she made me a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s1534">There was one problem with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: What was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: On my seat, there was a permanent marker’s address.</span> <span id="s1537">I – I had la – I had to su-sur-survive lot of ho – laughs –</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Teasing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: – lot of kidding from the other kids, because I had a address right on my –</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: On your seat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: – my butt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: Oh man, I just had another question about this, and – let me think.</span> <span id="s1543">Clothes – hygiene.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Oh God, it was – there’s such a thing as Russian bath, where they not only bathe, it’s a steam room, and next to it is the place where they put all their clothes that they take off, and it’s so pr – it’s so hot up there, that it’s supposed to kill all the lice –</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: Did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: – because, let’s face it, in the conditions that we were in, no soap, no soap, you just wash with water.</span> <span id="s1547">The pi – oh – only laundry you could do was in the water without any soap, and lack of clothes breeds all kinds of filth, lice among them.</span> <span id="s1548">So my mother had a routine.</span> <span id="s1549">Every couple days we had to strip, and we would look through our clothes, killing all whatever was moving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1551">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: It’s terri – yo-you don’t – people that didn’t go through it, don’t realize what a hell it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Not to be able to do something as simple as have some soap, and wash.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: Exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: And – but i – was this called a banya(ph)?</span> <span id="s1556">These – these –</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Banya(ph), yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: Mm-hm, so it’s something like a sauna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Ec – exactly, exactly.</span> <span id="s1560">And the Russians are very proud of it.</span> <span id="s1561">To them, it’s a part of civilization.</span> <span id="s1562">And they were saying that, what kind of civilized Poland it was that they did eve – da – didn’t even have the lice – lice killing equipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Well, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: So we’re not civilized to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: No lice, no equipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: No equipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: I talked about – so we talked about hyg – what about, in the forest, were there ever any little animals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: This was a part of it that still, you know, I still – when I remember it, comes to my mind.</span> <span id="s1569">Normally you would expect to have some wolves, bears.</span> <span id="s1570">There were none.</span> <span id="s1571">There were totally none.</span> <span id="s1572">The – the smallest – the animals that I seen were weasels.</span> <span id="s1573">And of course, you couldn’t even come close to, they were so fast.</span> <span id="s1574">The only other thing th – as a kid, I would try to do some fishing, and sometime with the success, which meant that we had a feast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: That evening, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: That evening, I would catch a catfish about this size, and God, that was a feast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: That’s like about 18 inches, 20 inch long catfish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: Yes, it was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: Yeah, even two feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: And I caught it few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: And how – without a fishing rod?</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: Well, we would – we would take a sack [indecipherable] sack, put it on the sticks, make it like a netting of it, and w-w – drag it around bushes or whatever in the water, and try to chase it.</span> <span id="s1583">And sometime we were lucky enough that the fish would j – flow into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Into the sack, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Into the sack, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Were there ever official meetings that were held for the entire settlement, that you had to go to, or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: No, no, never – never had one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: But the – the – the only time would be individual barracks –</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: – that will be a – you know, the – the – especially the KGB man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: So he would come in and hold a meeting for the whole barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: And what would he usually talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Well, about the success and – and li – of Soviet Union, of communism, of the future is only with them, and all that kind of stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Was there a radio in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Were there newspapers that were ever delivered?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: No, we-we – yes, but very few, because Russians would use the newspaper to st – to roll their cigarettes with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: Oh really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Yeah, that’s what they used.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: So, but sometime we would get maybe, you know, week old newspaper, or some –</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: How often would there be visits to the settlement from the outside?</span> <span id="s1605">Like the post girl, would she come once a week, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: She would co – she would be about couple times a week, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Couple of ti – was this about the only communication that there would be with somebody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Well, except the – some of the people worked in the – that baza place, they would be in touch with some Russians up there, but otherwise, there were very few Russians that would come to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: So it – it really gets – it sounds like you were very remote, and quite isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Totally – totally remote.</span> <span id="s1611">Totally remote.</span> <span id="s1612">And even to – the only place we could go without permission, which were – without the pass, was to the baza.</span> <span id="s1613">And farther on, to the villages, we would have to have a stri – slip of paper, pass, that we could go, and th-the signing when we have to leave, and when we have to come back.</span> <span id="s1614">And Russian people – excuse me, the older people, when they made sure that nobody is listening, they would made the sign of cross, and tell us how they believe in God, and how they feel sorry for us.</span> <span id="s1615">But the young people, they were telling us that w-we deserve wherever we get in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: The communists was – they were through and through communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Isn’t that interesting, that an older generation saw through that, wasn’t convinced of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1620">And ee – the – some of them even had the holy pictures hidden somewhere.</span> <span id="s1621">And when – again, when nobody was looking, they would show it to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: This would be when you would be going to trade, or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Would you like some water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Maybe a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Let’s – let’s cut then, yeah.</span> <span id="s1627">[break].</span> <span id="s1628">Okay, so tell me, is there anything else that I haven’t asked about, about life in the settlement, life in the camp, that you think is important for people to know about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: Well, yo – in this situation [indecipherable] that it’s really gets to you, the helplessness, and the – it gets to not just grown-ups, but also to children, that we are dependent on that one guy up there in th – that KGB man, whoever, that we don’t count, whatever we think, whatever we feel doesn’t count, it’s – we are helpless, totally helpless and hopeless.</span> <span id="s1630">And eventually brings in depression, and sometime, you know, it affects people different way.</span> <span id="s1631">Some bec – become where they pick fights, aggressive.</span> <span id="s1632">Some were totally cut off from the rest of the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: They retreat in themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: They [indecipherable] themselves.</span> <span id="s1635">And it’s a very sad situation, very sad.</span> <span id="s1636">And the hunger is a terp – terrible feeling.</span> <span id="s1637">It’s – it gets to you to the extent that you think of eating, you dream of eating, your ho – your whole concentration is on getting some food.</span> <span id="s1638">And believe me, in all – most of that time we were there, that’s what our main interest, and ma – our – our main effort was, to get some to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: So people changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Oh, totally, totally, totally, totally.</span> <span id="s1641">And the family becomes unit, and if you work together, you survive.</span> <span id="s1642">If you don’t, you don’t have much choice but give up.</span> <span id="s1643">A lot of people did give up, and pretty soon, there were the – the crosses on that hill multiply again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: So were there people who were deported without their families, for example.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: There were a few, yes, there were a few people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: And th – so if you were alone, you had far less chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1648">Because family held together, helped to stay – you know, had your mind set out to s – on survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: So you went through the winter of 1940, the summer of 1940 and the winter of 1941.</span> <span id="s1650">And, was that second winter pretty similar to the first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Well, winter itself was similar, but as far as we were concerned, we were in much worse shape, physically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Okay, ec – describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Mainly –</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: – mainly physically.</span> <span id="s1656">We were – we were starving, you know, eating just bread, and very little of it, doesn’t bi-build up any strength, any – you – you are hungry most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: So you were weaker with –</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: You were weaker – weaker physically, and sometime, like I said before, people got to the point where they were giving up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: So did they commit suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: They just died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: They didn’t have to, they didn’t have to, they just laid down and died.</span> <span id="s1663">And it happened, a lot of people happened, and – to a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Were there any other transports that came after you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1666">No more people.</span> <span id="s1667">We’re di – we’re – a – eventually, we know now that there were other transports, but at that time, at our place, we didn’t have a idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Okay, you would have been the only ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: We were – we were getting some mail from Poland, but whenever people tried to tell us something, it was cut out by censorship.</span> <span id="s1670">We would get the letters with the parts of it cut out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1674">So the second winter was a lot harder than the first one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: Positively, positively, positively.</span> <span id="s1676">Our clothes were already in shreds, and we were very, very bad shape physically.</span> <span id="s1677">Wit – what’s happened, second summer, the authorities told us that we can try to have a gardens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Oh, you were allowed to have ga –</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: We were allowed to – to have a gardens.</span> <span id="s1680">So we – they divided some of the open area in the camp into plots, and it – we drew lots, and it just happened that we – our part – our lot was very far in the – practically in the woods.</span> <span id="s1681">What turned out that nobody drew a lot which was right in front of our barrack.</span> <span id="s1682">So my mother went to the – the ca – ca – our commander, and ask him if she could cha – trade the – the – and she did.</span> <span id="s1683">So we had a – about, I would say 50 by 50 feet plot of land that we could – we could –</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: Plant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: – plant.</span> <span id="s1686">It just happened, this is a story in itself.</span> <span id="s1687">Second summer, my mother and I, we went to the village, which is located about 28 kilometers, to trade, I think it was my father’s jacket or something, for some 60 or 80 pounds of potatoes.</span> <span id="s1688">The problem was that we’d had no means of bringing those potatoes to the camp.</span> <span id="s1689">So we told the Russians people to keep it for us, and we will come back for it in the winter.</span> <span id="s1690">It just again happened that my mother was sick.</span> <span id="s1691">She lifted something heavy while she was working in the woods, and hurt her back, she couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s1692">She was in bed.</span> <span id="s1693">And th – we were really starving.</span> <span id="s1694">We had a family get together, and decided that we have t – my brother, who was that time just eight years old – no, I’m sorry, he was practically nine already.</span> <span id="s1695">No, he was eight years old.</span> <span id="s1696">And I was practically 13 – no, I was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s1697">So, that were two of us, right in the middle of winter, we have to go and get those potatoes.</span> <span id="s1698">Twenty-eight kilometers in the winter, 30 below zero.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: I, previous summer, I work – I made a sled, I built a s – myself a sled.</span> <span id="s1701">We were gonna use that sled to bring those potatoes.</span> <span id="s1702">So, my mother gave me and my brother slice of bread.</span> <span id="s1703">That had to last us two days.</span> <span id="s1704">And early in the morning we marched with dragging that sled.</span> <span id="s1705">We went to, a 13 and a eight, practically nine year old boys, 28 kilometers to bring the 60 or 80 pounds of potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Potatoes.</span> <span id="s1707">And you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: We walked all day.</span> <span id="s1709">When I close my eyes now, I still see when we got out of the woods, there was a small hill, and on top of the hill there were some hats – hats, with the chimneys, and the smoke coming from the chi – it looked like picture from heaven, after walking all day.</span> <span id="s1710">I found the hats, with my – where the potatoes were.</span> <span id="s1711">We got in hat – the room was full of people.</span> <span id="s1712">Turned out there were people that were going, men mostly, that were going to go to our camp with horses and – to help working in the woods, in the logging.</span> <span id="s1713">I still remember the smell of the sweat, bodies, and the cigars, or smo – I mean, s – pipes and smoking.</span> <span id="s1714">We slept all on the grou – on the floor.</span> <span id="s1715">Woke up in next morning about five, six o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1716">I went outside.</span> <span id="s1717">Turned out during the night, about 12 inches of snow fell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s1719">You were saved.</span> <span id="s1720">You were saved, cause it could have fallen on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: But this was – going through the virgin forest was just a, you know, path cut out through the – through the woods.</span> <span id="s1722">I had the idea.</span> <span id="s1723">I started going to every man, asking if they will allow us to tie our sled to their horse – horse drawn sled, you know, to help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: None of them would allow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Finally, there was a woman with a young girl, most likely my age.</span> <span id="s1728">And I ask her.</span> <span id="s1729">First she refuse, and then she change her mind.</span> <span id="s1730">She says, all right, you can do it on one condition, that you lead my horse.</span> <span id="s1731">Of course, I agreed to it.</span> <span id="s1732">So we put our bag of potatoes on the sled, covered it with the blanket and some straw.</span> <span id="s1733">My son – my brother would sit on it, and the – the sled was full of about five feet high with hay for the horses that would be fed on the – in our camp.</span> <span id="s1734">And the two women climbed on the top of that sled hay, and I would lead it.</span> <span id="s1735">We were about the last ones of the whole caravan of those sleds.</span> <span id="s1736">E-Everything was fine, until we got to about the middle of the distance to our camp.</span> <span id="s1737">There was a steep hill, downwards went the road, and on the bottom there was a stream, which of course was frozen solid now.</span> <span id="s1738">And there the pass – the road turned left.</span> <span id="s1739">Well, we were coming down th-the sleds that went ahead of us, cleaned the road pretty well, so when we were coming, it was pretty slick going.</span> <span id="s1740">I kept holding the horse as much as I could, but the – gradually horse start to galloping, faster and faster.</span> <span id="s1741">Finally I couldn’t keep up with him, so I let go.</span> <span id="s1742">The sled with the – went all the way down to the hill, and made the turn.</span> <span id="s1743">As it made the turn to the left, it slid sideways, hit the embankment of snow, and the two women were catapult out of the top of the sled, into the big pile of snow.</span> <span id="s1744">All I could see is two pair of legs sticking out.</span> <span id="s1745">Of course, my brother turn over too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: What happened to the potatoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: Well, they were – they were turned over too, into the snow.</span> <span id="s1748">It took us about half an hour to straighten out the sled, and put back the potatoes on – on the sled [indecipherable] with my little sled, my brother on it.</span> <span id="s1749">By the end of the day, we were at our camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Next day I was walking, and I seen that woman splitting logs for her fireplace.</span> <span id="s1752">She wasn’t much good at it, but I was.</span> <span id="s1753">For next hour or so I split all the wood that she had.</span> <span id="s1754">That was my thank you to her for being so good and help us, because I don’t know how we would have made it back that night, to the camp.</span> <span id="s1755">So she was good to me, and I repaid it by –</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: Splitting her logs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: – splitting her woods for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: And when I think about it now, my brother wasn’t even nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: And the potatoes, did they help?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Oh, God.</span> <span id="s1764">Wa – there were – there were – that – I don’t remember how long ago we went to sleep with our bellies full.</span> <span id="s1765">The potatoes tasted better than any before and any time after, when they did.</span> <span id="s1766">And for next month or so, and when – when we got the plot of land, when my mother would peel the potatoes, her – she – when there was a eye, with the possibility of growing, she would make a big, deep cut and save it.</span> <span id="s1767">So we planted those pieces, and next year we had a – some – our own fresh potatoes growing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: That was part of the good story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: It is.</span> <span id="s1773">It is, but what a difficult – what a difficult thing to do.</span> <span id="s1774">And for little boys, I mean, as you were starting to tell this, I was thinking, my goodness, those potatoes will freeze on that – on that journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Well, it was like I said, we covered with – with the straw, with the blanket, and my brother was sitting on –</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: Sitting on top of it, like a chicken on some eggs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: Exactly, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: So, by this time, let’s say, the second winter goes by, and that’s the winter of 1941, and then the summer is when you plant, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: – yes, you plant those –</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1782">Q: Now, in June 1941 is when Germany attacked the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: Did your lives change after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: Well, the irony of it, that we, that year we got what Russians call the amnesty.</span> <span id="s1786">To have – to have amnesty, you have to commit something, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: Well, I don’t know what we committed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: But you got amnesty anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: But we got amnesty anyway.</span> <span id="s1791">And who do we thank for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: Hitler.</span> <span id="s1794">So, is it the irony that we have Hitler to thank for our freedom.</span> <span id="s1795">Now, the way it worked, Russians at that time, when Germany attacked Russia, were in such a bad shape, within a few months, Germany was right into the Russian territory.</span> <span id="s1796">They went through the eastern Poland, into German authority.</span> <span id="s1797">Russians were looking for help, for allies.</span> <span id="s1798">At that time, Russia held about a quarter of a million Polish soldiers in it – prison of war camps.</span> <span id="s1799">Russians wanted to use those men to defend Russia.</span> <span id="s1800">They tr – to – got in touch with Polish government in exile in ri – in London, to form Polish army in Russia.</span> <span id="s1801">They agreed – Polish government agreed on one condition.</span> <span id="s1802">That they will release rest of the people, too.</span> <span id="s1803">That included us.</span> <span id="s1804">So that’s what the amnesty was about.</span> <span id="s1805">And we were officially told by – by officials.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: By the commandant, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: By the commandant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: Not the KGB man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: No, no, commandant, that we are free people.</span> <span id="s1810">We were given passes, legi – le – legitimacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: Legitimization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1813">That we could travel in Russia, that we can get supply of bread whenever w – it was available.</span> <span id="s1814">But we were – main thing, we were free to leave the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: And when did this – when did this come?</span> <span id="s1816">When did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: This was fall of ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: So, it was several months after Germany attacked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: So in the fall of ’41, when you finally have some potatoes of your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1822">That’s true, that’s very true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Your ha – you’re told that you are free to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: We were free to go, but go fra – where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: We were told that there’s a Polish army being organized in the southern Russia, in the – in the Kazakhstan, in the Uzbekistan.</span> <span id="s1827">We were told that there’s – that’s where the Polish army is being organized.</span> <span id="s1828">But how do we get there?</span> <span id="s1829">This is 3,000 kilometers from where we are.</span> <span id="s1830">Now, it was due south wi – by this time the German armies were already approaching Moscow, so there was no way we could go straight south.</span> <span id="s1831">A lot of people were hesitating, didn’t want to leave the camp because after all, there was some security here, and if we leave camp, who – then what?</span> <span id="s1832">My mother was a different – of different opinion.</span> <span id="s1833">She says she won’t stay here any more, we have to leave.</span> <span id="s1834">And sure enough, we – my sister went to a – the village, which was about 20 some mi – kilometers to, from – from our camp, and next thing we know, she came back couple days later with the horse-drawn sled, with the farmer, and that we can leave the camp –</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: With him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: – and he will take us to the – that village, and from there there was only few kilometers to the railroad station – railroad that was being built.</span> <span id="s1837">It – it wasn’t built yet, they were just building the railroad.</span> <span id="s1838">So we packed whatever we still had, things, and traveled over for a day and a half, we traveled to that village.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: So you left fairly soon afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: We – we left, it was – was winter of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: I think it was January – January something, beginning of January, I think we left the camp.</span> <span id="s1843">We got to that town, that village, and it turned out it was about 10 kilometers to the railroad sta – railroad.</span> <span id="s1844">Not station, but railroad.</span> <span id="s1845">Again, my mother bribed some of the people over there with some tobacco.</span> <span id="s1846">And they told us that we can load in, into the – get into one of the freight cars that was bringing supplies, railroad supplies, and we traveled about three days.</span> <span id="s1847">They closed the doors completely because they didn’t want anybody know what we – we were in the car.</span> <span id="s1848">It was freezing.</span> <span id="s1849">We had to walk most of the time to – to – not to freeze.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: To keep warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: To keep warm.</span> <span id="s1852">Finally we got to the town that we were originally dropped off –</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Oh, where you had walked –</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: – where we were brought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: We got – turns out there were thousand people just like us out there, from different camps all over ye – Russia, that part of Russia.</span> <span id="s1857">And within a few days the conditions were terrible, unbelievably terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: Were you all at the railroad station?</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: The railroad station.</span> <span id="s1860">Finally is – we – somehow we found out that there was a train preparing to go south, which had some of those cars prepared for traveling, for deporting [indecipherable] people.</span> <span id="s1861">So we got on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: And was it also like freight trains, or was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: It wa – well, there were some empty cars, but just about everybody that was on that station, got on that train.</span> <span id="s1864">Of course Polish people.</span> <span id="s1865">Three months we traveled on that train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: Three months we traveled on that train.</span> <span id="s1868">We lost more people on that train than in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: The worst – the worst was when somebody got lost from the train, we never – we never found them.</span> <span id="s1871">It just happened that my mother got lost.</span> <span id="s1872">What would happen, we would get to the station, and people, some people from each car would run to the center of the town to see if they could buy, steal or whatever some food.</span> <span id="s1873">And sometime when they were there, the train would go – would start going, and leave them behind.</span> <span id="s1874">And like I said, most of the time, when train would leave those people, we never seen them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: So what happened with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: My mother was one of the people that went to get some food.</span> <span id="s1877">In the meantime, they took our train and just moved it to different siding.</span> <span id="s1878">When my mother came back to the original spot, who – the – whoever was in charge told her that our train left.</span> <span id="s1879">She jumped on the next train and traveled for about three days, without sign of our train.</span> <span id="s1880">So she decided that she must have missed it, and she started coming back.</span> <span id="s1881">And would you know, she found us.</span> <span id="s1882">Not only did she found us, but she brought about two loaves of bread with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: What a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: Was a miracle.</span> <span id="s1885">We were desperate.</span> <span id="s1886">We were four children, and their grandma.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: Four children and their grandma.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: My dear, we were creatures from hell.</span> <span id="s1891">Dirty.</span> <span id="s1892">All through those three months, we never change clothes, we never washed.</span> <span id="s1893">There was enough water for drinking, never mind washing or – or – our clothes or washing yourself.</span> <span id="s1894">Can you imagine the stink?</span> <span id="s1895">Forty people in the car.</span> <span id="s1896">We were in one of the towns, I don’t remember the name now, big town.</span> <span id="s1897">And all of a sudden, all through the train went the news that on a different siding, there’s a train just like ours, and in that train, there’s a priest that’s gonna say a mass.</span> <span id="s1898">Believe me, everybody, whoever could stand on their feet, we run to that siding, and sure enough, there was in one of the cars, the gate – door was open, there was a table, and a young priest was saying a mass.</span> <span id="s1899">He was in a shreds of clothes just like we were.</span> <span id="s1900">Dirty, filthy, but you could tell he was a God’s man.</span> <span id="s1901">We were kneeling on the snow, we were praying.</span> <span id="s1902">We were singing Polish songs.</span> <span id="s1903">At the end of it we usually sing a song which says, God, let us – give us – give us a chance to get to freedom, get to pola – get back to Poland, to our cri – our country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: I can’t imagine what that scene must have been like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: It gaved us spirit.</span> <span id="s1906">It gave us a reason to live again.</span> <span id="s1907">Believe me, it was one of the miracles that makes human do things that sometime you don’t think you can do it.</span> <span id="s1908">Well, our luck was with us anyway.</span> <span id="s1909">We got through Kazakhstan – just one – I wrote it in my life story.</span> <span id="s1910">When we were going through Kazakhstan, the – the scenery was totally flat steppe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: The steppes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: Steppes, yes.</span> <span id="s1913">And I was looking through that small window, and what do I see?</span> <span id="s1914">Right along the railroad tracks, on the snow, there’s a fox, a red fox.</span> <span id="s1915">Was running parallel to a train, but at least he knew – you could tell he knew exactly where he was going, and we didn’t have the slightest idea where we were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1917">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: It’s stuck in my mind now.</span> <span id="s1919">Anyway, finally we got to the end – to bekist – paki – not Pakistan, it was Bekistan(ph).</span> <span id="s1920">And there they told us to unload at one of the stations, I don’t remember now which one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: Was it Tashkent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: No, no, it wasn’t Tashkent.</span> <span id="s1923">But not far from it.</span> <span id="s1924">And we – there were – they put is in the kolkhoz.</span> <span id="s1925">You know what kolkhoz is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: Explain, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: Kolkhoz is a government farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: Where people don’t own anything, they just work for a government farm.</span> <span id="s1930">A farm was – they were raising cotton.</span> <span id="s1931">This is main there, that’s what they grow in that part of Uzbekistan.</span> <span id="s1932">Well, they assign us to the Uzbek family.</span> <span id="s1933">They gave us a little room with a dirt floor, and my mother and my young – my older sister worked in the fields, and I worked in the smith shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: Was this Polish authorities, or Russian authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: Russian authorities.</span> <span id="s1936">But turned out that there were already some Polish authorities in the area, too.</span> <span id="s1937">Finally we contacted them.</span> <span id="s1938">And they kept us – kept telling us to sit tight, they’ll notify us where and when we have to go.</span> <span id="s1939">We spend, I don’t know, about four months up there, and working pretty hard.</span> <span id="s1940">Finally, my mother again, she has enough.</span> <span id="s1941">With the last thing that she still had – there were two more Polish families in the area.</span> <span id="s1942">They bribed drivers that were going – what we heard was town about hundred kilometers from where we were at, where there was already Polish army post.</span> <span id="s1943">So, one day we loaded up on the – on the truck, open truck, and for next 24 hours – it took them 24 hours to drive us that hundred kilometers.</span> <span id="s1944">Every 20 some kilometers, they had to change the tires on the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1946">It was that bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: That good.</span> <span id="s1948">Finally, at night, we arrived on that station, where we’re su – we were told that there’s a Polish outpost.</span> <span id="s1949">Sure enough, we unloaded at night, and we were sit – by this time it was nice and warm up there.</span> <span id="s1950">This is south of Russia.</span> <span id="s1951">So, I think it was some time in March or April already, and we were sitting against the wall on the – on the station.</span> <span id="s1952">It started getting light, and we could hear men’s walk is with the military boots on the – on the platform.</span> <span id="s1953">My mother jumped up and there was a – one sergeant and two soldiers coming towards us.</span> <span id="s1954">My mother looked at him and run to him and started hugging him.</span> <span id="s1955">He was a policeman from the Vorudek(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: No kidding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: He was – the man was a – the sergeant was a policeman from the Vorudek(ph), that knew my parents very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: From that time on our lives changed.</span> <span id="s1960">Turned out that a quartermaster of the 22nd regiment, that was stationed in the place – place was called Karmana.</span> <span id="s1961">And he was a buddy of my father’s.</span> <span id="s1962">Quartermaster.</span> <span id="s1963">He made my mother seamstress, she – she put – he put her to work.</span> <span id="s1964">My older sister wer – couldn’t go anywhere, because she suffered – she infect – got infected with typhoid.</span> <span id="s1965">But my younger sister was – joined the girls – yo-young girls’ camp.</span> <span id="s1966">My brother and I, we went to the boys’ camp.</span> <span id="s1967">And also turned out – turned out that one day, while I was in the camp, I was told that I have to report to the colonel that was in charge of 22nd regiment.</span> <span id="s1968">I got scared.</span> <span id="s1969">I didn’t do anything wrong, I – I saluted everybody, and here I am told to report –</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Report.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: – to the colonel, of – of all the people.</span> <span id="s1972">Turned out he knew my father when they were young officers in the 1920.</span> <span id="s1973">When he seen my name, he wanted to know if we know what happened to father.</span> <span id="s1974">So that’s what he wanted me to report to him.</span> <span id="s1975">But like I said, from that time on, our lives changed.</span> <span id="s1976">Mother was secure, thi – we were secured.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: Did you get more food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: Oh God.</span> <span id="s1979">First time I was taken to the military mess, they get me vast pool of rice and r – and raisins.</span> <span id="s1980">I ate about quarter of it and I couldn’t eat no more.</span> <span id="s1981">I could not.</span> <span id="s1982">I sat there and I cried because I can’t – couldn’t swallow any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: You were full?</span> <span id="s1984">A: I guess my stomach shrunk so that it – there was no room for it already.</span> <span id="s1985">But eventually, that went by.</span> <span id="s1986">On the middle of August, 1942, we were put on the train from the Karmana, from the camp, and taken to the port on the Caspian Sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: What was the name of the port?</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">A: Krasnovodsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: Krasnovodsk, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Krasnovodsk.</span>

sometime it can kill you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">A: But he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: So it was your m – you, your mother, your
