Okay, so, you tell me if I get any of the facts wrong and I’ll tell you what I have written down from your Shoah Foundation interview.</span> <span id="s11">You were born… hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I’m listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s14">You were born in Piotrków, Poland on September 24, 1924.</span> <span id="s15">Grew up in Grodzisk, Mazowiecki.</span> <span id="s16">Your grandfather Chaim Jakubowicz was the head of the Jewish community there.</span> <span id="s17">You had one brother, Gershon, he was born in 1929.</span> <span id="s18">You mentioned that your parents worked, say again what their work was?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My grandfather from both sides, my grandmother, had shoe stores.</span> <span id="s20">But my father, he bought from the tannery, when they make the leather, one part is what makes leather, the other part is like beady stuff.</span> <span id="s21">Doesn’t smell good, you know it.</span> <span id="s22">They use it mostly for glycerin, Vaseline, chemical factories.</span> <span id="s23">So in any tannery, when they had enough that we could send in a truck, you know it, so we could pick and give it to the tanneries.</span> <span id="s24">I don’t know how I can explain it closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: What was your mother’s maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Bluma, B L U M A and Hannah, Hannah was her middle name.</span> <span id="s27">Bluma Hannah.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: And we got your father’s name and her name on the other interview.</span> <span id="s29">Okay, now you mentioned that you went to high school in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s30">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I went to Warsaw and I went to Piotrków.</span> <span id="s32">I went to Piotrków first and I was away too much from my parents and I got homesick, so they took me back.</span> <span id="s33">They sent me from Grodzisk to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s34">And the gymnasium was not in [INAUDIBLE], it was… came out from the Jewish Federation, not Federation that time… the Gemennah (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Were you in Warsaw when the war broke out in September, 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: We lived Grodzisk, but Warsaw is only about 30 kilometers, 20 miles from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s37">Now I know, I found out they attached it to Warsaw, but at that time not.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Okay, so you were in Grodzisk.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Grodzisk.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Grodzisk.</span> <span id="s41">And you were there, living through the various restrictions that happened, that came along with the German occupation of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yeah, not quite, because the fifth of February, 1941, all the Jews had to leave Grodzisk, and we all had to go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s43">And before this there was kind of restriction, but it wasn’t that bad, you know.</span> <span id="s44">You had to go to work, you had to do other things, but it was not too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Can you, you did describe your, some general things about your experiences in the Warsaw ghetto in your interview, in your prior interview.</span> <span id="s46">But I wondered if you would say something more about it, in particular something about your living situation there.</span> <span id="s47">Where did you live and with whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: We lived on Twarda (ph) 24th, Twarda 26, as far as I can remember now, was a corner from Chepa (ph) and they called it the small ghetto.</span> <span id="s49">So, I went to school, when I went to school, I went on the bus two streets away from the Twarda.</span> <span id="s50">You know.</span> <span id="s51">So I knew this very good, the surrounding.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Who, what was your house like?</span> <span id="s53">And who did you live with?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Okay, we got moved in and there was two young girls, approximately 18 and 20, and their parents went to Russia.</span> <span id="s55">You know, and they ran away and they couldn’t get back or whatever it is, so we lived with the girls in that flat, in that apartment.</span> <span id="s56">There was my grandfather, from my father’s side, my grandmother, and there was my father and mother and my brother, including me.</span> <span id="s57">We were the same.</span> <span id="s58">I can’t recall was it two room or three rooms.</span> <span id="s59">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s60">It was there on the second floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Was it a comfortable, living situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: It was not comfortable.</span> <span id="s63">It was, you know, you had to live.</span> <span id="s64">But comfort, in the ghetto, there was no such a thing.</span> <span id="s65">You know, but it was better than a lot of people, they got worse apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: I was asking because I know that so many people were so crowded and it sounded like you had a relatively…</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Relatively we had, not bad, you know it, because it was second floor.</span> <span id="s68">It was only two girls, what they lived before.</span> <span id="s69">So it was crowded, but it was not too bad.</span> <span id="s70">You could live, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: And you kept going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Later on, since I went to the school before and there was only one school in the Natenzona (ph), you know I told you it came from the Jewish, you know what they call it, the Jewish Federation, so they opened it.</span> <span id="s73">It was still open and I got a chance to go, yes, in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: This was the same… let me make sure I understand.</span> <span id="s75">This was the same school that you had gone to before?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Exactly the same school I went before.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: And it just ended up being within the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes, it was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s79">And it was about two blocks, you know, where we lived from there, or three blocks.</span> <span id="s80">So it was close.</span> <span id="s81">It was not too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: What was the name of the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Natenzon (ph).</span> <span id="s84">And it was a technical school, if you want to be an engineer or something… as far as I remember in Poland we had, I think it was in 1933, every student had to wear, I don’t think in the ghetto was, but before the war – it was on your arm, on the left hand side.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Did you have a goal of becoming an engineer at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Really, not, you know it.</span> <span id="s87">It’s only for the while.</span> <span id="s88">It was close because I came from Piotrków back.</span> <span id="s89">I couldn’t stay, so they put me in there, more than to go in another high school.</span> <span id="s90">You know, at that time, you still don’t know what you want to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: So you were, you also mentioned going to the movies and cultural life, I wondered if you’d say a little bit more about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: In the ghetto?</span> <span id="s93">In the ghetto, yes, they had a lot of operettas.</span> <span id="s94">They had some movies and when you had a little bit money, you know you could enjoy, do a lot of things with it.</span> <span id="s95">But we had to watch out.</span> <span id="s96">I went out a lot with my mother and friends, we went to it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: How did your family get money?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: We could bring certain things in.</span> <span id="s99">We rented a cart, with a horse and buggy and certain things we brought in.</span> <span id="s100">And soon when we saw that it starts running out.</span> <span id="s101">We didn’t know it would last so long.</span> <span id="s102">And that was the reason why we later on, about three months, we left the Warsaw ghetto or it would mean starvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Okay, so you left the Warsaw ghetto after about three or four months…</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: …when your family decided to separate and to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: You and your mother and your brother went out of the ghetto together and then you met your father there?</span> <span id="s108">Did your grandparents…?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s110">My grandparents stayed, from my father’s side.</span> <span id="s111">But we went to Piotrków and you needed, in order to escape if they caught you, you got shot.</span> <span id="s112">So, we thought we’d split up and then after a certain amount of time, I don’t know exactly how long, my father joined us.</span> <span id="s113">He escaped the same way, you know it, and joined us in Piotrków, because there is where my grandmother from my mother’s side lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: And what was her name?</span> <span id="s115">Your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Zudla Ritterband, R I T T E R B A N D or sometimes I see now, Riterband with one T and one with two T’s, so I don’t know, I get confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: And so you lived in the ghetto in Piotrków…</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Yeah, from there we escaped the Piotrków ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: And your father worked in a glass factory there.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: And you worked for a company that made office furniture for the German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s123">Aus Deutsche Republic (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Did your brother work?</span> <span id="s125">Gershon?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: He was too young.</span> <span id="s127">He was born in 1929, though and I was born ‘24.</span> <span id="s128">No, he did not, because in 1941, he was only 12 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Did you have… were you and Gershon very close?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yes, we were very close.</span> <span id="s131">It was a close family.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: I wondered, just speaking of your family, I want to back track a little bit, because I had wanted to ask you, you mentioned that your grandfather was the head of the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: That’s right, he had a shoe store.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Would you say something about your family history?</span> <span id="s135">Was there a long tradition of leadership in the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s137">About the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s138">My father was only one son, but yes, every certain amount there was always election.</span> <span id="s139">And they elected who they wanted to represent them.</span> <span id="s140">And he was always involved in politics about the Jewish people, you know it.</span> <span id="s141">So he always, as far as I can remember, always was elected.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: My grandfather.</span> <span id="s144">And he had a shoe store, but mostly it was run, and years ago, it sounds funny, the women ran the store.</span> <span id="s145">And they were doing a good job.</span> <span id="s146">So mostly Jewish men of that time, say they divided their time, mostly.</span> <span id="s147">But for a lot of them, for the community… or they went to the, they studied the Torah.</span> <span id="s148">And he was in that time, fairly religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Had your family been in that area of Poland, in Grodzisk, for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: My mother was from Piotrków.</span> <span id="s151">And as far as I know it, my grandmother from my father’s side was from Piotrków.</span> <span id="s152">And at that time, marriages was made in matchmaking marriages.</span> <span id="s153">So, since she came… she was highly intelligent and her father was dead, so you know it, at that time years ago with a dowry, you know.</span> <span id="s154">They didn’t care, they were fairly off, they wanted somebody highly intelligent in their family.</span> <span id="s155">I don’t know, now it doesn’t make sense, but that’s the way what it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Yeah, I understand.</span> <span id="s157">So then on October 13th, 1942, the ghetto was encircled.</span> <span id="s158">And it was liquidated within one week.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: And then the 2,000 people who worked in the glass factory were allowed to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yeah, because the factory didn’t let them out.</span> <span id="s162">And then they made staravarshaska (ph), we called it the yiden (ph) gas.</span> <span id="s163">And on the other side was the gun, staravarshaska.</span> <span id="s164">I remember.</span> <span id="s165">There was only one block, a big block, where they made wires, you know, where you couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s166">And then they brought them back.</span> <span id="s167">When everybody, everything was liquidated.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: And your father was working in the glass factory, so he was allowed to, he was allowed to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: That’s right, there was a few of them.</span> <span id="s170">There was Hortensia (ph) and one was Kara (ph).</span> <span id="s171">He worked with Kara.</span> <span id="s172">They made glass and it was, in that time it was a war, so they put pieces of metal in it.</span> <span id="s173">If the bomb fell, they didn’t split any, it got… you know, so…</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Your mother had the foresight to volunteer you as a carpenter.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: When we came to go away, you know, there is no volunteers.</span> <span id="s176">They ask, “Who is a carpenter?”</span> <span id="s177">So, my mother said, “He is a carpenter.”</span> <span id="s178">And I had a piece of paper that I could leave the ghetto, before it, in order to go to my work.</span> <span id="s179">She said, “He’s a carpenter.”</span> <span id="s180">So, this way they didn’t ask questions, just pulled me out.</span> <span id="s181">And I went as a carpenter.</span> <span id="s182">What was the carpenter work?</span> <span id="s183">It’s to make shelves in one of the buildings, Kompu-Stego (ph).</span> <span id="s184">And they bring from the old houses, you know it was about 20,000 people, 21,000 Jewish people.</span> <span id="s185">So they emptied everything and later on they shipped it to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: And you saw your father occasionally, but did not live with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: No, I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s189">About two months, two or three months later, it was decided that about 1,000 more Jews would be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Were liquidated, not deported.</span> <span id="s191">In fact there is now a monument, maybe you saw it, where they, I don’t know, six, 700 people, they got killed.</span> <span id="s192">They took all the people in the synagogue, you know a lot of the kids, they got shot inside.</span> <span id="s193">It was really bad circumstances.</span> <span id="s194">You cannot describe it.</span> <span id="s195">After two or three days, you know, the screaming, they took us out and we were supposed to be shot.</span> <span id="s196">And when they took me out, happened to be a gendarme, you know, a police man, a German police man, whom I happened to work with.</span> <span id="s197">He says, “Hey, what are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s198">Like I volunteered.</span> <span id="s199">Kicked me out of it.</span> <span id="s200">You know, he would say, “You don’t belong here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: I wanted to ask you about that particular moment, because it was striking to me that this gendarme saved your life.</span> <span id="s202">Do you think he intended to save your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: He intended, yeah, because, a lot of the Germans, they go, “What you doing?”</span> <span id="s204">And he saw that I had a job.</span> <span id="s205">See?</span> <span id="s206">Most of them, they were hiding out and they had no jobs and there was a lot of children.</span> <span id="s207">But he knew that I worked there.</span> <span id="s208">Not because he wanted to save my life, no.</span> <span id="s209">I didn’t know him so much.</span> <span id="s210">But he only knew that I worked for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: So, you didn’t have a personal relationship with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: No, I didn’t know this guy at all.</span> <span id="s213">But I remember his name, Meister Poltin.</span> <span id="s214">Yeah, he was a stiff man, was an older man, in fact, a day before, two days before, he shot a little girl.</span> <span id="s215">She was 17, 18 years, because he thought that she stole a pair of stockings, you know, when they put these things in.</span> <span id="s216">He shot her, so… no, he did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So, he was certainly not sympathetic…</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s219">I didn’t know him, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: How did you feel at that point about the Germans in general?</span> <span id="s221">Were you getting a sense of what it was that they were capable of?</span> <span id="s222">The depths of…?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Oh yeah, I knew.</span> <span id="s224">You know this didn’t come overnight.</span> <span id="s225">When you saw it all the time, you know what they did.</span> <span id="s226">And then when I was on the…when they took the people to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s227">And when somebody didn’t go fast, they shot him.</span> <span id="s228">When an older woman couldn’t move, they shot her.</span> <span id="s229">You saw literally corpses everywhere.</span> <span id="s230">You knew it.</span> <span id="s231">Despite what my parents, especially my mother tried to keep me sheltered, but I knew it, you know.</span> <span id="s232">You cannot close… otherwise I wouldn’t be normal.</span> <span id="s233">Yes, we knew it.</span> <span id="s234">In fact, a few days before they took Tomaszow, they took already one.</span> <span id="s235">And they said to put him to death, put him to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s236">We could still not believe it.</span> <span id="s237">Why would they take people and put them to death?</span> <span id="s238">So it didn’t make any… you always, as long as you live, you have a little bit of hope that the people are lying.</span> <span id="s239">But deep inside we knew it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: At that point, what did you know about Treblinka?</span> <span id="s241">Did you know…?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: I didn’t know it even existed.</span> <span id="s243">They only said they go in a place and I didn’t know it was Treblinka.</span> <span id="s244">A place where the people get gassed.</span> <span id="s245">I didn’t even know what place.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: But you had heard that there was a extermination…?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes, there was an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s248">That’s right.</span> <span id="s249">It takes people, and you know they bring them there… how or what, its only main purpose to liquidate the people.</span> <span id="s250">A liquidation camp, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: So, your mother and your brother had already been taken at that point, to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Yeah, that was… you know, the date when they pulled me out, they went already there.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Did you know at that point, were you certain at that point that they had been killed?</span> <span id="s254">Or was there a question in your mind that they might still be alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: It’s always a question in your mind, but you know, certain things in life you know it is.</span> <span id="s256">It’s easier to believe things what you would like to believe, even when we were there, we say, “They couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s257">They didn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s258">What do you want to take so many people and kill them at the same time?”</span> <span id="s259">You know?</span> <span id="s260">But it was true.</span> <span id="s261">But I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s262">I knew it and I didn’t know it, you know, because I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s263">But people talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: After this gendarme took you…</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Meister Poltin (ph), yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: …took you out of the group, then you said in your testimony that the other 900 or so people who had been gathered, were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Eight or nine, later now I see it’s seven you know it, because some of them got killed in there, inside and I didn’t count them.</span> <span id="s268">You know I knew it was a lot.</span> <span id="s269">I did not know that they got shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Oh, you didn’t?</span> <span id="s271">At that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: No, later on, when I came and they… we knew that they took them.</span> <span id="s273">Rakhov was a little bitty forest and they shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: So, you found that out.</span> <span id="s275">Did you find that out after the war?</span> <span id="s276">Or.</span> <span id="s277">.</span> <span id="s278">?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: No, right away when I was in the ghetto back.</span> <span id="s280">Because they always took other Jews to cover the graves and everything.</span> <span id="s281">The Germans didn’t do this, so they took somebody to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: So, the word spread fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: You mentioned something I wanted to hear more about.</span> <span id="s285">That the role of the Jewish police in this.</span> <span id="s286">Can you say more about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Jewish police was not angels.</span> <span id="s288">When they put me in the synagogue, the Germans didn’t put me in, the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s289">The Germans probably told them we needed so many to put in and catch everyone.</span> <span id="s290">So, they did the dirty work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s291">It’s like anything else, somebody wants to be very good and is a hundred percent, when they ask you.</span> <span id="s292">One thing you want to do ten percent better.</span> <span id="s293">Okay?</span> <span id="s294">And certain people, it is a matter of survival, they have to do what they have to do.</span> <span id="s295">But they didn’t do more.</span> <span id="s296">But certain people were bad.</span> <span id="s297">Jewish or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s298">Maybe they thought only this way they can survive.</span> <span id="s299">I don’t know it.</span> <span id="s300">Certain people couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s301">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Going on with the summary.</span> <span id="s303">After a few days, you were among 20 boys and 20 girls who were sent to Tomaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Tomaszow Mazowiecki.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Mazowiecki.</span> <span id="s306">You were there a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: What were you doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Same thing what we did, what we did in Piotrków.</span> <span id="s310">We made shelving.</span> <span id="s311">Collected everything and then we brought it to Piotrków.</span> <span id="s312">They called it sammische, sammische stellen (ph).</span> <span id="s313">That means they brought everything together and they shipped it to Germany.</span> <span id="s314">When this was finished, they didn’t know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s315">Luckily for us, they sent us to Starachowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Where you made ammunition for the Germany military.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s318">As I said, called it Hermann Goering werk (ph).</span> <span id="s319">There was already a big factory.</span> <span id="s320">But, I guess so, probably we did a good job.</span> <span id="s321">And then to be truthful, I think at that time, we was watched by guys, other viklestande (ph) division.</span> <span id="s322">They were not so hateful, you know it.</span> <span id="s323">They were young and we were young, so we talked.</span> <span id="s324">They weren’t about to kill you.</span> <span id="s325">Maybe they put in a good word.</span> <span id="s326">I don’t know it, but anyway they took… because 40 people doesn’t mean nothing… so we went to Starachowice from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: So, is this right?</span> <span id="s328">That was around June or July of 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s330">Wait a minute, 1943?</span> <span id="s331">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Tell me some more about your time in Starachowice.</span> <span id="s333">You didn’t tell very much about that in the first interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Starachowice was a big ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s335">They made 1.5 though 15 millimeter… they made 8.8 millimeter and 7.5 millimeter.</span> <span id="s336">From the beginning I worked there, where you know, before you put it in the press.</span> <span id="s337">There is a hydraulic press.</span> <span id="s338">You have to make it very, very hot, so the hydraulic press can press it out, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Press out bullets?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yeah, they pressed out only the shell.</span> <span id="s341">The bullets come later on, you know.</span> <span id="s342">But this was the shell what they made.</span> <span id="s343">Oh, they get cleaned and all kinds of things they would get.</span> <span id="s344">So, I worked there and it was very hard and very hot.</span> <span id="s345">Luckily for me, I met a guy, his name was Chaim Enischmann (ph).</span> <span id="s346">And his brother was from the Jews, the head of the Jews.</span> <span id="s347">You know, that the German told him… you know it…</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: In Starachowice…?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Yeah, and this Chaim Enischmann, I didn’t know it before, he… and there was four other boys.</span> <span id="s350">There was five boys and he by risking his own life, he brought us always food in the evening.</span> <span id="s351">You know it.</span> <span id="s352">Ironically, he never survived.</span> <span id="s353">Was a very, very good person.</span> <span id="s354">Only one from the five boys, no, two.</span> <span id="s355">Is me and there was another guy.</span> <span id="s356">Heniek… I tried to remember his name, but I can’t.</span> <span id="s357">I saw him after the war.</span> <span id="s358">He went to Frankfurt and to college.</span> <span id="s359">He was surprised that I didn’t go to college.</span> <span id="s360">But stupid Abe got married.</span> <span id="s361">(Laughing.)</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: How did you find out what happened to Chaim Enischmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Chaim, what’s his name, from him, from the other guy, he was with him together.</span> <span id="s364">Enischmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Say his name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Chaim Enischmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Enischmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Because his brother, had from the camp, from the Jewish side.</span> <span id="s369">And he worked, his brother worked in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s370">You know the older, when we came home, he made sure that we got something.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Why this… five particular boys?</span> <span id="s372">Did he chose you out or were you part of a group?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Yeah, no, we slept together, you know when you go up on the benches and you sleep.</span> <span id="s374">Some of us slept together.</span> <span id="s375">And you know sometimes a chemistry from a person to a person.</span> <span id="s376">He didn’t want nothing in return.</span> <span id="s377">He just wanted to help.</span> <span id="s378">He knew he cannot help more.</span> <span id="s379">He can’t help everybody.</span> <span id="s380">The other four boys, probably he knew them from before, they already were from there.</span> <span id="s381">And somehow he said, you know, “I’ll help you do whatever I can.”</span> <span id="s382">In life, what I found out everywhere, you need a little bit luck, but other people will help you.</span> <span id="s383">You have to be in the right spot.</span> <span id="s384">And he just, you can say, it’s God’s will or not, if you are religious.</span> <span id="s385">And he really helped me, you know, there.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Speaking of religion, was religion a really important part of your life, up until that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Religion was a very big point until 1939.</span> <span id="s388">You know, I was not… my father… you saw the pictures from my grandfather, you know, he was religious.</span> <span id="s389">He had a beard, he had the traditional thing.</span> <span id="s390">My father, not more.</span> <span id="s391">But we went Saturdays to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s392">We ate kosher.</span> <span id="s393">You know what kosher is?</span> <span id="s394">We Jewish people separate the milk from the, you know, you have to wait when you eat meat six hours after it.</span> <span id="s395">It’s one way of hygiene or something.</span> <span id="s396">We did this.</span> <span id="s397">That was… I knew what I was.</span> <span id="s398">Like some people maybe they would die for it.</span> <span id="s399">And if somebody were to tell me, Abe, if tomorrow you are a Christian and you live, I would chose either side.</span> <span id="s400">You know, it’s like, you know, always like in Spain, when you had….</span></p> <p><span id="s401">End of Tape 1, Side A Tape 1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview with Abe Jakubowicz.</span> <span id="s403">You were saying about religion…</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yeah, until then, you know, it did not, I knew where I belonged.</span> <span id="s405">I like to help the people, because I know what this is.</span> <span id="s406">But it was not later on, the main.</span> <span id="s407">I suffered because of it, but it was not my main thing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: You mentioned that when the war started, that changed.</span> <span id="s409">Did your feelings about religion, about God change?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: No, what had changed is that you couldn’t go in the Synagogue no more.</span> <span id="s411">Because they caught you, you know, they shoot you or they shot you or they did something to you or they beat you up if you was lucky.</span> <span id="s412">So, we were scared.</span> <span id="s413">So… it did not change.</span> <span id="s414">I believed certain… if you ask me now, I think God is for everybody.</span> <span id="s415">There is no such a thing about being closer or not.</span> <span id="s416">We’re having to live together and if you try to separate yourself, you end up like in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s417">Can’t do it.</span> <span id="s418">There’s not a Jewish God, there’s not a Catholic God.</span> <span id="s419">It’s a God, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Did you think about, I mean at this point, when the war is well underway… at the time you were in Starachowice, you were separated from your entire family.</span> <span id="s421">You didn’t know whether they were alive.</span> <span id="s422">Did you feel, did you think at all about your spirituality, your relationship with…</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Number one at that time, is survival.</span> <span id="s424">You want to survive, regardless.</span> <span id="s425">You want to survive.</span> <span id="s426">You ask yourself, “Why me, oh Lord?”</span> <span id="s427">You know.</span> <span id="s428">But you want to survive, you know it, that’s all what it is.</span> <span id="s429">Like an animal, we become simply like animals, you want to survive.</span> <span id="s430">Only certain people would do more to survive and certain people would do less, something different, but we all want to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: So, there wasn’t the time or the experience for that kind of questioning?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: No, we did not, no, there was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Is there anything else you want to say about Starachowice?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: In Starachowice, when we saw the Russians came too close, and there was already a train standing.</span> <span id="s435">We did not know where we are going.</span> <span id="s436">We thought we all will be liquidated.</span> <span id="s437">So, we saw a lot of them, maybe 50 people.</span> <span id="s438">So that… and we run always, you know, a place, and we run away.</span> <span id="s439">I… some they went with machine guns.</span> <span id="s440">A lot of them got caught.</span> <span id="s441">I happened to be, but I didn’t get shot by the machine gun.</span> <span id="s442">And being there one night, two nights, you need to eat, you have to get something.</span> <span id="s443">There was very big forest they called Lasisvindikshe (ph), very big forest.</span> <span id="s444">And then I came, I saw a hut standing there.</span> <span id="s445">And I thought “Okay, I’ll try,” and I go in.</span> <span id="s446">And when the guy saw me, he said, “Hey,” he said, “Jew.</span> <span id="s447">You’re a, you know, really, you’re a Jew.”</span> <span id="s448">“Wait a minute, because when the Germans come they will shoot me.”</span> <span id="s449">But he went on the street and he saw the German police.</span> <span id="s450">But this is military police, you know, they directed already, you know it… brought ‘em in.</span> <span id="s451">So Abe, now you’re at the end of it.</span> <span id="s452">He says, “Okay, where did you run away?”</span> <span id="s453">Listen, he didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s454">I said, “I was in this camp, and we all, we get, you know…” He says, “It’s good.</span> <span id="s455">I will take you there back.”</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Tell me again who this was?</span> <span id="s457">What nationality this person was?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Pole.</span> <span id="s459">He was a Roman Catholic, or whatever it is, but not Jewish.</span> <span id="s460">And I went to the… so, they took me in to… and luckily I told you this Enischmann.</span> <span id="s461">All day he talked… he says, “Okay, we’re going now to…” He knew already we’re going now to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s462">“Why now do you want to shoot him?</span> <span id="s463">We take him with us.”</span> <span id="s464">And then I went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: So, you were deported with Enischmann and the five other boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s467">But I was not with them.</span> <span id="s468">This is his process.</span> <span id="s469">I don’t know what car they went, but we all went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: So when you were deported from Starachowice to Auschwitz, you weren’t necessarily with people that you knew and were close with?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: No, you just, you are a number.</span> <span id="s472">You are not… it was maybe a hundred people in a train.</span> <span id="s473">You know, maybe you thought you were… And they’d say, “Get out, get!</span> <span id="s474">Get!</span> <span id="s475">Get!”</span> <span id="s476">You know, so you were scared.</span> <span id="s477">No, I could not see him anymore in Auschwitz, either.</span> <span id="s478">Somehow I got away from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: When you look back on that time, to me something that really is striking is that you had been… I get the impression you were such a close-knit family and your family was all depending on each other and counting on each other.</span> <span id="s480">And all of a sudden, you are thrust, you’re just thrust into this independent and solitary….</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Then it takes over something else.</span> <span id="s482">You want to survive to tell it to the other people.</span> <span id="s483">I didn’t care to survive, but they would tell me, “Listen Abe, you will survive.”</span> <span id="s484">For one year, until it was fine.</span> <span id="s485">That such an atrocity happened.</span> <span id="s486">I owed it to my parents.</span> <span id="s487">I owed it to… it takes over in your body, the will to survive.</span> <span id="s488">And if you have to crawl, if you have to eat something, you have to do it, you will do it.</span> <span id="s489">And when you are younger, you got a better chance.</span> <span id="s490">Say you stood near… if they want to shoot somebody, it was you, it was you.</span> <span id="s491">There was not anymore… you know.</span> <span id="s492">Sometimes it’s luck, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s494">But it was almost, it was as if this whole different person, you became a whole different person.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: A whole, completely different person.</span> <span id="s496">But later on, it’s a funny thing, when I was liberated, I was the same me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: So you left Starachowice, according to what you said before, around March 1944, as a ballpark guess of when you left.</span> <span id="s498">And then…</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: ‘44, that’s right.</span> <span id="s500">Because when the Russians came closer… yeah, it’s a ballpark.</span> <span id="s501">I don’t even know it, but it’s probably, it is.</span> <span id="s502">It’s probably in the ballpark.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: And you described your journey and you described arriving in Auschwitz and being taken to the Gypsy lager.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Gypsy camp.</span> <span id="s505">They did not make selections, because they saw all these people worked and they needed at that time, they needed workers.</span> <span id="s506">And a lot of Hungarian Jews came in that time and mostly they put them in D camp.</span> <span id="s507">So, since they didn’t have any place, they put us for a while in the Gypsy camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Did you have any interactions at all with the gypsy families that were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Can you describe what kinds of interactions you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: You went out and you saw there was whole families living, you know it, and they had a curtain, not a curtain, just a blanket, you know it.</span> <span id="s512">And here was this family, there was that family and that was as far as the interaction.</span> <span id="s513">Because being there a few days, they liquidated all the gypsies in that camp.</span> <span id="s514">At night you hear the cars, you know, going back and forth, trucks taking them to the crematory.</span> <span id="s515">But it was three days and I came over to the family and everything is fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Had you known at that point that the Nazis were exterminating other groups than the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s518">Yeah, we knew it.</span> <span id="s519">I knew if you wasn’t their way, they exterminate you.</span> <span id="s520">But I didn’t know before that they took the Gypsies.</span> <span id="s521">You know, only when I was in Auschwitz, I saw that they disappeared.</span> <span id="s522">I knew where they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Did the Jews in the lager and the Gypsies generally interact with one another?</span> <span id="s524">Talk to one another?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: We spoke, yeah, we spoke, but that is it, as far as it went.</span> <span id="s526">In the first few days, we were in quarantine.</span> <span id="s527">We didn’t go to work.</span> <span id="s528">We stayed there.</span> <span id="s529">You were afraid to go far.</span> <span id="s530">They catch you….</span> <span id="s531">But yes, you get to talk to some of them.</span> <span id="s532">They said their son is on the front, works for the Germans, makes ditches, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: And then you described how you started working with the Canada commando.</span> <span id="s534">And I wondered how it was that you got that position, because that was a somewhat coveted position.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: No, nobody wanted it, nobody wanted it.</span> <span id="s536">Usually when you stand, you know, I worked that time before I worked in katowe bunker (ph), you know, where the potatoes was.</span> <span id="s537">And you had to, there was two people, one in front and one in the back and then they filled it up.</span> <span id="s538">You lift it up and you go to other place, you know, and filled it, put it in there.</span> <span id="s539">Because mostly when they came with the railroads, they dumped it.</span> <span id="s540">And I knew one thing, there was always selection going on.</span> <span id="s541">There was selection to go in the crematoria if you didn’t look good or if they didn’t like you.</span> <span id="s542">So, you always watched out.</span> <span id="s543">Your eyes went the right way.</span> <span id="s544">Somehow I missed him.</span> <span id="s545">He was standing in front of me.</span> <span id="s546">And he said, write down here the number.</span> <span id="s547">You know, my number what I got right here on my hand.</span> <span id="s548">He wrote it down and they called me out.</span> <span id="s549">I didn’t know where we’ll go.</span> <span id="s550">You know, nobody wanted to work in two different places.</span> <span id="s551">Sonderkommando, where what the people burned them, you know it.</span> <span id="s552">And Canada, where you take the clothes.</span> <span id="s553">You told them, “Oh you will live, and it’s nothing,” whole kind of thing, “Take off, when you come out, you will find it.”</span> <span id="s554">You know, we had to take it away, and they sold it.</span> <span id="s555">But this meant a certain death, too.</span> <span id="s556">Say, sonderkommando maybe three months, the other one may be six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Well, it’s interesting to hear you say that nobody wanted it, because I’ve heard other people say that it was, that they would try to get a position, because you would have advantages of clothing and food and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Now, you had advantages, but you didn’t want to, because you knew that you would be dead, too.</span> <span id="s559">And you always have that little hope, you know?</span> <span id="s560">They did not, they picked you, you didn’t pick them.</span> <span id="s561">They picked me out.</span> <span id="s562">And I said, “Oh,” you know it.</span> <span id="s563">No, I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s564">I had a little bit of food, but then I had to watch out.</span> <span id="s565">Somebody would see me shoving it down my mouth, they would kill me, and all these things.</span> <span id="s566">But in a way, this food helped, but I didn’t want to, no.</span> <span id="s567">So I was in Canada.</span> <span id="s568">It’s like nobody wanted for the Sonderkommando.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Did you have friends in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Friends what I knew only, I met them in the camp, but nothing else.</span> <span id="s571">Friends, but I slept with them, but no, you did not have friends.</span> <span id="s572">You didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s573">What binded with them, they all had a miserable life, but that was it.</span> <span id="s574">No, I did not have nobody.</span> <span id="s575">Some brothers stayed together, or even high management maybe stayed ___________.</span> <span id="s576">I did not.</span> <span id="s577">Somehow I, I got away somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Okay, back to the summary.</span> <span id="s579">Something that you mentioned in the first interview that I wanted to ask you a little bit more about… you mentioned that God was watching over you.</span> <span id="s580">Did you feel that at the time that God was watching over you?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No, I felt later on when I saw all the deaths, that he was watching over me.</span> <span id="s584">In fact, the opposite.</span> <span id="s585">I always ask, you know, “Why me, oh Lord?”</span> <span id="s586">You know, to have suffered.</span> <span id="s587">And a lot of people, you know, they was weak, they grabbed the electric wire.</span> <span id="s588">If I had guts I would have done it, but I have no guts to do it.</span> <span id="s589">But no, no.</span> <span id="s590">Later when I see so many dead, I say probably God was watching over me.</span> <span id="s591">This is what saying about God.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: So, about September 1944 you were shipped to Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s594">And there we stayed about two weeks, I think.</span> <span id="s595">And that was a quarantine, you know, it was near Berlin.</span> <span id="s596">In fact, we saw, you know, we were in a station in Berlin and there was bombing, all things.</span> <span id="s597">It was already going, you know, everything going strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: And I was a little confused about what happened next.</span> <span id="s599">I heard something… either you went to Ohrdruf or you went to Krauwinkle (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: At first we went to Krauwinkle.</span> <span id="s601">Krauwinkle was a little small place, you know it?</span> <span id="s602">But then we had to build this big place for all the people to come, because we built the tunnels, you know, in the mountains.</span> <span id="s603">So Krauwinkle was, yes, Krauwinkle was a very, very small place.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: It all went fast, about a week, two.</span> <span id="s606">I remember it was so cold in the mountains, you know.</span> <span id="s607">I remember we had to go so far, to the mountains, to drill and do this here.</span> <span id="s608">In fact, at times they didn’t have a lot of SS guarding us – it was a volkstrom (ph), was an old man.</span> <span id="s609">Almost as old as me.</span> <span id="s610">And they guarded us.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: And did you do something, taking care of a dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Yeah, when I was, late in… was it Ohrdruf or was it Krauwinkle?</span> <span id="s613">I had an SS guy ask me to take care, really it was not to take care of the dog.</span> <span id="s614">Really it was to make chopped wood for his wife, if she wanted something to do, you know it.</span> <span id="s615">But beside there was a German Shepherd, he told me to, you know, feed him too, and this was just caring for the dog.</span> <span id="s616">So he gave me permission to go in the SS kitchen, you know and pick up all the bones.</span> <span id="s617">But everything was edible, so you can imagine.</span> <span id="s618">I always got beat over by the dog.</span> <span id="s619">He gives him so much food, and he’s so skinny.</span> <span id="s620">___________.</span> <span id="s621">(laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: But you got a little bit of extra food by doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Yeah, you got always a little.</span> <span id="s624">Not from him… the food what I got in the SS kitchen that I could steal.</span> <span id="s625">Nobody gave you anything extra, you know.</span> <span id="s626">Extra you had to take.</span> <span id="s627">Was it in Krauwinkle?</span> <span id="s628">You see he picked them… you know, in that time they told me, if you let yourself go, you don’t wash yourself, you go down very fast.</span> <span id="s629">And I didn’t want to go down fast.</span> <span id="s630">And also our hopes for the war, it’s winding down.</span> <span id="s631">I only thought they would shoot us before… you know it.</span> <span id="s632">So, probably I was maybe cleaner like near the time.</span> <span id="s633">You know he said that I should take care… you know, for his wife, and other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: So, you found ways to wash yourself through that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yeah, you go and, washings, you know, it was cold, but they want you to wash yourself, you know it.</span> <span id="s636">So, what I did, I did.</span> <span id="s637">The other ones were afraid, you know, it’s cold, they didn’t want to, not all of them, ninety percent washed.</span> <span id="s638">It’s only when your mind goes down, your body goes with it.</span> <span id="s639">Your feet start swelling and you give up.</span> <span id="s640">You can know it.</span> <span id="s641">So in that time I didn’t give up yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: When you were in Auschwitz and the other camps before…?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I still tried to maintain, you know, as much as I could to be clean, because otherwise they would put you in the selection, to the crematoria.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: How did you… was it difficult when you were in Auschwitz to obtain water to clean?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s646">We got, there was a shower, only you went in, you know, you were supposed to wash a little bit.</span> <span id="s647">It was not difficult.</span> <span id="s648">In fact they didn’t want any sicknesses to break out either.</span> <span id="s649">They cut your hair, pick lice all around your arm.</span> <span id="s650">No, I could wash, it was not that hard to shower, but they took us so we could wash ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: After you arrived in Ohrdruf, you started to build a camp, build the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: That’s right, we started building the camp.</span> <span id="s653">The camp to Treblinka, no to Krauwinkle, we went and built the camp.</span> <span id="s654">And then they moved us over into the…</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: And then you described that, your time in Ohrdruf in the first interview.</span> <span id="s656">And then in February 1945, around, around then, you set out on a death march towards Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s658">The Americans came closer, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: And you talked about how you thought you would die before you arrived in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: And the Dutch prisoners, Jewish prisoners helped you.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: I assumed it was Jewish prisoners, maybe not.</span> <span id="s663">It was Dutch people.</span> <span id="s664">I knew that they spoke Dutch.</span> <span id="s665">And they dragged me in to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: It’s kind of remarkable how there were certain key points where people, people were there for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: It was, if they could help me, I was too.</span> <span id="s668">Lot of times I was younger than an older man, if there was something to do, I tried to do it, too.</span> <span id="s669">You tried, you know?</span> <span id="s670">You didn’t lose your humanity, you got a sense of survival, but if you knew it’s a danger, you stayed away.</span> <span id="s671">But if you could help somebody you were there.</span> <span id="s672">Because I was, when I was in Ohrdruf, we went, there’s a city called Arnstadt and we had to make ditches, because they laid cables.</span> <span id="s673">And there happened to be a Jewish guy, much older, and he told me he was head of one of the Jewish bigger newspaper from Heit (ph).</span> <span id="s674">He told me, you know, and we talked and I tried to help him as much as I could.</span> <span id="s675">Whenever there is an older person with who his work was pen and pencil, wasn’t as good at ditch digging, you know, to dig the ditches.</span> <span id="s676">You know, and I was a young kid, and you learn.</span> <span id="s677">Not that I was better, but I tried to learn much better than an older person.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Did you, you talked in the first interview about being in Buchenwald and recovering and about how at first you were in a horrible place, and then you walked out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s680">When they brought me to Buchenwald, they dumped everybody.</span> <span id="s681">No shower, no kind of thing.</span> <span id="s682">This guy came to me, this Kapo and he said, “What you got?</span> <span id="s683">You got diarrhea?</span> <span id="s684">You got stomach, you cannot control your bowel movement?”</span> <span id="s685">I say, “It’s okay, it’s fine.”</span> <span id="s686">He said, “Go in here.”</span> <span id="s687">There was a place about five and I got on top, got the place he told me to lay down…</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Five bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Ya, ya, so I was there, but I thought, my gosh, if I have to survive.</span> <span id="s690">Here’s a death, here’s a death, smells horrible.</span> <span id="s691">And I went down and I told the guy, “Hey listen, I’m nice and clean, but I don’t really do such things.”</span> <span id="s692">In the meantime always when, simples Juden ein treiden (ph), all the Jews should go because they put them on march.</span> <span id="s693">I said, “My gosh, I cannot go, they have to shoot me, let them shoot me here.”</span> <span id="s694">And I ignored it.</span> <span id="s695">And they needed a few clean people.</span> <span id="s696">They had a small place where girls worked and they needed a few cleaners, because they wanted to keep for the SS some woman, you know?</span> <span id="s697">So they put me in there and I was liberated there.</span> <span id="s698">That place was a little bit cleaner.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: What were the nationalities of the women who were kept there?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Oh, this was prisoners, but mostly they spoke German.</span> <span id="s701">But they was prisoners.</span> <span id="s702">But they keep them, you know, as nurses for the people that worked there.</span> <span id="s703">But this was only to pretend, to show, you know, it was not…</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: It was a kind of brothel, you mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: That’s right, part of a brothel.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: And how did they, can you say how business was undertaken?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: No, I was there in that time.</span> <span id="s708">I was really sick.</span> <span id="s709">Then Americans they say they come.</span> <span id="s710">And they probably went, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s711">I don’t know it.</span> <span id="s712">I would have had to invent it, but I don’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: You don’t know whether they were forced into the…</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: They were forced, ya, surely, yes they were forced.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: At that time, you, were you so sick it was hard for you to even get up?</span> <span id="s716">Or how…?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: I couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s718">I could really not… I was, when I came into Buchenwald I had already diarrhea by myself.</span> <span id="s719">I had to run.</span> <span id="s720">And after a while if you have nothing behind, you get weaker and weaker.</span> <span id="s721">But I was… in fact after the liberation it took about six weeks, six months, until I could learn to walk again.</span> <span id="s722">So, when the Americans came, I couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s723">They told me that the Americans are there, but I… And there were two Polish guys with me.</span> <span id="s724">Got still some pictures from them.</span> <span id="s725">They brought me a little bit food, they brought me that, you know it?</span> <span id="s726">They could move better than I could.</span> <span id="s727">I couldn’t move.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Do you remember when the Americans came into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Oh yeah, I remember, it was, you know it.</span> <span id="s730">But that was the eleventh of April.</span> <span id="s731">But probably a little bit later, but then you saw the people came and took pictures.</span> <span id="s732">You know, ironically today, I went out with a guy on Shoah, he spoke as a liberator.</span> <span id="s733">And he came to Buchenwald one day later that it was liberated.</span> <span id="s734">He’s Mr. Knight, his son happened to be an opthamologist.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: You went out with him today?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yeah, I went out today.</span> <span id="s737">He’s 81 years, with his wife.</span> <span id="s738">And we went out to eat something.</span> <span id="s739">I say, “Hey you liberate me, I go and meet.”</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Have you been in regular contact with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: I met him only… no, I met him when I went first time to Shoah.</span> <span id="s742">And he spoke how they liberated Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s743">And then I went to him.</span> <span id="s744">I say, “Hey, I was one what you liberated.”</span> <span id="s745">So, I give him my telephone number and he gives me his telephone number.</span> <span id="s746">So, we happened to go out today.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: So when you say you went to Shoah, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Once in a year, it’s a memorial for the Holocaust survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Here in Louisville?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: In Louisville, it’s everywhere.</span> <span id="s751">And the last few times, he’s always picked me, but you cannot always pick the next, the same person to speak.</span> <span id="s752">First you hear it, and then it gets like old coffee.</span> <span id="s753">So, last time, I didn’t, they did it differently.</span> <span id="s754">But I had got to light the candle and all the things, yeah.</span> <span id="s755">And this guy spoke as a liberator from Buchenwald, but I didn’t know him before, you know.</span> <span id="s756">So, we went out today.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: How did that go?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Oh, it was nice, you know, my gosh.</span> <span id="s759">I only wished we came in ________– when I was sick and was liberated, people came with cameras and the press and everything and made pictures.</span> <span id="s760">I wish I would find somewhere a picture from me, because I’ve got at least thousands of pictures what they made.</span> <span id="s761">But I didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s762">I’m still looking.</span> <span id="s763">My wife says, “Why do you watch it?”</span> <span id="s764">I say, “I want to recognize me somewhere.”</span> <span id="s765">(laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Did you talk today with him about…?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s768">He was as much interested as I was.</span> <span id="s769">He told me what he was, he was a platoon leader and he was in Weimar.</span> <span id="s770">Weimar is, I think seven kilometers from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s771">So, he had to buy some things, so he went with a jeep and drove in there and what he saw.</span> <span id="s772">You know, so we talked about it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: No.</span> <span id="s775">No, he’s not, but you don’t have to be Jewish in order to see it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: You were, you remained in Buchenwald then for how long after the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Oh, I did not stay in Buchenwald very long.</span> <span id="s778">I stayed maybe a month, or maybe three weeks and then the next little, tiny city was Blankenheim.</span> <span id="s779">They evacuated schools and they put us in there, you know it.</span> <span id="s780">I remember a room like this, who knows how many beds.</span> <span id="s781">And most of them, they give bread to each one.</span> <span id="s782">It was plenty, but they didn’t want to give, because they was afraid they will die.</span> <span id="s783">So, she gave me bread and the other ones couldn’t eat it.</span> <span id="s784">So sometimes I ate twenty pieces of bread and… “Oh!</span> <span id="s785">, you will get diarrhea and you will die.”</span> <span id="s786">I tell you I was only one from few that survived.</span> <span id="s787">I got the diarrhea and survived.</span> <span id="s788">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s789">But I gained every week, about five pounds.</span> <span id="s790">And they were all the meat… I couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s791">They had to teach me how to walk and to go.</span> <span id="s792">So I was in Blankenheim.</span> <span id="s793">Ironically, now let’s go farther, one of the doctors, Doctor Lucas, I met him later on in Frankfurt and he was head from TB hospital.</span> <span id="s794">And I had TB, so we became really close friends, you know, he always took care.</span> <span id="s795">I remember when he met this girl and he want… you know, he told me, everyone around.</span> <span id="s796">There was a bond because he saw how I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: And you did mention him… End of Tape 1, Side B Tape 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Abe Jakubowicz.</span> <span id="s799">Sorry, we got cut off and you were just saying that he was a German prisoner of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Prisoner of war, that’s right.</span> <span id="s801">And they got a lot of doctors, German prisoners of war, so his nurses, they were German prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Did you… so some people, of course, feel that the German nation as a whole was responsible for what the Nazis did to Jewish people.</span> <span id="s803">The fact that you were able to befriend this man, who was a German, non-Jewish man.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: I say the German was responsible, but I didn’t say that every German killed or a German hated.</span> <span id="s805">Fact is, you know it, it was their __________, you know it.</span> <span id="s806">But I think there’s some good and some bad in every nation.</span> <span id="s807">And I believe, first, life is too short to hate.</span> <span id="s808">Secondly, I believe if I teach my kids to hate, somebody will hate them and it is a vicious cycle.</span> <span id="s809">The cycle has to stop.</span> <span id="s810">And my mother always told me, “You know Abe, if somebody throws a rock at you, throw them bread back.</span> <span id="s811">Take a piece of bread and throw them back, don’t hate.”</span> <span id="s812">You know, so I… even when I was liberated, I wanted to tell my story, but I didn’t hate.</span> <span id="s813">It’s wrong to hate, I can’t.</span> <span id="s814">I think that people what hate, they are born… as you see now in Yugoslavia, they take kids, for two year, __________ throw them down ___________, and the training, and the ditch.</span> <span id="s815">It takes a special person, but everybody can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: So, you weren’t angry even then?</span> <span id="s817">Were you angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: I was angry, but I didn’t hate.</span> <span id="s819">I was angry at the SS.</span> <span id="s820">I was angry, but never hate.</span> <span id="s821">I think they should be punished, what they did, but not hated.</span> <span id="s822">In fact, my wife is German, you know.</span> <span id="s823">I say you can’t make everybody responsible for something.</span> <span id="s824">But then I would be the same thing like Hitler, he said all the Jews are bad.</span> <span id="s825">Maybe some of them were.</span> <span id="s826">It’s like now in Russia, I saw in today’s paper, the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s827">Because they blame the Jews for what’s going on now, and Jews had nothing to do… there’s only a few of them.</span> <span id="s828">The difference is, now the Jews have a way, they can run away.</span> <span id="s829">I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s830">And I would run for my life, but I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: What was the name of the doctor again?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Lucas.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Did you talk with him at all about any of these issues?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yes, we talked a lot about it, because he saw and we became good friends.</span> <span id="s835">Certain things I tried to avoid, I didn’t want to bring up things, you know, because I knew it will not help me and it will not help him.</span> <span id="s836">He had already his opinion formed.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: What kind of things did you not want to bring up?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Oh, the cruelty, because he saw it.</span> <span id="s839">Why try to win if there’s nothing there to win, you know?</span> <span id="s840">He knew it, he saw it, so certain things I tried to avoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: What was his point of view that he shared with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: No German will tell you that he agreed, they only got forced to do it.</span> <span id="s843">But I knew he got forced to do it, you know.</span> <span id="s844">He was too smart.</span> <span id="s845">He was not in the SS.</span> <span id="s846">He was a good person.</span> <span id="s847">Certain people, even when you are good, you can’t do nothing about it.</span> <span id="s848">He was good in my book.</span> <span id="s849">He was a very nice person.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: It strikes me as very unusual that you were able to separate your anger from your hatred and to have meaningful relationships with…</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: You have to, otherwise, you become very bitter.</span> <span id="s852">I have a lot of friends, you know, friends from there.</span> <span id="s853">They are bitter.</span> <span id="s854">And it doesn’t help you really.</span> <span id="s855">And if I go around and be mean and mistreat other people, would my mother want me to see this way?</span> <span id="s856">No.</span> <span id="s857">So I have motive to show that you are not the same.</span> <span id="s858">You have to be different.</span> <span id="s859">I am different.</span> <span id="s860">I would force myself more to be mean, you know, than that is my nature.</span> <span id="s861">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Did you have friends or acquaintances who were Jewish, at that time, who couldn’t understand why you would want to be friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Oh yeah, I had, especially when I married my wife.</span> <span id="s864">They was against… they say, you know it, “How can you do it?”</span> <span id="s865">I say “Listen, I go to them, they are very nice, they open the door.</span> <span id="s866">I’m sick, so money doesn’t play any part.</span> <span id="s867">I met the most beautiful person and now this married to me.”</span> <span id="s868">____________.</span> <span id="s869">Here she was a young girl, good-looking, and at the time, I tell you the truth, looking back now, I needed somebody.</span> <span id="s870">I really needed somebody.</span> <span id="s871">You know, I was not the one what could live alone.</span> <span id="s872">You know it.</span> <span id="s873">And it was nice.</span> <span id="s874">And then when we went out.</span> <span id="s875">And I would be cruel and leave her.</span> <span id="s876">And only because she, it was nice.</span> <span id="s877">Then I leave her out.</span> <span id="s878">Then the Germans later on will say… you know it.</span> <span id="s879">So it’s again another thing, I would have to think a lifetime on it.</span> <span id="s880">And I tell you, we are 52 years married, we had all the kids college graduate.</span> <span id="s881">We never had any problem about the religion, about other things.</span> <span id="s882">I think our marriage has evened out.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Did you, you were in the TB hospital for…</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Ya, this is where the Dr. Lucas was head of it, the TB Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Okay, going back to the summer, you were in Blankenheim first…</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Ya, and then the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s887">And I couldn’t stay with the Russians.</span> <span id="s888">They ask you why you don’t go home.</span> <span id="s889">They thought because I murdered somebody.</span> <span id="s890">You know, therefore I don’t want to go.</span> <span id="s891">I told them everybody got killed.</span> <span id="s892">So I _____________ away.</span> <span id="s893">There were a lot of Jewish guys.</span> <span id="s894">We went to the railroad, we drove to Berlin, and from Berlin we drove to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s895">You know we came over in the American zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Before you go on from there, regarding your statement that you knew you didn’t want to go back to Poland because everybody had been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: I just thought everybody was dead.</span> <span id="s898">It was a cemetery.</span> <span id="s899">I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Did you get definite news at that point about your father and your brother and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: You ask, that’s true, you ask.</span> <span id="s902">In fact, when I came to Berlin and it was all the troops from everywhere, from Russia.</span> <span id="s903">And there was a guy, he exactly looked like my father.</span> <span id="s904">And I want to believe and I asked him.</span> <span id="s905">I just direct asked him, you know it.</span> <span id="s906">Surely it was not, but I wanted to believe it.</span> <span id="s907">You know, I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s908">I found out later on from people what were with him, that he died in 1945 in Dora, you know, not far away from where I was.</span> <span id="s909">Maybe the mountain was from the other side, but I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s910">He died in 1945, in the beginning of ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: When did you find that out?</span> <span id="s912">And from whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: I happened to be, you know, when you come after the war, you ask everybody.</span> <span id="s914">“Hey, you didn’t you see?”</span> <span id="s915">“Where are you from?”</span> <span id="s916">“Piotrków.”</span> <span id="s917">“Piotrków?</span> <span id="s918">Did you know my dad?”</span> <span id="s919">You know, because in Piotrków… and he said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s920">In fact, this guy, his name is Rappaport and he became a dentist in St. Louis.</span> <span id="s921">He’s dead now, too.</span> <span id="s922">But I found out in Rupertstein (ph), he was sick on TB, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: And when did you learn about Treblinka and what Treblinka…?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: I knew this all, this I knew right away.</span> <span id="s925">That the whole transport went to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s926">When you went to Treblinka, it was death.</span> <span id="s927">And I knew this, so I didn’t have to ask anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Right away after the war, you mean?</span> <span id="s929">Or right away…?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yeah, right away after the war.</span> <span id="s931">In fact, I came late, because I was in Buchenwald, you know, and then I was in Blankenheim, in the hospital.</span> <span id="s932">So it was a few months after the war already.</span> <span id="s933">I would say, we got liberated in April, maybe six months later, because I had to walk and I couldn’t walk right away.</span> <span id="s934">I got there about six months, seven months.</span> <span id="s935">Then it was awful cold and I didn’t feel good.</span> <span id="s936">And I was coughing.</span> <span id="s937">And I got x-rayed and they told me, “Abe, you’ve got TB.</span> <span id="s938">You better go to the hospital.”</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: And that was when you went to Rupertstein?</span> <span id="s940">You were in there for quite a while, weren’t you?</span> <span id="s941">How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: I stayed in Rupertstein until 1947.</span> <span id="s943">No, ‘57, ‘57.</span> <span id="s944">I got married in ‘47.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: You stayed in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Ya, in town.</span> <span id="s947">I was in hospital maybe two, I would say to about a few months before I got married.</span> <span id="s948">End ‘46 or the beginning of ‘47.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: What did you, was that time, what was that time in the hospital like?</span> <span id="s950">Were you really sick and out of commission?</span> <span id="s951">Or did you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: No, you were sick.</span> <span id="s953">You felt good, TB doesn’t hurt you.</span> <span id="s954">So all what in that time, now you got penicillin and streptomycin.</span> <span id="s955">In that time, all what could help you, so many people died… in fact, a lot of people what I wasn’t there was liberated, they died.</span> <span id="s956">You got to lay down and breathe fresh air.</span> <span id="s957">It was high in the mountains.</span> <span id="s958">They give you decent food, and that was it, you know.</span> <span id="s959">Mother Nature in that time had to help.</span> <span id="s960">So certain people didn’t make it… because a lot of people years ago died on TB.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: So, during your, what did you do to keep yourself busy and occupied during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Well, we went in the village.</span> <span id="s963">Really a lot of people weren’t supposed to go, because there was, they call it, plus and minuses.</span> <span id="s964">If you got the bacillus and you don’t have it, but you still had TB.</span> <span id="s965">I could, because, you know… but a lot of people had it and went any way, because the Germans at that time would not stop you, you know.</span> <span id="s966">So, we went in the village.</span> <span id="s967">I got some… from UNRRA, United Refugees… anyway we got some packages and we traded.</span> <span id="s968">I couldn’t eat, how much sugar can you eat?</span> <span id="s969">So, we traded for some different things, you know.</span> <span id="s970">Some had fruits.</span> <span id="s971">You know, it was a village more, you know it, we traded with the people.</span> <span id="s972">We got coffee, you know at that time coffee didn’t mean nothing to me, but to them it meant a lot, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: You said something earlier about how when the war ended, you became again, the person who you had been before.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Did you start to go to services in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: There was not anymore services.</span> <span id="s977">There was in Salzheim.</span> <span id="s978">When I was in Rupertstein, I was alone, you know, with a few other people.</span> <span id="s979">But I had, not a cousin, but a relative far away and he… Windheim (ph).</span> <span id="s980">He was liberated.</span> <span id="s981">No, he ran away on papers that he’s a Pole or something.</span> <span id="s982">So, we went, for the high holiday, he invited me.</span> <span id="s983">And we went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s984">Because there wasn’t a synagogue really, in Frankfurt everything bombed out anyway.</span> <span id="s985">It was in the Rochiltalay (ph) there was a meeting where you could pray.</span> <span id="s986">So, I went for the high holidays, but otherwise all what you wanted really is to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: And after you, so you still felt, even after the war ended, that your main goal was survival for a time?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: When you are sick, you want to get well.</span> <span id="s989">And if that’s not the goal, then you see, see a lot of people, they survived and they’re dying.</span> <span id="s990">But you wanted to survive, you wanted to live.</span> <span id="s991">I was only 21 years old, 20 years old.</span> <span id="s992">But now I got surely, the will to live is very, very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Did you start to have, as you started to recover and to feel healthier, did you start to have other goals for what you wanted?</span> <span id="s994">Or did you start to remember, have thoughts about the past?</span> <span id="s995">What was going on inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: In my brain?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: You know, from the beginning when I got better, then you know, you want to live, you want to go to a dance.</span> <span id="s999">You’re still young.</span> <span id="s1000">I met my wife and we got married, then you got children.</span> <span id="s1001">So, maybe I didn’t start it from the right side, but sometimes time dictates it.</span> <span id="s1002">You know, certain people were different.</span> <span id="s1003">They first want the career.</span> <span id="s1004">I wasn’t smart enough to do all that thinking.</span> <span id="s1005">I become a child again.</span> <span id="s1006">(laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Can you talk about, more about meeting your wife and what that was…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: How I met my wife?</span> <span id="s1009">We knew a girl, a Jewish girl, and she was not quiet sick.</span> <span id="s1010">So, they had a house, and were rented the rooms there for her.</span> <span id="s1011">Her name was Lutia (ph).</span> <span id="s1012">And she happened to be from Lodz and my friend was from Lodz.</span> <span id="s1013">We always went there to see how she was doing.</span> <span id="s1014">Nothing else, we want, you know it.</span> <span id="s1015">So, when I came, I say, “My gosh, that’s a good looking girl.”</span> <span id="s1016">But then you forget a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1017">Oh look at this, he has all _________.</span> <span id="s1018">My wife… and at that time girls played hard to get.</span> <span id="s1019">But when you talk a lot and you talk and you know… my goal was, not to stay in Germany, having children and leave, maybe for Israel, maybe for the United States.</span> <span id="s1020">But since I had TB and I was sick, Israel and the climate would have been very tough.</span> <span id="s1021">I was supposed to come here in 1952, but my wife talked me out.</span> <span id="s1022">She says, “Listen, these people want to go.</span> <span id="s1023">Look here we got the nice apartment.</span> <span id="s1024">We got everything to eat.</span> <span id="s1025">Why do you rush so much?”</span> <span id="s1026">So, I gave in and in 1957… was Hungarian uprising in 1956.</span> <span id="s1027">And I knew that’s the last way I can get out, and still I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1028">But that’s the way we got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Was it difficult for you to live in Germany during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: It was really not, because the Germans are very, very nice, even when what they think is something different.</span> <span id="s1031">You learn to live with it.</span> <span id="s1032">You know, if you have something, if you have a hunchback, you learn to live as a hunchback, you know.</span> <span id="s1033">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1034">You cannot go against a trend.</span> <span id="s1035">They was extremely nice.</span> <span id="s1036">And then I thought I needed a trade.</span> <span id="s1037">So, I went to work for the IG Farben.</span> <span id="s1038">And they sent me to a school and they taught me, you know, about the way.</span> <span id="s1039">So and the people saw and I worked with them, that I was not different.</span> <span id="s1040">I was not what they had told them I am.</span> <span id="s1041">You know, so, no… in fact, when I was supposed to go to the United States, I told them.</span> <span id="s1042">They said, “Listen, we give you a year leave of absence and if you don’t like it, you can always come back.”</span> <span id="s1043">And they made an album and everybody wrote something nice in it.</span> <span id="s1044">I am not a person what carries around hatred.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: So, did you know when you started working for IG Farben, what their role, their history had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1047">I knew it, because I told you, I saw the Zyklon B, and all the gas.</span> <span id="s1048">In fact, near Auschwitz there was a, called Buna, they made gasoline from coal.</span> <span id="s1049">And as far as I know it was conducted by IG Farben, too.</span> <span id="s1050">Yes, I knew it, but I had to… when you have to live, you have to live.</span> <span id="s1051">I want a trade, and then first things first.</span> <span id="s1052">And then it’s different.</span> <span id="s1053">You cannot kill before you’re dead.</span> <span id="s1054">(Laughing.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: But how ironic that they were, that IG Farben had Jews working as slave labor during the war and then you were working…</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s1057">I worked there, because I wanted to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s1058">I cannot work physically hard anymore and there was… they paid me good.</span> <span id="s1059">They were extremely nice.</span> <span id="s1060">They went out of their way.</span> <span id="s1061">And sometimes you have to take advantage, later on, you cannot forget, but you have to learn to forgive a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Did they know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Ya.</span> <span id="s1064">And I didn’t have to be ashamed then later on, you know.</span> <span id="s1065">Yes, I told them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: You didn’t experience any anti-Semitism from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: If it was, it was only behind my back.</span> <span id="s1068">They wouldn’t openly show it, no.</span> <span id="s1069">Germans are different, you know.</span> <span id="s1070">See, a Russian, if he is, he tells you.</span> <span id="s1071">And Germans will be very, very nice, you know.</span> <span id="s1072">The nicer they get, then you know you have to watch out.</span> <span id="s1073">(Laughing.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Were you afraid, at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Why would I be afraid?</span> <span id="s1076">No, I wasn’t afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: You didn’t feel that there was a danger of any Holocaust happening again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: In Germany now?</span> <span id="s1079">I will say Germany now is different.</span> <span id="s1080">I was there a few times.</span> <span id="s1081">You got still a few, but they are, but most of them, they’re educated, they’re adaptable, you know.</span> <span id="s1082">They know it was wrong.</span> <span id="s1083">They know what Hitler… the older ones.</span> <span id="s1084">All it brought them is, they couldn’t speak, they couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s1085">Now, they have a nice country built.</span> <span id="s1086">When we went to Israel, saw a lot of German tourists.</span> <span id="s1087">They’re interested.</span> <span id="s1088">You know, sure they will always find… like anything else, here too, people would relate.</span> <span id="s1089">And no matter what, if somebody tells me he hates blacks, I know right away he hates everybody, stay away, you know.</span> <span id="s1090">And I know it.</span> <span id="s1091">So, this type will always hate and you know why?</span> <span id="s1092">Because it’s an excuse for their misery.</span> <span id="s1093">They will not say it.</span> <span id="s1094">I didn’t go to school because I was dumb.</span> <span id="s1095">If the Jews would not go, I would go there.</span> <span id="s1096">You know?</span> <span id="s1097">It is the same thing.</span> <span id="s1098">What do you agree it is this way?</span> <span id="s1099">It doesn’t work the other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: There was a Nuremberg trial, a case brought against IG Farben that came to trial in 1947, 1948.</span> <span id="s1101">Were you following that, interested in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1103">‘47, ‘48 I was still… you know, I just got married.</span> <span id="s1104">I followed a little bit, you know, you always, but no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: When were you working for IG Farben?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: I was working in 1954, ‘55, ‘56 and ‘57.</span> <span id="s1107">But I tell you a story, while I was working for IG Farben and now when I retired, the German government couldn’t say I was not ________.</span> <span id="s1108">You get the SS the war years, they had to give me the war years, and I got a nice pension from Germany.</span> <span id="s1109">Beside being a Holocaust survivor, you know, because they had to give me all the years.</span> <span id="s1110">And they cannot say, “Hey, we give an SS man.”</span> <span id="s1111">Say yes, wasn’t in the war, and while I was in concentration camp, I don’t get it.</span> <span id="s1112">They had to pay me back so much.</span> <span id="s1113">I said only I’ll try, but in this case they was very generous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: How was your relationship with your wife’s family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Oh, it was good.</span> <span id="s1116">They was not… really you know everybody can say, but then when you live so long, you see the history.</span> <span id="s1117">You know, they live in a little village, they minded their own business.</span> <span id="s1118">They never knew Jews.</span> <span id="s1119">Maybe if they knew they would hate one, but they did not know, I know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Did they have an understanding of the extent of what had been done in the name of Germany to the Jews of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Oh ya, oh ya.</span> <span id="s1122">They tried those, a lot of them German… they tried to excuse and they didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1123">I know a lot of them didn’t do it, but that’s the way, what it was.</span> <span id="s1124">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: So, they talked to you about it and…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: We talked a lot about it, you know.</span> <span id="s1127">But they was really, they maybe had to play the game, but nobody was in the Party.</span> <span id="s1128">And in a small village, everybody will talk about you.</span> <span id="s1129">In a big city, you don’t know it.</span> <span id="s1130">All you had to do, is go to the neighbors and you know everything.</span> <span id="s1131">You know even what they cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Did you have friends who, you mentioned something earlier about how some of your friends were saying you shouldn’t…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Yes, I was in the hospital with them.</span> <span id="s1134">They were my age.</span> <span id="s1135">A few of them, ironically, came from Blankenheim, you know, from… after we was liberated, they came with me in the same train and we stuck kind of together.</span> <span id="s1136">He found out he had TB and I had TB, so we were kind of, there was a bonding.</span> <span id="s1137">If you have nobody, your friends become your relatives.</span> <span id="s1138">You’re bonding, it’s true.</span> <span id="s1139">And we could speak openly, you know, that is their opinion.</span> <span id="s1140">And I value their opinion.</span> <span id="s1141">I don’t say that they were wrong.</span> <span id="s1142">I really didn’t know, maybe I was mixed up and didn’t know what was right or wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Did they come to your wedding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Yes, yes, ironically they came to my wedding, too.</span> <span id="s1145">In fact, one was the best man, Trebletski (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: What kind of wedding did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: As little bitty as we could.</span> <span id="s1148">It was not very much.</span> <span id="s1149">We went only to the Justice of Peace.</span> <span id="s1150">You know.</span> <span id="s1151">And he said, “You are man and wife.”</span> <span id="s1152">So, we made a little bit, what we could get at that time.</span> <span id="s1153">It was not very much.</span> <span id="s1154">But it was… like the style you would say was very poor, but it was fine.</span> <span id="s1155">I got the bride anyway.</span> <span id="s1156">(Laughing.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Right, that’s what matters.</span> <span id="s1158">Did you talk before hand about, I imagine you did, about what you were going to do as far as religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Well, sure.</span> <span id="s1160">My wife is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1161">And I figured with the kids, it would not be fair for me and she would not make a good Jew anyway.</span> <span id="s1162">It is only because to please somebody, like I would not make a good Catholic.</span> <span id="s1163">Doesn’t mean that I hate the Catholics, by no means not.</span> <span id="s1164">But my kids got to choose what they want to.</span> <span id="s1165">Like Janet, she goes always on the holidays she goes with me to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1166">And my oldest daughter, she lives in Barrington, in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1167">She does a lot.</span> <span id="s1168">And what I’m mostly proud is that they’re all involved in the Holocaust survivors, the second generation.</span> <span id="s1169">They’re active.</span> <span id="s1170">It is not that they hate.</span> <span id="s1171">It is not to let people forget, look here what happens.</span> <span id="s1172">You cannot make it back.</span> <span id="s1173">I cannot turn the clock back.</span> <span id="s1174">But we can let the people know what hatred can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: So, at that point, religion, which had been important to you before the war was not as important to you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: No, I saw what people, if they become fanatic.</span> <span id="s1177">And you start to put religion in front, then you lose your sight.</span> <span id="s1178">You have to first see, and really what’s good when you are religious and go pray and don’t live up to it.</span> <span id="s1179">I call them the hypocrites.</span> <span id="s1180">So you have to have it in the heart and nothing else.</span> <span id="s1181">And nobody can force you to be something.</span> <span id="s1182">If you don’t have it, you don’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Why did you want to leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Because I didn’t want my kids to be exposed anymore.</span> <span id="s1185">And truthfully, very truthfully, I didn’t want them to get married there and be there, you know?</span> <span id="s1186">I wanted them really to get away.</span> <span id="s1187">That is really my, to give you the best answer what I know, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: So you didn’t necessarily feel fully trusting of Germany and the German people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Yeah, but, I feel trusting, but if you get wounded, a scar is there.</span> <span id="s1190">Okay?</span> <span id="s1191">I had the scar.</span> <span id="s1192">But that doesn’t mean that can function perfect yet.</span> <span id="s1193">You’ve got now a lot of Jewish people that come from Israel, even, they live, and a lot of them from Russia.</span> <span id="s1194">You know, but for me, was too much experience and I didn’t want to rub salt in the wounds.</span> <span id="s1195">You know, I want to stay away.</span> <span id="s1196">Maybe it was the easiest way out.</span> <span id="s1197">I don’t know it.</span> <span id="s1198">This is just what I felt, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Was talking… during those years just following the war, was talking about what had, what had happened to you, and about your past and about your feelings about losing your family… was that important to you?</span> <span id="s1200">And was it a critical part of your relationship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: It is still very important to me.</span> <span id="s1202">In order to clear the air, you have to get everything on the table and then you can go on.</span> <span id="s1203">If you play a game, it will be still there.</span> <span id="s1204">Can’t do it.</span> <span id="s1205">So, yes it is fine.</span> <span id="s1206">In fact my wife now, “Why do you watch all that?”</span> <span id="s1207">I say, I still have to watch it.</span> <span id="s1208">It brings back bad memories, but you still have to go on, and not forget it.</span> <span id="s1209">I will not forget it regardless, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Did you have… I’m sorry, let me stop and flip the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">End of Tape 2, Side A Tape 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: You mean both sides?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Being here, and after liberation, how I felt… being a little boy…</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Yeah, well, it’s so complicated, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s1215">To try to think of what came before, and what…</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Life is complicated.</span> <span id="s1217">You know it.</span> <span id="s1218">You have only to learn to make the best right away.</span> <span id="s1219">You have to learn not to let it go, let it get to you, the teflon mentality, because otherwise you get soaked on with it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: The which mentality?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: The teflon mentality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: I thought that was what you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: You’ve got to, because otherwise what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s1224">You know.</span> <span id="s1225">It’s part of the Bible, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Well, I appreciate you taking the time to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Any time, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: You just mentioned something about other interviews.</span> <span id="s1229">I wondered, have you been interviewed?</span> <span id="s1230">Have you done other interviews besides…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Only for Shoah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Uh huh, Shoah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: And then came a lady, she did interviews for that, but besides she did it for herself, too.</span> <span id="s1234">So, I got another interview.</span> <span id="s1235">And then I had a few speeches for the… you know, when it’s the Shoah.</span> <span id="s1236">So I went and I spoke a little.</span> <span id="s1237">It is not as easy as you think, when you see so many thousands of people.</span> <span id="s1238">And to show, you know, your people and show _________.</span> <span id="s1239">I can speak about everything, I have no problem.</span> <span id="s1240">But this is hard.</span> <span id="s1241">And then you don’t want to show your emotions.</span> <span id="s1242">The emotions come, you know it?</span> <span id="s1243">So you know, this was the… you have to do it, what you have to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Yeah, I wondered whether when you first started, when you first had the experience of trying to systematically tell the story of your experiences, whether that was a powerful experience for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: It was.</span> <span id="s1246">It was for me and it was for the other people, too.</span> <span id="s1247">You know it.</span> <span id="s1248">Because, you know, it’s really nothing to make you happy, basically, and nothing to be proud of, you know, it’s part of what you went through.</span> <span id="s1249">And you have to do it.</span> <span id="s1250">I told myself in concentration, if I survive and I can do something, I will go out and not tell the people, I will scream to the people.</span> <span id="s1251">But the real world is different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: You mentioned that two of, was it two of your children were born in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Ya, my oldest one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: What’s your oldest one’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Bluma, is after my mother’s name.</span> <span id="s1256">Yeah, she was born in 1948.</span> <span id="s1257">In July, no in June.</span> <span id="s1258">And my son is born in July.</span> <span id="s1259">His name is Ben, you know it, and he was born in July, in 1954.</span> <span id="s1260">And Janet, the youngest is when we came to the United States, my wife found out she is pregnant and then Janet, she was born here.</span> <span id="s1261">That was in 1957.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: What made you want to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: To get away and to be a free person, you know.</span> <span id="s1264">To be free.</span> <span id="s1265">I knew always.</span> <span id="s1266">The United States, sure there’s people like KKK, you know, but most people, they are not from here, they understand if somebody is nice to me, what do I care if he’s an Arab, or ________ but he’s nice to me.</span> <span id="s1267">Like my neighbor, Scotty, you know it, we’ve already forty years to go.</span> <span id="s1268">And we always used to go, when we were younger, together out.</span> <span id="s1269">You know, so, it’s too much of a mixture to undo it.</span> <span id="s1270">And in Europe, you’ve got only two religions.</span> <span id="s1271">Say, go to Ireland.</span> <span id="s1272">It was Catholic, only one is Roman Catholic and the other one is Protestant and they hate each other, you know.</span> <span id="s1273">So when you got a minority, you know, it’s only two, always will be the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: So, it appealed to you to come to a place that had a real mixture of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: That’s right, people understand different culture, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1276">People are more tolerant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Is that why the United States appealed to you more than Israel, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Israel appealed to me very much, but first thing, you know, I was too sick.</span> <span id="s1279">I would have to stay much longer and then go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1280">And I knew in Israel I would have to work much harder and that the climate is much more, you know, it’s warmer and hotter.</span> <span id="s1281">So, if I had, had another choice, I would go to Israel, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Did your wife have any feeling about where she wanted to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: My wife really wanted to stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s1284">And I told her about the kids and everything.</span> <span id="s1285">She says, okay, then we try and if I don’t like it, you can always go back.</span> <span id="s1286">The worst thing in life is when people don’t try.</span> <span id="s1287">And you don’t know, you don’t know your potential.</span> <span id="s1288">You don’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s1289">You have to be willing to take risk and try in your life.</span> <span id="s1290">And if it didn’t go right, don’t blame nobody.</span> <span id="s1291">Pick up the pieces and keep on going.</span> <span id="s1292">But that’s life things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Did you have relatives in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Yes, I had relatives, but they was very, very far, you know.</span> <span id="s1295">From my grandmother, had a sister, they lived in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1296">And when we came there, they were so nice and they tried to help you.</span> <span id="s1297">But really, what you can help, is help yourself by doing… you know.</span> <span id="s1298">But they were nice, in fact, we correspond a lot, a long time.</span> <span id="s1299">He just died, he was 88 or something, you know, you get old.</span> <span id="s1300">He had two children.</span> <span id="s1301">In fact, his daughter came to visit us, you know.</span> <span id="s1302">I got now relatives.</span> <span id="s1303">I got a cousin and he came from Israel.</span> <span id="s1304">But still __________, from my grandmother, she had another sister and she went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1305">The name was Goldstein.</span> <span id="s1306">And after 1947, he wanted to study engineering here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1307">And he really told me in his mind was to, cooling systems, because they need… but when he came and he studied here, he went to Berkeley.</span> <span id="s1308">He got approached by the Bechtel Corporation, if he wanted to take atomic engineering.</span> <span id="s1309">He said, I don’t know nothing about it.</span> <span id="s1310">They say, we will put you through college and everything.</span> <span id="s1311">So, he went and studied atomic engineering.</span> <span id="s1312">In fact, he is now, he’s built so many reactors, and you know?</span> <span id="s1313">And then he taught at Berkeley too for a while.</span> <span id="s1314">But even nowadays, retired… his name is Golan (ph) now, from Goldstein changed.</span> <span id="s1315">He still likes _________, like… when it was in Russia, when the explosion was in the, what was name is it?</span> <span id="s1316">They went there to see what they can do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Chernobyl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Chernobyl, ya.</span> <span id="s1319">So they still, like last week, he went to Paris, they have all this, scientists.</span> <span id="s1320">In fact, two months ago we went to visit him.</span> <span id="s1321">He lives in San Francisco.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: What’s his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Simcha.</span> <span id="s1324">Simcha in Jewish means happiness and the last name is Golan from Goldstein.</span> <span id="s1325">Ya, he was here visiting.</span> <span id="s1326">You know, it’s family, so we stay close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: How is he related to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: My grandmother had, she was the oldest and she had five sisters.</span> <span id="s1329">And one went to the United States, one went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1330">One, she lived in Lodz and went together in the same train with my mother and my grandmother to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1331">And she left a son, he ran away.</span> <span id="s1332">She had a few kids, but they all went together.</span> <span id="s1333">He survived and he lives now in New York.</span> <span id="s1334">And one lived in Warsaw with the _________, he was Rudja (ph), he was the youngest one of them.</span> <span id="s1335">From these two, later on when you have no family, you look and whatever you can find.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Did you know very much about the United States when, before you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: I knew quite a bit, but what you knew as a boy, it’s completely different, you know.</span> <span id="s1338">I read Jack London and had dreams and all kinds of junk, you know it.</span> <span id="s1339">It’s completely different.</span> <span id="s1340">But later on, I thought you know it.</span> <span id="s1341">A place if I would like to go.</span> <span id="s1342">I would like to go really to the United State.</span> <span id="s1343">And we spoke fairly a little bit English already.</span> <span id="s1344">We knew more than the average.</span> <span id="s1345">When we needed some oil, we could buy oil and we didn’t come home with vinegar.</span> <span id="s1346">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1347">You know, __________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: So, your wife also didn’t speak very much English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Yeah, she didn’t speak very much, but we understood.</span> <span id="s1350">We took lessons.</span> <span id="s1351">We prepared ourselves a little bit, because we had time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Did you have an idea of what you would do once you were here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: No, I told you, I wanted to go in chemistry.</span> <span id="s1356">But most of them, like here when I came, they couldn’t hire me, because I was a citizen… I was not a citizen.</span> <span id="s1357">So, I got my first paid job for a person who made glasses.</span> <span id="s1358">For a dollar an hour, and then it worked out and I liked it.</span> <span id="s1359">Now, we got the 20/20 Eye Care store.</span> <span id="s1360">We’re doing very good.</span> <span id="s1361">If you feel you like it, you try it.</span> <span id="s1362">And if you don’t succeed, try it again, get stubborn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: What were your initial experiences or your first impressions of the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: It was always… oh!</span> <span id="s1365">When I got my first paycheck and, you know, you are not spoiled.</span> <span id="s1366">And you can buy so many things.</span> <span id="s1367">And it’s a free world.</span> <span id="s1368">We lived on, you don’t know it here, St. Catherine Street, you know it.</span> <span id="s1369">And you hear the bells from the church ringing.</span> <span id="s1370">And the sunshine’s nicer when you like it, you know.</span> <span id="s1371">And we lived near a park and we took the kids to the park.</span> <span id="s1372">It was nice.</span> <span id="s1373">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1374">We loved it right away.</span> <span id="s1375">Even if we didn’t have nothing, but we loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: But you didn’t come straight to Louisville, right?</span> <span id="s1377">You were in…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: I was first in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1379">And in Philadelphia I didn’t like it, only because my wife got pregnant, was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1380">In Germany we had the best hospital, the best everything.</span> <span id="s1381">And since I worked for IG Farben, I could get anyplace, you know it, they had always.</span> <span id="s1382">And we had a nice home.</span> <span id="s1383">So it was an adjustment.</span> <span id="s1384">Like the garbage emptied only one time in a week and was standing around.</span> <span id="s1385">And we was in a hotel, very old.</span> <span id="s1386">The Gladstone (ph) Hotel, I remember this.</span> <span id="s1387">We was maybe on the 17 or 20th floor, but when you want to see what kind of weather, you have to open the window, everything was dusty.</span> <span id="s1388">I didn’t care for it, particularly, but… I had this one friend, Colrink (ph).</span> <span id="s1389">And he says, “Abe, if you want to come here, I’m working for Ford Motor Company.</span> <span id="s1390">I can get you there a job.”</span> <span id="s1391">So, I came to Louisville.</span> <span id="s1392">First I came and I said to my wife, “If I get the job, I gave you and, you know, call you up, and you come with the kids.”</span> <span id="s1393">Well even then you don’t react.</span> <span id="s1394">You’ve got all this luggage, pregnant, two kids, you know, ____________.</span> <span id="s1395">But that was what we did.</span> <span id="s1396">So we stayed in… we came over here.</span> <span id="s1397">We rented an apartment.</span> <span id="s1398">And here it was different.</span> <span id="s1399">It’s a smaller city, everything was organized.</span> <span id="s1400">I worked for Ford Motor Company and at that time made about 100 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1401">My gosh, I could for ten dollars, load up so much groceries I couldn’t even carry it, you know.</span> <span id="s1402">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Did you have any knowledge about Louisville at the time?</span> <span id="s1404">Or what you might have expected?</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: I didn’t even know that Louisville exist.</span> <span id="s1406">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: So, you couldn’t have any prejudices against it, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s1409">No, I did not.</span> <span id="s1410">But it’s still a nice city.</span> <span id="s1411">People are nice.</span> <span id="s1412">I like it.</span> <span id="s1413">In fact, my daughter, she went to Lexington.</span> <span id="s1414">She went to Law School.</span> <span id="s1415">She went to Lexington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: During this time when you’re beginning to rebuild your life, did you take time to mourn what you had lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: No, you took later on.</span> <span id="s1418">From the beginning, you couldn’t even tell nobody.</span> <span id="s1419">People wouldn’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1420">They thought that you are freaks.</span> <span id="s1421">They tried to stay away from you, you know it.</span> <span id="s1422">You didn’t act like the people here.</span> <span id="s1423">In fact, it was hard on the kids, too, you know.</span> <span id="s1424">We didn’t speak any perfect English, you know.</span> <span id="s1425">It was hard, but we knew that we would catch up.</span> <span id="s1426">First you have to have a footage and then you get time.</span> <span id="s1427">No, not from the beginning, but later on, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: When were you able to take time to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: When I saw… I went to the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s1430">We took the kids.</span> <span id="s1431">Later on when I quit, not I quit, they quit me from Ford Motor Company, because they laid off the whole second shift.</span> <span id="s1432">And I went to work for dispenser Eli Jaffe (ph).</span> <span id="s1433">He was Jewish, so I could at least speak with him.</span> <span id="s1434">How well you can speak to somebody else.</span> <span id="s1435">So, it takes, it’s a slowly thing.</span> <span id="s1436">It doesn’t come overnight.</span> <span id="s1437">It does not, you know.</span> <span id="s1438">And then you didn’t want to offend nobody.</span> <span id="s1439">You didn’t know how the people would react, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Did people ask you about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: If you don’t tell, nobody will ask me.</span> <span id="s1442">And I didn’t tell from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1443">It’s only the last, you know, about ten years ago.</span> <span id="s1444">No, we went, ten years, we went to Washington.</span> <span id="s1445">Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1446">So, maybe about 15 years, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: And how was the Louisville Jewish community?</span> <span id="s1448">Did you become involved with people here?</span> <span id="s1449">Jewish people in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Ya, I came involved.</span> <span id="s1451">But still, they in that time didn’t want to hear it either.</span> <span id="s1452">In order to find a listener, somebody has to listen, you know.</span> <span id="s1453">So, until later on when they found out that we are not lying, that such things exist.</span> <span id="s1454">A lot of people didn’t want to believe that such exists, you know.</span> <span id="s1455">So, it took a while.</span> <span id="s1456">I don’t know how long.</span> <span id="s1457">But I know it took a long time, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: So, when you met people and they knew that you were from Europe, they just would, they wouldn’t ask you where you came from, anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1460">In fact, when you interview people now, they will tell you the same thing.</span> <span id="s1461">They had a very hard time to communicate with them, you know it.</span> <span id="s1462">Because you was different.</span> <span id="s1463">They had their problems, they didn’t want to hear my problems, even it was not a problem no more.</span> <span id="s1464">Still sooner or later, you know… it was not overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: It seems like that would have made it difficult to form relationships, trusting friendships.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: It was not.</span> <span id="s1467">Somewhere, I’m already better than 90 percent, because I’m easy trusting, so I have no problems.</span> <span id="s1468">But a lot of them, they couldn’t trust, they still cannot trust.</span> <span id="s1469">And in fact, I cannot blame them.</span> <span id="s1470">They are different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Did you start meeting people who were Holocaust survivors in the Louisville area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Yeah, that was the first, you start to look for somebody what you got something in common.</span> <span id="s1473">And people what came mostly, you know, we call them the greenah (ph).</span> <span id="s1474">You know the green people.</span> <span id="s1475">That was the Holocaust survivors who are, you know.</span> <span id="s1476">And then you want to show to the people that you aren’t a loser.</span> <span id="s1477">That is not true, what they said, you know.</span> <span id="s1478">Then you try to work harder than the other one, you want to be better than the other.</span> <span id="s1479">You try to… you know it.</span> <span id="s1480">The kids didn’t understand it, but it was true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: So there was some competition going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Not between the other ones, no.</span> <span id="s1483">Between… I try to prove to the other world, that I am not really, one what they think I am, you know?</span> <span id="s1484">And then you’ve got a guilt feeling too.</span> <span id="s1485">They think, “My gosh he survived, how many people did he kill in order to survive?</span> <span id="s1486">How come the other ones didn’t survive and he survived?”</span> <span id="s1487">So, there was a guilt feeling, too, you know.</span> <span id="s1488">How come I survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: You felt like people were judging you for surviving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: I judged myself and other people judged me, too, you know it.</span> <span id="s1491">I must have been very bad, when the other ones didn’t survive and I did, you know.</span> <span id="s1492">So, you got the double whammy.</span> <span id="s1493">(laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Was there any kind of formal meeting of Holocaust survivors in Louisville?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: No… they lived here and they tried to share, it was a little bit longer than I am, where they shop, and then we bought some records, from old country.</span> <span id="s1496">Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1497">I still like to listen to them, you know, and we formed a world within ourselves.</span> <span id="s1498">But you cannot live in this world, because there is no walls.</span> <span id="s1499">And certain people they still live with it, you know, they don’t speak much English.</span> <span id="s1500">They don’t trust other ones.</span> <span id="s1501">And in this case I did much, much better than the other ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: How did you find the other people?</span> <span id="s1503">Was it through the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: Right, through the Jewish community center.</span> <span id="s1505">And then when one found out, he told the other one, so you knew them right away.</span> <span id="s1506">Word got very fast out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: So, were your meetings usually just one on one or did you ever gather at the…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Oh, we went to the Jewish Community Center, for example, you met them there.</span> <span id="s1509">And if you liked somebody, you invite them to your house or they invite you.</span> <span id="s1510">You cannot like everybody the same way.</span> <span id="s1511">God didn’t meant it to be this.</span> <span id="s1512">You know?</span> <span id="s1513">Somehow the chemistry has to match.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Were you aware of other things going on in Louisville at the time that you moved here?</span> <span id="s1515">Such as Civil Rights movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Oh yeah, I could read the paper and I read the paper.</span> <span id="s1517">And I was completely on their side, you know it.</span> <span id="s1518">Because it’s more than fair, those people.</span> <span id="s1519">In fact, I found out then, the German prisoners of war could go in places where they couldn’t, when they were fighting for the United States.</span> <span id="s1520">To me it didn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s1521">Oh yes, and the one thing about our kids, we do not hate, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Did you see a parallel in the situation, between the situation of the blacks in the United States and the Jews of Europe?</span> <span id="s1523">Of course, they’re not at all the same.</span> <span id="s1524">But did you see the issue of racism as being…</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: The Jews had the advantage in this case.</span> <span id="s1526">Because a lot of them don’t look like blacks, so they don’t judge them, you know it.</span> <span id="s1527">So, if they want to beat up, it was first the black and then the Jew.</span> <span id="s1528">They didn’t hate him, they didn’t like him, but they didn’t know it, you know, what you did.</span> <span id="s1529">So… __________.</span> <span id="s1530">Yes, if somebody will come to you and tells you, “I hate blacks,” you know automatically he will hate you.</span> <span id="s1531">Or somebody, I hate something for some reason, then you know this man or this woman put their mind on hating or looking for excuses, because they are a failure and therefore they hate.</span> <span id="s1532">There is no reason.</span> <span id="s1533">If you want to be, it is an open country, you can do much better, work harder.</span> <span id="s1534">We came in ‘57, you know.</span> <span id="s1535">In 1960, we bought the house.</span> <span id="s1536">We worked hard.</span> <span id="s1537">We couldn’t maybe have afford it in that time, oh I could afford later on might be, but it doesn’t mean the kids… you know.</span> <span id="s1538">But, and if I say “Ooh, I’m living a lifetime here and can’t afford it.”</span> <span id="s1539">Yes, if you go out and spend your paycheck, then you can’t afford it.</span> <span id="s1540">You have to know it, what you got, and then they have a goal, what you want to __________.</span> <span id="s1541">Do I want to go and drink it away or do something, you know, you can do it.</span> <span id="s1542">You have to balance your money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Did you experience anti-Semitism in Louisville at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Really, really, no, you know.</span> <span id="s1545">At first here where I live there is no Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1546">No, I did not, to be truthful, no.</span> <span id="s1547">And in business, where I had a Jewish boss, or here when I do this.</span> <span id="s1548">I tell them, you know, I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s1549">But they work for us, so I don’t think somebody would go out and… no.</span> <span id="s1550">But we treat them right.</span> <span id="s1551">If we don’t give them a choice to be not to.</span> <span id="s1552">You know, we give them health care, and a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1553">I know what it means to make a very dedicated employee.</span> <span id="s1554">There is no one way street.</span> <span id="s1555">You cannot exploit somebody and tell them I’m your friend.</span> <span id="s1556">It doesn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood when you first arrived in Louisville?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: No.</span> <span id="s1559">I lived on St. Catherine Street, which wasn’t a Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1560">I tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s1561">Sometimes it crossed my mind, why don’t you go move near the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s1562">But then I thought, you know what, sometimes it is better when you stay away, even when you go up, you climb.</span> <span id="s1563">The higher you go, the more you can observe.</span> <span id="s1564">You know it.</span> <span id="s1565">So I say if I want to go, I can go there, I don’t have to live there, you know.</span> <span id="s1566">Back in the ghetto, they created their own ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: Do you, how have you, how do you feel about living in Kentucky?</span> <span id="s1568">Do you, do you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: It’s a very nice state.</span> <span id="s1570">And you got equal opportunity and it is not like a Southern state, now I know more about states.</span> <span id="s1571">People are different here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: How are they different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: They’re more tolerant.</span> <span id="s1574">They’re much more tolerant.</span> <span id="s1575">Sometimes in life you develop, something what you can judge already, called instinct.</span> <span id="s1576">I might not be always right, but sometimes my instinct is right, you know.</span> <span id="s1577">So, I know it is in there.</span> <span id="s1578">If I go to New York, hustle, bustle, too much running, going to work so long and coming home, you have no time to spend with the family.</span> <span id="s1579">Here you are right close to everything, you have more time to spend with the family, I think.</span> <span id="s1580">To bring up children, regardless, Louisville is a nice city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Do you travel around elsewhere in the state at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1583">We got stores, you know, but this is stores, but otherwise, yes.</span> <span id="s1584">We go in state and out of state.</span> <span id="s1585">Yes, we do a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1586">But sometimes I combine my work, you know.</span> <span id="s1587">We got in Elizabethtown, a store, we got in Litchfield, a store, we got in Jeffersonville, a store, you know.</span> <span id="s1588">We’ll go around and, you know, talk with the people.</span> <span id="s1589">See, I’m 75 years old already.</span> <span id="s1590">Have to be thankful for a lot of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: You must enjoy your work a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: I enjoy my freedom.</span> <span id="s1593">It is not so much the work, as I enjoy talking to people.</span> <span id="s1594">And this what I like about uptakes (ph), you try their glasses, you can talk to them.</span> <span id="s1595">I always enjoy talking to people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: Do your employees know anything about your history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Do they ask you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: In fact, yes, a few times.</span> <span id="s1600">Some of them came when I had, told them I’m speaking, if you want to… And everyone knows everybody and we got a lot of black people, they got to high positions, and they’re doing good.</span> <span id="s1601">To me, it is a person.</span> <span id="s1602">Because we got here in Fern Creek one and he is a very good employee.</span> <span id="s1603">And my wife says, “Why do you take the ______________, and unfortunately people are prejudiced.”</span> <span id="s1604">I said, “You know I came from Poland.</span> <span id="s1605">They hated the Jews, but every Pole had his own Jew.”</span> <span id="s1606">You know, they come and ask more for them, they ask for me.</span> <span id="s1607">You know, they’re good.</span> <span id="s1608">What does they care, when they go out, and they see the glasses is good and he’s nice to them, after a while they forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: And what do your employees think?</span> <span id="s1610">Do they tell you what they think of knowing something about your past?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: If you want to go this way, they all will be nice, but I know deep inside, you know what, I don’t give them a chance not to be nice.</span> <span id="s1612">I’m very nice to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: They haven’t talked… have they talked to you directly about your Holocaust history?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: Some yes, some of them didn’t, don’t even know the subject.</span> <span id="s1615">We’ve got a lot of young kids, 20, 25, you know, you cannot put it up on them anyway, even if I would want to, you know.</span> <span id="s1616">They’ve got their struggles.</span> <span id="s1617">They’re married.</span> <span id="s1618">Especially now, when two people go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Part of the reason I’m asking is that I think people have in recent years, become so much more aware of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1620">And young people have become so interested…</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: I saw it on television and I thought so.</span> <span id="s1622">And they know my feelings, they will come and tell me, yes, you know.</span> <span id="s1623">But otherwise I will not go there.</span> <span id="s1624">If they do not approach me, I will not approach them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: What kind of responses have you gotten from people, when they’ve heard you talk, for example at the Shoah day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Oh, very, very nice.</span> <span id="s1627">People are different, you know, they got their own struggle.</span> <span id="s1628">And they see on television what you went through and now you’ve got the Bosnia and you’ve got this.</span> <span id="s1629">So, you know it.</span> <span id="s1630">And now you’ve got in Russia, you’ve got a powder keg, too.</span> <span id="s1631">You know, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">End of Tape 2, Side B Tape 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: This is tape number three, side A of an interview with Abe Jakubowicz.</span> <span id="s1634">When did you become a citizen of the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: After being five years here, exactly, you know it.</span> <span id="s1636">We came in ‘57, 1962.</span> <span id="s1637">Yeah, we didn’t wait very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: Was that a significant, important occasion for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: Very, very much.</span> <span id="s1640">Now you feel, you saw this, yesterday, Kruschev’s son became an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1641">And they asked him about it.</span> <span id="s1642">He said it is a big honor.</span> <span id="s1643">So, me a poor, Jewish guy got it, it’s a very big honor, yes.</span> <span id="s1644">You know, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: Can you recall some of your feelings at the time?</span> <span id="s1646">Your thoughts and feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: I felt like I am a part of the family.</span> <span id="s1648">The circle is now getting closed.</span> <span id="s1649">What’s gone, you cannot forget it, but now I’m a part of everything.</span> <span id="s1650">I’m a citizen.</span> <span id="s1651">I represent the United States and I know I will make a good citizen.</span> <span id="s1652">I knew it at that time, you know it.</span> <span id="s1653">I think I made a very good citizen, you know.</span> <span id="s1654">We’re involved in a lot of things, you know, so we’re doing it.</span> <span id="s1655">We’re paying back to society, too.</span> <span id="s1656">You have to and it’s much nicer to pay back than receive, much nicer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: A lot of people don’t see it that way.</span> <span id="s1658">(Laughing.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: Yeah, if you need everything, all what you see, the things what I need.</span> <span id="s1660">But you never see the reward, you know, in giving.</span> <span id="s1661">That’s why I always say the poor has one thing that he can afford.</span> <span id="s1662">You know, the reward of giving.</span> <span id="s1663">And giving is very, very important.</span> <span id="s1664">We got raised even as a child, you know, that you have to collect more to help the other ones.</span> <span id="s1665">We call it Schtucka (ph), you know it.</span> <span id="s1666">So to me it is _____________ you, it is always you are there.</span> <span id="s1667">If I were to take a job for an hour, for a dollar an hour, I’m ordered not to get it.</span> <span id="s1668">You know.</span> <span id="s1669">Because I saw there’s other people that need it more.</span> <span id="s1670">You know, but it’s nice, a good feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Do you still, do you observe…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: High holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: …high holidays and do you go at any other time, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: No, any other time, no, but the high holidays, I’m going.</span> <span id="s1675">And the main thing what I’m going to is because that they have a prayer for the death, you know it.</span> <span id="s1676">And that’s the only one thing, I know that I can’t help them, but at least I can be with them in my mind.</span> <span id="s1677">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: How much of a role in your daily life does that memory play?</span> <span id="s1679">Is it there always with you every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: Oh, I have to be thankful always, every day to my mother, to my father, give me life.</span> <span id="s1681">They taught me what’s right and wrong.</span> <span id="s1682">And they were good to me, really good to me, you know.</span> <span id="s1683">Yes, I think of them, in fact, I got their picture hanging where my bed is.</span> <span id="s1684">To me, because we know everybody has to die, period.</span> <span id="s1685">But they got taken away this way, to me they are still the two young people, you know, my brother, it’s different.</span> <span id="s1686">Yes, it plays… they still, if you see your mother die or father.</span> <span id="s1687">They’re old, they’re 80 years old and we know everybody can die.</span> <span id="s1688">And they get wrinkled.</span> <span id="s1689">I saw them only as young people.</span> <span id="s1690">You know, so maybe it’s a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: You mentioned that it was maybe ten or 15 years ago that you really started talking about your…</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Because nobody wanted to listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: What happened ten or 15 years ago that made you start?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: They came out with the Holocaust survival.</span> <span id="s1695">They showed movies.</span> <span id="s1696">People suddenly started realizing, you know.</span> <span id="s1697">And not only the other people.</span> <span id="s1698">Jewish people didn’t want to listen, too.</span> <span id="s1699">You know I speak about people.</span> <span id="s1700">And you cannot speak when nobody listens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: Do you remember any particular events or incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: I don’t know it, because it’s so many events, but suddenly something clicks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: I was wondering, just going back for a minute to the issue of when you became an American citizen, and you talked about how important that was to you.</span> <span id="s1704">You work a lot with young people, young Americans in your work and I was wondering if you see, if you see people as taking, young people as taking that too lightly… because I think, or taking it for granted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: I speak to schools, a lot of the time, I get invited by a school.</span> <span id="s1706">And the young kids.</span> <span id="s1707">And I will say, we don’t give them enough credit.</span> <span id="s1708">Surely they got now the pressure, they got now more divorces, where parents go to work and it’s harder.</span> <span id="s1709">Surely when you have a little bit money, you send them in private schools.</span> <span id="s1710">But I will say, if you are open when you speak to them, they can absorb as good as anybody else.</span> <span id="s1711">But you need guidance, you know.</span> <span id="s1712">We didn’t have so many things when I was, I tell you I wouldn’t have done it.</span> <span id="s1713">We didn’t have drugs.</span> <span id="s1714">I didn’t even know such things exist, you know it.</span> <span id="s1715">We didn’t have a lot of things, so how in the world can I judge and tell them they are bad?</span> <span id="s1716">They are not.</span> <span id="s1717">My kids are good.</span> <span id="s1718">Their kids are good.</span> <span id="s1719">Sometimes you are lucky.</span> <span id="s1720">They hang out with the wrong people… you have to control it, which rooms they go.</span> <span id="s1721">You form only one opinion, but you have to trust your kids.</span> <span id="s1722">And watch out with whom they go.</span> <span id="s1723">It is very important.</span> <span id="s1724">And I will say it again, and if a child makes wrong, don’t tell him he’s dumb, he’s stupid.</span> <span id="s1725">Tell him that he made a mistake, but you’re always there, because I know my mother would be there, you know.</span> <span id="s1726">This way you don’t break off the communication.</span> <span id="s1727">I wonder sometimes how come all this homeless people come from, you know.</span> <span id="s1728">Don’t they have a family?</span> <span id="s1729">Don’t they… everything, you know?</span> <span id="s1730">And I have no answer for it.</span> <span id="s1731">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: You mentioned earlier that your children have been interested in Holocaust remembrance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Yeah, in fact they belong to the second generation.</span> <span id="s1734">How?</span> <span id="s1735">It’s the same thing, it’s nothing what you can change, but we can promote, you know, that people should listen what had happened.</span> <span id="s1736">Changing, we cannot, because a lot of people don’t even believe that such a thing existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: Did you talk to them about your past, your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: Oh yeah, surely, my kids have very open minded, you can talk to them.</span> <span id="s1739">You know, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: When they were children did you tell them about their…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: Very little children, you can’t, because you break their growing up period and you put something in it, what they will have a hard time.</span> <span id="s1742">When you have formed your opinion, when you are grown up, then it is different.</span> <span id="s1743">At least I feel about it this way.</span> <span id="s1744">Not that I’m right in everything.</span> <span id="s1745">I’m wrong in a lot of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: Has that been something that they’ve been particularly interested in learning about from you?</span> <span id="s1747">Do they ask you a lot of questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: Oh, I can do nothing wrong.</span> <span id="s1749">I am the greatest in their eyes.</span> <span id="s1750">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1751">No.</span> <span id="s1752">No, if they have something, they ask me, you know.</span> <span id="s1753">Or even Jessica, you know, she goes now… I have one granddaughter, she goes to Berrington.</span> <span id="s1754">She told me she would like me to speak for the class in Berrington, Illinois, you know.</span> <span id="s1755">So, I think I got a lot of letters and all kinds of things from them, what they spoke about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: It must be very gratifying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: It is gratifying, you know it.</span> <span id="s1758">Especially when you don’t expect a lot, then it’s double gratifying.</span> <span id="s1759">If I would expect, then it’s something different, you know.</span> <span id="s1760">But I don’t and it’s double gratifying.</span> <span id="s1761">My youngest, she goes now to Purdue, she got accepted there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: Your granddaughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: How many grandchildren do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: Seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: And what are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: Richard, Ben, then comes Jamie and Josh – we’ve got a lot of J’s, and Jessica and Jacob.</span> <span id="s1768">See, a lot of J’s.</span> <span id="s1769">And there’s my daughter, Janet.</span> <span id="s1770">(Laughing.)</span> <span id="s1771">You know, so we’ve got a lot of J’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: Richard, Ben, Josh, Jacob, Janet, Jessica?</span> <span id="s1773">No, not Janet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: No, Jessica and then we got Jacob and then we got the little baby, she’s just born.</span> <span id="s1775">She’s one year old, name is Edie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: Is there anything else you want to add today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: It was a pleasure to meet you.</span> <span id="s1778">(Laughing.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: It was pleasure to meet you, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: You ask me all kinds of questions.</span> <span id="s1781">What can I do, I don’t know it.</span> <span id="s1782">You know.</span> <span id="s1783">Keep on doing the good work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: One thing I didn’t ask you about, I haven’t quite figured out how to phrase the question, but it’s so impressive that you came with nothing to this country, not even being able to speak the language.</span> <span id="s1785">And how many, how many eye care stores do you own now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: Five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: We could have owned more, but we have to go slow, you know it.</span> <span id="s1789">You know, and I did it more for my kids, they are doing it now.</span> <span id="s1790">I’m only a, you know, checking… at 75 you can’t do very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: And you live in this very lovely house.</span> <span id="s1792">So, it’s just very impressive that you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: Yeah, you know it is livable.</span> <span id="s1794">My wife would like to move out.</span> <span id="s1795">But I figure, you know, 75, where do I want to go, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: How do you, do you wonder about that or do you think about how it is that somebody can go from having so little to just building up so…</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: Oh, some people got it even better.</span> <span id="s1798">No, it is, in life, as I told you, you have to take risks.</span> <span id="s1799">You try to do good and be fair with everybody.</span> <span id="s1800">You got friends, you know it.</span> <span id="s1801">And when you have this, they will support you.</span> <span id="s1802">You cannot go through the world alone, you know it, you need friends.</span> <span id="s1803">You need family, you know.</span> <span id="s1804">And then you take a risk and when you lose, you didn’t lose everything, you made a wrong judgment.</span> <span id="s1805">So as in life with the kids, I told them a lot of times, when you make a mistake, so you made a mistake.</span> <span id="s1806">You know, pick yourself up and keep on going, but don’t brood on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: I didn’t ask you about your journey back.</span> <span id="s1808">I know that you made a journey back to…</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: …Poland.</span> <span id="s1811">And you talked some about it in your videotape, but I wondered if you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: Yeah, my kids, we decided we’d take the kids, Janet.</span> <span id="s1813">And they’re always busy now.</span> <span id="s1814">And Bluma would live in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1815">And Ben…</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: Whose idea was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Well, I would say my daughters’ more, because they want to keep on this relationship.</span> <span id="s1818">More my daughters, Janet and Bluma.</span> <span id="s1819">So we lived in, I told you, in Germany.</span> <span id="s1820">And my wife got a lot of relatives still in Germany.</span> <span id="s1821">So, we rented a car.</span> <span id="s1822">Going to Poland, you don’t get a car, because they say they steal it.</span> <span id="s1823">So, anyway we used all the relatives and we rented a car.</span> <span id="s1824">We flew into Frankfurt, from there we went to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1825">Czechoslovakia, why Czechoslo…, because Auschwitz is near the Czech border.</span> <span id="s1826">And Czech, it was just liberated, you know, the Russians.</span> <span id="s1827">And if you have money one time and want to have a nice trip, go to Prague.</span> <span id="s1828">It’s observed, the Germans didn’t bomb.</span> <span id="s1829">All the antiques are still there.</span> <span id="s1830">It’s a lot of culture.</span> <span id="s1831">So anyway, we went to Prague.</span> <span id="s1832">We stayed two days in Prague and then we went to Krakow.</span> <span id="s1833">Krakow is near Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1834">We went to stay the night in Auschwitz, at Krakow, then we drove into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1835">We stayed all day long.</span> <span id="s1836">And we had already made reservations in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1837">But we had a car, you know, we drove.</span> <span id="s1838">In Warsaw we made reservations at the hotel.</span> <span id="s1839">And then from Warsaw, we made all our journeys from there.</span> <span id="s1840">First we went to Grodzisk where I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: In 1992, I think or ‘91 or ‘92.</span> <span id="s1843">And the kids, we went in the same house.</span> <span id="s1844">You felt the hostility from the Poles, but give them a few dollars, it’s okay, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: How did you feel it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: First, they are afraid that you come here and you want to take the house away from them and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1847">And then you, let’s see, a lot of graffiti on the walls.</span> <span id="s1848">You know, I still speak perfect Polish.</span> <span id="s1849">So, I knew it.</span> <span id="s1850">But if you win their confidence, at least they are not so hostile, you don’t trust them, but you are ___________.</span> <span id="s1851">So, and this lady, I told her all I wanted was to show my kids where my mother lived, where my father lived, you know, and I give her a few dollars, so she spoke already different, you know.</span> <span id="s1852">In fact, to be honest with you, before we left the first time, you know, we had candle sticks, some silver.</span> <span id="s1853">We didn’t want to take it in Warsaw ghetto and they showed me where they buried it.</span> <span id="s1854">But I saw the Poles, I didn’t want them to risk myself to go take a look.</span> <span id="s1855">They’re probably not, but I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1856">So, anyway, we went to Grodzisk.</span> <span id="s1857">Showed them where we lived.</span> <span id="s1858">Showed them where my grandfather lived, where I went to school.</span> <span id="s1859">Oh, I made a lot of pictures, too, you know it.</span> <span id="s1860">And then we went back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1861">Next day we went to Piotrków, you know it.</span> <span id="s1862">And same thing, I showed them where the ghetto, and where we were.</span> <span id="s1863">One thing what I couldn’t bring myself in, to go in this room where my parents and my grandparents went out the last time.</span> <span id="s1864">I told my kids, I can’t go in, you know, somehow I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1865">So anyway, so we went there and we went back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1866">And then we went to Treblinka, this is on the other side from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1867">And then we stayed there and then we went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1868">Went to Buchenwald, where I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1869">And so we made our way home.</span> <span id="s1870">At least I showed the kids, that we still lived, we had an apartment.</span> <span id="s1871">Really it was our house.</span> <span id="s1872">You know, we were still something.</span> <span id="s1873">No doubt that we didn’t come out from a rock.</span> <span id="s1874">(Laughing.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: Do you think this was important for your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: And for me and for them more, because I knew it.</span> <span id="s1877">They didn’t.</span> <span id="s1878">Yes, it is very, very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: Do you think they had a new, a different understanding of…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: Not a new different understanding.</span> <span id="s1881">They knew, they trusted me, they knew that I didn’t lie.</span> <span id="s1882">But it, seeing with your own eyes is different than imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: Was anything from that entire trip particularly important for you, personally?</span> <span id="s1884">Did you come to terms with something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: For me?</span> <span id="s1886">For me was the worst thing was when I was supposed to go in that room, you know, where we lived, in the ghetto, in Piotrków.</span> <span id="s1887">Couldn’t get in, didn’t go in.</span> <span id="s1888">This sticks out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: Why that room in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: In Piotrków.</span> <span id="s1891">And that is Fitarska (ph) ten, you know it’s an address.</span> <span id="s1892">And across the street, it was high holidays in that time.</span> <span id="s1893">And the people went over and cried and cried.</span> <span id="s1894">I couldn’t go in there either, you know.</span> <span id="s1895">This is what sticks out in my memory the most.</span> <span id="s1896">You go to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1897">You see all the rocks and all the things.</span> <span id="s1898">It’s cold.</span> <span id="s1899">Here, you know, your mother got killed, but you didn’t see it visually, but the other ones, you know, I saw it.</span> <span id="s1900">And when I went to Auschwitz, you know, and saw the crematorias there.</span> <span id="s1901">I think I didn’t have to see, I knew it.</span> <span id="s1902">And you saw the gate where everybody in Arbeit Macht Frei, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Did you ever, I saw last time that you still have your tattoo.</span> <span id="s1904">Did you ever consider having it removed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: Why would I remove it?</span> <span id="s1906">I will have to die with it.</span> <span id="s1907">To me, it is now an honor, you know.</span> <span id="s1908">I will not remove it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Did people pressure you after the war to remove it or tell you that they think you ought to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: No, no, nobody pressured me.</span> <span id="s1911">In fact, if somebody would pressure me, I would tell them different.</span> <span id="s1912">No, no.</span> <span id="s1913">They can’t see me for my other side.</span> <span id="s1914">I might not tell it in a harsh way, but I can tell them in a nice way.</span> <span id="s1915">Put them in place.</span> <span id="s1916">No, it’s my arm anyway in the long run.</span> <span id="s1917">(Laughing.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1919">And do people comment on it, when they see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A: Yeah, they saw it now.</span> <span id="s1921">You see it on television.</span> <span id="s1922">Now it’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Do people stop you to say anything to you after they see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: It’s most was when you speak to the kids, they’re more sensitive.</span> <span id="s1925">You know, you do not tell it in a graphic way, because you do not want to hurt them.</span> <span id="s1926">But they are more sensitive.</span> <span id="s1927">They argue and it’s honest.</span> <span id="s1928">And otherwise you don’t know it.</span> <span id="s1929">You might question it or not, that’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Okay, I’m done.</span> <span id="s1931">Do you have any other things you want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: Listen I told you enough, to repeat again, I appreciate it and I like you for it, because you do a lot of things, which is good.</span> <span id="s1933">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Conclusion of Interview Yom ha Shoah, the annual Holocaust remembrance day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Survivors of the
