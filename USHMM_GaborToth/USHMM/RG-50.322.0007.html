Erich, Graduate Student, Wright state University.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Conduct of the Interview: An interview lasting one hour and fifteen minutes was conducted with Helene Erman in her residence at 3160 Valerie Arms Drive, Dayton, Ohio on May 19, 1981 at 10:00 a.m.</span> <span id="s10">The concluding segment of the interview was held on June 2, 1981 at the same time.</span> <span id="s11">The inquiry took place in the dining room of a combined living/dining room.</span> <span id="s12">The microphone was placed on the table between us.</span> <span id="s13">Mrs. Erman also taped the conversation.</span> <span id="s14">Helene Erman is a sixty-year old woman of medium height and weight.</span> <span id="s15">She is a sensitive woman who gave much thought to her responses.</span> <span id="s16">There were no interruptions during the questioning</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: We are at 3160 Valerie Arms Drive, Dayton, Ohio.</span> <span id="s18">I will be interviewing Mrs. Erman in connection with the Dayton Area Holocaust Project</span></p> <p><span id="s19">OK.</span> <span id="s20">Mrs. Erman, I like to start off by asking you first of all where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: I was born in Dortmund, Germany on June 16, 1921.</span> <span id="s22">I am the youngest daughter of five children.</span> <span id="s23">When I was two years old, my father passed away and my mother was the sole supporter of our family.</span> <span id="s24">Not only did she take good care of us, but she went into business and supported the family.</span> <span id="s25">She did a grand job personally and in financial things.</span> <span id="s26">When Hitler came to power, in 1933, the family was together, that means we all lived together.</span> <span id="s27">Suddenly the whole picture changed and everybody went different ways</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: This is getting quite a bit ahead of the project.</span> <span id="s29">Let’s go back a little.</span> <span id="s30">I like to know your parents names.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: My mother’s name was Dora Laufer.</span> <span id="s32">My father’s name was Jacob Laufer.</span> <span id="s33">My brothers and sisters were Erna, for my sister; Max, Ferdinand and Leo for my brothers in order of age.</span> <span id="s34">The only survivors are Leo and Erna.</span> <span id="s35">They both live in St. Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: You said that your father died when you were two years old.</span> <span id="s37">What did he do to earn a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: He was a businessman.</span> <span id="s39">He had stores.</span> <span id="s40">When my father passed away, by the way he passed away in Poland, since both my parents were Polish citizens, my mother had to sell everything in order to go to Poland and see what was going on.</span> <span id="s41">During WWI (at that time no Polish state existed.</span> <span id="s42">Poland was re-established by the Allies in 1919.)</span> <span id="s43">He drank some poison which affected his lungs.</span> <span id="s44">After that he was sick all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Let us talk a little more about your basic background.</span> <span id="s46">You were born in Germany of Polish heritage?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: That is true.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Do you have any idea how long your family lived in Poland, or in Germany?</span> <span id="s49">(Prior to 1919 portions of Poland were integral parts of Germany.)</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: My parents were born in Germany.</span> <span id="s51">Both their families were born in Germany.</span> <span id="s52">They did not come to Dortmund as a married couple.</span> <span id="s53">They met and fell in love in Germany.</span> <span id="s54">They came to Germany proper as teenagers.</span> <span id="s55">They went to school in Germany.</span> <span id="s56">Later they got married in Germany.</span> <span id="s57">By the way, when my father was sick, he went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s58">I don’t know whether they had better doctors there, (Germany had past WWI and was in the middle of a bottomless inflation) or whether he just wanted to be with his family.</span> <span id="s59">I was the only one of the family who was with him when he died.</span> <span id="s60">This was a sad picture for the entire family.</span> <span id="s61">My mother never remarried.</span> <span id="s62">She always said that she wanted to raise her own children.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: What year was it that your father died?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: 1923.</span> <span id="s65">In Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: You said you were the only one with him.</span> <span id="s67">You then were two years old.</span> <span id="s68">How did it happen that you, as a two year old were with your father in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: The other children were in school.</span> <span id="s70">I was with my father at his family’s.</span> <span id="s71">This lasted for only a short while, I believe.</span> <span id="s72">Then my mother came.</span> <span id="s73">She had to sell everything in Germany.</span> <span id="s74">Of course she thought that she might set up her life again, in Poland.</span> <span id="s75">Then she felt that that was not possible, the situation was not as she would have liked it to be.</span> <span id="s76">She took all of us back to Germany.</span> <span id="s77">The burial had taken place in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: You said that your father was in business.</span> <span id="s79">Do you know what kind of business?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Clothing business.</span> <span id="s81">He sold textiles in stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: He did not own his business himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yes, he owned his own business.</span> <span id="s84">Later on my mother owned the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Do you recall the name of your father’s business?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Was he in business alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s89">That is together with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Your mother apparently did help in the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s92">We did have help at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: That is one of the questions I was coming to.</span> <span id="s94">What kind of help was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: We had a sleep-in help.</span> <span id="s96">We did not call her a maid.</span> <span id="s97">She slept with us, later on also, when my mother was busy.</span> <span id="s98">As a matter of fact, she was so devoted, that my mother said she could trust her more than she could trust us.</span> <span id="s99">However when Hitler came to power, all the girls had to leave Jewish homes.</span> <span id="s100">So she had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yes, it was Mary.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Let us now talk a little about the cultural aspects of your lives.</span> <span id="s104">Were your parents involved in the arts?</span> <span id="s105">Did they take part in plays, did they go to the opera in Germany, anything of that type?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: I remember that my mother loved music.</span> <span id="s107">She went to concerts, and to the theaters.</span> <span id="s108">She took us children, along many times.</span> <span id="s109">My love for music came from hers.</span> <span id="s110">She was always singing.</span> <span id="s111">I always sang.</span> <span id="s112">As a matter of fact, I had some parts in Aida (Verdi opera) and in Shulamite (possibly another opera or oratorio), not solo parts, but in choirs.</span> <span id="s113">I always sang in choirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Did any of the children take lessons?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Music lessons?</span> <span id="s116">No, nobody did.</span> <span id="s117">I did later on in the U.S. I don’t believe that the money was available for that.</span> <span id="s118">After all, she had five children to support in public schools and other schooling, as well as clothing and feeding.</span> <span id="s119">That was quite a job.</span> <span id="s120">I believe that this might have been one of the factors.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: However she apparently introduced you to the world of music.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Definitely!</span> <span id="s123">Oh, definitely!</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: What was the range of ages of the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: My older brother was fourteen years older than I.</span> <span id="s126">The next two were one and two years younger respectively, the next one was eight years older than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Your father died in 1923.</span> <span id="s128">You said that he had been injured during the war.</span> <span id="s129">Had he been a serviceman during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yes, he was a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: For Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: For Prussia, actually that was part of the German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Do you know how he could have been injured?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s135">He sniffed some kind of acid, by accident.</span> <span id="s136">This burned his lungs.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Did he receive a pension because of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No, he did not.</span> <span id="s139">The Germans always said that it wasn’t their fault, but his own fault.</span> <span id="s140">My mother tried to obtain a pension, but she never succeeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Were either of your parents ever politically oriented?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: No.</span> <span id="s143">Not my parents.</span> <span id="s144">My brothers were.</span> <span id="s145">But not my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: They probably were not even able to vote in Germany.</span> <span id="s147">Were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: I am not sure whether they could or couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: When your father died, your mother carried on the business or did she re-establish it?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: First she sold everything because my father was in Poland.</span> <span id="s151">Then she returned and she established another business, the same kind of business.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Do you believe that was successful?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s154">She was able to raise five children.</span> <span id="s155">Not only that, but she bought an apartment house.</span> <span id="s156">We were not rich people, but she could do all these things.</span> <span id="s157">Later on, I guess that I am again jumping ahead, when Hitler came to power and her business was no longer lucrative, since people did not want to pay, she just ignored it and gave it up.</span> <span id="s158">She said that she would not work for people who don’t want to pay.</span> <span id="s159">Then she was able to live from the revenue of the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: You mentioned briefly that you lived reasonably well.</span> <span id="s161">Could you give us some kind of idea into which economic class you could have been put, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: I believe that it could not have been the middle class, it could have been the lower middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: All of you children attended school?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yes, certainly!</span> <span id="s165">(Education until age fourteen was required by law).</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Did everyone graduate?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: The neighborhood where you lived, was it predominately German or Jewish?</span> <span id="s169">Or mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: The area where we bought our house was all lived in by gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: You owned a home?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: My mother owned a building, which contained apartments.</span> <span id="s173">This was all occupied by gentiles.</span> <span id="s174">Before that we always had tried to live in an area where Jewish families lived.</span> <span id="s175">My mother had brothers and sisters in Dortmund.</span> <span id="s176">They tried to live together.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: When your mother bought this apartment in all this gentile neighborhood, did you live in one of the apartments?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes, later when one became vacant, we moved into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: How religious was your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: I am talking about my mother now.</span> <span id="s181">My mother was observant.</span> <span id="s182">For instance, we had a kosher home.</span> <span id="s183">However, if a customer came in on Saturday she would take money for whatever she sold.</span> <span id="s184">We had someone who turned on our lights on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s185">I would not call this being super religious, but she was observant.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: You children all attended the Holy Day events?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s188">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Were your brothers Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Oh, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Were there ever any incidents in your childhood, which you can recall now, where you were discriminated against because you were a Jewish child?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yes, I went to a Jewish Day School, therefore most of my friends were Jewish.</span> <span id="s193">I should say “all my close friends were Jewish”.</span> <span id="s194">At home, however, we lived in an area where there were a lot of gentiles.</span> <span id="s195">At the beginning, I was a tomboy.</span> <span id="s196">Everybody liked to play with me and I liked to play rough games.</span> <span id="s197">That was fine, however, when Hitler came, slowly, slowly they had to remove themselves without letting me know that they were doing it because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s198">Nobody said it, but it was known.</span> <span id="s199">So I went with my own friends.</span> <span id="s200">Instead of playing in the neighborhood, I went over to their (the Jewish) neighborhood.</span> <span id="s201">They also came to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: You felt that then there was an actual separation from the gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: That was the influence of the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: You were probably around fifteen at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: No, I was born in ’21, so I was twelve.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: So you had some inkling of what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: That was as a young child.</span> <span id="s211">You had older brothers and sisters, were they influential in any way how you felt as a child toward what was going on?</span> <span id="s212">Did they see things happening with their older groups, which you were not aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Oh, definitely yes!</span> <span id="s214">I remember that my brother had a gentile girlfriend.</span> <span id="s215">He was dating a gentile girl.</span> <span id="s216">The first thing everybody told him was ‘that if you don’t want to be arrested, you better drop her, or leave her, or she will leave you”.</span> <span id="s217">That is what it was.</span> <span id="s218">It was a matter of time until they had to be separated.</span> <span id="s219">Now when Hitler came to power, my brother belonged to a political organization.</span> <span id="s220">It was called the “Reich’s Banner” (translated into “State’s Flag”).</span> <span id="s221">Our house was searched one week after Hitler came to power because my brother was on their wanted list.</span> <span id="s222">Just one day before our house was searched to look for him or to look for anything, he left Germany.</span> <span id="s223">He just had to flee Germany.</span> <span id="s224">He went first to Holland (the closest border to Dortmund) and then to Belgium, then to France.</span> <span id="s225">Finally he settled in Israel, then Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Let us talk a little about that.</span> <span id="s227">First I wanted to ask you -- up and until this point, before 1933, when the Nazis (means National Sozialistische Partei, the official, legal name of Hitler’s political party) actually took over, were there any indications with your mother’s business or anything else, were there influences which were pressuring her about her business?</span> <span id="s228">I mean before that time only, before Hitler took power.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s230">No, my mother did her business.</span> <span id="s231">She went out to the farmers and sold her merchandise.</span> <span id="s232">They did not always have the money ready, so they told her “Come back in a year” or come back in two months or whatever.</span> <span id="s233">She had what was then called “abzahlungs geschaft”, which means that people bought on credit, like charge accounts.</span> <span id="s234">They knew that every month or every two months either they sent the money in, or my mother would come and bring something new and they would pay it off.</span> <span id="s235">That worked well.</span> <span id="s236">That is, it did work fine until Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s237">Most of them did pay what was owed, but some of them said, “Why should we?</span> <span id="s238">Anyhow Mrs. Laufer is a Jew and she can’t do anything to us.</span> <span id="s239">The law is on our side.”</span> <span id="s240">So some of them did not pay what was due.</span> <span id="s241">Many big stores in our city, owned by Jews, had their windows smashed.</span> <span id="s242">People stood in front of Jewish owned stores shouting “Don’t go in!</span> <span id="s243">Don’t buy!</span> <span id="s244">If you want to help Germany, stay out of there!”</span> <span id="s245">(That was a one day organized boycott, which took place shortly after Hitler became German Chancellor).</span> <span id="s246">Right after that Jews were taken into prisons.</span> <span id="s247">Again whoever was on their list.</span> <span id="s248">If you belonged to a political party, if you had married a gentile, all these people were on the list.</span> <span id="s249">They came to pick these people.</span> <span id="s250">Fortunately they did not arrest any in my immediate family, but we knew many people who got arrested and who were kept for months or years.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Did your mother employ gentiles in her business?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: No, she did not.</span> <span id="s253">Yes, I believe there was one gentile.</span> <span id="s254">Most of her dealings came from Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: She worked by herself didn’t she?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yes, that she did.</span> <span id="s257">She had one employee who helped her carry things into the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: You said that your brother got out just before they came to arrest him.</span> <span id="s259">He was aware of what was going on.</span> <span id="s260">Who did he contact to get out?</span> <span id="s261">What was his route for escaping?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: My brother belonged to a Zionist organization, also, as I did, like the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s263">He had a group of friends, a group of eight friends who put all the money they had together and during the night, they went to Holland and then Belgium.</span> <span id="s264">Then naturally they had to go further.</span> <span id="s265">Wherever they went they got some help from Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s266">However, they could not find employment -- you were a fugitive and you were not allowed to be employed.</span> <span id="s267">In Belgium he had an uncle, where he stayed for a while.</span> <span id="s268">While he was in France he became sick and he stayed there for a while until finally his papers to go to Israel came through (at that time immigration to Israel/Palestine was fairly open).</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Now this was your oldest brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: No, my youngest brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Your youngest brother!</span> <span id="s272">What about the others?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: My oldest brother went to Israel via Belgium under normal circumstances.</span> <span id="s274">The middle brother stayed in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: What year did your oldest brother leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: He left later, but he was not personally wanted by the Nazis, so he could stay.</span> <span id="s277">He was not on the wanted list.</span> <span id="s278">So he could stay.</span> <span id="s279">He was not on the blacklist.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: They did not want to prosecute him.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: So there were four of you left with your mother.</span> <span id="s283">This was in 1933.</span> <span id="s284">The Nazis were taking over.</span> <span id="s285">How did this affect your mother’s business?</span> <span id="s286">Can you go a little more in depth on that score, if you will?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: She really gave it up very quickly, since she could see no future in it.</span> <span id="s288">If you buy merchandise, naturally she had to pay for the merchandise, and if only 70% pay her back she couldn’t stay in business.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: No one came to her and threatened her?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s292">That is what I wanted to establish.</span> <span id="s293">No word came down that she should close?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: No.</span> <span id="s295">It was just the attitude of the people.</span> <span id="s296">If the government says ”don’t buy from Jews, and if you bought from Jews you don’t have to pay”.</span> <span id="s297">Decent people paid anyhow when they got their merchandise.</span> <span id="s298">Whoever did not want to pay didn’t have to.</span> <span id="s299">So what is the use of keeping up with a business that is a losing proposition?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Are you still in the city where you were originally?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Where I was born, Dortmund?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s303">What did your mother do at that point?</span> <span id="s304">She still had four children to take care of?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: No!</span> <span id="s306">The older children were on their own.</span> <span id="s307">The boys were on their own.</span> <span id="s308">I was the only one who still was in school and we had the apartment house.</span> <span id="s309">She could live from the rent she received.</span> <span id="s310">Of course, she could not live very well, not in luxury, but she could support me.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Considering the fact that you were a Jewish family living in a gentile apartment house, how did that work as a relationship with your tenants?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: There was only one Jewish family living in our building, the rest of them were gentile.</span> <span id="s313">They paid their rent; that did not change.</span> <span id="s314">(The Nazis had made no special rules) If they didn’t pay their rent, my mother took the proper action.</span> <span id="s315">There was no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: What year did you graduate?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: I believe in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: You were able to attend school until the year 1936, without any problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: I went to a Jewish elementary school.</span> <span id="s320">A Jewish school.</span> <span id="s321">We were taught by Jewish teachers.</span> <span id="s322">The school was supported by the Jewish agencies.</span> <span id="s323">All our faculty was Jewish (fairly early under the Nazi regime no Jewish teacher was allowed to teach in other than Jewish schools -- that caused many teachers to be available, if there was a Jewish school in town).</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: There was no attempt by the government to close you down?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: No.</span> <span id="s326">Then already they did not want Jewish students to enter high school, or colleges.</span> <span id="s327">So they were happy with Jewish Day Schools.</span> <span id="s328">It was hard (for Jewish students) to get into a university.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: There were no problems which you remember at this particular time, which you or your mother came up against in the years from 1933 through ’36, when you completed school.</span> <span id="s330">Things went along normally?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: I remember one incident.</span> <span id="s332">I belonged to a Zionist group.</span> <span id="s333">Every weekend we went on trips, field trips.</span> <span id="s334">There was a period of time when the SS (Schultz Staffel, the black shirted so-called elite troops, who furnished personal protection for Hitler, etc. and who later manned the concentration camps) or the SA (Sturm Abteilung, the brown shirted storm troopers who provided most of the Nazi manpower) attacked these groups every Sunday night by stoning or any other means and the students were injured.</span> <span id="s335">So we had to make a decision.</span> <span id="s336">Should we go on our field trips, or should we just abandon it?</span> <span id="s337">We voted against abandoning, but we said that we would be ready.</span> <span id="s338">So, instead of going to sleep we took big sticks in our hands and stones, also, and we fought against them.</span> <span id="s339">I still remember this, that we had to fight back against our attackers.</span> <span id="s340">We did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Do you remember what year it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: This might have been in 1936, or so.</span> <span id="s343">Maybe 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: You were still a teenager?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yes, sure, we were all teenagers!</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Did the “Nuremberg Laws” affect you?</span> <span id="s347">Or your family in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: What do you call the “Nuremberg Laws”?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: The ones which came into force and you mentioned earlier that Jews were not allowed to associate with, to marry or to have any relationship with gentiles.</span> <span id="s350">I mean that type of thing, not anything specific, but restrictions of any kind which were placed on you because of you being defined as “Non-Aryans”.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: The restrictions?</span> <span id="s352">You know it was made a crime, just being a Jew.</span> <span id="s353">(Being a Jew was defined “legally” as having at least one Jewish grandparent.)</span> <span id="s354">If you were not Aryan, that means a German born so over some generations that meant you are different and you don’t belong there.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Did they, at that time, make any moves to eliminate or to keep you away from your synagogues?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: No!</span> <span id="s357">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Were you allowed to attend?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Yes, we were allowed that.</span> <span id="s360">The only thing which was not allowed, in the pursuit of our religion, was the required slaughter for the butchers.</span> <span id="s361">The ritual slaughter of animals was not allowed so we did not have red meat.</span> <span id="s362">People who wanted to follow their religion could not eat red meat unless it was imported from Poland, Holland or Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q; Were you able to go out and shop without any problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s365">(At that early time).</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: You were not arrested on the street, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No.</span> <span id="s368">There was a time.</span> <span id="s369">I am only talking about the beginning, that Hitler was only very firm against the Jews.</span> <span id="s370">Then, that very quiet and peaceful and tranquil time started and the Jews thought, “Maybe the bad period will be behind us.</span> <span id="s371">However this was only the quiet before the storm really broke out.</span> <span id="s372">It was like that in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Once you had completed school, did you attempt to get employment of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s375">My goal was to go to Palestine/Israel.</span> <span id="s376">In order to go there, one had to go to a “Preparation School”.</span> <span id="s377">However, there was a waiting list for this school because everybody wanted to leave, especially the youngsters.</span> <span id="s378">There was no future (in Germany) for the youth.</span> <span id="s379">Of course, everybody really was ready to go someplace, emigrate to the U.S., for that you needed a permit, or a visa.</span> <span id="s380">There was a quota there.</span> <span id="s381">So our family decided that our goal is Israel.</span> <span id="s382">I went to Cologne (Koln or Cologne) to what is called “Hach Shara”.</span> <span id="s383">They prepared the people for Israel.</span> <span id="s384">They taught people about Jewish history, some of them went out to farm to learn to be agriculturalists, or they learned professions such as sewing and carpentry.</span> <span id="s385">Here truly the biggest tragedy started.</span> <span id="s386">In 1938, all Polish citizens were supposed to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s387">That included me.</span> <span id="s388">When they knocked at our door and they said “Helene Erman (this probably should be “Helene Laufer”) has to come tomorrow morning to the train station and she will be deported to Poland”.</span> <span id="s389">Now I could not reach my mother, because she did not have a phone.</span> <span id="s390">My sister, who lived in Berlin, she had a phone and I reached her after a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s391">She said that I should go with the group because they are going to catch me anyhow and she added that she would attempt to somehow get word to my mother.</span> <span id="s392">So we all were assembled into groups at the station.</span> <span id="s393">In the morning the Jewish Committee came and brought us some food.</span> <span id="s394">the next evening we were put on the train in order to go to “Spaunching”.</span> <span id="s395">Spaunching (which could not readily be located -- it may be what is today called “Sosnouwiec” then at the German-Polish border now well inside of Poland) is a place between Germany and Poland.</span> <span id="s396">The Poles didn’t want to let us in and the Germans threw us out.</span> <span id="s397">My sister was not able to get in touch with my mother because of that lack of a phone at my mother’s, but she contacted neighbors, friends and they told her that my mother had been arrested also.</span> <span id="s398">She also was brought to Poland.</span> <span id="s399">There were two different places to which she could have been brought to, they were Baunschen and Bousen (these places could not be located).</span> <span id="s400">I remember when, after a long, long ride being sixteen or seventeen years old, not knowing what had happened, we finally came to a railroad station and I heard someone yelling “Where is my child?”</span> <span id="s401">My mother then came to the train to look for me.</span> <span id="s402">That was a very emotional experience.</span> <span id="s403">I believe that we stayed there for ½ year, until my mother could return to Germany in order to liquidate all our belongings.</span> <span id="s404">Of course the big building which was worth a lot of money just could not be sold for what it was worth.</span> <span id="s405">They knew that she came to liquidate and they gave her a fraction of what it was really worth.</span> <span id="s406">From there on, when my mother returned, we could have gone into Poland by then because now we had the means to support ourselves.</span> <span id="s407">However, shortly after that, the war broke out, that was WWII, my mother went to her former home town which had been called Bochnia (located near Krakow) in Galicia and I was trying to get to Vilna.</span> <span id="s408">Here again, we were a group of seven students and we tried to stay ahead of the Germans.</span> <span id="s409">Every day we were ahead of the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s410">The war was going on.</span> <span id="s411">The German soldiers were marching into Poland.</span> <span id="s412">In our group of eight, seven people were trying to survive.</span> <span id="s413">We had to work, but we couldn’t find work.</span> <span id="s414">At night we lived in hedges, in farms or wherever.</span> <span id="s415">During the day we tried to find some food.</span> <span id="s416">We were always afraid that we might be caught.</span> <span id="s417">Amongst us there was only one girl who knew Polish.</span> <span id="s418">It was a terrible life.</span> <span id="s419">It was a life of a fugitive.</span> <span id="s420">It was really awful.</span> <span id="s421">Some of the girls and boys got sick, so we had to stop, but somehow we survived by a miracle and we came to Vilna.</span> <span id="s422">Vilna at the time belonged to Poland.</span> <span id="s423">During the war, Vilna was “given” by Poland to Russia, as a result of the German-Russian friendship pact.</span> <span id="s424">Then Russia gave it to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s425">Do you know what a pogrom is?</span> <span id="s426">A pogrom is always directed against the Jews, who serve always as escape goats.</span> <span id="s427">When the Russians came they asked “Who is here?</span> <span id="s428">The Jews and the Polacks!”</span> <span id="s429">(derogatory term for Poles) The Poles attacked the Jews in Vilna.</span> <span id="s430">It was terrible, really it was.</span> <span id="s431">It was a pogrom!</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Why was it that your mother and you decided to separate?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Because all the time we thought it would be better for me.</span> <span id="s434">She lived in a very small town where she had a very ill father.</span> <span id="s435">She felt that she had to help him.</span> <span id="s436">Also she knew that I would not get the right education in Bochnia.</span> <span id="s437">She also hoped that from Vilna I could go to Palestine from there.</span> <span id="s438">People were able to go to Palestine from there.</span> <span id="s439">These were the main reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: So she thought that when you left that you were going to eventually get to go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s442">My objective was to reach Israel.</span> <span id="s443">That was my goal.</span> <span id="s444">As far as I was concerned, it was only a question of time until I got there, and that is what really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: You said that you stayed in Baunschen for about six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Yes, maybe a little more.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Can you describe what the situation was like during those months?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: They had assembled Jews from all over Germany.</span> <span id="s449">We lived in one room, maybe eight or seven families, all together.</span> <span id="s450">We did not have beds, we lived on mattresses on the floor.</span> <span id="s451">The Polish People Support gave us lunch once a day and we could take food along for breakfast and dinner.</span> <span id="s452">I should say that the Polish People Support were Polish Jews, or a Polish Jewish Committee.</span> <span id="s453">The younger people, of course, worked.</span> <span id="s454">We worked for the Jewish government in Baunschen.</span> <span id="s455">We didn’t get paid, but of course this No-man’s land became like a small country so it had to be governed.</span> <span id="s456">So a hospital was established in a hurry, so were schools.</span> <span id="s457">They set up committees to address all the problems people had.</span> <span id="s458">All of this had to established from nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: How big a population was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: It was very small.</span> <span id="s461">Like a small town.</span> <span id="s462">I don’t know exactly, maybe about 2,000 Poles altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: And the Jewish people who came from Germany were included?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: We were there for maybe nine months, until the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: You said that the Jewish Committee was in charge, more or less, of itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yes, it governed itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Were you, in any way, super-governed by the Germans?</span> <span id="s468">or the Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: No Germans.</span> <span id="s470">The Polish government, rather.</span> <span id="s471">The Germans just dumped us.</span> <span id="s472">The only things we had to do was to obey the rules of the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Were you kept under guard at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s475">We could not leave that freshly set up country until somebody of a family went back to Germany and liquidated their belongings and assets.</span> <span id="s476">Then you could go into Poland.</span> <span id="s477">From there they might go further but my mother decided that we should stay.</span> <span id="s478">That is what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: You were in a very small town on the border.</span> <span id="s480">Was there any way that you were in a camp?</span> <span id="s481">Did they build any housing?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: They did not build anything except maybe for barriers.</span> <span id="s483">Yes, there were barriers around.</span> <span id="s484">At the beginning, as I said, you could have gone, you could even have broken out, over the barriers, however, later on soldiers surrounded the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: You said that your mother was able to return to Dortmund and to liquidate her assets and then to return with them.</span> <span id="s486">She was having no problem doing that, apparently, other than the fact that she had not received the full amount.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: What, at this point, happened to your brothers?</span> <span id="s489">Your sister was in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes, my sister had married a German.</span> <span id="s491">She was in Berlin and from there she came to the U.S. Two brothers were in Palestine.</span> <span id="s492">The oldest of my brothers was wandering around.</span> <span id="s493">He was in Russia later on, he was caught by the Russians and he got very sick.</span> <span id="s494">After the war was over, he went back to Germany and he passed away shortly after that.</span> <span id="s495">He had been in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: You apparently left Germany before “Kristallnacht” (November 10, 1938).</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s498">My sister was in Germany during that Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Was her relationship with her husband changed because of that?</span> <span id="s500">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: No!</span> <span id="s502">He was a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s503">No, no!!</span> <span id="s504">He was a Jew, he is a Jew.</span> <span id="s505">A German Jewish man.</span> <span id="s506">They now live in St. Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Now you and seven other young people decided to leave Baunschen.</span> <span id="s508">I am asking all these questions about being within a camp is that I wonder how you were able to get out of that situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: The war started.</span> <span id="s510">So there were no barriers involved any more.</span> <span id="s511">The war started and everyone went running.</span> <span id="s512">Everybody started running and to spread out.</span> <span id="s513">My mother left one or maybe two weeks before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s514">This was one good part.</span> <span id="s515">We young people decided to stay together.</span> <span id="s516">We were seven students, as well as friends.</span> <span id="s517">We walked out through the location of the barriers through the area where the bombs were falling.</span> <span id="s518">The shooting sometimes went over our heads.</span> <span id="s519">We attempted to always be one day ahead of the Polish soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">(Here the tape was changed and apparently some of the story was lost in the interval.</span> <span id="s521">Apparently as the tape resumes HE is explaining her and her mother’s decision to separate in Baunschen).</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: That was a hard decision for you to separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yes, she was very torn by doubts.</span> <span id="s524">Also for me to make the decision not to go with her was quite a hard one to make.</span> <span id="s525">After all, in her eyes, I was still a young child.</span> <span id="s526">I felt very close to her also.</span> <span id="s527">However, at the time, we felt that was the best for me.</span> <span id="s528">From Bochnia, I probably would never have been able to get out, since my mother vanished from Bochnia, her hometown.</span> <span id="s529">It turns out this was the better thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Now, how did your group leave the area?</span> <span id="s531">By train?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: No, No!</span> <span id="s533">By foot, everything by foot.</span> <span id="s534">We went from one side of Poland to the other by foot.</span> <span id="s535">We could not and did not go into a train.</span> <span id="s536">Occasionally we hitched a ride on a wagon with straw, but as a rule, we walked from one end to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Were you able to formulate any plans?</span> <span id="s538">You knew you were going someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yes, our destination was Vilna, since we knew that in Vilna there is a place where we first are going to find shelter and then we would get to an organized group who would send us to Israel, who would support us.</span> <span id="s540">They would give the needed papers and shelter and food, and then we would get an opportunity to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">N</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Now between Baunschen and Vilna, did you have any problems getting along the road.</span> <span id="s543">In other words, what was the situation like other than the fact that you stayed just ahead of the fighting?</span> <span id="s544">Were you able to move directly to Vilna or did you have to go by a round about road.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: It took us almost two years, actually one and a half years to get to our destination (One year and nine and a half months elapsed between the German invasion of Poland and their invasion of Russia, and Vilna was overrun within one week after the invasion of Russia).</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: So we got a lot to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s548">It took us almost that long</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Can you describe to me the type of things you ran into?</span> <span id="s550">What happened in that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: The things we ran into was just a case of survival.</span> <span id="s552">We were fugitives, we slept on the ground, we slept in barracks.</span> <span id="s553">We ate what we found, sometimes, at night we had to pick up garbage.</span> <span id="s554">We did whatever we felt had to be done for survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Were the Polish people themselves, not the Polish Jewish people, but the Polish people helpful in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Some of them were very helpful.</span> <span id="s557">Some of them took us in so that we could take a bath and some of them were afraid.</span> <span id="s558">You know that the worst anti-Semitism existed in Poland.</span> <span id="s559">Hitler set his concentration camps up in Poland because he knew that they would have good support there, since the Poles did not like the Jews either.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Did you ever get to a point where the fighting was where you were at the time -- I know that you said that you always were able to be one day ahead of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: We just somehow made it, by a miracle, by our strength, by our know-how, by our will to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: You mentioned that some of the people got sick along the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: When people got sick, we had to take care of them.</span> <span id="s564">We had, sometimes, to get people to a doctor.</span> <span id="s565">We were pretty well living without money.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Were you able to move in spurts?</span> <span id="s567">Did you get to a place, then stop for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s569">We stopped in bigger cities.</span> <span id="s570">We supplied ourselves with food.</span> <span id="s571">Sometimes, we worked for a few days.</span> <span id="s572">We got help from Jewish families.</span> <span id="s573">After all, we could not always walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: I was going to ask you if you ever came in contact with Jewish Refugee Organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: As a matter of fact, toward the end our group grew.</span> <span id="s576">We picked up some more refugees, that is Jewish refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: You didn’t run across any particular organization which took you in?</span> <span id="s578">or aided you?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: You know we Jewish people are very unique people.</span> <span id="s580">If someone is in need, they will get help.</span> <span id="s581">We know that and we got that help.</span> <span id="s582">It shows again that it’s hard to get somebody down if you really are determined.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: During all of this time the Nazis were rounding up Jewish people all over Poland, and shipping them to various camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: This came a little later (actually during most of this time HE and her group must have been in Russian controlled Poland).</span> <span id="s585">The concentration camps came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: What year are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: We are talking about 1939 and 1940.</span> <span id="s588">We arrived in Vilna in early 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: When you arrived in Vilna, how many of the original group were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Our group grew.</span> <span id="s591">We picked up more people.</span> <span id="s592">There were thousands and thousands of people in Vilna.</span> <span id="s593">Jewish people who wanted to go to Israel, who prepared themselves for Israel.</span> <span id="s594">We received a hero’s welcome.</span> <span id="s595">As a matter of fact, at the same time our group arrived other groups came also.</span> <span id="s596">That was like a reunion although it was with people we had never met.</span> <span id="s597">Of course they did not have all the facilities to house us, and to feed us.</span> <span id="s598">We wound up with four people in our bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: The seven other people you left Baunschen with?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: They all came.</span> <span id="s601">We all finished together.</span> <span id="s602">We all made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Vilna, I am not very familiar with it.</span> <span id="s604">Was it a ghetto?</span> <span id="s605">Was it a refugee center?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: In a way it was a refugee center.</span> <span id="s607">(It was, of course, a relatively large town for this area of Lithuania -- White Russia.</span> <span id="s608">It also used to be the center of a thriving Jewish community over 100 years ago.)</span> <span id="s609">We knew that from Vilna there was a regular route to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s610">There were people who organized this.</span> <span id="s611">There were people who would falsify our dates, for instance, since the British government allowed entry to people who were \sixteen years old or less.</span> <span id="s612">At the time, in 1941, I was older so they falsified my documents including passport, identification papers, etc.</span> <span id="s613">I was made three years younger.</span> <span id="s614">I was in Vilna for half a year till I moved on.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Now, Vilna, was that a situation where the Polish army was in control as it had been earlier (Vilna by that time had been overrun by the Russians, and the Polish army no longer existed as a national force.)</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Vilna was like an oasis covered by the Polish government.</span> <span id="s617">Only afterwards Russia took over.</span> <span id="s618">The Poles gave Vilna up and Russia took over, however, only for a very brief time then they turned it over to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s619">That is really when things started to move.</span> <span id="s620">They were peaceful, quiet people and things started to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: How many Jewish people were there in Vilna when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Thousands.</span> <span id="s623">Thousand youngsters.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: You mentioned briefly that you were four in a bed.</span> <span id="s625">Could you describe this a little more?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: You see we had to make the best of what existed.</span> <span id="s627">We slept in three shifts.</span> <span id="s628">During that time everybody else worked.</span> <span id="s629">We did outside work.</span> <span id="s630">I remember doing lumber work and housework, farming, anything which was to be done.</span> <span id="s631">Everywhere where people needed help, we provided it.</span> <span id="s632">We were a group of 1,000 people who had to be fed and housed.</span> <span id="s633">We lived in a barracks where soldiers had lived.</span> <span id="s634">That is where our headquarters were.</span> <span id="s635">This place was also bombed by the Germans and some people were wounded (prior to Russia occupying her part of Poland in 1939).</span> <span id="s636">One mother had been holding her child when it was killed in her arms.</span> <span id="s637">There were some dramatic experiences.</span> <span id="s638">However, as long as we were young, everything seemed so different.</span> <span id="s639">The only thing we could never understand was why all this happened to us.</span> <span id="s640">Why is it a crime to be Jewish?</span> <span id="s641">This was always a question which never left us.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Did you feel that, once you had reached Vilna, you were safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Yes, safe!</span> <span id="s644">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Were you able to check on your mother at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s647">We had letters from each other all the time.</span> <span id="s648">She was all right.</span> <span id="s649">She lived with her father, in Bochnia.</span> <span id="s650">My uncle came to Bochnia, actually two uncles, with their families.</span> <span id="s651">She lived amongst her relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: You stayed in Vilna, a matter of six months, what was taking place around you at that time?</span> <span id="s653">Where were the Germans?</span> <span id="s654">Were you relatively safe at that time so you didn’t have to make a rash move?</span> <span id="s655">Was it all very well planned out?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: It was very well planned out.</span> <span id="s657">The Germans did not come into Vilna.</span> <span id="s658">The Germans gave Vilna and the other portions of Eastern Poland to Russia.</span> <span id="s659">Later Russia gave Vilna to Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: This took place at the same time you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yes, this took place when I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Did the Russians ever move on the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s664">However, the Russians didn’t do anything to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Now the Lithuanians, I assume moved in.</span> <span id="s666">Did you feel threatened at that stage?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Yes, they moved in.</span> <span id="s668">Then I got a Lithuanian passport going to Israel.</span> <span id="s669">They were very orderly.</span> <span id="s670">Very nice.</span> <span id="s671">We could work.</span> <span id="s672">It was rather a peaceful time.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Now you had a forged passport, making you three years younger, to go to Palestine, the land of Israel.</span> <span id="s674">Tell me what took place at this point.</span> <span id="s675">How many of you were scheduled to leave?</span> <span id="s676">When were you scheduled to leave and how were you scheduled to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Unfortunately there were many left behind.</span> <span id="s678">Unfortunately and this always bothered me terribly.</span> <span id="s679">As a matter of fact, I had a very close friend whom I had made during all these hard times, going through Poland.</span> <span id="s680">She was not supposed to leave and I put my foot down and I said “If Rachel doesn’t go, I am not going either”.</span> <span id="s681">I spoke to the President of our organization.</span> <span id="s682">He said “OK lady, we are going to give Rachel her papers”.</span> <span id="s683">The reason for that was that she looked older, actually she was a year older than I, and that is what they were afraid of.</span> <span id="s684">They were afraid that if one did not look real they might jeopardize the whole organization.</span> <span id="s685">Then she was able to come with me.</span> <span id="s686">We got on a train through Poland, Moscow, Odessa, Turkey, Syria and Lebanon finally to Palestine – Israel.</span> <span id="s687">That was our road.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: How many were you at that time?</span> <span id="s689">all together?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: We were a very small group.</span> <span id="s691">We always left by small groups of maybe ten to twelve people at the most.</span> <span id="s692">There were many who left before me.</span> <span id="s693">There were many who went to Japan.</span> <span id="s694">That was a different road.</span> <span id="s695">That was our road.</span> <span id="s696">I believe in our group there were twelve people, including me.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: A mixed group, boys and girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Yes, a mixed group.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: What was your next stop after you left Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: I was two days in Moscow, two days in Odessa, one day on the Turkish border, I forgot the name of the place.</span> <span id="s701">Then we went through Syria and Lebanon.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: What were your accommodations like, on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: They were excellent, truly excellent.</span> <span id="s704">The Jewish Committee had us stay at beautiful hotels in Russia.</span> <span id="s705">We were fed royally.</span> <span id="s706">That was the first time we had seen good food.</span> <span id="s707">We had a good bed.</span> <span id="s708">It was the same way in Turkey.</span> <span id="s709">Of course in Syria and Lebanon we could not be seen because of the anti-Jewish feeling.</span> <span id="s710">Then we drove through the Arab countryside by car.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: While you were on the train, passing through Russia, did you ever run into any problems with your passport or identification papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: No.</span> <span id="s713">the only thing was that we were watched constantly.</span> <span id="s714">For instance, when we went sight seeing we always knew that someone was behind us, following us, and watching us, and listening to what we were saying.</span> <span id="s715">We always knew that there was someone who watched us.</span> <span id="s716">At night, I told you that we stayed in a beautiful hotel, we went to a show, we always knew that we were watched.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: What were conditions like in Russia at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: I really couldn’t go into details because I knew that people were afraid to speak.</span> <span id="s719">I had a toothache, so I went to a dentist.</span> <span id="s720">I took two of my girlfriends along.</span> <span id="s721">The girls spoke Polish, they did not speak Russian.</span> <span id="s722">We all spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s723">The dentist looked Jewish to me.</span> <span id="s724">He didn’t speak Polish.</span> <span id="s725">They asked him if he spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s726">“No.”</span> <span id="s727">If he spoke Yiddish?</span> <span id="s728">“No.”</span> <span id="s729">Then I said, “Do you speak German?”</span> <span id="s730">He said “Yes.”</span> <span id="s731">However his German was like Yiddish.</span> <span id="s732">This means that he was a Jew, who was afraid to concede that he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s733">This is the way we felt all the time.</span> <span id="s734">Jews were afraid to proclaim their religion in Russia.</span> <span id="s735">However we did not go into details.</span> <span id="s736">We were there for two days.</span> <span id="s737">You know that really was not on our minds.</span> <span id="s738">All we wanted was to get to the land of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Can you remember the date when you actually left Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Do you remember what month or time of year that might have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: I know it was in 1941.</span> <span id="s743">It must have been in February or March.</span> <span id="s744">I did reach Israel March 25, so it must have been March.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: So it was before the Allies had entered the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s747">(England and France had declared war on Germany in September 1939, Norway and Denmark had been invaded in April 1940 and the Benelux countries in May 1940, so that recollection is not accurate for the European allies.)</span> <span id="s748">It was two months before Russia went against Germany.</span> <span id="s749">(Germany invaded Russia on June 22, 1941) so the timing was as if an angel watched over us, guiding us.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Just backtracking a little.</span> <span id="s751">You mentioned that you had been in touch with your mother all the time you were in Vilna.</span> <span id="s752">Was she finally aware that you had left Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: She had that peace of mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yes, she knew.</span> <span id="s756">I was in contact with her before I left and then from our way we always had contact through the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s757">The Red Cross served us by transmitting letters so I was always in touch with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: You went from Moscow to Odessa?</span> <span id="s759">Did anything occur along that segment of your trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Yes, something which at the time was like a terrible thing, which now seems very small.</span> <span id="s761">Before I left Vilna, my friends gave me a pair of beautiful wool gloves.</span> <span id="s762">You know it was very cold in Vilna.</span> <span id="s763">Sometimes as low as 40 or 45 degrees below zero.</span> <span id="s764">They didn’t have anything, nobody had any money, so they bought me as a going away present a pair of gloves.</span> <span id="s765">I hung my coat up in the train, not in the station, but in the train, while we were traveling, and when I woke up in the morning, my gloves were gone.</span> <span id="s766">Oh, I thought that this was the worst thing, not only because they stole my gloves, but because they were the nicest souvenir which I could have gotten.</span> <span id="s767">That was taken away from me.</span> <span id="s768">This was very disappointing, but it was nothing special.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: You were not stopped or interrogated, or anything like that on your trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No.</span> <span id="s771">the only thing is that we were followed in Russia, observed as if we were spies or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Now we are assuming that it was the Russians who were following you.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Definitely, but definitely it could only have been the Russians.</span> <span id="s774">There were no other people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: You went to Odessa and went to Turkey, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Were you in Istanbul?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Yes, in Istanbul.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Did you have any problems crossing that border?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s781">All our passports were made up beautifully.</span> <span id="s782">They did a very good job.</span> <span id="s783">There again we stayed for maybe a week, until we were ready to go to Israel, to the land of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: During the trip and realizing that this was a rather pleasant trip compared to the hardship you had gone through, other than being followed and someone being aware of your moves, did you ever feel as if you were never going to get to your destination?</span> <span id="s785">Or did you feel that eventually you would get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: The only time we felt threatened was in Syria and in Lebanon.</span> <span id="s787">Prior to our getting there, they told us, “Make sure no one sees you!”</span> <span id="s788">we arrived at night.</span> <span id="s789">We were pushed while they were saying, “Sh!</span> <span id="s790">Very quiet, very quiet” into the hotel rooms.</span> <span id="s791">Our food was brought into our rooms in bags.</span> <span id="s792">We were told “Don’t speak!</span> <span id="s793">Make sure that you don’t speak German, Yiddish or Hebrew, or whatever you speak.</span> <span id="s794">Let nobody hear you!”</span> <span id="s795">Early in the morning, at dawn, the bus driver picked us up.</span> <span id="s796">He didn’t speak.</span> <span id="s797">He got money out of doing this job.</span> <span id="s798">That is how he made money.</span> <span id="s799">Until we reached the border of the land of Israel we didn’t know how it would end.</span> <span id="s800">For one and a half days through Syria and Lebanon, these were again tense moments.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: You said that you stopped in a hotel, and then there was a bus driver.</span> <span id="s802">Were the people Arabs?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Yes, Arabs.</span> <span id="s804">These were Arab people who worked for the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Other than the fact that it was a very precarious situation, you had no problem getting across any borders?</span> <span id="s806">From one border to the next?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: No.</span> <span id="s808">The driver knew his way.</span> <span id="s809">He had done this several times before.</span> <span id="s810">That was the way in which our people were brought into Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Just to clarify this a little, did you actually cross borders at checkpoints?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: No, not at checkpoints.</span> <span id="s813">No we did not cross borders at official crossings.</span> <span id="s814">He knew his road.</span> <span id="s815">It was his livelihood to smuggle people into the land of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: OK, so you came in through the back door?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Yes, definitely, through the back door.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: What were your feelings when you crossed the border into Israel?</span> <span id="s819">I am sure that you recall them.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Unbelievable!</span> <span id="s821">We were lying on the ground and kissing the ground.</span> <span id="s822">We were singing and we were jubilant.</span> <span id="s823">We were dancing.</span> <span id="s824">It was a moment we will never forget.</span> <span id="s825">Then the people who lived there, came to join us and we were brought up to Haifa to get all our injections.</span> <span id="s826">Then my brothers called and later I rejoined my brothers.</span> <span id="s827">So this was something special.</span> <span id="s828">Then I started school, high school again.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: When you entered Israel, what was the village or town, what was the point of entry?</span> <span id="s830">Did you go to a central point other than Haifa?</span> <span id="s831">at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: We entered through a small village close to Lebanon.</span> <span id="s833">Then another driver came on the bus and we were driven, that was now an Israeli bus driver, and drove us to Haifa.</span> <span id="s834">There we were checked over, we got our shots, whatever we needed.</span> <span id="s835">Then we had our slip telling us what our destination was.</span> <span id="s836">I went to visit my brothers.</span> <span id="s837">They lived, at the time, in Richon Le-Zion (just south of Tel Aviv.)</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Before we get to that point were you ever aided at any point along the route by any Jewish organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Certainly!</span> <span id="s840">The whole thing was set up and aided by Jewish organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: I realize that.</span> <span id="s842">Can you name some of these organizations, I wondered if you had the titles of some of these groups.</span> <span id="s843">Do you remember who they were?</span> <span id="s844">I know that in Germany and later in the U.S. there was the Joint Distribution Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: In Turkey, it was the Joint.</span> <span id="s846">The VIZO.</span> <span id="s847">There was something like the UJA.</span> <span id="s848">All of the organizations cooperated.</span> <span id="s849">You just don’t bring people into a country by one man or one organization.</span> <span id="s850">It was a joint effort and a joint doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: It was organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yes, very organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: There was someone to meet you in the Land of Israel, when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: There?</span> <span id="s855">Yes!</span> <span id="s856">Of course.</span> <span id="s857">Wherever we came we were met, we were welcomed.</span> <span id="s858">You knew that you were amongst friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Do you remember now?</span> <span id="s860">You left basically in March 1941, and you arrived?</span> <span id="s861">How long a trip was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: We arrived in March 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: So it was a matter of about two or three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: You said that you went as soon as you could to visit your brothers.</span> <span id="s866">You had two brothers living in Israel at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: The other one was in Russia, and you were not aware of his whereabouts?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Did you know that he was in Russia when you passed through that country?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: No.</span> <span id="s872">Even if I had, I couldn’t have done anything.</span> <span id="s873">I knew that he was someplace, but he was in a different area entirely.</span> <span id="s874">I could never have left my assigned route.</span> <span id="s875">As a matter of fact, at the time he was in Poland.</span> <span id="s876">Then he was sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s877">I don’t believe that I knew that at that time either.</span> <span id="s878">I only heard about this afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Were your brothers married at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Both my brothers got married in Palestine-Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: They had established themselves in Palestine-Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: When I arrived one of my brothers was married.</span> <span id="s883">Yes they were both established.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: You attended school in Haifa?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: No, in Richon Le-Zion.</span> <span id="s886">My first school was an agricultural high school.</span> <span id="s887">Then I attended school in Jerusalem, and then I attended school in Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: The first school was an agricultural high school which trained you to work on something like a Kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s890">I had a choice.</span> <span id="s891">Either I could go straight to Jerusalem and to the university there, or I could go to Richon Le-Zion into that agricultural high school.</span> <span id="s892">I decided to finish two years in the latter, because my brothers were there.</span> <span id="s893">I felt that since I had not been close to my family for such a long time, this would give me the support I needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: When were you able to find out more about what happened to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: From time to time we received Red Cross letters.</span> <span id="s896">(These were notes mailed on letters where you could indicate by check marks which of several phrases you felt were applicable -- that way absolutely no intelligence information could be transmitted since nothing other than the name was written.)</span> <span id="s897">The final thing about her, most of her brothers and sisters and sisters-in-law vanishing, we found out after the war only.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: So you were really unawares for what happened to her for about three or four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: I still had letters from her in 1943.</span> <span id="s900">So that means since the war was over in 1945, that two years before the war finished, I still had letters from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: So you have any idea where, or when she was sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: She was sent to Krakow Concentration Camp.</span> <span id="s903">The last letter I received from her was from Krakosh, in Galizia.</span> <span id="s904">Then the letters stopped!</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: You were in school.</span> <span id="s906">Your plan is to stay in Israel-Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Oh, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Can you describe to me what conditions were like in Israel-Palestine when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: At that time the country was under the British Mandate.</span> <span id="s910">The country was surrounded by Arabs and so it still is.</span> <span id="s911">The Arabs didn’t want us.</span> <span id="s912">The British did not want to leave.</span> <span id="s913">In other words, it was in some kind of uproar.</span> <span id="s914">For us Jews that was the only country to live in.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: It is June 2, 1981.</span> <span id="s916">This is the second part of an interview which I am having with Helen Erman on the Dayton Area Holocaust project.</span> <span id="s917">It is 10:A.M.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Helen, when we ended last time, we were talking about the situation in the Land of Israel.</span> <span id="s919">I want to start off this time by asking you; did any of the events which were taking place at that time, when you first moved there influence your future?</span> <span id="s920">You were apparently living with your brothers, or, at least, one of your brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: No.</span> <span id="s922">When I first moved there, I first came to the place where all the new immigrants come.</span> <span id="s923">It is called Bet Olim (Olim is a Hebrew word which means New Immigrant).</span> <span id="s924">There tests were taken.</span> <span id="s925">I was checked to see if I was well.</span> <span id="s926">We got all the needed shots.</span> <span id="s927">Then I went straight to school, to the agricultural high school for two years.</span> <span id="s928">Of course, I visited my brothers but in Richon Le-Zion.</span> <span id="s929">I stayed for two years in the agricultural school.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Was the idea of the high school to prepare you for the Kibbutz type living?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: No, that was not the case.</span> <span id="s932">I could have gone to a Kibbutz, as a matter of fact, I worked for three months on a Kibbutz, but this school was not a preparation for Kibbutz life.</span> <span id="s933">We studied Hebrew first and then Jewish history, and Jewish literature and we worked half day.</span> <span id="s934">So we studied half day and we worked for half day.</span> <span id="s935">We supported ourselves with the vegetables we grew.</span> <span id="s936">We, also, had cows, chickens and so on.</span> <span id="s937">We supported ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: May I ask you, now while we are talking about school, how many languages do you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: I speak four -- let me change that to three and a half.</span> <span id="s940">They are German, Hebrew, English and Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: No Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: No, I don’t know Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: While you were in that school, that is where you met Hans?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Did you complete the school training?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s947">We did not marry when I met him.</span> <span id="s948">We got married two years later.</span> <span id="s949">After we got married, I went to another school, that was part time.</span> <span id="s950">It was a college in Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: What did you study there?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: I studied Home Economics, but I never worked in that field.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: In what year were you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: In 1945.</span> <span id="s955">Both our children were born in Israel.</span> <span id="s956">This was the greatest joy we could imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Could you give me their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Our son’s name is Stanley.</span> <span id="s959">That means that his Hebrew name is Etan.</span> <span id="s960">Our daughter’s name is Dori.</span> <span id="s961">Her Hebrew name is Dorit.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: How long did you stay in Israel, after the children were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: We left Israel in 1954.</span> <span id="s964">That means that our son was six and a half and our daughter was three and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: So you were in Israel during the time of the War of Independence.</span> <span id="s966">Would you like just to talk about that, those particular years, between the time you were married and the time you left?</span> <span id="s967">What was going on in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: When I came to Israel the British Mandate was going on.</span> <span id="s969">They really had a very rough time to please the Jews and to please the Arabs.</span> <span id="s970">Of course they could not please anybody.</span> <span id="s971">The Jews made demands for more immigration, i.e. for more Jews to come to Israel, and that was rejected by the Arabs.</span> <span id="s972">The attacks of the Arabs were always present.</span> <span id="s973">Our school was attacked at least ten times during the two years I went there.</span> <span id="s974">The first thing we had to learn was how to use weapons.</span> <span id="s975">At that time, I was nineteen years old.</span> <span id="s976">We had to learn how to use the weapons, how to pull guard duty, how to throw a hand grenade.</span> <span id="s977">We had to learn all these things.</span> <span id="s978">We had to be alert.</span> <span id="s979">We also had many casualties.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: The school you were talking about defending, that was the agricultural school?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: You were never drafted into the Israeli Armed Forces?</span> <span id="s983">into any kind of military?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: No.</span> <span id="s985">At this time girls could join.</span> <span id="s986">Some of my fellow students and classmates did join, but you were not drafted.</span> <span id="s987">Presently it is a different thing.</span> <span id="s988">At present any girl who is not married actually joins the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Did you have any contact with any Arabs, during these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Yes, after I was married the lady who cleaned my house was an Arab.</span> <span id="s991">She came once a week.</span> <span id="s992">She did our laundry and when something was going on.</span> <span id="s993">i.e., when the situation was not smooth, she didn’t come.</span> <span id="s994">But one knew that she was safe and was a lovely person.</span> <span id="s995">Arabs who stayed did very well.</span> <span id="s996">Their children received education; they earned a decent income.</span> <span id="s997">As a matter of fact, when the War of Independence broke out, there was a group of people, a group of Arabs in our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s998">We told them to stay and we said, “Nothing will happen to you.</span> <span id="s999">We are going to protect you”.</span> <span id="s1000">However, their leaders said, “Leave, there is nothing for you!</span> <span id="s1001">There is no future for you.</span> <span id="s1002">We are going to attack the Jews and we are going to destroy them, or at least drive them out”.</span> <span id="s1003">However, thank God, it never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: You were aware that the British had theorized that the Jewish population and the Arab population were going to be integrated on a very equal basis.</span> <span id="s1005">So there was not going to be any problem of the kind which did arrive and which caused the war.</span> <span id="s1006">Was there ever a feeling of wellbeing between the two peoples?</span> <span id="s1007">You know since you were there?</span> <span id="s1008">Was there ever that feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: I think that it could have worked out.</span> <span id="s1010">I really do.</span> <span id="s1011">At that time there were only 600,000 Arabs and maybe 500,000 Jews, so we were pretty evenly matched.</span> <span id="s1012">It could have worked out if the big powers would not have interfered as they did.</span> <span id="s1013">You know there are also Arab states which surround Palestine, if they would not have interfered.</span> <span id="s1014">It was a power struggle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Did you ever feel at any time you were there, that you personally, were in a great deal of danger?</span> <span id="s1016">Living as you did in that part of the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: In Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1020">If you live in Israel, you know that you are surrounded by enemies, and you have to live with that in mind.</span> <span id="s1021">You have to watch out, you have to be alert, you have to be prepared, but I never felt that “tomorrow might be my last day”.</span> <span id="s1022">That is the same thing as happens here.</span> <span id="s1023">It happened to the President, it happened to the Pope!</span> <span id="s1024">However, in Israel I felt very strong.</span> <span id="s1025">I am a very positive Zionist.</span> <span id="s1026">I am a very positive Jew, so I don’t hesitate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Tell me about the war of 1948.</span> <span id="s1028">How did it involve you, and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Our son was, at the time, one year old.</span> <span id="s1030">When the War of Independence was declared.</span> <span id="s1031">At night we heard bombs.</span> <span id="s1032">Egypt bombed Tel Aviv, not far from us.</span> <span id="s1033">We lived on one floor in a house, right under the roof.</span> <span id="s1034">So we took our son to some friends of ours, who lived at the lower level.</span> <span id="s1035">Now we had two stories above us, and we felt that this was a little better than nothing.</span> <span id="s1036">Of course food was scarce.</span> <span id="s1037">This really was a very bad time.</span> <span id="s1038">we did not have much to fight back with.</span> <span id="s1039">Israel, at the time, was very weak.</span> <span id="s1040">I remember that we had “Little Sputnicks”, as we called them, really they didn’t amount to anything.</span> <span id="s1041">At times we fought until the last dozen Jews were left.</span> <span id="s1042">Somehow we came out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Your family was not involved in the actual fighting?</span> <span id="s1044">How about your brothers?</span> <span id="s1045">Did they have to fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: My husband was a soldier.</span> <span id="s1047">He was drafted as a soldier and he really had more to do with the education than the actual fighting.</span> <span id="s1048">He taught the new immigrants Hebrew, and how to get around and how to get along.</span> <span id="s1049">But he was drafted.</span> <span id="s1050">My brothers were drafted.</span> <span id="s1051">One brother was drafted and was in Sinai.</span> <span id="s1052">One brother was wounded in his arm.</span> <span id="s1053">Yes, during the War of Independence we had some problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s1055">You survived the war and things settled down into a post war low, if you can call it that!</span> <span id="s1056">Why then did you decide to leave Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: We decided to leave Israel because my husband wanted to study.</span> <span id="s1058">He wanted to complete his studies.</span> <span id="s1059">This was one reason why we left.</span> <span id="s1060">My husband also had only one sister who lived, at the time, in the U.S.</span> <span id="s1061">We also wanted to be with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: May I ask your feeling upon leaving?</span> <span id="s1063">I know being there was very close to your heart.</span> <span id="s1064">How did you feel about leaving from a place which meant so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: I can only tell you that coming to Chicago with my tears just running down my cheeks constantly, when I compared what I had in Israel with what I had in the U.S. when we came.</span> <span id="s1066">Israel is a very small country.</span> <span id="s1067">You know everybody.</span> <span id="s1068">You know your neighbors.</span> <span id="s1069">You feel the troubles of other people.</span> <span id="s1070">You feel the joy of other people.</span> <span id="s1071">You are like a large family.</span> <span id="s1072">Here I was a nobody.</span> <span id="s1073">Nobody knew me.</span> <span id="s1074">I knew nobody.</span> <span id="s1075">I did not know the language.</span> <span id="s1076">It was very, very difficult until I got use to the U.S. Even today, if someone asked me, “What is your homeland?”</span> <span id="s1077">I would not answer Germany!</span> <span id="s1078">Never!</span> <span id="s1079">My eyes feel very strong and very close to the Land of Israel and their wellbeing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: I would like to ask you a little about the time you spent in Chicago, and various places where your husband went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: I went to school in Chicago also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: To the Hebrew College.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Did you get a degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: I got half my degree in Israel and half my degree here.</span> <span id="s1086">So I can teach.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Your children were small then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Our son was close to seven and our daughter was close to four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: I know that your husband moved around at different times in his career, in order to move upward, what were your feelings about the moves you had to make?</span> <span id="s1090">In all the moves, did you ever feel comfortable?</span> <span id="s1091">Did you ever live in a Jewish neighborhood or community?</span> <span id="s1092">Did you have the feeling that you belonged?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A; I am a person who adjusts very well, otherwise, we could not have moved.</span> <span id="s1094">From Chicago we moved to Des Moines, then to Atlanta, then to New Haven and now in Dayton.</span> <span id="s1095">Being in the position that we are, working amongst our people, we always made friends, not always close friends -- but a lot of acquaintances.</span> <span id="s1096">There was never a problem that we felt that we didn’t belong because I was teaching Hebrew -- so there were children involved and parents involved -- and with my husband’s position -- so there never was a question of not knowing people.</span> <span id="s1097">We knew many people but, of course, that does not mean that you always make a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s1098">However, we did make friends wherever we were.</span> <span id="s1099">Then it was always hard to leave the place, but there was always something to look forward to, so it wasn’t together bad.</span> <span id="s1100">You learn from every city and everybody.</span> <span id="s1101">I could say that you learn from every child.</span> <span id="s1102">You just have to keep an open mind and something will come of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Your relationships have generally been with the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Only!</span> <span id="s1105">I never worked for a non-Jewish group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: That interests me.</span> <span id="s1107">Obviously you feel comfortable there and your husband’s position puts you in this environment.</span> <span id="s1108">.</span> <span id="s1109">Would you feel uncomfortable if you were thrown in a position, now that your husband is retiring, where you were not quite totally within the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: No, I don’t think that I would.</span> <span id="s1111">I would definitely not feel uncomfortable because now I will meet gentile people, but I would not have called them close relationships.</span> <span id="s1112">In our building here, there is a gentile couple and I respect her and she respects me.</span> <span id="s1113">You respect a person for what he is, not for what his religion is.</span> <span id="s1114">However, it happened that during all our years in the U.S., we worked amongst Jews, Jewish schools and Jewish education and Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1115">We were always surrounded by Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: You are very dedicated to the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: This leads me to another question.</span> <span id="s1119">Based on your past experience, what you have been through, what is it like to be a Jewish woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: That is the only thing I have ever been, so that is all I know.</span> <span id="s1121">I was born a Jew.</span> <span id="s1122">I feel strongly towards Judaism.</span> <span id="s1123">I am not a religious person.</span> <span id="s1124">I don’t go to services every day, however, I am very committed towards Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Do you feel that because of the experience you have been through, that the Jewish people are very special people in some regard?</span> <span id="s1126">That they have to carry on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A; I don’t know if they are special people, but I do know that if we don’t look out for ourselves -- if we don’t help each other -- nobody will do it for us.</span> <span id="s1128">So I think that, in order for us to survive, if the Holocaust had not been, it would be a different story.</span> <span id="s1129">However, we have learned through persecutions, including the Holocaust, and now with the fighting with the Arabs, that we have to look out for ourselves.</span> <span id="s1130">We have to help each other, otherwise, we won’t survive.</span> <span id="s1131">The question of survival is a very strong one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: People are very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Yes, in general, people arte strong, but many nations and many peoples have been lost during these generations, as civilizations.</span> <span id="s1134">Thanks God the Jews still remain, even if only a small remnant but they are still struggling and they are still powerful and we have the will to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: You said that you were not necessarily a very religious person.</span> <span id="s1136">I want to ask you what part religion played in your life?</span> <span id="s1137">Or has played since you have been in the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: We are Conservative Jews.</span> <span id="s1139">I keep a kosher home.</span> <span id="s1140">We eat only kosher food.</span> <span id="s1141">We go to services, not every Saturday and not every day, but I would say, three times a month.</span> <span id="s1142">I enjoy prayers.</span> <span id="s1143">I had an uncle who was a rabbi.</span> <span id="s1144">I had an uncle who was a cantor.</span> <span id="s1145">It is involved in me.</span> <span id="s1146">I like the Jewish atmosphere.</span> <span id="s1147">I like the feeling of Jews.</span> <span id="s1148">We celebrate the Holy Days.</span> <span id="s1149">On Friday nights I light the candles and we have a festival meal.</span> <span id="s1150">Friday and Shabbat is different than any other day.</span> <span id="s1151">I do enjoy the holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: What part has the synagogue played in your social life?</span> <span id="s1153">Apart from the religious life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: I do belong to the Sisterhood, but I hardly ever attend because of my working schedule.</span> <span id="s1155">You see school starts (that is for religious after school classes) at 3:30 P.M. and the Sisterhood meetings involve that time.</span> <span id="s1156">So, at this point, in Dayton, I am not very active in the Sisterhood of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1157">, However I am active in Hadassah.</span> <span id="s1158">Hadassah is a women’s organization which is very pro-Israel.</span> <span id="s1159">They have a hospital in Jerusalem on Mt. Scopus.</span> <span id="s1160">I am an active member.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Do you still have relatives of any kind living in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: I have nieces and nephews and a sister-in-law, as well as cousins.</span> <span id="s1163">My brother passed away not long ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: How often do you visit Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Not often enough.</span> <span id="s1166">We were supposed to go this summer, if we were not going to move.</span> <span id="s1167">So we will get there hopefully next year.</span> <span id="s1168">We would like to go.</span> <span id="s1169">We get letters and they tell us how awful the situation in Israel is.</span> <span id="s1170">The inflation is terrible.</span> <span id="s1171">However somehow they are going to make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Have your children ever visited Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: No!</span> <span id="s1174">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Don’t they have any desire to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Very much so, but the last time we went to Israel we were planning to take our children along.</span> <span id="s1177">They have some very purist rules there, such as: If you are a Sabra, that means you were born in Israel, which our children are, and you come back you have to join the army.</span> <span id="s1178">We were afraid even though they were in college here at the time, that if they came back they would have to join the army.</span> <span id="s1179">If they didn’t join the army, it would take them a long time until everything would be straightened out.</span> <span id="s1180">After all we are still Israelis!</span> <span id="s1181">We have dual citizenship, because if you are once an Israeli, you are always an Israeli.</span> <span id="s1182">So we were afraid to take our children.</span> <span id="s1183">However, now that they are older they also have changed their rules in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Do your children have dual citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Yes, both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Your children have families now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: They have two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q; That would make a difference, as far as being drafted doesn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: No.</span> <span id="s1190">My brother was drafted when he was sixty years old, in Israel.</span> <span id="s1191">If the need is there you do.</span> <span id="s1192">You know, if the need is there you pitch in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: How about your grandchildren now.</span> <span id="s1194">They are getting a little older?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: They are too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: They are still too young to appreciate a visit to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1198">That they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Would you like to take them someday?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s1201">Definitely.</span> <span id="s1202">If I can afford it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: I asked your husband this question.</span> <span id="s1204">I will now ask you this question, also.</span> <span id="s1205">You have been through a traumatic life.</span> <span id="s1206">You were exposed to a great deal of hardship.</span> <span id="s1207">How has this manifested itself in the way you raised your children?</span> <span id="s1208">Do you know of anything that, because you lived the life that you did live, you raised your children in a very special way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: I don’t know if this is a special way.</span> <span id="s1210">We involved a lot of love in our children.</span> <span id="s1211">The special way could be that we told them, “Don’t lie”.</span> <span id="s1212">Is that what you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: We had some difficulties with that.</span> <span id="s1215">Sometimes you have to tell a “white lie” in order to survive.</span> <span id="s1216">When you look back, the people, the best people really vanished in concentration camps because they didn’t know how to fight back.</span> <span id="s1217">People with stronger shoulders and with stronger personalities survived.</span> <span id="s1218">It always was a question which we repeated to our children, “Be honest!</span> <span id="s1219">Do your best!</span> <span id="s1220">However, in some cases you have to use a white lie then do it!”</span> <span id="s1221">It didn’t happen to them because they are decent kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: There is nothing that you felt that, because you had gone through this, your children were raised any differently than perhaps if you had not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s1224">They both were good students.</span> <span id="s1225">They both learned an instrument.</span> <span id="s1226">They were always able to make friends.</span> <span id="s1227">As a matter of fact neither one has an accent.</span> <span id="s1228">They are Americans!</span> <span id="s1229">They are American Jews!</span> <span id="s1230">They are pro-Israel, of course, but 100% American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: You mentioned briefly a couple of times that you don’t know what will happen in Israel.</span> <span id="s1232">Would you like to elaborate on that a little?</span> <span id="s1233">Your feeling about what is going on over there now.</span> <span id="s1234">Is there a future, a decent future for the country?</span> <span id="s1235">Or will there always be this constant struggle against it’s neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: I think that is actually a struggle amongst the big powers.</span> <span id="s1237">I think that the Arabs and the Jews could eventually live in harmony, if the big powers would not interfere.</span> <span id="s1238">On the other hand you know that the U.S. needs Israel.</span> <span id="s1239">I am actually not a politician, so I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: However you would favor allowing Israel and it’s neighbors to settle things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s1242">Definitely!</span> <span id="s1243">I would love them to settle things amongst themselves.</span> <span id="s1244">They could help each other tremendously.</span> <span id="s1245">It would be an asset to all of them.</span> <span id="s1246">You would know that, if you go to Egypt.</span> <span id="s1247">People, who have gone to Egypt now that Egypt is open, say that the poverty is so bad.</span> <span id="s1248">The children are on the ground, on floors, and the sickness is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1249">The majority is very, very poor and sick.</span> <span id="s1250">The cities are dirty.</span> <span id="s1251">I haven’t been there but people who went have told me that it’s unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: This is probably one of the reasons why Sadat favored peace?</span> <span id="s1253">He cannot fight a war and feed his people, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Sure, sure.</span> <span id="s1255">They could only benefit.</span> <span id="s1256">You see Israel is a small country, but they are so determined to make it.</span> <span id="s1257">They would do it for any price, they would pay just to have peace in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Then you obviously favor the Camp David accords?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: Oh, definitely!</span> <span id="s1260">It is a big step forward.</span> <span id="s1261">But, unfortunately so, for only Egypt has gained from the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1262">Egypt got the Sinai Peninsula back and the oil fields.</span> <span id="s1263">The only one who has really benefited is Egypt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: What do you really think Begin and the government should do at this stage?</span> <span id="s1265">Incidentally, there are meetings again with Sadat coming up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Now there is another problem.</span> <span id="s1267">The problem is Syria and also, the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization).</span> <span id="s1268">They are having a lot of problems and inflation is very big.</span> <span id="s1269">They would like more people, you know, Jews, to immigrate to Israel.</span> <span id="s1270">There are problems.</span> <span id="s1271">Many Israelis are leaving, even if it’s only for a short while.</span> <span id="s1272">Good people are leaving because they need employment.</span> <span id="s1273">The housing problem is not good.</span> <span id="s1274">Yes, there are problems, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: I realize that you are moving to St. Louis, because your daughter lives there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: Yes, my daughter, my grandchildren and my son-in-law and my brother and sister as well as nephews and nieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Had you ever considered to retire to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Oh, yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: And you turned it down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Well, not quite.</span> <span id="s1281">It all depends.</span> <span id="s1282">If my children would go to Israel, we would all go.</span> <span id="s1283">There is no question about it.</span> <span id="s1284">However, at this point, my son is settled here and so is my daughter, so we won’t leave them.</span> <span id="s1285">That is one of the reasons why we are going to St. Louis.</span> <span id="s1286">That way we will be close to at least one of the children.</span> <span id="s1287">Maybe eventually our son will settle there.</span> <span id="s1288">Also, hopefully.</span> <span id="s1289">But, if they would settle in Israel, there is no question we would go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: You are going to retire.</span> <span id="s1291">Your husband is going to retire to St. Louis.</span> <span id="s1292">Do you have plans for yourself after you retire?</span> <span id="s1293">Is there something special you plan to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: I know one thing.</span> <span id="s1295">I won’t sit in a rocking chair.</span> <span id="s1296">First, I am going to enjoy my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1297">I might do some kind of teaching, maybe some tutoring.</span> <span id="s1298">I am going to be active in Hadassah.</span> <span id="s1299">We are going to join a synagogue and I will be active there.</span> <span id="s1300">So there is a lot to look forward to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: You are at a happy stage in your life</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s1304">Let us hope that we all stay well.</span> <span id="s1305">That is most important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Is there anything that we have not covered in this interview, which you would like to say at this time?</span> <span id="s1307">I believe that we talked about your life and about what has transpired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Yes, very briefly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Is there anything which I have neglected to ask you, which you would like to put on the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: No, not that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: You think that we have covered it all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yes, I believe so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Well, I have really enjoyed it enormously and we are so pleased that you have volunteered to give us your story.</span> <span id="s1314">I have enjoyed it very, very much.</span> <span id="s1315">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
